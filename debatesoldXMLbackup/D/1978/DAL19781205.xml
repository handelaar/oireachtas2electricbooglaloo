      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is satisfied that the law in relation to the employment of minors is not being contravened in some hotels and restaurants in Portlaoise, County Laois.</P>

      <P>In the course of inspections of a number of hotels and restaurants in the Portlaoise area in the last 12 months some infringements of the Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977 were discovered.  In the case of the most serious of these I have referred the papers to the Chief State Solicitor. Warnings were issued in the other cases and further recent inspections of them have revealed no serious infringements of the Act.  The position will be kept under surveillance by the inspectorate of my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is gratifying to hear the Minister has taken such action, might I ask him does he have to hear? Does a complaint have to be made or is there any process whereby he would become aware of this, simply in his Department, in respect of other hotels all over Ireland where a certain amount of this appears to go on?  Is the Minister satisfied with the efficiency of the process?</P>

      <P>I assured the Deputy and the House some months ago that any complaints made in connection with that Act would certainly be acted upon.  In addition the House will be pleased to hear that the new Employment Regulation Order which came into effect on Monday, 9 October for workers employed in the catering industry will ensure that inspections of restaurants, cafés and so on will be carried out at regular intervals by the general inspectorate.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the number of inspectors he has policing the provisions of this Act?  There have been reports especially over the summer months&mdash;whether substantiated or otherwise&mdash;that the provisions of this Act have been infringed in many resorts in the country.  Is the Minister satisfied with the number of inspectors he now has?  Has he any plans to increase the number, or has the number been increased?</P>

      <P>The Employment Equality Agency who operate under the aegis of my Department have the <Col N="565" /> general function of working towards the elimination of discrimination in relation to employment and of promoting equality of opportunity between men and women in relation to employment. They also have the function of keeping under review the working of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and of making proposals for amending either of these Acts.</P>
      <P>Issues, including the question of legislation, affecting the relative status of men and women in areas other than pay or employment would be for the Minister concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>On 19 July 1978 I requested the Labour Court, under section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, to investigate the problems of industrial relations in Irish Base Metals Ltd., and to furnish a report together with recommendations as to the solution of these problems.  The court met the parties to the dispute and decided that, because of the complex nature of the dispute, an assessor's report on the financial implications for the company would be necessary before it could issue a recommendation in the matter.  Following receipt of that report the court issued a recommendation which was not, however, acceptable to the company.  A Labour Court conciliation conference was held on 8 November without resolving the matters in dispute.</P>
      <P>I understand that a meeting between the parties to the dispute took place on 4 December and that a further meeting is scheduled for Monday, 11 December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to make any further intervention in view of the fact that the workers are not getting any strike pay or unemployment benefit?  Is there any way that he can help them while these negotiations continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy that I share his concern. However, as he will be aware from my reply, I have referred the matter to the Labour Court under section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.  A meeting was held yesterday between the parties concerned and a further meeting will be held on Monday next.  I, too, would be hopeful that this long drawn-out dispute would end quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister must accept that, whatever efforts have been made to date, they have not been good enough.  There are 250 men out of work there.  It is up to the Minister for Labour to be seen to be involved in this and at present, as far as the people are concerned, he is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that what is more important is that this dispute be resolved, not that the Minister for Labour be seen to be doing something, but that something positive is being done.  That is what is most important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give any undertaking&mdash;these people have taken enormous sums out of the country&mdash;that at some stage he will say that these negotiations have gone on too long?  The workers have been left in a very difficult position as a result of prolonged negotiations and have been left, in financial terms, defenceless.  Can the Minister force the company to come to some decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy must be well aware, the Labour Court issued their recommendations which were not accepted by the company.  In that situation I cannot compel either party to a dispute to accept a recommendation but naturally one would always be desirous that such recommendations <Col N="567" /> would be acceptable.  At this stage I would be hopeful as well that something would come of the talks to be held again on Monday next.</P>

    <P>10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if safety mining regulations at Tara Mines, County Meath, must be submitted to him for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to <Col N="568" /> take Questions Nos. 5 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>There were seven fatal accidents since the mine opened in 1973, two of which happened on the surface.  Three occurred in 1976, two in 1977, and two in 1978.</P>
      <P>The mine is inspected regularly by the mining inspectorate of the Department of Labour.  All the accidents referred to were fully investigated and reported on by the inspectorate.  In the light of the reports of the inspectorate I would not see grounds for ordering any further inquiry in relation to this mine or to mines generally.  Regular inspection of the mine will, of course, continue and should the reports call for any special action it will be taken.  However, I have ample power under the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965, to order any investigation or special inquiries which may be required into accidents or dangerous occurrences in mining.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's reference to &ldquo;safety mining regulations&rdquo;, I should explain that, in exercise of the powers of the Minister for Labour under the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965 numerous safety regulations have been made in relation to the mines at Navan and for mines generally.  However, the Deputy may have in mind the &ldquo;Safety Manual&rdquo; which the mining company provide for each employee.  Such manuals are not required to be submitted to me for formal approval but this manual was reviewed by my Department's mining inspectorate before it was issued to workers by the mining company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that we would all be very worried at this kind of death rate in any other big undertaking and would take some kind of action to improve the situation. Is it a fact that the union members of the safety committee resigned because they were not satisfied with the safety precautions taken and does the Minister suggest&mdash;he says there is no reason why further serious accidents should occur &mdash;that this kind of accident rate is what we may expect in future from the development of the Tara Mines?  Is this an acceptable level of death rate among the miners who are, I understand, deeply <Col N="569" /> distressed and very worried about what has happened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the Deputy's question is I am not so aware.  With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, I would certainly at all times express concern at any accident, particularly any fatal accident, but the Deputy will understand that such accidents may be due to causes or circumstances which may not necessarily mean a breach of safety regulations by the employer.  To deal with these cases in detail would require me to comment on the cause of individual accidents in which the identity of the worker and the employer could be readily adduced.  As the question of prosecution under the Mines and Quarries Act is not the only legal issue which may arise in relation to these accidents it would not be proper for me to comment here on these individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the workers and their representatives are satisfied with the safety precautions that exist?  The Minister says they have not been breached.  It might be possible that they were not breached because they were not sufficiently comprehensive and, even if they were not breached, that did not prevent several people getting killed so, therefore, they are not comprehensive enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the mine opened in January 1973 I would point out to the Deputy that 74 inspections have been carried out by the mining inspectors of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that seven deaths in any one place in such a short period is a very alarming situation and, in view of the high death rate, would he not agree that a review of the regulations and prohibitions governing safety is now urgently required in Navan?  Does he propose to take any action in regard to such a review?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the number of inspections carried out and I <Col N="570" /> have said the carrying out of inspections by the inspectorate will be on a continuing basis and, should the necessity arise at any time as a result of their inspection, I would be only too willing to review any necessary improvements that may be suggested.</P>

    <P>In the ten months up to the end of October 25,042 persons had applied for the adult courses and 9,000 young persons had applied through the National Manpower Service for entry to apprenticeships. In the same period 14,088 persons were trained in the places specified.  The relationship between numbers trained and training places is explained by the fact that the courses vary in duration from as short as one month to as much as nine months depending on skill.  In the case of the longer adult courses which include radio and television servicing, draftsmanship, computer programming techniques, servicing and repair of domestic appliances and hairdressing, and for which there is a big demand, there can be a waiting period of perhaps up to a year or something more but this is not a general pattern.  Apart from the length of the courses the rate of intake in any skill in a particular region may be influenced by the market situation&mdash;the danger of over-supply at any particular time resulting in saturation of the market.</P>
    <P>Where places are not immediately available on a course, applicants are advised of the likely waiting period and put on a waiting list but they are free to opt for any alternative courses which may be available and suitable for them.</P>
    <P>The position regarding apprenticeships is that when the limited number of vacancies have been filled, unsuccessful applicants are not retained on a panel but are advised to reapply in the following year.</P>
    <P>AnCO plan to expand the number of training places in their own centres from the present number of 3,528 to 5,200 by 1982.  Most of this expansion will take place in Dublin and Cork where new centres will be built.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 16, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the commission is as set out in their terms of reference which were published on 5 May last.  When I addressed the inaugural meeting of the commission on 30 May I expressed the <Col N="574" /> hope that it would be possible for them to present their final report inside two years.  I also indicated that I was anxious that an early examination should be made of the industrial relations institutions, particularly the Labour Court, which operate under the Acts of the Oireachtas and I hoped to receive from the commission an interim report and recommendations governing these insitutions as soon as the commission had an opportunity of examining the matter. It is also open to the commission to submit interim reports on other issues of pressing concern if they so desire.</P>
    <P>I understand that since 30 May last there have been three further meetings of the commission and that another has been scheduled to take place on 6 December.</P>
    <P>Under long-standing instructions relating to commissions and special inquiries not held in public, the proceedings are treated as confidential and I am not, therefore, free to give the information sought in relation to submissions made to the commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the commission decided not to issue an interim report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the commission have so decided.  In view of that does the Minister propose to continue to long-finger the multiplicity of industrial relations problems facing the country or does he propose to stand idly by while the country is wrecked by poor industrial relations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Deputy's information it is true to say that it is agreed on all sides that there is a need for this commission to plan for and structure industrial relations procedures for the future.  Submissions have been made by some but I am not at liberty to give any details.  I should like to add that the commission asked for submissions and any group was entitled to make such a submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not denied my statement to the effect that the commission have decided not to <Col N="575" /> issue an interim report and I should like to know if he considers it good enough for him to continue to refer problems relating to industrial relations to the commission.  Would the Minister agree to bring into the industrial relations area a short-term solution to the present problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that the Minister does not know anything about industrial relations or the commission. Will the Minister wait until the commission report in three or four years' time or eight years' time&mdash;they have only held three meetings since their inaugural meeting seven months ago&mdash;or does he intend to take any action in the industrial relations area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was in Opposition he was not quite so relevant in his supplementaries.  I should like to ask the Minister, if there is a danger that the commission will not report for some years, the role he perceives for himself in the interim period.  Does he perceive a danger that short-term measures that might be required in relation to various Acts would be unnecessarily delayed if the commission spend some years considering certain matters before them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always said that&mdash;I made this clear in my initial comments to the commission&mdash;I would be prepared, after consultations with both sides of industry, to help in any way I can by any necessary legislation.  I am prepared to do that whether the commission are sitting or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consult with the commission to ascertain if they have decided not to produce an interim report as he requested?  Would he ask the commission when they are likely to issue a report in view of the fact they <Col N="576" /> have only managed to meet every second month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he asked for an interim report on industrial relations machinery, specifically the Labour Court, and I should like to know if he is aware that such a report will not be issued.  For that reason will the Minister discontinue referring all industrial relations problems to the commission and do something about the problem himself?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1 May 1978, working groups of the team have met on the following dates to consider and formulate further proposals: 11 May 1978; <Col N="578" /> 2 June 1978; 7 June 1978; 8 June 1978; 9 June 1978; 22 June 1978; 23 June 1978; 8 August 1978.

    <P>19.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if there are any proposals to set up a youth employment agency, to include members from all relevant bodies, to assist in the monitoring of the scale of youth unemployment, and to provide proposals to help alleviate this serious social problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>Up to the end of October 1978, the schemes suggested by the team had provided more than 28,000 man weeks of employment.  I understand that the team hopes to be in a position to make a further set of proposals to me soon.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate for me, at this stage, to announce a decision on the future of the team or any other possible arrangement in relation to youth employment when I am in the process of a major review of manpower policy and relevant institutions and instruments in the context of the White Paper which is to be published this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the 28,000 man weeks created as a result of the team's suggestion represents about 500 man years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The schemes suggested by the Employment Action Team have been successful despite the Deputy's criticism in the House earlier in the year.  For his information, I would point out that on the work experience programme which commenced at the beginning of September, at 2 December it had succeeded in placing 1,300 people. <Col N="579" /> At the end of October almost 2,000 people were involved in environmental work schemes.  That is just two indications of proposals of the team that merited such criticism from the Deputy earlier in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has given the figures.  I should like to know from the Minister if it represented 500 man-years.  I thought the team was supposed to create 5,000 man-years employment.  That is what the Minister promised. Secondly, in relation to the environmental improvement scheme for which the Minister has quoted 2,000 places, the figure given by the Minister for the Environment suggests that for £800,000 some 225 jobs were created in Dublin Corporation.  At the very same time because of the national pay agreement, for which this Minister is responsible, the corporation had to find £1.89 million.  Because this could not be used for job creation it meant that 500 new jobs could not be provided in Dublin Corporation.  Is the Minister satisfied with that situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy I am satisfied with the progress made by the Employment Action Team in their efforts to provide job opportunities and work experience for our young people at a time when there is a high level of youth unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If a youth employment agency were to be set up, does the Minister consider that it could more accurately determine the scale of unemployment among young people and, if properly constituted and financed, that it could produce far more definite opportunities than were produced by the Employment Action Team?  They only produced proposals that were for the short-term in many instances and even some of those proposals have not been carried out as yet.  Does the Minister consider that a youth employment agency could produce more definite proposals for long-term jobs and also determine more accurately the scale of youth unemployment?</P>

Before we become puzzled by the colours of the various studies, will the Minister state if his deliberations on the Green Paper will be concluded before the White Paper comes out or will he come back to the House and tell us he is deliberating on the White Paper?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the action he proposes to take to reduce the incidence of unofficial disputes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely concerned about the incidence of unofficial disputes and their repercussions on industry and on the community generally.  The number of such disputes has, indeed, been at an unacceptably high level for many years.  This problem is primarily one for resolution within the trade union movement because such disputes involve in the main issues such as adherence to agreed procedures and questions of discipline.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that the Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Relations will come up with recommendations for improvements in this area.</P>
      <P>If, pending the commission's report, it becomes necessary to take the action referred to, I will make proposals to the Government on whatever initiatives may be called for.  Any action taken, however, must be effective and preferably acceptable to all the interests concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's difficulty.  I would ask him not to wait for the report of the Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Relations on this subject because the matter is far too urgent.  Will the Minister not agree that within the trade union movement itself there is a great deal of impatience with the number of unofficial disputes? Further, does the Minister not agree that <Col N="583" /> it is the trade union movement itself that is most threatened by these disputes? Perhaps a consensus could be reached between the social partners and the parties in this House on this subject? Therefore, will the Minister consider taking an initiative on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of the Deputy and the community regarding the incidence of unofficial disputes. I would point out to the Deputy that the percentage of man-days lost as a result of unofficial disputes in 1977 was 40 per cent and from January to October 1978 it was 23 per cent.  The average figure regarding unofficial disputes for some years has been at a high constant figure, higher than this year's, and I accept the seriousness of the situation. However, as I said in my reply, this problem is primarily one for resolution within the trade union movement.  If initiatives are called for I shall have no hesitation in recommending them to the Government but any action taken must be effective and preferably acceptable to all the interests concerned.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 23, 24 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inter-departmental committee for the employment of disabled persons in the public sector decided at one of their first meetings to compile a register of disabled persons who might be suitable for employment under the scheme.  The National Rehabilitation Board, who are to prepare such a register, require to carry out a survey in a number of Departments and State-sponsored bodies so as to obtain a clear picture of the types of jobs into which eligible handicapped persons could be placed, along with job descriptions covering each post or grouping of posts at recruitment level. The part of the survey relating to the <Col N="586" /> Department of Labour has been completed and discussions are taking place with staff interests in other Departments in order to settle some problems that have arisen.  I am hopeful that these problems will be resolved quickly so that the survey and register can be completed and recruitment commenced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The committee have received a submission from the Union of Voluntary Organisations of the Handicapped which they are considering with a view to a discussion with the union at an early date.</P>
    <P>The question of any further measures for the employment of the disabled which would involve employment outside the public sector is a matter for the Minister for Health who is in continuous consultation with the NRB in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was Minister for Labour the Government set a target of 3 per cent employment for the disabled in the public service by 1981. Would the Minister agree the time has come to update that figure?  It appears that the target set is not being achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Government took that decision in March 1977 but it was left to me to set up the inter-departmental committee which had their first meeting in January 1978.  They have set up a number of sub-committees to examine specific aspects of the matter. As I said, because of their expertise in the area, the National Rehabilitation Board were considered the most appropriate body to undertake the task of investigating requirements and registering disabled persons for employment in the public sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <P>The number of cases under the same Act, before the Labour Court was six.</P>
    <P>(b)  There were no cases under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and there was one case under the same Act before the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> The redress procedures under the 1977 Act differ from those in the 1974 Act in that they provide initially for settlement at conciliation level: in this regard there were two such cases with the industrial relations officers of the Labour Court on that date.</P>
    <P>The time taken to have such cases dealt with depends on the complexity of each case and how promptly or otherwise the parties involved respond to requests for relevant information and documentation.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Labour Court that an equality officer would spend about ten days, in disposing of a relatively straightforward case, but more complex cases would take much longer.</P>
    <P>The same factors apply to cases appealed to the Labour Court.  Depending on the complexity of a particular case the court may require additional information or submissions from the parties concerned and possibly a resumed hearing in order to clarify points raised at previous hearings.  Obviously the speed at which the parties respond to the court's requests for additional information has a bearing on the time taken for the court to issue their determinations.</P>
    <P>The court have dealt with 13 recommendations since 1 January 1978 and the average time taken in these cases was five months.</P>

      <P>As I announced recently, the European Commission, which in June issued a reasoned opinion giving Ireland two months to comply with the Tachograph Regulation, have now decided to suspend the infraction procedure subject to our implementing the regulation on a phased basis up to the beginning of 1981.  The programme which I put before the Commission was that with effect from 1 March 1979 tachographs should be installed on newly registered transport vehicles over two-and-a-half tons unladen weight subject to certain exceptions.  Over the period <Col N="593" /> until 31 December 1980, tachographs should be installed on a phased basis on existing vehicles.  The use of the tachograph will be required from 1 January 1981.</P>
      <P>In accepting the programme submitted, the Commission have asked that certain matters be considered, including installation and use of tachographs on some categories of vehicles at earlier dates than proposed.  I am having these points examined and discussions with representatives of employer bodies and the trade unions will be involved.</P>
      <P>I will shortly be making regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972, providing for the phasing-in arrangements for the tachograph.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Minister for Finance to subscribe an additional £15 million equity capital to the air companies.  The last capital injection in the companies was made in 1969 under the Air Companies (Amendment) Act, 1969.  An injection of £15 million was made then to assist the financing of their capital programme at that time which included the acquisition of two Boeing 747 aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then the companies have incurred continuing capital expenditure on new aircraft and other assets.  They have also had to cope with very severe losses over a number of years in common with other airlines.  In the period from March 1970 to March 1977 the companies' losses <Col N="617" /> amounted to £7.7 million, or £14.4 million when provision is made for extraordinary items.  Fortunately, the airlines have now returned to profitable operation and hopefully this favourable trend will continue.  In addition the companies are now faced with very heavy capital expenditure on the replacement and expansion of their fleet.</P>
    <P>Against this background the companies' present capital structure is very unsatisfactory.  At the 31 March last the shareholders' equity in the companies amounted to £20 million and loan capital stood at £46 million.  This heavy dependence on borrowing, if allowed to continue, could only inhibit the companies in catering and planning for growth over the next few years with resultant failure to realise possibilities for expansion of employment in the airline and in the better servicing of tourism, trade and industry.  The equity injection of £15 million now proposed will restore the gearing between equity and borrowing to a more normal ration and bring it more in line with competitor airlines.  It will enable the companies to take a positive attitude towards growth possibilities which will redound to the benefit of the Government's plans for economic expansion and increased employment generally.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill it is appropriate that I should speak about the performance and prospects of the companies. The difficulties encountered by the air transport industry in the early seventies, especially in the north Atlantic are well known and it is hardly necessary for me to dwell unduly on them now.  The main factors were the severe recession which affected the entire western economy and caused a slump in tourism and in travel generally, the sharp increase in oil prices, the steep rate of inflation which affected all costs, the disruptive effect of currency fluctuations, severe competition from charter services and the general over-capacity on the north Atlantic, which led to unremunerative fare structures.  As I have said, the losses of the air companies totalled £14.4 million in the period from 1970 to 1977.  The turn around to profitable operation began in 1976-77 when a <Col N="618" /> modest profit of £117,000 was returned and the position further improved significantly in 1977-78 when a net profit of £4.6 million was earned.  While this development is very much to be welcomed, the profit figure represents a very small return on the investment and turnover involved.  The level of profits will need to be substantially increased to meet the costs of new equipment in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Because of age and noise requirements it will be necessary to replace a large part of the companies' fleet in the years immediately ahead.  In addition it will be necessary to expand the fleet significantly to meet growing traffic.  The capital requirement for new aircraft over the next decade is estimated at £250 million at present prices.  It will be appreciated therefore, that very substantially increased profits are necessary to build up the necessary reserves to meet this expenditure.</P>
    <P>The level of profitability over the years ahead will determine the future success of the airline and of the plans which the airline has for the future. These plans include the generation of a very substantial increase in the number of visitors to Ireland by 1981 with a consequent creation of a substantial number of new jobs in the tourist industry, and upwards of 1,000 new jobs in the airline itself.  The equity injection now proposed is intended to put the air companies on a sufficiently sound basis to enable them to maintain and improve the present profitable trend.</P>
    <P>Significantly the bulk of the profits earned by the companies last year came from the successful ancillary activities especially those closely related to aviation. Continued heavy losses were incurred on north Atlantic operations while the short haul European network, including cross-channel, was marginally profitable.  The development of ancillary activities by the air companies has been very successful and these activities are proving their worth in offsetting cyclical swings to which air transport is inherently subject and in providing a high level of well-paid employment.  In the present climate of pressures for low fares, and hence low yields, it would be difficult for the airline to generate sufficient earnings <Col N="619" /> from its air transport operation alone to service borrowings and to provide an adequate reserve for the heavy investment which will be needed for fleet additions and replacements.  It is hoped that the returns from ancillary activities will continue to provide a significant surplus which will go some way towards providing for the future capital requirements on the transportation side.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that we must view the present demand for lower fares.  A scheduled airline must provide a regular all-the-year-round service, taking the rough with the smooth, to meet the on-demand needs of the business community. It must maintain a widespread sales network and, especially in our case, incur heavy expenditure on promotion of tourist traffic.  A scheduled airline cannot just cater for the peak demand when full loads are guranteed and cost their operations accordingly.  This would be creaming the top of the market, and while there are carriers who seek to engage in this activity it would be entirely inappropriate for a publicly owned national airline with obligations to the community as a whole.  In this respect the north Atlantic is a source of continuing worry.  The airline is still suffering heavy losses on the Atlantic due to the very uneconomic fares now obtaining in that theatre.</P>
    <P>I see very little hope of an early improvement in the economics of transatlantic services because of the strong and rapid trends towards the dismantling of the regulatory framework and towards uncontrolled competition.  Fair competition can of course help to stimulate the market and promote efficiency but the airline industry, because of its capital intensity, seasonal and cyclical nature and its public service obligations, cannot operate economically in conditions of uncontrolled and excessive competition.  Because of the present intention on the part of the US authorities to deregulate air transport, and the fragmentation of policy among western European states, I can at present see only a continuing price war on the north Atlantic in which all airlines are likely to get hurt and some may even have to withdraw.  Withdrawal from the <Col N="620" /> Atlantic in our case is not a realistic option in present circumstances because of the consequences it would involve.</P>
    <P>It would mean the release of about 1,300 airline staff, many of them home based.  It would mean the disruption of our airline with large scale diseconomies and loss of morale.  In national terms it would be harmful to industry and trade, and it would deal a serious blow to tourism and national development.  I am hopeful that such a course will not arise for serious consideration and that there will be a return to a more rational regulatory framework before too long within which the airlines can compete fairly, provide an adequate and reasonably priced service for the travelling public and earn moderate returns. This can be done only by international action.  There is little that a small state such as ours can do on its own.  We will, nevertheless, continue to do our utmost to secure a return to a more sensible regulation of the market.</P>
    <P>Encouraged no doubt by what has happened on the north Atlantic, a demand is at present being widely voiced for a reduction of fares on the European network, particularly cross-channel.  I know that Aer Lingus are conscious of the need to keep fares at the lowest possible level consistent with providing an efficient and viable service.  It must be borne in mind, however, that the Aer Lingus short haul operations are only marginally profitable.  All applications for fare adjustments are examined in detail by me and I am concerned in considering proposed increases to ensure that the essential balance is kept between the natural demands of the travelling public and the need to meet continually rising airline costs.  Aer Lingus must operate commercially and must generate profits if they are to face future expansion plans with confidence.  The company also have an obligation to provide a fare structure which will help to stimulate tourism.  This it does by offering a range of special fares including excursion and advance booking fares as well as reduced fares for families, all designed to cater for the price-conscious traveller.  As Minister responsible for both aviation and tourism, I am particularly anxious that services, including <Col N="621" /> fares, offered by Aer Lingus do not act as a disincentive to tourism growth.  I am satisfied that at present this is not the case, but I will continue to keep fare levels under review so that the air traveller may have the benefit of the lowest possible fares consistent with the economics of the airline and the development of tourism.</P>
    <P>All that I have said underlines how unstable the air transport industry can prove itself to be in the short term.  It is subject to wide fluctuations both globally and in particular sectors.  By and large, however, it must be seen as a very young and vigorous industry and one in which, notwithstanding temporary fluctuations, continued growth is assured.  In the case of a small island community such as ours, its importance in servicing our national development cannot be overstressed.  Our national airline has served us well to date.  It provides a wide network of air services efficiently and safely.  It affords high grade employment for some 6,000 people in what is a high technology industry.  It expends £7 million per annum on tourist promotion and earns about £60 million in foreign exchange for the benefits of our national economy.  Its work on behalf of other airlines earned revenue of about £23 million last year, which is proof in itself of the airline's efficiency and international good standing.  The continued development of our national airline is a top priority towards the realisation of our national objectives.  Vital to the proper development of the airline is the provision of a reasonable capital structure on which it can work.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House support this Bill, the objective of which is to provide additional equity capital for the national airline.  While supporting the Bill we do not look on this exercise here today as a mere rubber stamping by Dáil Éireann of a demand by one of our State-sponsored bodies for £15 million, a considerable amount of money.  The manner in which the Bill has been presented focuses attention on the almost impossible situation with which Opposition spokesmen are confronted when it comes to debating an issue of <Col N="622" /> this kind.  I received this Bill in the post yesterday morning, and Monday is a very busy day for any Deputy with constituency work and so on.  I came up here this morning and now we have to debate this Bill.  It focuses attention on the extreme difficulty with which Opposition spokesmen are confronted.  We have to assess whether it is worthwhile to allocate £15 million of the taxpayers' money to a State-sponsored body and we have had no opportunity and no back-up services to enable us to assess the performance of the company in a proper manner and deliver an informed judgment as to whether or not this is the right thing to do, whether or not we are justified in giving this money to Aer Lingus.  I acknowledge the fact that there is now a parliamentary committee on State-sponsored bodies and that Aer Lingus, in common with other State-sponsored bodies, will in due course be coming before that committee.  I am glad that I have the privilege of being a member of that committee because it gives us more time and opportunity and we will have the necessary expertise at our disposal to examine in depth the performance of companies such as this.  In this case we have had to rely mainly on the published annual report of Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>The Minister has come before the House and sought permission to take steps to give, in effect, £15 million to the national airline.  The purpose of this additional financial injection is twofold. One is to enable the national airline to re-equip itself and to carry out its very impressive expansion plans over the next decade.  The second objective of the Bill, and a natural consequence of the first, is that it will restore some semblance of normality to the very serious imbalance that has developed in the financial structure of Aer Lingus as between the equity capital and the loan capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure everybody is very pleased to read of the successful year which was reported on in the 1977-78 annual report of Aer Lingus where there was a very impressive performance and a net profit of £4.6 million.  But when I started to examine and make inquiries about the actual profitability and the operating profits and so forth it came as rather a <Col N="623" /> shock to me to find that in that same year the cost of the combined interest charges for the loan capital was £3.6 million, which is roughly 50 per cent of the total operating profit.  No air company in the modern competitive field in which the aviation business is carried on can be faced with this exorbitant figure for loan charges every year and continue to operate.  For that reason I support the present Bill.  The most desirable result of it will be, as the Minister pointed out in his speech, to restore this imbalance to a normal ratio as between equity capital and loan capital.</P>
    <P>Air transport and air fares have been very much in the news at present and for a long time past.  The Minister in his speech referred to what I would describe as the total jungle of air fares on the North Atlantic.  Somebody told me recently there were something like 17 different air fares on the North Atlantic. The figure could be 17 or 15 or 20.  The actual figure is not important.  What is significant is that it indicates the crazy situation that obtains on the Atlantic air routes.  This situation has very serious implications for national scheduled carriers like Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>A scheduled carrier has to maintain schedules and flights have to go out irrespective of the number of passengers on board.  We accept all this.  The performance of Aer Lingus as we find it in the 1977-78 annual report is very impressive despite the fact that they are saddled with having to pay a figure of £3.6 million in loan charges.  We talk about a £4.6 million net profit.  To the average person this means that in carrying passengers, cargo and so on Aer Lingus made £4.6 million.  This is not a fact at all because the interesting thing is that, as is clearly reflected in the financial summary in the annual report for 1977-78, one striking factor emerges.  In relation to carrying passengers, cargo and mail, the purely air transport part of the business, the revenue was £96 million and the profit was only £.2 million, that is, .2 per cent.  This was the profit on the purely air transport part of the business.</P>
    <P>This highlights the dramatic way in which what has been described as the <Col N="624" /> ancillary activities have contributed to the overall profitability of the national airline.  For example, aviation related activities contributed £6 million profit on a revenue of £29 million.  That is a really striking figure.  Hotels, leisure and catering contributed £2.4 million profit on £35 million revenue and financial and computer services contributed £.9 million out of £3 million, which is equivalent to over 30 per cent profit.</P>
    <P>While this support for 1977-78 reflects a very healthy overall performance by Aer Lingus, in relation to air transport and their ancillary activities, it pinpoints a very significant factor, the extreme competitiveness and very narrow marginal profitability of modern air transport.  We should appreciate the difficulties Aer Lingus had to contend with during the world economic recession, as the Minister outlined in his speech.  We should compliment Aer Lingus for their performance in 1977 as revealed by their annual report.  The board, the chief executive, the management and all categories of workers in the air company have done a tremendous job for which they are due great credit.</P>
    <P>This debate takes place against the background of a world debate in relation to the whole future of international aviation. The Minister referred in passing to the problems created for Aer Lingus and for other scheduled carriers in the western world because of the move towards deregulation.  Now that the traditional IATA price-fixing policy appears to have gone by the board the Minister, Aer Lingus and public representatives in general, not merely here but throughout the entire western world, are today faced with a growing and very vocal demand for cheaper air travel side by side with the mandate of our national carriers to be commercially viable and pay their way.  The Minister in his speech today revealed his thinking in relation to this issue when he said:</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus must operate commercially and must generate profits if they are to face future expansion plans with confidence.  The company also have an obligation to provide a fare structure which will help to stimulate tourism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> There is a contradiction here.  This particular passage in the Minister's speech reflects the conflict between the demand for cheaper air travel and a growing increase in the amount of charter traffic which is creating major problems for the scheduled carriers.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to create the impression that he hoped that this jungle in relation to the Atlantic air fares would rationalise itself in due course.  I do not agree with him here.  I believe we can never expect a return to the former IATA situation.  We will have more and more public demand by the consumer lobby for cheaper air travel.  Governments, air lines and public representatives will be subjected to more and more pressure by the public, tourist interests and others for lower air fares. The Minister was confronted with this in London a few evenings ago.  I had practically the same experience a month ago when I attended the annual dinner of the Limerick Men's Association in London. I will deal with what the Minister's countymen and my countrymen from Limerick were complaining about in London.  Those things deal with an aspect which is peculiar to the situation as it affects our people in Britain.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister that the former IATA situation of international fare-fixing and a club-type approach to air fares will return.  I believe we will have, especially now that the USA have decided to deregulate, a free for all.  At the moment Aer Lingus have a mandate, which I do not think has changed since they were established, that they must be commercially viable and must pay their way.  At the same time they have some kind of undefined social obligation.  The Minister referred to it when he said that Aer Lingus have an obligation to fix air fares at a level which will not inhibit tourism.</P>
    <P>I am aware&mdash;the Minister must also be aware of this&mdash;that Bord Fáilte and the Irish Tourist industry in general have for some time past been seriously concerned about the impact of high air fares on the development of the tourist industry here.  I do not think that Aer Lingus, restricted as they are by the very narrow commercial viability mandate <Col N="626" /> which they have, will be able to play their full role and make a proper, optimum contribution to the development of the tourist industry.  I understand the Minister has received reports from Bord Fáilte on the question of access transport, which is a vital element in the development of the economy of a small country like ours with a very large tourist dimension.</P>
    <P>The mandate of Bord Fáilte to promote tourism into Ireland and the mandate of Aer Lingus to be commercially viable beyond anything else are now definitely in conflict.  The Minister is in an ideal position now to do something because he is the Minister for Tourism as well as Minister for Transport.  I hoped he would have availed of this opportunity to reassess the role of our national airline <i>vis-à-vis</i> the tourist industry. There are complaints every day from people involved in the industry, travel agencies, the public and so forth, about the high cost of air fares.</P>
    <P>I was in London at the annual dinner of the Limerick Men's Association the day the announcement was made that the return air fare between London and Shannon had been increased to £86.  I had spoken before the comment was made and I had not referred to this fact because I had spoken about it over the years both in Government and in Opposition. It had become an embarrassment because I was never in a position to do anything about it.  It is very difficult to explain why my neighbours in Limerick city and county who travel from Shannon to London must pay £86, while for very little more they could travel to New York and back on a Laker DC 10.  A full study should be made of the relationship between air fares and the volume of tourist traffic.</P>
    <P>The real complaint of our emigrants in Britain existed before the present problems arose in relation to the deregulation of transatlantic air fares.  It is estimated that over 1 million people born in this country now live in the UK. If one takes account of the second generation, there are several million people. This is very significant from the point of view of tourism, if one takes the lowest denominator.  No attempt has <Col N="627" /> been made to design air fares which would be appropriate to the special needs of our own people in the UK.</P>
    <P>In the excellent briefing document issued recently to Member of the Oireachtas, Aer Lingus list a number of special travel bargains.  A weekend in London costs £62.90 and this includes two nights bed and breakfast, provided that two people travel together.  Various other special bargain fares are offered. This special fare of £62.90 is not of benefit to the parents of an Irish person living and working in London because such people will not normally stay in an hotel but with relatives or friends.  Yet they would have to pay £62.90.  This is a real injustice.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the package offered is an attractive one but it is not of any use to an elderly couple who may wish to visit their children in London. The same thing applies to the huge numbers of Irish people who come home on holidays every year.  They usually stay with relatives or friends and must pay the full air fare.  They are not interested in staying in hotels.  This is the real complaint of Irish people living in the UK.  The Minister heard it the other night and I have been listening to it for years.  Something should be done and it is not beyond the inventiveness of Aer Lingus to devise a suitable fare.</P>
    <P>The London weekend fare of £62.90 includes travel plus two nights' accommodation and breakfast.  It must cost a minimum of £24 for the hotel, thus the fare content is about £40.  Allowing for the fact that the hotel room must be used by two people, it is possible that the fare content may be £50.  I cannot understand why an Irish couple travelling to or from London for a weekend cannot be offered a fare of £50.  There is no reason why a special emigrant fare could not be offered.  I feel very strongly that something definite must be done to cater properly and realistically for the large Irish population in Britain.  An Irish worker, his wife and two children who come to Limerick are charged £86 each. That is the return air fare between London and Shannon.  I am satisfied that Aer Lingus can devise an appropriate fare.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> In relation to the future of Aer Lingus, I believe the international situation will continue to worsen.  There is an enormously strong and powerful lobby demanding cheaper air transport.  The emergence of people like Sir Freddy Laker is proof of this demand which governments now find it impossible to ignore.  This has very serious implications for our national airline and for all major carriers.  Some international air carriers have annual budgets which are greater than the national budget here. The problems facing our comparatively small airline are enormous.  We on this side of the House are prepared to support Aer Lingus in every possible way to ensure that the airline will be able to meet the enormous challenge confronting them and overcome the difficulties.</P>
    <P>I do not adopt the simplistic attitude which the Minister appears to have adopted to this problem.  He expressed the hope, as I do, that there will be a return to more rational thinking and a more rational regulation of international air fares.  The classic answer trotted out by Aer Lingus in justifying the return fare of £86 between Shannon and London is the cost per mile.  The Minister attempted to put forward that explanation, as I gathered from reading a report of his visit to London at the weekend.</P>
    <P>This is not credible or acceptable.  It is much more than a simple X pence per mile.  When we compare it with what other international airlines charge it is invalid.  It is important at this stage that Aer Lingus be able to meet the present challenge.  The fact that the company could report a very successful year for 1977 gives us confidence in their ability to take on the challenge but the time has come for the Minister and the Government to review the role of the national airline in relation to national development. They must accept the vital importance of access transport not merely in relation to tourism but in relation to international trade.  This is a small nation, a member of the EEC which will shortly become a member of the EMS and we are widely dependent on exports. Tourism is also a vital part of the national economy and access transport <Col N="629" /> at the most competitive rates is essential to the future development of tourism and exports.</P>
    <P>The mandate of Aer Lingus should be changed.  It is impossible in present circumstances, in the international aviation field, to reconcile the situation of the commercially viable airline making at the same time a maximum contribution to the development of tourism.  It is time for new approaches to the whole question of aviation development.  The narrow, purely commercial mandate of Aer Lingus, the balance sheet criteria mandate, should be changed to a new formula based on cost/benefit analysis. There is strong justification for this. Apart from the direct contribution of Aer Lingus from their earnings, their promotion of tourism and their ancillary activities Aer Lingus make an enormous indirect contribution to the economy.  It should be possible to broaden the method of assessment of the performance of Aer Lingus to include consideration of their indirect contribution to the economy.</P>
    <P>When talking to a leading tour operator at Shannon Airport some time ago he remarked that a 747 coming in had 416 passengers who would spend three weeks here.  I asked him to calculate the revenue we would get as a result of their spending and he said that the economy would gain if we brought those passengers free of charge to spend three weeks here in hotels and spending money in various ways.  That is a very simplistic and dramatic way of expressing the vital relationship between the level of air fares and the volume of traffic coming in.  The Minister might discuss with Aer Lingus the possibility of devising a cost/benefit formula to assess the performance of Aer Lingus in a more realistic fashion.  A more flexible mandate would give greater scope to the national airline to introduce the type of emigrant fares to which I referred, to offer more attractive fares to tour operators and so on.</P>
    <P>I raised with the Minister during Question Time some time ago the possibility of introducing a shuttle service between London and Dublin, which is a high density route.  The Minister explained that some of the top people in <Col N="630" /> Aer Lingus indicated that that was not on at present, but the general public find it hard to understand why a shuttle service such as that between London and Glasgow is not possible between London and Dublin which carries more traffic than most other European routes.  If it is possible to operate such a service between London and Glasgow it ought to be possible to operate one between London and Dublin.  This would make it possible to charge a more economic fare and it would give some kind of consideration to the people in relation to what they have been asked to pay to travel home.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus are now faced with an enormous growth in charter traffic. There is a growing demand for this and a more liberal attitude has been adopted by Governments towards granting permission to charter.  In the Shannon region because the Government are more liberal in relation to charter traffic, Shannon Airport has done well because of the increased volume of traffic even though this has created a difficulty for Aer Lingus.  The problem of charters <i>vis-à-vis</i> the scheduled airlines has been met by some international carriers who now have charter subsidiaries.  I referred to this here a good many years ago when the Viscount aircraft were phased out and they were lying idle at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>I do not know what happened in the end.  The market was not good for Viscounts then.  They were probably dismembered and sold for spares.  I remember putting forward the idea at the time of Aer Lingus setting up a subsidiary charter company to go into charter business and make maximum use of the charter era, so to speak. Whether this is feasible or not I do not know but I believe that, confronted as we are with the present international situation and now that part of the purpose for which money is being allocated to Aer Lingus is to enable them to buy new Boeing 737s, I presume they will be disposing of some of their present equipment and it may be an opportune time to look at the possibility of having a subsidiary company engaged exclusively in charter business.</P>
    <P>To sum up&mdash;I congratulate Aer <Col N="631" /> Lingus on its progress and say to them that so far as my party and I are concerned we are anxious to support them in every possible way.  We recognise the difficulties which confront them at present and I am putting a certain suggestion to the Minister that the whole of the purely commercial balance sheet mandate be reviewed and a more liberal or broader mandate based on cost-benefit analysis might be considered.  I plead with the Minister and Aer Lingus for special consideration of the air travel needs of Irish people in the United Kingdom.  The possibility of a shuttle service between Dublin and London should be kept in mind and be periodically reviewed.  I also want to throw out the possibility of Aer Lingus setting up a subsidiary charter company.</P>
    <P>I would be remiss in concluding without reference to what I might call the astonishing growth of the ancillary aviation activities and the great success with which Aer Lingus is developing this sector.  It has now come to the stage where there is really cross-fertilisation almost to the stage where the ancillary activities are balancing the difficulties of a very narrow profit margin in the air transport section.  I am particularly pleased to find this happening.  Here again one may be critical but it is only fair to acknowledge initiative and new development in the case of a State-sponsored body.  I have been greatly impressed by the manner in which Aer Lingus have developed their maintenance and overhaul service.  Not only that, but they now have 170 airline customers covering 48 countries with 1,000 foreign trainees which brought in a revenue of £11 million and a profit of £3 million.  It is a great credit to Aer Lingus also that they now have senior management teams in many developing countries advising on management and they have engineering and technical teams working in eight countries.  This is an area that can be developed still further.  It is a great tribute to Aer Lingus and an indication of the latent talent and expertise available here that a small country with a relatively small airline is now providing technical, <Col N="632" /> managerial, engineering, maintenance and back-up services of a wide variety to the airlines of so many countries.  I hope that aspect of their development will continue to make progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not match the Deputy who has just sat down either in his fluency in the Irish language or his knowledge of Aer Lingus and aviation generally.  This is because of the fact that he is a Shannon Deputy and I should like to congratulate him on the various points and suggestions he made to the Minister in this amicable debate.  I and my party, needless to say have no objection to an increase in the State shareholding in Aer Lingus to the extent of £15 million and that from public funds.  I think our support is desirable and the measure the Minister has introduced is desirable because it is well known that Aer Lingus have been borrowing in the private market for some time now, including borrowing on the foreign market.  The balance between State and private investment in the company needs now to be redressed to some extent&mdash;I say to some extent deliberately.</P>
      <P>We also support this measure because the new investment by the State in Aer Lingus will indicate the confidence of the State in the company thus making future borrowing in the private sector much easier than heretofore.  This is one of our most successful semi-State companies and it is a tribute to Aer Lingus to say that the last injection of money was in 1969.  Now, nine years later they come along for what I regard as a modest £15 million.  Therefore, we have no hesitation in supporting this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Donnell, I did not have the Bill in my hands until yesterday morning&mdash;I do not blame the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for that&mdash;but I did discover in some quick research that <Col N="633" /> this time last year approximately Aer Lingus sought the injection of £20 million. Whether that was an official request by Aer Lingus or not I do not know but that figure was mentioned. This £15 million is needed for the reasons set out by the Minister.</P>
    <P>One still does not know what the future of Aer Lingus will be as regards its finances because I think we could describe as great expectations the remarks the Minister made in his speech about Aer Lingus in the future.  Referring to certain plans he said in an earlier part of his speech:</P>
    <P>These plans include the generation of a very substantial increase in the number of visitors to Ireland by 1981 with a consequent creation of a substantial number of new jobs in the tourist industry, and upwards of 1,000 new jobs in the airline itself.</P>
    <P>That is very encouraging and very desirable.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The equity injection now proposed is intended to put the air companies on a sufficiently sound basis to enable them to maintain and improve the present profitable trend.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister for this because the position in regard to air travel is dicey.  On page 5 of his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Fair competition can of course help to stimulate the market and promote efficiency but the airline industry, because of its capital intensity, seasonal and cyclical nature and its public service obligations, cannot operate economically in conditions of uncontrolled and excessive competition. Because of the present intention on the part of the US authorities to deregulate air transport, and the fragmentation of policy among Western European States, I can at present see only a continuing price war on the North Atlantic in which all airlines are likely to get hurt and some may even have to withdraw.</P>
    <P>We share the Minister's known concern for that kind of situation.  For quite a long time there has been a price war. <Col N="634" /> The public do not understand the financing and costing of airlines.  How does Freddie Laker manage to fly passengers across the Atlantic for half nothing?  As he is not a philanthropist, we can only assume that he is making a profit.  I am not suggesting that Aer Lingus could match his fares but there is a great difference between his fares and the fares of Aer Lingus and other major airlines.</P>
    <P>I know that Aer Lingus have incurred heavy losses in recent years and that their finances have been strained.  The interest on loan capital has been excessive. It appears that the current problem of Aer Lingus arose when sterling came under pressure.  There were exchange losses on their non-sterling borrowings when the value of the £ decreased.  I am talking about exchange losses as distinct from overall losses.  There was a loss of £1.7 million between 1970 and 1977.  During that time dollar earnings fell short of expectations because of the general slump to which the Minister referred.  He was only repeating what we had been saying when we were in Government.  There was also a slump on Atlantic routes because many Americans believed that there was a war in this country.  I am sure that Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte went to great trouble to explain to them that there was peace in the Republic at that time and that they were very welcome.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago the Minister said there was a profit of £120,000 for the year ended 31 March 1976 and that in the year up to 31 March 1977 there was an operating profit of £3 million.  The reason for this increase in profit was a 7 per cent growth in passenger traffic due to ancillary activities in hotels and aircraft maintenance to which Deputy O'Donnell referred.  This aspect of their operation has been important.  I should like the Minister to explain why the sum of £15 million is now being allocated.  A year ago Aer Lingus said they needed £20 million.  I presume the situation is not as bad as it was this time last year and that £15 million will suffice.  I am told that the £15 million will provide for fleet renewals but I do not know how much of that money will go towards renewals.  Perhaps the Minister would also tell the House what part of the £15 <Col N="635" /> million will be invested in ancillary activities.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell queried passenger fares between Dublin, Shannon and Cork to Great Britain.  Many people are dissatisfied with the fares on these routes.  The Minister says that we must take the rough with the smooth and have regard for the valley periods as well as for the peak periods.  At £72, the normal fare between Dublin and London is outlandish. In a recent reply at Question Time the Minister said that that fare compared favourably with the fares from London to the continent and that the charge per mile was the same as that charged between our airports and airports in Great Britain.  The excursion fare is £60 and the APEX fare is £48. To buy a £48 ticket one must book a month in advance.  The Minister's answers to questions in the House have not been satisfactory.  If we are to consider those whom Deputy O'Donnell described as wanting to come home for weekends, Aer Lingus will have to introduce different fares in order to encourage them to do so.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to Aer Lingus and to their staff.  Aer Lingus are regarded as being the friendly airline and it is true that they have an excellent name with passengers all over the world. I have no objection to this injection of £15 million.  It is a vote of confidence by the country in Aer Lingus.  I wish them success and trust that the observations made by Deputy O'Donnell and I in regard to fares will be referred to by the Minister and be subjected to examination by Aer Lingus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to the fact that this Bill was being taken so quickly.  I understand that the Deputy Whip of his party was given copies of the Bill on Thursday. Nevertheless, I accept the difficulty and I should like to express appreciation to Deputies O'Donnell and Corish for taking this Bill at such short notice.  I also thank them for their appreciation of the work being done by Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my introductory speech I outlined the reasons why it became necessary to <Col N="636" /> make £15 million equity capital available to Aer Lingus.  Deputy O'Donnell referred to the cost of loan charges. The north Atlantic area is the most difficult one for Aer Lingus.  As both Deputies mentioned, there is very severe competition there in relation to fares.  It is true to say that all the world airlines, especially the scheduled services, are very conscious of the problem, and although it is difficult to see a change, there would appear to be a move, though it is unidentifiable at the moment, towards an upward trend in fares on the north Atlantic route.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to the fact that the profit made by Aer Lingus is very low in respect of its ordinary operations, that is, its passenger and freight service.  As he pointed out, the profit was approximately £230,000.  Most of the profit that accrued to Aer Lingus in the past year has been from ancillary activities. In the purely economic sense, it is really not a profit at all because quite a number of other factors are involved. Deputy Corish mentioned a figure of £20 million.  The application made to me was for £15 million.</P>

      <P>Are Aer Lingus happy with £15 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There will always be a dilemma in relation to fares, on the one hand as to whether the airline's activities are to be economic and on the other hand whether the interests of tourism should dominate, requiring fares to be lower so that more tourists would come here.  There has always been a conflict there.  An airline must try to operate economically, but tourist interests are always anxious for lower fares.  The fact that I have had to come to the Dáil to make provision for £15 million equity capital for Aer Lingus underlines the fact that their profits are so low, even at present fare levels, that they could not contemplate re-equipping or developing without this extra assistance.  They suffered considerable losses until recently <Col N="637" /> and the profits this year are low in relation to a gross revenue of £162 million.</P>
      <P>On a general question of fares, we would all be very anxious to keep fares as low as possible.  Aer Lingus have been endeavouring to keep fares down to the lowest possible limit.  Proposals for new fare structures come to me and they are thoroughly examined before permission is given to increase them.  As Deputies have said, demands are being made for lower fares on the short haul services, especially on the cross-channel route. Let me repeat that the Aer Lingus short haul services are only marginally profitable, and were it not for subsidisation from ancillary activities the fares would have to be higher.  As I have indicated, there is need for substantial profits in the years ahead to meet the cost of new aircraft.  These circumstances indicate how difficult it is even to consider reducing fares.</P>
      <P>I pointed out earlier that there are three different fares on the Dublin route. There is the normal economy return of £72, the excursion rate at £60 and the advance purchase excursion ticket at £48.  In addition, as Deputy O'Donnell has mentioned, there are other low promotional fares.  When one compares like with like, and this is not usually done because people tend to compare the highest level of Aer Lingus fares with the lowest fares elsewhere, it is a fact that the Aer Lingus fares are the lowest in Europe on a cost-per-mile basis.  The figures I have already given, whether they are acceptable or not, are factual. The economy fare works out at 12.4p per mile on the Dublin-London route, 11.7p per mile on the Cork-London route and 11.3p on the Shannon-London route.  This compares with 18.7p on the London-Paris route, 19.7p on the London-Brussels route and 17.9p per mile on the London-Amsterdam route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though I accept that people would like to have lower fares, I have to emphasise the problems we have to face in this regard.  Deputy Corish mentioned the Laker service.  I suggest that that service underlines the reasons for recent comments there have been about fares generally.  It would appear that the success <Col N="638" /> of the Laker-type operation has been possible because Laker remains in a small low-cost operation in a very large market.  Laker operates only on routes where high density traffic exists such as London-New York and London-Los Angeles.  In such routes it is relatively easy for an independent carrier such as Skytrain to cream off sufficient traffic from the scheduled carriers already serving the routes to make the service commercially viable.  It is not burdened with the high costs incurred by the scheduled carriers who have to operate on various routes, many of which may be totally unprofitable or only marginally profitable.  On occasions when we were discussing other semi-State bodies, CIE for example, the case was invariably made from Deputy Corish's benches that if you allowed somebody else to operate against the semi-State body they would simply choose the routes to their own best advantage.  The State body must operate to the benefit of everybody.  Therefore, it is not quite as simple as some would make it appear for Aer Lingus, which must service many routes, profitable and unprofitable, to provide lower fare structures.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to the possibility of a shuttle service.  My information is that the most obvious advantage to the passengers on a shuttle service is the availability of a seat at any time without prior reservation, which would be obviously of benefit to business travellers.  However, there is no guarantee that this would result in reduction of fares.  The potential advantage to the airline is a traffic increase.  But there would be substantially increased costs involved, mainly the cost of providing a back-up service to cater for peaks of demand. My information is that about two-thirds of the Dublin-London traffic is comprised of non-business passengers, many of whom use the existing special promotional fares which would not fit in with a shuttle service.  A number of studies have been done on the introduction of a shuttle service on this route.  It was felt that it would not be an economic proposition and would not be justified because of the relatively limited number of passengers likely to avail of it, considering the extra expenditure involved. <Col N="639" /> At the same time as far as I know both Aer Lingus and British Airways are keeping this question under review.  I expect if they find at some stage or other that it is an economic or viable project, they will enter into that field.  With regard to the charter traffic there is nothing that a subsidiary company could do that Aer Lingus cannot do as it is.  Aer Lingus keep this matter also under review.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to my visit to London recently.  In relation to that I should like to say that the people of Louth, whether at home or abroad, are very courteous, kindly and hospitable.  I should like to point out here that I was received by the people of County Louth in London in a very friendly and kindly manner, as I would have expected.  It is a fact that a small group, led by a gentleman who should have known better&mdash;and who, incidentally was not a Louth man&mdash;did interrupt me in a noisy fashion for a very short period.  If what happened appeared simply to be a reflection on me personally, I would not bother raising it here.  I refer to the matter because it could appear from the way in which it was reported to be almost a reflection on the organisation which invited me.  For that reason I feel it necessary to reiterate that I was received in a very kindly and hospitable fashion by the County Louth Association.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1) (a) (ii), lines 23 to 25, to delete &ldquo;,being a contract to which a body to which this clause applies is a party,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Originally the provision was included in the Bill in response to representations from the Department of Finance who are particularly concerned to ensure that in cases where Irish persons or bodies seek and are being granted loan facilities from foreign financial institutions on conditions of a guarantee by an Irish licensed bank the latter will be able to give that financial guarantee.  The loans ordinarily would be from the institutions mentioned in section 2 (2).  Since the publication of the Bill the banks, as represented by the Irish Banks Standing Committee, made very strong representations that the licensed banks should not be confined to granting these guarantees to the restricted institutions in section 2 (2) but should be allowed to give them inter-bank freely or to other persons not being banks, for instance, in respect of revenue duties, port duties or facilities required by a customer.</P>
      <P>Consequently I tabled this amendment which meets the banks' request in respect of all pure financial guarantees where the sole obligation of the person under the contract is payment of a sum of money.  This is accepted as an essential ancillary to bank customer service. This facility is available in most foreign countries&mdash;for example in the United Kingdom under the 1974 Act.  This provision, as amended, will make the legal position of banks on this matter clear and will meet the requirements of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 12 to 21, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  in the course of his banking business given or entered into, as surety or guarantor, by a person resident outside the State to satisfy, and only for the purpose of, a requirement which is both&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  a requirement of a licensee, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  made solely for the purposes of securing financial facilities to be made available by that licensee.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This represents a degree of access by foreign banks to the Irish market.  Such foreign bank involvement is necessary to meet the requirements of licensed banks which, in making loan finance available to the Irish operations of foreign companies, require, in the course of banking business, that banks of such foreign companies act as guarantors on behalf of such Irish operations.  The extent of the foreign banks involvement is being controlled in so far as it must be at the request of a licensed bank.  It was intended also to further limit the scope of the foreign banks' involvement to certain areas of industry, as defined in section 2 (1) (b) (ii).  This latter restriction is now being removed as a result of representations from the banks standing committee which reveal that other areas of need for this facility existed.  The amendment will extend the scope of foreign banks' involvement in this area to cover all guarantee business in which licensed banks may require guarantees from foreign banks in respect of sums, certain or ascertainable, by removing subsection (1) (b) (ii) of this section.</P>

I explained on the last occasion the Bill was before the House that I thought it would be neater and less confusing to do it like this because I felt that to have the Act of 1971 in a section here which will now become part of a set of Insurance Acts, one of which was passed in 1971, would possibly lead someone looking at the thing quickly astray.  I will not put the point further than that if the Minister does not feel disposed to accept the amendment.  I think what I suggest would be a neater job.</P>

      <Col N="643" /> This is a drafting improvement on an amendment originally tabled by Deputy Kelly.  His amendment was acceptable but for reasons of draftsmanship, in order to tidy the amendment up somewhat, the parliamentary draftsman made some changes, the principal one being the insertion of the word &ldquo;exploration&rdquo; as well as exploitation. Deputy Kelly referred only to exploitation. It was felt that exploration should also be included.  I have also gone further than Deputy Kelly.  He referred to the exploitation of the sea bed.  I have added &ldquo;anything thereon or thereunder&rdquo;.  The final part of my amendment refers to &ldquo;is situated in or outside the State&rdquo;.

I understood the Minister to say he intended something of that sort to be covered by the Bill and he thought it would be covered by the word &ldquo;service&rdquo; in section 2 (1) (ii), line 18, page 2.  That may be so <Col N="644" /> but I am just wondering whether if it ever arose for litigation it could be said that the function of ordering equipment or installing it, or employing a subcontractor to instal it, was a service.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health (Hospital Bodies) Regulations, <Col N="645" /> 1972 (Amendment) Regulations, 1978, a copy of which Regulations in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 21 November 1978.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House seeks approval of the draft Health (Hospital Bodies) Regulations, 1972 (Amendment) Regulations, 1978.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum which I have circulated with the draft sets out the legal background to these regulations and the necessity for them.  Very briefly, the regulations provide for a continuance of the arrangement whereby all the members of Comhairle na nOspidéal are appointed direct by the Minister for Health and for an increase in the total membership from 23 to 27.</P>
    <P>The 1972 Regulations provided that all members of Comhairle na nOspidéal would be appointed by the Minister for Health during the period ending on 31 December 1975.  The five-year term of office of the members appointed in accordance with those regulations will expire on 31 December next.  It is necessary, therefore, to make appropriate legal provisions to enable members to be appointed after that date.  This the draft regulations now before the House will do.</P>
    <P>The rules in relation to membership of the comhairle are contained in the Second Schedule to the Health Act, 1970. Rule 6 of that schedule provides that members shall be appointed for such term of office not exceeding five years as the Minister for Health may specify.  It would be my intention to continue the practice of appointing members for a three-year term of office.</P>
    <P>The functions of Comhairle na nOspidéal are set out in section 41 of the Health Act, 1970, and in the explanatory memorandum.  One of its main functions is to regulate the number and type of appointments of consultant medical staffs in hospitals engaged in the provision of services under the Act. Since the hospital system is by far the most costly element in the health services, it is essential that advances in medical specialisation should proceed in a rational manner, that over-lapping and possible wasteful expenditure should be avoided and that in general the development <Col N="646" /> of hospital services should be carried out on a controlled basis.  The comhairle was established mainly for this purpose.  Because of the importance and far-reaching effects of its discharge of these functions, the selection of members for appointment to the comhairle is obviously a matter of serious concern to all involved in the hospital services of the country.  The ideal would be to have persons on the comhairle who could speak on behalf of all the interests involved. This is not, of course, capable of being achieved without a very substantial increase in the membership of the comhairle, which in turn would lead to an unmanageable and largely ineffective body.  The comhairle has authority to appoint committees for specific purposes and to appoint to such committees persons who are not members of the comhairle.  Representations for each and every interest and speciality in the actual membership of the comhairle is not therefore essential for the purpose of securing a completely balanced representation of interests.</P>
    <P>I consulted various interests before putting the draft regulations before the House.  These included medical and nursing organisations, health boards, voluntary hospitals and medical teaching authorities.  Nearly all of the views which I received favoured a continuance of the existing method of appointment to the comhairle, that is, by direct appointment.  The draft regulations provide accordingly.  It would be my intention, when making the appointments, to take into consideration the names submitted by the various interests concerned of persons willing to act on the comhairle.</P>
    <P>The views which I received from the various bodies consulted seem to indicate that some increase in the present membership of 23 would be desirable.  It would allow better geographic representation and would enable me to go some way towards meeting requests for greater representation of health board areas and for wider representations generally.  These considerations were put forward by many of the bodies consulted, and I have decided to make provision in the regulations for an increase <Col N="647" /> of four in the membership of the comhairle.  This increase will bring the total membership to 27, of whom 14 will, as required by the 1970 Act, be hospital consultants.  I should like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the interest shown by the various bodies which I consulted and of the reasoned and constructive views which they put forward.  I am confident that they appreciate the fact that, in an exercise such as this, it is not possible to meet fully the viewpoints of all interests.</P>
    <P>I recommend that the House approve of the draft of the Regulations which is before it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>These draft regulations allow the Minister the power to increase the membership of Comhairle na nOspidéal in that for ever afterwards a Minister for Health will appoint the members of the comhairle.  When the Health Bill was originally going through the House, and afterwards, we heard many suggestions that the selection of the membership of the comhairle ought not to be left entirely to the Minister of the day and that some provision should be made whereby groups involved in the medical and health fields would have the right to appoint members.  That is the reason why the present regulations are framed as they are and contain the clause in relation to October 1975.  The Minister has decided to remove that clause and give to himself in perpetuity the right to appoint the members of the comhairle.  I do not think that is a good thing and the reservations expressed in the early seventies were valid.  Events have shown the validity of those reservations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many respects the existing comhairle have done a fine job and, from the point of view of Ministers, they have done a useful job in taking the political heat off them.  However, in many parts there is a great deal of unhappiness about the way the comhairle have operated and about the fact that the comhairle appears to be somewhat remote from local issues and points of view.  There has been a suggestion that it would have been better if the eight health boards had the power to nominate <Col N="648" /> members to the comhairle.  That would have meant that local interests and points of view would have been put forward to the comhairle by health board representatives and, in turn, the views of the comhairle and reasons for them wanting to make certain decisions could be conveyed by those representatives. There would have been better communication between the two bodies concerned.  The suggestion has been made that such a procedure would eliminate a lot of the disagreement and unhappiness about decisions and recommendations of the comhairle.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party considered that point of view carefully in the light of the experience of a number of Members who are also members of health boards and in the light of experience of other Deputies of the operation of the comhairle and decisions taken in relation to hospitals and hospital functions in their constituencies.  We decided that it would be proper for the Minister, instead of changing the regulations, to allow the health boards appoint two representatives from its membership to the comhairle, one being the chief executive officer of the board.  In that way there would be the combination of administrative interests and membership interests.  The views of local boards could then have been conveyed to the comhairle and, in turn, the views of the comhairle conveyed to the health boards.  Apparently, that suggestion did not find favour with the Minister.  The Minister did not tell us in the course of his speech that those reservations were expressed but told us that the majority of the bodies consulted felt it was right that the Minister should make the appointments. We are most unhappy that no attempt was made to improve the communications between health boards and the comhairle who make remote decisions in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I endeavoured to amend the motion before the House, as provided for in Standing Orders, but I was told that I would not be allowed enter amendments. I cannot understand the basis for that decision.  That leaves the political groupings in the House in an awkward position because they are invited either to accept the Minister's draft in its entirety or <Col N="649" /> oppose it.  We would wish to see the comhairle continue in operation but we are anxious that the membership be appointed in a different way, something which we cannot express in the form of an amendment.  The situation is unfortunate. The amendments I intended entering would have sought to increase the membership of the comhairle from 23 to 33 with 16 to be appointed by the eight health boards.  I was anxious that the chief executive officer of each board be one of the two nominees from those health boards and that the other person be an ordinary member.  That would have ensured a better spread of interest and representation among the membership to the comhairle.</P>
    <P>At all times the comhairle have endeavoured to act in what they considered to be in the best interests of the development of the health and hospital services.  However, it would be foolish if we did not recognise that their decisions have often provoked a great degree of unhappiness and upset at local level.  In some cases it appears as if the decisions of the comhairle were being taken in isolation from local wishes.  I do not suggest that we should dwell at length on some of the local issues debated here recently but it is fair to say that some of the aims of the comhairle are little short of utopian.  They do not take into account the social, economic or geographic factors within the country.  Very often recommendations and decisions appear to have been taken as if all other factors were equal.  They did not appear to take into account geographical difficulties or the question of a sparse population spread over a wide area and who have the local services removed with consequential additional travel for relatives of patients.</P>
    <P>It is right that Comhairle na nOspidéal should endeavour to achieve the highest possible hospital services but they should also keep in mind a realisation of the special social and geographical factors and the make-up of the country, the way county boundaries are laid out, the difficulties of travel and the hardships incurred by patients and relatives.  Sometimes I think it is not a marvellous advancement to have a high <Col N="650" /> level hospital operating to the best level but where the majority of the patients are unhappy.  They may be unhappy because they are so far removed from their home environment.  They may be upset because their relatives and friends are virtually debarred from visiting them or they may be upset because of the distance they have to travel afterwards on an out-patient basis.  They may be upset because their relatives and friends find it can take more than a day to visit them in hospital.  All of these factors must be taken into account.  Regard must be had to the way the population is distributed, the fact that there is an over-weighting of population along the east coast while in the rest of the country the population is thinly spread.  It is not possible simply to say that because there is a certain hospital system operating in another country we will impose that régime here without taking account of the way of life of the Irish people and the geographic and social factors to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say I do not think Comhairle na nOspidéal have given full attention to those factors, other than the achievement of the highest possible medical standards.  There should have been an obligation on them to take those factors into account.  This was one of the losses suffered in setting up Comhairle na nOspidéal.  In the past the Minister of the day was bound always to take account of the social and geographic factors and the wishes of the local community. While he might have been faced with unpalatable decisions, when he took them they were tempered by the local demand and by the real state of the nation rather than having the decisions taken wholly and solely by a group of medical people, sitting together in isolation and trying to impose textbook solutions on an imperfect society.  We are an imperfect society and to try to impose a perfect régime on such a society can have worse rather than better consequences.</P>
    <P>In his reply the Minister probably will say that he knew of all these things, that Comhairle na nOspidéal take these decisions. That can only prompt us to ask if the Minister was so aware that <Col N="651" /> Comhairle na nOspidéal are the final body in making decisions about the level of services to be provided in hospitals why did he, prior to the last election, make extravagant promises to various sections of the electorate which he knew he could not keep.  The Minister is looking quizzical now.  Apparently he has suddenly forgotten Roscommon, Monaghan, Mallow, Tullamore and all the other places&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am suggesting it was wrong to do that.  To use words that the Minister is fond of using, he was either a knave or a fool to have made those promises.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister assumed office he told the people of Roscommon the decision was not his, that it was a decision for Comhairle na nOspidéal, the body we are discussing on these draft regulations.  In view of the Minister's interruption, I want to know whether Comhairle na nOspidéal make the ultimate decisions.  Since the election <Col N="654" /> it has been represented by the Minister that Comhairle na nOspidéal were set up under section 41 and make the decisions as to what specialists may be appointed in any area, and the Minister merely provides the finance with the agreement of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>If that is not the situation the Minister has not kept his promise to the people of Roscommon although he was capable of keeping it.  If that is the situation the Minister misled the people of Roscommon prior to the election.  He cannot have it both ways.  He could not expect us to discuss the re-appointment of Comhairle na nOispidéal without discussing these matters in the House.  They are extremely relevant.</P>
      <P>During the most heated part of the debate on Roscommon Hospital, I recall hearing a member of Comhairle na nOispidéal explain why they took their decision on this matter.  I accept that the comhairle felt they were operating in the best interests of the general public in Roscommon.  The kernel of the argument was that, above all else, they had to take into account the health of the new-born child.  I asked was there anybody in the comhairle who tried to take into account the well-being of the mother.  Pregnant mothers in Roscommon were expected to travel up to 60 miles in certain cases to attend the maternity hospital which the comhairle felt was the right hospital.</P>
      <P>Before the election people were objecting to that and, in that situation, the Minister made the promise he did not keep.  Was there nobody in the comhairle to ask about the health of the mother, her physical and mental health, removed from her family, unable to receive regular visits from her family, and worried about what might happen to her if she were taken suddenly ill, was in need of urgent maternity services and was expected to travel up to 60 miles to a maternity hospital?  It would be scant consolation for her to know the comhairle made their decision on the basis of the situation prevailing in Denmark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been far better if the Minister had allowed the health boards to make appointments directly to the comhairle so that the chief executive of the Western Health Board, a member of <Col N="655" /> the board, would be directly represented on the comhairle and would be able to put forward the validly and legitimately held views of the public, and would be in a position on returning to the Western Health Board to give an explanation at first hand as to why the comhairle made whatever recommendation or decision they made.  That would have led to a far better operation by the comhairle.  That is not my personal decision.  It was taken by the entire Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.  The composition of the comhairle would have been far better.</P>
    <P>The Minister now has complete discretionary power to decide in what area and in whose interest people appointed to the comhairle will serve.  During a recent debate, in reply to Deputy Mrs. Burke the Minister said he agreed one female member out of 23 members of the board was far too few.  He said that he agreed that there should be more than one in 23.  There is nothing in the regulations putting any obligation on the Minister to appoint a greater number of women to the board.</P>

      <P>There is nothing in the regulations to force the Minister to see to it that the people who comprise almost 50 per cent of the population have better representation than less than 4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in the regulations to sort out the unhappy situation in which officers of the Department of Health who also serve on the comhairle found themselves recently.  This deserves comment as well.  A strange situation arises when an officer of the Department serves on what is intended to be an independent body and is serving on that body by virtue of being appointed by the Minister of the day.  The question must then be asked: in whose interest does he serve?  Does he serve on that independent body as a person with expert advice to offer in his own right?  Is he representing the interests of the Department of Health and does he act and vote in accordance with the decisions of the civil servants in the Department of Health?  Does he serve and act on that <Col N="656" /> independent body in the interest of the Minister who appointed him?  Is he expected to act and vote in accordance with the directives of the Minister of the day?  Apparently that is the situation in which civil servants from the Department of Health who were appointed members of Comhairle na nOspidéal found themselves in the recent past in the sorry and distasteful affair of the maternity unit in Roscommon Hospital.</P>
    <P>Officials of the Department serving on the comhairle felt unable to attend a meeting of Comhairle na nOspidéal because of the pressure the Minister was putting on them to act in one way.  This created a conflict in their own minds because of their anxiety and their personal wish to sit and act and vote in a different way.  It is extremely unfair that officials of the Department should have been placed in that position.  It should be made very clear in what capacity an official from the Department serves if he is appointed to what is supposed to be, and I understand always has been, an independent body.  Any civil servant will carry out the terms of his appointment. If he is appointed to act and vote on behalf of the Minister he will do so.  If he is appointed to an independent body because of his knowledge, expertise and skills, he is entitled to make his own decisions on whatever information is available to him as a member of that independent body.</P>
    <P>It is not desirable that the new Comhairle na nOspidéal should be set up with some members appointed from amongst the officials of the Department of Health unless the situation is made crystal clear to them, to the general public and to their fellow members of the board.  There should be no doubt about how they will act on the comhairle.  If the Minister wants to keep the power to appoint members of the comhairle, and if he wants to appoint officials from his Department to the comhairle because of their knowledge, expertise and skills, he should not endeavour to put pressure on those appointed officials to act against their personally held beliefs.  That would appear to negate the very reason for which they were appointed in the first place.  The fact that that unhappy incident occurred and was used as an excuse <Col N="657" /> to explain away the Minister's incapacity to deal with the local situation in Roscommon is indicative that there is not contained within the membership of Comhairle na nOspidéal a voice to represent the general public and local interests.</P>

      <P>The reason for inserting that clause is given in the explanatory memorandum issued by the Department some weeks ago.  It said that the time limitations of article 3 on the method of selection of persons for appointment as members to the comhairle was included because there was disagreement as to whether all the members should be selected by the Minister or whether some should be selected by different bodies.  I believe the predecessor of the Coalition's Minister for Health also included that time clause.  The fact that the provision to take away from the Minister the power to appoint the comhairle and to allow other bodies to appoint people who would to some degree be representative of the general public and the health boards at a future date was included, clearly indicates that there was a recognition of a need for the public to be represented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No amount of heckling will alter the facts that the Minister has decided to keep to himself the power of appointment to the comhairle, that he is not allowing the health boards to appoint directly their chief executive officers or some of their members to the comhairle and that he is not providing specifically in the regulations that there should be a certain number of women members of Comhairle na nOspidéal.  He is not suggesting in the regulations that he should appoint to the comhairle nominees from the Medical Council who were set up under the recently passed Medical Practitioners Act, although that might have been a very worth-while suggestion because members of that body are carefully selected to represent different branches of the medical profession. It might have been very appropriate if that council, who also have an educational responsibility, had been nominated as one of the bodies which would have a direct right of appointment to the comhairle.</P>
      <P>The Minister has done none of those things.  He has merely removed the clause which his predecessors felt was necessary to provide for a reexamination of the workings of the comhairle after it had been set up to see if, in the light of its experience after its first few years of operation, it would have been better if somebody other than the Minister of Health of the day had the right to appoint members to the comhairle. He has done none of those things. He has done what in my view will be the least successful and acceptable thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I might have different views about what rural Ireland thinks but I hold the view that there are many people in rural Ireland who do not <Col N="660" /> believe that Comhairle na nOspidéal have taken into account the geographic and social factors and local needs and desires in coming to the decision and recommendations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the comhairle have acted in anything but the best interests to achieve the best hospital and health service possible.  Unfortunately, I find myself having to say again, because of the Minister's apparent inability to grasp what I am saying, that the decisions of the comhairle appear to have been taken in isolation from the real, everyday life of Ireland, that is, Ireland outside Dublin.  This has resulted in a great deal of unhappiness and unrest and I believe it is an endeavour to achieve a Utopian medical situation. While I admire the comhairle for trying to see that the best hospital service is provided, I believe there should be an obligation on them to take into account the other factors I have mentioned.  I am not sure if that obligation should not have been written into the legislation of the day.</P>
      <P>While we may all agree that the comhairle have removed the Minister from the unpalatable decision-making position, which would necessarily have fallen on any Minister for Health during the seventies, nonetheless when he made that decision the social and geographic factors and the desires of the local community bore heavily on his mind because he was made very aware of them by the people themselves and by their elected representatives.  While some decisions made by Ministers in regard to the development of the hospital services might not have met with the general approval of a people in an area, at least society could have been happy that the decision had been taken by somebody who had been made aware of the different arguments put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that the comhairle, as operated, have chosen to ignore factors other than the strict attainment of the highest possible standards of hospital care provided in the world.  I am not sure that <Col N="661" /> the comhairle will achieve those standards unless they take into account the social and geographic factors that make up the fabric of our society.  There have been expressions of unrest in different parts of the country and the fact that the Minister's predecessor, who he is so quick to criticise and deride, changed the plan outlined by Mr. Childers, and the fact that the last Minister, Deputy Corish, decided that a number of additional hospitals were to be retained at county level, was indicative of the report that people who were taking into account merely the utopian situation did not always achieve the best possible results.  Regardless of how much this Minister may huff and puff there is no doubt that during the term of office of the last Government there was a change and there was an acceptance of the idea that a certain number of additional hospitals should remain to provide services at a county level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem of a short memory seems to be endemic within Fianna Fáil.  Each of the hospitals which the Minister has outlined in his interruption were detailed for closure by the late Deputy Childers when he was Minister for Health.  He was the Minister who introduced the Health Act and set up Comhairle na nOspidéal.  If the present Minister knows so little about the development and the evolution of the hospital services not to realise it was the late Deputy Childers who decided to close them, he should consider the situation before coming back to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to those hospitals mentioned by the Minister there were many others that were destined for closure in accordance with the Fianna Fáil plan of the early seventies and in 1975 the then Minister, Deputy Corish, decided that a number of those hospitals should not be closed and he outlined which hospitals should remain.  In relation to a number of other hospitals he outlined the <Col N="662" /> development that he considered should occur in regard to them.  For instance, in the case of Roscommon, to which the Minister has referred once again in an endeavour to cloud the issue, Deputy Corish restored to that hospital the accident and the surgical services which the late Deputy Childers had had removed.</P>

      <P>During the time that Deputy Corish was Minister there was suggested the setting up of a federation between Roscommon and Portiuncula hospitals on the basis of an agreement to be made between the two authorities. That agreement provided for, for instance, maternity services by way of the engaging of a full-time obstetrician to be based at Roscommon.  But the agreement was not implemented prior to the change of Government because of the opposition by Comhairle na nOspidéal.  This Minister gave an undertaking that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power he would implement that agreement, but it has not been implemented.  I <Col N="663" /> am suggesting that the reason for not implementing it has been that Comhairle na nOspidéal, the body mentioned in these regulations, did not allow the Minister to do so.  But I suggest also that at the time of making the promise to implement the agreement, the Minister knew that he did not have the power to do so without changing section 41 of the Health Act.  Comhairle na nOspidéal should have within its membership people who are representative of the general public, the general public not only of Roscommon but of every other county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be done by the simple expedient of allowing the eight health boards who are charged with the provision of health services to appoint two members each to the comhairle, one to be the chief executive officer of the board and the other from among the membership in each case.  Members of the health boards are elected in various ways and all of them have the duty of representing the general public at health board level.  If they were serving also as members of Comhairle na nOspidéal they could put forward the validly held point of view&mdash;regardless of whether we would agree in any instance&mdash;of the general public in those areas.  But if the Minister did not wish to do that he should have put into these regulations, as was the case in respect of the Medical Practitioners Act regarding the setting up of the Medical Council, a provision that a certain number of the members of the comhairle should be persons who in the opinion of the Minister represent the interests of the general public.</P>

If he had not wished to allow the health boards to appoint the members, he could have appointed them himself by putting into the regulations a stipulation that a certain number of the members of Comhairle na nOspidéal should be appointed by the Minister on the grounds that they represent the interests of the general public.  There should also be the stipulation that a certain number of the members be women so that the female viewpoint would be represented in relation to decisions regarding hospital development especially in respect of maternity hospitals.  In the regulations, too, power should be given to the Medical Council to make appointments because of their specialist knowledge and expertise.  There are many different ways in which the composition of Comhairle na nOspidéal could have been improved but there is only one way in which it could have been disimproved: to remove from the existing regulations the onus placed on the Minister of the day to consider, as was suggested in the first regulation, the idea of Comhairle na nOspidéal members being appointed from a number of different sources other than merely by the Minister for Health. However, the Minister chose to take the easy way out and this was the worst way.</P>

      <P>The Minister is regarded as being a fair man when it comes to wielding a political knife; but when he reaches a situation when he cannot get to a tape first with a scissors, the situation is not auguring well for his continuation in political life.  His predecessor placed an obligation on the Minister to examine the situation of the hospitals in the light of the disagreement that prevailed at the time on the question of whether the Minister should appoint all the members of the comhairle.  The suggestion at the time of the setting up of Comhairle na nOspidéal was that they should be allowed operate on foot of being appointed by the Minister for a number of years and that after the expiry of those years, in other words after the council appointed in 1975 completed their term of office, the situation should be examined in the light of the operation of the comhairle to see whether they might operate better if they were appointed by a number of different bodies and contained appointees of the Minister.  That is what the Minister's predecessor set out to do and that is what the Minister has decided not to do. The last few years have seen public protest marches, demonstrations, acres of newspaper comments and editorials, the passing of resolutions by local authorities, health boards and local district health committees, all calling on Comhairle na nOspidéal, on the Minister and on different people to change the operation of the comhairle.  If ever there was proof of the wisdom of the decision that the composition of and method of appointment to the comhairle should be <Col N="666" /> examined in a number of years after commencement of their operation, that proof is there in the record of public authorities engaged in the provision of health services and in the files of newspapers and journals.</P>
      <P>The health boards should be allowed the right to appoint roughly half the membership of the comhairle, but I am not suggesting that they should be given the right to appoint members without any type of restriction.  One of each of the two health board nominees should be the CEO of the health board who might fairly be expected to convey the overall viewpoint of his board to the comhairle and to convey back in turn the viewpoint of the comhairle to the health board. That would have represented an improvement in the operation of the comhairle and in their relations with the health boards, and the general public.  It would be silly to suggest that Comhairle na nOspidéal have good relations or are held in high esteem in certain parts of the country.  It is regrettable that the comhairle are not held in high esteem.  The way the comhairle are working and trying to achieve the best possible hospital service would be better understood if among their members were people from each of the eight health boards.  The Minister has not chosen to provide for that or to put the restriction upon himself to appoint women or people who would be representative of the general public.</P>
      <P>Following examination of the regulations and what they were setting out to do, my party have expressed unhappiness about the changes the Minister is making in these regulations and the fact that he is not taking into account the often repeated exhortations to change the method in which the comhairle are appointed.  I am confident that the comhairle will continue to make decisions based on what they believe to be the attainment of the highest possible hospital service.  Those decisions would be better taken if there were more people on the comhairle representing local interests and Irish life, lay as well as medical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to delay the House unnecessarily on this motion.  When Comhairle na nOspidéal <Col N="667" /> were established I had grave reservations about them.  I thought they had power exceeding that of the Minister for Health.  The charter setting up the comhairle was such that they seemed to have unlimited power.  The purpose in setting them up was praiseworthy but there was a saying with a great element of truth in it prior to the setting up of the comhairle and applying particularly to voluntary hospitals, that if your aunt was the Reverend Mother you could be assured of a consultant appointment in a hospital.  That was not as funny as it sounded.  There was a great deal of nepotism in the appointment of consultants to hospitals which was contrary to normal, decent practice.  Merit did not count for much.  We still have evidence in voluntary hospitals, particularly in this city, of a great deal of nepotism, and merit is of secondary consideration.</P>
      <P>The setting up of Comhairle na nOspidéal indicated a great attempt to rid this country of nepotism in hospital appointments.  How far this has succeeded is another matter.  There are a number of loopholes still.  Comhairle na nOspidéal do not have the final decision and the hospital can overrule their recommendations with regard to appointments. The former Minister for Health, the late Mr. Childers, admitted that the hospital would have the final say.  I was disappointed in that.</P>
      <P>I have said that the comhairle had power exceeding that of the Minister himself.  One wonders whether such a body should have unlimited power.  It could be argued that this gets the Minister off the hook because it gives power and authority to a body to make decisions, perhaps political decisions. The big dilemma facing the Minister for Health is whether he should allow a body to take decisions of such importance in relation not only to the appointments to hospitals but also to the setting up and location of major hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend no disrespect to Deputy Boland, but having listened to him I was confused.  I wondered whether he wanted the Minister or Comhairle na nOspidéal to have the power.  Is the power to be taken away from the Minister and given to an autonomous body the constitution <Col N="668" /> of which, with regard to the members, is rather one-sided?  Another criticism of the comhairle is that they are Dublin-orientated. I recognise that the membership of the comhairle must contain a certain number of consultants, but I wonder whether the composition should not be much more balanced. Who should make the final decision? Should Comhairle na nOspidéal merely take unto themselves the task of deciding the manpower requirements in hospital services?  Should they rationalise this? Should they make the political decisions as to where hospitals should be located? These are the big arguments we must consider in relation to Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>
    <P>Did Deputy Boland want the Minister to have the power to appoint to the comhairle or did he want them somewhat on the lines of the new medical council? Should there be more lay representation on the comhairle?  Should there be nominating bodies with powers of nominating to the comhairle?  If that is the case, do we take away the power completely from the Minister and is he then merely a figurehead in the Department of Health?  We must decide whether the location of hospitals should be a political decision or one taken by a body such as the comhairle.</P>
    <P>We will never get a consensus on this. No matter what Comhairle na nOspidéal do in their present form and no matter what decisions they take, they will be criticised.  If it takes a decision in relation to Mayo, Sligo will criticise it as indeed will Galway and Roscommon.  If it takes a decision in relation to Monaghan, Cavan will criticise it and there will be an editorial in the Cavan <i>Anglo-Celt</i> criticising it.  I recognise that.  In a situation such as this a political decision will have to be taken in respect of the location of hospitals and it may have to be an unpopular decision.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister, in expanding the membership of the comhairle, doing it so that he can make political decisions and overide the powers of the comhairle? Does he want to put his own name on it so that a political decision can be taken by him?  I put these questions because the Minister has not said that he will arrange for the new appointees to be <Col N="669" /> representative of various areas.  Should they come from the western area or the north-western area?  Of the four additional members proposed should there be one representing two health boards? There is no arrangement for this in the appointments which the Minister envisages.</P>
    <P>I would not agree with Deputy Boland that the late Mr. Childers made the decision originally.  The first attempt to rationalise our hospital services was made in the Fitzgerald Report in the late sixties.  The Minister was presented with this report and it was a fair attempt to rationalise our hospital services.  Perhaps the working party which examined the situation was Dublin-orientated and did not understand the local problems of the various areas.  But no matter what the recommendations of the report, I dare say they would have been criticised.  I remember in 1969 I went to a meeting in Athlone and I came up against a very irate group of people who were objecting to the downgrading of their hospital.  I often felt that the Department of Health did not go to enough trouble to explain the purposes of the recommendations in the Fitzgerald Report because when I explained the position to them in terms of a person whose child might be admitted to the hospital for what might be an apparently simple symptom demanding surgical intervention but during the course of the operation it turned out to be a much more complicated thing which required expertise beyond the capacity of a particular hospital, the public were not irate at all and they saw the logic and they were prepared to make certain sacrifices in the interests of patients.  The Fitzgerald Report was too unbalanced in so far as it was too Dublin-orientated.  It was a pity that it started off on the wrong foot.  It was a sincere attempt to rationalise our hospital services.  It was a good report, perhaps a little ahead of its time in its thinking.  If it had been more balanced in its representation of various rural areas it might have achieved a lot more.</P>
    <P>The nettle has to be grasped by the Minister.  There was a lot of political expediency since in deciding on hospitals.  I saw evidence of political expediency some years ago and a Minister for <Col N="670" /> Health who will decide on where hospitals should be will have to be unpopular; he will have to take a decision in consultation with the comhairle which will, perhaps, be unpopular with members of his own party.  They will be unpopular decisions but it will be a brave man who will take them and he is going to have to take them.  He is not going to have a consensus about the location of hospitals.  If the Minister favours Tullamore he will come into conflict with his representatives in Portlaoise, and <i>vice versa.</i>  We cannot retain all our hospitals. If we try to do this we will be diluting the service too much.  The cost of hospitals and hospital services is an enormous burden at the moment.  We will have to make unpalatable decisions but right decisions in the interests of the country.</P>
    <P>The dilemma the Minister faces is a serious one.  It is a big decision he will have to make.  It is suggested that the Minister in attempting to expand it is attempting to gain a political power over the comhairle so that he will be able to make political decisions in favour of particular hospitals.  I am not saying that he is but it has been suggested to me that he is.  Perhaps it is true; maybe he wants to make political decisions but I would like him to do it taking into account all aspects of it, all factors involved and primarily he should remember that it must be in the interests of the people and not his vested interest in an area.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I took an unpopular line in regard to Roscommon so far as my own party were concerned but I felt at the time, and I still do, that sometimes one has to be unpopular in the interests of the people as a whole.  The people in Roscommon were talked to and had the situation explained to them properly.  No mother will object to a little inconvenience in the interests of her baby. I feel strongly about that and I believe that most mothers who have any sense of feeling for their unborn child would be prepared to suffer the inconvenience. Everyone knows mothers who have suffered more than mere inconvenience. Our biggest problem is that we have not taken the trouble to explain the position properly to people.  We get involved in this political wrangling all the time and it is very wrong and we lose credibility. <Col N="671" /> We do ourselves harm and the public lose respect for us.  I will say frankly, at the risk of offending someone, that I admire the Minister for admitting that he had made a mistake.  He admitted he was wrong.  Maybe he was ill-advised but I think it is good that anyone can say he is wrong.  I have been wrong many times.</P>

      <P>It is important to admit that we are wrong at times when we are wrong and the Minister said he was wrong and I admire him for that.  It is a good man who says that.  As I have said, I could not in conscience support the Roscommon maternity unit in preference to the Portiuncula unit.  If I did I would be doing an injustice to the people.  We have to make decisions bearing in mind all factors in the situation. Sometimes it is unpopular to do so. There is a dilemma in regard to Comhairle na nOspidéal where they are not totally representative whether to give them this full power to make decisions. That is the only thing I find wrong; I would like to see the comhairle more representative.  How does one do it? Maybe the time will come in the next few years, when a new body is being appointed, when the Minister will get around to making them a fully representative body without making them too cumbersome a body.  There is always the great risk that a body will become too cumbersome when this is done.  Perhaps increasing the membership by four will not do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comhairle have done an enormous amount of work.  I have to admit I was critical from the beginning but I have to admire the work they have done. Before Comhairle na nOspidéal came into being we had no statistics on what <Col N="672" /> was available here or on our manpower requirements.  We were making appointments without any regard to any of these things.  There were duplications all over the place and there was an appalling state of chaos.  Comhairle na nOspidéal have done a wonderful job in trying to rationalise the position and in bringing about order out of this terrible chaos in regard to consultant services.  We need to do this in the interests of the economy because we could not withstand this waste any longer and Comhairle na nOspidéal have done this and have done it admirably.  They have done a great job and we can be proud of the work they have done because their members are very busy people.</P>
    <P>It is often said that the person to appoint to a body such as this is a very busy person.  All of them have been very busy.  Their attendance has been very high.  They have had committee meetings and have done a wonderful job.  We might find the chaos worse without them.  In deciding the medical manpower requirements, we should seriously consider asking them to take into account the medical student intake to universities and medical schools.  If we are considering our medical manpower requirements we must take into account the number we will permit in our medical schools.  It is not in accordance with the facts to say that we might be making our contribution to the Third World by allowing unlimited admission to medical schools because the graduates from our medical schools do not usually go to the Third World; they go to the rich, prosperous countries.  We are not fulfilling any obligation to the Third World by having unlimited acceptance in our medical schools.</P>
    <P>I recognise the unique position of the Royal College of Surgeons in relation to this.  They have graduated their fees so that they charge lower fees to medical students from the Third World.  I would like to see the comhairle look at this aspect of it, because it is an important point.  We cannot consider medical manpower requirements for this country without considering medical student intake. The Minister has an unenviable task in deciding whether we should give them the power or whether he should retain <Col N="673" /> it.  I would like to see a wedding of both, consultation with the Minister and the last word with him.  I do not begrudge him the right to do this. Sometimes political decisions have to be taken after consultation with the experts. A weak Minister would like to shake the matter off and not have it because it is an unpopular thing to do.  He will face enormous political pressures, which I hope he will resist.  I hope he will take into account the basic requirements and overlook the fact that vested interests may be applying pressure.</P>
    <P>When the Minister comes to make the appointments I hope he will be big enough not to take in political appointees. I am not casting any reflection on him.  I hope he will be able to say &ldquo;I want this to work right; I want this body to operate well.  I will appoint people whom I feel will do a good job and I will see, where possible, that the representation is as wise as possible&rdquo;.  If the Minister does this he will do a very good job in regard to the appointments.  It might change his whole thinking on medical personnel and medical requirements if he gave a little time to reading a book called <i>Doctors on Trial</i>, which will shortly be published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with a number of points made by the two representatives of the Opposition parties during the course of this discussion.  First of all, I want to make it clear that in extending the membership of the comhairle it is my hope that the increased membership will enable me to provide a better regional basis for the new comhairle.  I want to assure Deputy O'Connell that I will endeavour to avail of the power of appointment which the regulations give me to ensure that the best possible comhairle comes into being with the widest spectrum of representation in the professional and in the regional capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> I, like Deputy O'Connell, was quite confused as to what exactly Deputy Boland was suggesting to me in regard to the constitution of the new comhairle. Most of his criticism in regard to the existing comhairle should not be directed at me at all because the existing comhairle was almost exclusively appointed by my predecessor.  My predecessor, Deputy Corish, as Minister for Health, decided he would retain for himself the power of appointment.  I do not criticise that, but it is not very fair of Deputy Boland to attempt to criticise me for retaining that power of appointment on the very flimsy ground that I am now deleting the termination date for the Minister's power of appointment.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned in the situation that we are confronted with in this area the only way out is for the Minister to make the appointments.  I assure Deputy Boland that I have carried out a very wide range of consultations in this connection.  The overwhelming view of all those concerned is that the Minister should retain the power of appointment. Because of all the diverse interests that have to be represented on the comhairle the only practical way is for the Minister to receive lists of nominations and make the appointments himself.  Deputy Boland, with his customary attempt to court popularity here and there, tied himself up in a number of knots.  He wanted to criticise me for retaining this power of appointment.  He said that the Fine Gael Party had discussed this and they had decided that the Minister should not retain this power of appointment. Every Minister so far who has had to deal with this matter has decided that the only practical, sensible compromise in the approach is for the Minister to make the appointments.  I do not think I can be criticised on political grounds for retaining this power of appointment.  If the Fine Gael Party do not agree with that it is just another indication of how out of touch they can become with reality in those areas.</P>
    <P>Another petard on which Deputy Boland hoisted himself was that, on the one hand, he said I should not retain this power of appointment and, on the other hand, he demanded certain things which I can give only if I retain the power of <Col N="675" /> appointment.  He wanted a certain amount of reflection of public interest and opinion on the new comhairle and his way of achieving that would be to nominate the eight CEOs from the health boards.  Surely that is a totally ludicrous proposition.  The CEOs are not elected.  Excellent officials though they may be, nobody would attempt to suggest that they represent or reflect public opinion in their areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>They certainly do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to accept Deputy Boland's word that what he put before us represents the crystalised wisdom of the Fine Gael Party.  I will not dispute that but I am very surprised that the Fine Gael Party are suggesting to us that Comhairle na nOspidéal in a very significant element of their membership should consist of the CEOs.  As I understand popular opinion among Deputies in this House who are interested in health matters, it is that the criticism of the health boards which should be made is that the CEOs have too much authority and power, that far too many matters are decided by the CEOs without reference to public opinion and popular requirements and demands. Deputy Boland and the Fine Gael Party want to extend that undesirable situation into Comhairle na nOspidéal.  If Deputy Boland attempts to ameliorate that ludicrous proposal by saying that he also suggests there should be two from each health board, that is getting into even more absurd ground.  If there were two from each health board, 16 members out of a total of 23 or 27 would come from the health boards. They would have a complete majority on the comhairle.  Whatever element of flexibility and response to public demand there is in the comhairle at present, there certainly would be none then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say quite categorically that the only way to bring the comhairle into being with the right sort of mix in the membership is for the Minister to receive proposals from as wide a spectrum of organisations as possible and then make the appointments, trying to reconcile all <Col N="676" /> the different conflicting interests involved. If Deputy Boland takes away from me the appointment of the members, how can I ensure that there is reasonable representation of women?  I gather that Deputy Boland puts a high priority on the adequate representation of women on the new comhairle.  The only way I can ensure that is by having the power of appointment.</P>
    <P>Lots of the things Deputy Boland said in pursuing what Deputy O'Connell referred to as &ldquo;the political wrangling advantage&rdquo; led him into very contradictory positions.  I do not want to rehash the old business of Roscommon and the closure of this or that hospital.  It was my policy put before the people at the election in the Fianna Fáil manifesto that we would retain the county hospital. In so far as the manifesto received the approval of the people, it received it with that element included in our health policy.  I believe the retention of the county hospitals is necessary in our circumstances, having regard to our population structures and our social strata. At some time in the future it may be that we will be able to do away with the county hospital but that day is far removed from practical politics at present. In every part of the country there is overcrowding in our hospitals.  We find people in corridors and wards chock-a-block with beds to the point where staff can hardly move around.  How can we contemplate at this stage or in the forseeable future closing down some of these valuable county hospitals which are providing an acute service for the people in their areas?  It would not make economic or social sense.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of that policy which I put openly in the Fianna Fáil manifesto before the general election, I am now endeavouring as far as possible to retain the county hospitals for the benefit of the people of those areas.  Whether or not any Deputy likes to contradict this in points of detail, the fact is that Monaghan hospital has been kept open and preserved as a full-scale county general hospital.  The same applies in Tullamore, Mallow and Roscommon.  It is my policy to maintain these as county hospitals providing an acute general service. I have indicated to the comhairle <Col N="677" /> that this is my policy and asked them to staff these hospitals as required.  They have done that.</P>
    <P>I want to make it absolutely clear where the line of demarcation comes. Sometimes there may be a slight overlap but broadly speaking the line of demarcation is as follows.  It is my decision, as Minister for Health answerable to this House, as to what general hospital policy should be.  It is my decision whether there should be an acute general hospital here or there.  When I have taken that decision, it is the responsibility of the comhairle to decide on the level of staff.  I do not find any particular difficulty working with the comhairle along those general lines of policy and I do not think there will be any difficulty with the new comhairle.</P>
    <P>It will do no good to rehash the Roscommon situation.  It is a difficult matter.  Perhaps Deputy Boland and Deputy Burke would now acknowledge that they have got all the political advantage they can get from that situation.</P>

      <P>When I came into office there was a stalemate in regard to Roscommon.  Nothing was happening.  I asked a senior official of my Department to bring all the parties together, to start consultations again and to try to work out a federation which would work.  We did that and a reasonable compromise proposal was put forward which, as far as I could see, met the situation reasonably accurately.  Unfortunately, that proposal has been rejected, not by Comhairle na nOspidéal but by the Western Health Board.  Those federation proposals could now be in operation as to 90 per cent of their content were it not for the fact that the Western Health <Col N="678" /> Board rejected them because they did not go all the way they wanted.  I have given an undertaking before and I repeat it now that I will keep working on the Roscommon situation until we can devise some solution which will meet the social and community demands of the people of Roscommon.  As Deputy O'Connell has clearly and honestly outlined, whatever the political disadvantage to himself might be, the solution devised must meet the medical requirements: the overriding need for us to provide the right sort of maternity service for the mothers and children in future.  These two things must in some way be brought together in some sort of intelligent sensible proposal in the Roscommon situation.  In so far as my undertaking in regard to Roscommon is concerned, the county hospital will be retained as a county hospital to provide the level of services in the area and I intend to continue that situation to the best of my ability.</P>
      <P>The comhairle will have very important functions and an important role, as outlined by Deputy O'Connell, in trying to keep some rationalisation in the system of hospital appointments and in making sure that the right balance and structure is preserved so that there is no overlapping and no shortages and that the right number of appointments is made throughout the whole hospital structure. That is a very important function in so far as it is delegated to the comhairle by statute.  I will not interfere with their decisions or try to influence them in any way.  I will make my policy clear to them in regard to hospital development and, having done that, it will be their function to implement that policy so far as the staff are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There need be no particular difficulty about our continuing to operate along these lines.  I am following along the path charted by my predecessors.  If the House agrees that I should continue to have the appointments of the members and that I should increase the number to 27, I will endeavour to provide the best possible comhairle I can, an independently minded comhairle which will make decisions strictly on the merits of the situation, objectively and impartially&mdash;a <Col N="679" /> comhairle which, as far as I can ensure, will have a good representation of all the regions throughout the country and will be able to reflect all the problems and aspects that arise in the different areas and at the same time will by and large continue to do the task that the existing comhairle has done fairly successfully, and which, but for the odd instance here and there, the comhairle has done to the general satisfaction of the people interested in health matters.</P>
    <P>I avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to the existing comhairle, to the chairman and the members.  As I said in a reply to a criticism by Deputy Boland I did not appoint them; they were appointed by my predecessor.  But in so far as I found them there when I came into office, I have absolutely no complaint about the comhairle.  They went about their statutory functions honestly and diligently and I fully subscribe to what Deputy O'Connell said about them.  The amount of work they put into their task is quite extraordinary.  They have been very assiduous and very comprehensive in their approach to the task they were allocated by statute.  Whether we agree or disagree with particular decisions of theirs, we would all agree that the comhairle <Col N="680" /> now going out of office have served us very well indeed.</P>

      <P>Every Deputy is entitled to his own opinion.  I am giving the House the benefit of what I think, as the responsible Minister.  The existing comhairle have done a very good job and have devoted an awful lot of time and dedication to their statutory function.  I hope that the new comhairle which will come into being next year will be able to provide the structure of staff throughout the hospital service which will best serve the people which, as Deputy O'Connell pointed out, is the ultimate objective of the new comhairle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann notes with concern the state of industrial unrest and calls on the Government to take urgent steps to reduce worker alienation caused by its socially perverse policies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It gives us no pleasure to move this motion.  The present state of industrial unrest has been a matter of great concern to us.  We believe that the national interest is more important than any political advantage which the Opposition can gain in this regard.  Accordingly, we have restrained ourselves for the past 18 months.  We have been responsible and helpful but our helpfulness has not been recognised and reciprocated.</P>
      <P>Before I discuss the perverse social policies to which the motion relates, I should like to say that we are more than anxious for the turbulence inflicting industrial affairs to cease.  I repeat the call I have made many times for a generation of industrial peace.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy has diagnosed our industrial troubles as the English disease.  The diagnosis seems reasonable at first but on reflection it is clearly wrong.  Our problems are homegrown. It is very much an Irish disease, the main characteristics of which are insane suicidal tendencies.  It is to the eternal shame of this Government that, far from seeking to cure them, their policies have exacerbated and sharpened our industrial ills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will recall the outrageous economic indisciplines of the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  With the election of Fianna Fáil, boom time was said to have arrived.  The question is: boom for whom?  Instead of it being a boom for the workers it has been a gloom for them.  This year more than £800 million was borrowed to pay for millionaires' wealth tax, to pay for the abolition of rates on grandiose mansions, and on multi-occupied dwellings in the ownership of speculators, to pay for a reduction in capital gains tax and to pay for the abolition of car tax, no matter how many are owned by the same family. These policies might not have been such an affront to working people had they not been accompanied by what I can only describe as perverse or antisocial <Col N="683" /> suggestions, namely, the phasing out of food subsidies, the tax on children's allowances, the increase in bus fares which followed the abolition of car tax and the increase in local authority rents which followed the abolition of domestic rates.  As a result of Fianna Fáil's policies, ordinary men and women have been faced with sharply inflated house prices as building millionaires smile all the way to the bank or, as some of them did, to the stud.  We have witnessed the indecent spectacle of one of them gambling £750,000 on a share in a not very successful thoroughbred filly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in house costs since the Government came to power has been three to four times greater than the increase in material and labour costs.  The building millionaires smile all the way to the banks as a result of the Government's perverse policies. The affront to ordinary people is compounded by the unparalleled level of mortgage interest rates which this anti-social Government have refused to subsidise. They have refused to follow the example of the Coalition who subsidised mortgage interest rates in the middle of the world recession when they were not as high as they are today.  The Government removed the relatively small amount of wealth tax and abolished domestic rates on the grandiose dwellings of the rich.  At the same time they cannot find funds to subsidise mortgage interest rates or to reduce the qualifying age for pensions to 65.  As they penalise mortgage holders they subsidise the rich and increase the bank accounts, at home and abroad, of the building millionaires. The same Government are withdrawing medical cards from the needy sections of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only fair to describe such policies <Col N="684" /> as anti-social.  It is evident that the Government's actions and inactions add up to the most anti-worker Government since the departure of British imperialism. It is reasonable to say that Fianna Fáil policies have been a double fiasco.  First, in order to win an election they created an atmosphere of euphoric expectation to which the workers responded.  Secondly, Fianna Fáil underestimated how anti-worker their policies were perceived to be and the extent to which they have alienated workers.  This Government, temporarily, have warmed the cockles of rich men's hearts, have brought happiness to the well-heeled tax evaders who are a cancer in our society.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder, therefore, that the alleged Fianna Fáil pursuit of tax evaders is seen not as a sensible attempt to stop abuse but as an unfair attack on the weaker sections of our community? There has not been any recognition of the penal way in which ordinary wage and salary earners are being taxed through PAYE.  They pay as much as 87 per cent of income tax revenue, yet it is clear that neither the Minister for Labour nor any other Minister has any clear perception of the demoralising effect PAYE has on the workforce when compared with the very generous and suspect kid gloving of the rich.</P>
    <P>These points must be made.  It does not give me any pleasure to voice them, but uppermost in the minds of Deputies on this side is the national interest.  That must take priority over any political opportunities presented to the Opposition by an inept and unsocial Government. The national interest requires urgent action.</P>
    <P>According to replies given to me today by the Minister, the total man days lost in the current year through industrial action are running at an annual rate of close on 600,000.  That is five times the rate for the early years of the decade.  It is of little use that the Minister says the man days lost have been fewer than in the pre-national wage agreement days.  They are scandalously high, five times what they were six years ago.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the public sector in the industrial relations field. While I was preparing my speech for this motion during the weekend, I listed <Col N="685" /> all the bodies in the public sector who have had strikes this year&mdash;CIE, the ESB, NET, Aer Lingus, Posts and Telegraphs, Dublin Corporation, the local authority engineers and RTE.  I thought I had exhausted the list until I walked through Baggot Street yesterday and noticed a Bord na Móna picket. Quite apart from overall responsibility for industrial relations, the Government have a special responsibility for affairs in the public sector, and anyone who knows anything about industrial relations, or indeed people who do not know anything about them, will appreciate that there is an acute industrial relations problem in the public sector.  Not only have we had repeated problems in the areas I have mentioned but we have had major disputes among the gardai and the nurses, and now we hear of problems in relation to higher and junior civil servants and, once again, CIE.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Government have been doing about the special problems in the public sector or why these problems are so chronic.  It will be noted that any action the Government have taken on industrial relations in the public sector has been to the detriment of public servants.  The Aer Lingus dispute would have been settled earlier except for the intervention of the Department of the Public Service.  Look at the appalling delay in the settlement of the telecommunications dispute which for many weeks left us without even the normally bad level of telephonic communication before the Minister came down from his ivory tower and allowed some discussions to take place.  How long did it take us to get the Minister for the Environment to accept responsibility for the local authority engineers' strike? The frustrating of the efforts of Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick to raise the matter in the House was a standing joke in the media.</P>
    <P>Mainly through inaction, the Government have mishandled completely industrial relations in the public sector. They have given no attention to the massive morale problems in CIE despite repeated requests from this side.  There has not been any inquiry into the situation in the ESB where even a couple of days ago a go slow left the country <Col N="686" /> without supplies.  These problems will not go away if Ministers continue to bury their heads in the sand in the hope that they will go away.</P>
    <P>In both public and private sectors positive action is required now.  It is accepted by everybody that the preparation of legislation on industrial relations, where human emotion is a major concern, is a delicate matter.  I agreed with the Minister today when he told us that any such legislation must be acceptable to be effective.  I agree wholeheartedly.  I acknowledge entirely that legislation for industrial relations, without a consensus, is potentially suicidal.  I am not coming into this House to ask the Minister or the Government to commit suicide.  I plead with the Minister to unfreeze himself, to come out of his corner and seek that consensus which, in the main, I believe exists not just between the social partners, between the FUE and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions but also between all sides of this House.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough&mdash;as the Minister demonstrated in this House today&mdash;that he should sit idly by and do nothing.  In all the replies to questions before us today everything was under review or was referred to the Commission on Industrial Relations who, the Minister would not admit to this House, will not be issuing any interim reports and are not likely to report for years to come.  I know that is a fact.  I presume and hope the Minister knows it to be so.  We cannot await the outcome of the report of the Committee on Industrial Relations.  We cannot tolerate the Minister hiding himself under the bushel of the commission.  The Minister will have long ceased to be Minister when that commission report.  If he continues with his present &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; policy in every area of his responsibility the problems confronting us today in industrial relations not only will not be solved but will be greatly aggravated and multiplied.</P>
    <P>I have said publicly before that the makings of a consensus on certain changes necessary in the legislative area exists not only between all sides in this House but between the social partners. What is now needed, and what I would propose, is a major change in the industrial <Col N="687" /> relations code in the form of a Bill of workers' rights and responsibilities. Such a Bill could be a workers' charter enshrining not only the value and dignity of all workers but the doctrine that each right is accompanied by a parallel responsibility, and <i>vice versa.</i>  The worker himself and the trade union movement are threatened by the pernicious cancer of unofficial action. The great bulk of workers know the verity of that statement; the trade union movement know its verity.  Yet, like the Minister, a nervousness exists amongst the work force and the trade unions about legislation.  It is nervousness that freezes any action in this regard, a nervousness that freezes any discussion in this matter.  It is a nervousness I understand but do not share.  It is for the benefit of the worker and the trade union movement that any change in the law&mdash;and in particular the law on picketing&mdash;be devised.  It should be designed wholly for their benefit.  What is called for is less nervousness, more confidence, especially more mutual confidence between the social partners on the one hand and the politicians on the other.  I repeat my earlier invitation to the Minister to go out and create that confidence, to seek that consensus from those on this side of the House and with the social partners which I believe exists in principle.  If he fails, all is not lost; if he succeeds, Ireland will be in his debt. Very often legislation is understood by many as a possible anti-worker move. No Bill coming before the House which even in the slightest degree could be considered anti-worker would have our support. That is not the sort of Bill we want; it is not the sort of legislative change we want.  We want the sort of legislative change that will have our support and that of the social partners.</P>
    <P>There are many areas that could be updated by enlightened legislation.  I shall not go into them now.  Certainly I can conceive of many different topics which, if enhanced in such a Bill of workers' rights and responsibilities, would significantly contribute to our economic progress.  Legislation is not the whole answer, not nearly the whole <Col N="688" /> answer; it is but part of the answer. Because of the possibility of failure or of our nervousness we should not be deterred from the attempt at least.  I suppose there will always be tension in industrial relations but certainly there are other areas in which significant improvements can be achieved.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the question of pay bargaining and a recent development when the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, at their conference two weeks ago, rejected even talks on a further national pay agreement.  I would not wish that we would have another national pay agreement similar to the current one.  On the other hand, I believe that a free-for-all most definitely is not the answer.  I note the almost quietly-pleased way Government Ministers accepted the verdict of congress.  In view of their temporary financial and self-induced difficulties it seemed to me that the Government might not have to pay increases to the public sector in the absence of a national pay agreement. Every 1 per cent thus saved saves the Exchequer £10 million and reduces the financial embarrassment, self-induced, now afflicting the Government.  That is short-term thinking.  I believe a free-for-all would bring us back to the chaotic pre-1970 days; it would be of great benefit to the strong but a great affliction for the weak; the highly-paid would do very well while the lowly-paid would do miserably.  Therefore, a free-for-all is not the answer.  Neither is a repeat of this year's national pay agreement nor perhaps of earlier ones, undoubtedly good and beneficial though they have been for our economy.  What is necessary is a new type of tripartite agreement, a social contract&mdash;call it what you like&mdash;because it seems to me no longer tenable to divorce centralised pay bargaining from Government policies on taxation, prices and social welfare.  They all need to be blended to avoid counteractive effects on each other and their compound negative effect on competitiveness and job creation.</P>
    <P>This is what I say to the Minister tonight.  Let the Government address themselves urgently to that task, the task of seeking a social concordat on which their social and incomes policies will be <Col N="689" /> based, not just for the next year but for, perhaps, the next few years.  I believe that is essential.  I believe any objective analysis of this year's national pay agreement, now running at something like 16 per cent, will show that more than half that 16 per cent for a start was clawed back in increased income tax, increased inflation and increased social welfare.  On the other hand, increased costs have priced how many thousands of Irish workers out of jobs?  Sixteen per cent means that we are that much less competitive than we would have been had it been 10 per cent, or 8 per cent, or 5 per cent.  It means inevitably&mdash;hard to quantify but someone should attempt to quantify it&mdash;that some thousands of jobs have been squandered.</P>
    <P>Would it not have been much better if the Government had buried their pride, taken their courage in their hands and negotiated last year some sort of social contract?  Would it not be better if everybody concentrated not on fictional increases in pay, which do not have a similar increase in purchasing power, but rather on the purchasing power of wages mainly by reduced taxation and, perhaps, reduced social welfare?  I say that because I believe, and I have said this before, social welfare in particular acts as the payroll tax.  It is a disincentive to employment.  So are high wage costs.  On the other hand, workers are entitled to a fair share of the national cake and not only entitled but they have generated most of the economic growth we have been enjoying and are, therefore, entitled to the major part of it. It makes little sense for them to get increases in pay which are of less value than a reduction in taxation and social welfare.  In the end we would all be better off, more competitive, with more people in work, more contributed to the Exchequer and less taken out of it.</P>
    <P>The social partners themselves have a very big part to play in improving industrial relations.  I have never made any secret of my admiration for the role that has been played by the trade union leadership over the last number of years. I have never made any secret of my respect and regard for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  But that is not to say that it is an uncritical respect. <Col N="690" /> I do not think anybody in congress leadership today, or in past years, would say that congress or the trade union movement is perfect and so I make a strong plea, first, to the congress to reorganise itself as best it can in such ways as are possible to improve the discipline, the strength and the standing of the trade union movement.  I address a similar appeal to the FUE and to management generally because I believe a major component in our industrial relations problem, especially in areas of repeated unofficial action, is bad personal management.  I believe that certainly to be true of the battle of this time last year, Ferenka.  Bad management is a big factor in bad industrial relations and the FUE and industry generally, and not just industry but the public sector management as well, would do well to address themselves to this problem and help to contribute towards a solution.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to make an appeal that we should now set out to make strikes truly an action of last resort and not, as is now so often the case, an early weapon in a battle that no one in the end wins.  I make one further final appeal to the Government to reverse their perverse, anti-social policies and to address themselves to the problems and the aspirations and the expectations of the work force on whom so much depends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;supports Government policies aimed at promoting industrial, economic and social progress and rejects any suggestion that these policies are contributing to industrial unrest&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Government took office 18 months ago they did so with an overwhelming mandate from the electorate, a mandate based on the economic and social policies they had put before the people.  These policies were intended to deal with the economic crisis which faced the country at the time of the election.  We had record unemployment. <Col N="691" /> We had the worst inflation rate in the EEC and an intolerable level of foreign borrowing.  From the beginning the Government's overall economic and social strategy has been geared especially towards the generation of higher employment through a sustained high level of growth, greater investment and a reduction in the rate of inflation. Because we realised the effects of our measures to reduce taxation would take some time to work their way through the economy and be reflected in increased employment the Government took immediate action to provide employment by special programmes of expenditure in peak areas.  It was necessary that our policies be pursued vigorously so that the economy could quickly recover momentum after the severe recession.</P>
    <P>The results to date demonstrate that the Government's approach has been successful.  The target growth rate of 7 per cent for this year will be achieved and inflation will be down, it is expected, to a level of about 8 per cent compared with 10½ per cent in 1977.  The target in regard to unemployment for 1978 was a reduction of 20,000 in the numbers out of work.  While the latest estimates suggest that there may be some shortfall it will be very small indeed and the net increase in employment this year will reach a record level.  The special programme for job creation in the public sector, in the building and construction industry and in youth employment which the Government initiated shortly after coming into office is going ahead successfully.  The target set under this heading was 20,000 new jobs and indications are that this target will be exceeded by the end of 1978.  While there were unavoidable delays in getting some elements of the programmes under way, due in particular to administrative difficulties, I am happy to say there has been a very substantial improvement in recent months.  At the time of the last election our fundamental policy was the reduction of unemployment, not just for economic reasons but also for social reasons and for the development of the individual worker and the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion speaks of <Col N="692" /> worker alienation.  Surely the greatest form of alienation in our community is being unable to find suitable employment when one seeks it.  I am disappointed, therefore, that the tremendous efforts being made by the Government, and the community, to provide employment are jeopardised firstly by unofficial disputes and then by exaggerated comment on the industrial relations situation by the media and the Opposition. Anything which disturbs good relations between workers and employers and interferes with the attainment of industrial harmony is, naturally, a matter of concern to the entire community.  As our economy continues to develop the degree of interdependence between the various sectors of the economy increases. Further, as the percentage of the workforce engaged in primary production diminishes so even greater numbers of our labour force are engaged in adding value to the primary product or, alternatively, are dependent for their livelihood on providing services to those engaged in the production of goods.  The increasing complexity of linkages in the economy, therefore, means that no worker is totally immune from the repercussions of strike action.</P>
    <P>It is important, therefore, that the real problems affecting industrial relations here be critically examined not only by those directly involved such as managers, trade unions, and the authorities concerned but by the whole community.  People who seek to make political capital out of difficulties in this area are hardly performing a useful service for the community.  Emotional language may be difficult to avoid in some disputes but a disproportionate emphasis on industrial relations conflict conveys misleading impressions not only to the Irish public but also to the international business community.</P>
    <P>We live in a competitive and exacting international environment in which other countries are striving to attract foreign industrial developments.  Our competitors will hardly play down any adverse reports on our performance in industrial relations.  The picture of industrial relations for most people is painted by the daily newspapers, TV and radio.  My view is that a disproportionate <Col N="693" /> amount of media coverage is given to the reporting of strikes and conflict.  We see little coverage of the many stories of success in the conduct of industrial relations in the vast majority of enterprises here. It would seem to be a case of good news being no news.  Since 1976 my Department have been compiling approximate figures on industrial disputes which come to their attention.  In the first ten months of this year there were 142 strikes.  If we compare that figure with those of recent years we will find that in the four years, 1969 to 1972, inclusive, the total number of strikes was remarkably constant, ranging from 131 to 134 per year.  However, in 1973 when the National Coalition took office, the figure rose to 182 and in 1974, 160 strikes were recorded.  If we look at the position in the years from 1969 to 1978 we will find that the number of strikes which were unofficial were generally in the region of two out of every three strikes.  In 1973 unofficial disputes at 81 per cent had reached an abnormally high level.  What socially perverse policies were pursued by that Government to bring about such a deplorable situation? This record does not show that the industrial relations climate has worsened since that time.</P>
    <P>In the first ten months of this year about 469,000 man-days were lost because of strikes.  In the corresponding period of 1977, 391,000 man-days were lost and the total for 1977 as a whole was 449,000.  The figure for this year and for 1977 are thus a long way short of the total of just under 800,000 in 1976.  One Opposition Deputy has, in fact, seen fit to make the very wild and damaging statement that the number of man-days lost due to strikes would this year exceed one million.  This is a case of someone thinking of a number and doubling it for political advantage.</P>
    <P>In 1977, two out of five man-days lost, or 40 per cent, were caused by unofficial stoppages.  In the first ten months of this year 109,000 man-days were lost due to unofficial action, which represented 23 per cent of the total.  This is a welcome reduction from the figure for the corresponding period in 1977.</P>
    <P>Two important conclusions can be <Col N="694" /> drawn from the figures I quoted.  Firstly, the vast majority of employers were not directly affected at all by industrial disputes. The second conclusion to be drawn from our strike record is the obvious need for disputes to be settled before the parties concerned become entrenched in their attitudes.  Disputes which develop into long drawn out strikes cause financial hardship to the strikers and to their dependants, and may ultimately cause frustration and loss of production for establishments indirectly affected by the initial stoppage. Worse still, any ill-feeling caused by real or imagined grievances during a strike can persist when the strike is over. Where such residual ill-feeling persists it does not augur well for future industrial relations in the companies concerned.</P>
    <P>Such problems can be readily avoidable if the disputants are prepared from the outset to negotiate in a meaningful fashion.  Employers have long been acutely aware of the power wielded by the trade unions in the form of the strike and picket, which are powerful weapons and which should, therefore, only be used as a last resort. Nobody will deny the right of workers to use the strike weapon and withdraw their labour, but where a strike does occur I feel it reflects on both employers and workers alike.  It may mean that either the negotiators or the procedures for communications between them are not what they should be or even that one side or the other is acting unreasonably.</P>
    <P>The resort to strike action can only be justified when the issue involved is of a serious nature.  Workers and employers must bear in mind the effect their action has on their families with the consequential financial hardship and on the future viability of the company and on the community as a whole.  Each individual employer and trade union official has a duty to ask himself what positive contribution he is making in his own area of responsibility towards industrial peace, to use ways and means at plant level to work towards economic procedures which will avoid industrial disruption and to use these procedures effectively. Clear-cut lines of communication are needed between workers and management so that workers will know that any <Col N="695" /> grievance they have will be dealt with quickly and sympathetically.</P>
    <P>Where do the Government and the Minister for Labour fit into all this?  I see the primary role of the Minister and the Government as providing the structures to deal with dispute situations, making sure that they work efficiently and with maximum speed and reviewing and improving these structures as the need arises.  In addition to the institutions established by the State for the settlement of disputes as a whole, an array of informal arrangements and practices have developed during the years.  These informal arrangements and practices operate sometimes separately from the more formal procedures, sometimes side-by-side and sometimes even as a component part of wider arrangements.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that in this process of evolution our main institutions have remained virtually intact, the only significant change, perhaps, being the establishment of the Employer-Labour Conference some eight years ago.  Very often in serious dispute situations there are demands for ministerial intervention. What many people do not realise, however, is that frequent interventions of this kind can lead in the long term to a debasement of our existing structures and the addition of another rung on the negotiation ladder.  My concern at all times will be to uphold the institutions which have been provided.  The establishment last May of the Commission on Industrial Relations reflected the Government's view, which I believe is shared by the public, that a fundamental review of the procedures governing relations between employer and employee are overdue.</P>
    <P>The commission's terms of reference are very broad and I accept, therefore, that their deliberations may take some time.  I believe it is important that the commission be given an opportunity to reach a consensus on the main recommendations of their final report.  These recommendations may be expected to influence the conduct of our industrial relations for some considerable time to come.  I think it important to stress that employers and trade unions are equally <Col N="696" /> represented on the commission and the recommendations of the commission in due course will have the early attention of the Government.</P>
    <P>As regards their future strategy, the Government have already, as it were, put their cards on the table in the recent Green Paper on &ldquo;Development for Full Employment.&rdquo;  It puts forward for discussion a framework for economic and social policies designed to maximise our potential and to bring about a worthwhile improvement in living standards for all our people by methods that do not call for unacceptably high levels of taxation or Government borrowing.  It outlines a ambitious programme for employment creation and presents the option of reaching a situation within a relatively short period where work can be available for all who require it.  This is indicative of the Government's commitment to solving the problem of unemployment as a first priority.  This objective can be achieved only if it has the active support of all sections of the community and if people at work accept the need for moderation in income increases in the interests of maintaining existing jobs and creating more employment.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the Green Paper, there has been discussion with a wide range of interests and the various responses are being taken into account in the preparation of the forthcoming White Paper which will outline the Government's plans for national development for the next few years. Therefore in framing their economic and social policies, the Government are careful to provide that the various sections of the community are given the opportunity to contribute to and to comment on these policies.  This in the Government's view is the most effective means of ensuring that their development plans have the widest support possible.</P>
    <P>One of the requirements for success of the Government's strategies is that pay increases do not move ahead too quickly. Otherwise our ability to compete is diminished and opportunities for more job creation are lost and, as the Minister for Finance has emphasised recently, we are all involved in the process of job creation.  Our attitudes to income increases <Col N="697" /> and how we actually spend our incomes exert a powerful influence on employment levels.  The unemployed do not sit at the negotiating table and if we are serious about job creation we cannot blind ourselves to the fact that a tradeoff exists between higher incomes and more jobs.  Unfortunately, as Deputy Mitchell said, recent pay claims are giving cause for very serious concern.  It now appears that the increase in incomes this year could be of the order of 16 per cent or more.  While the standard terms of the national agreement were significantly above the norm proposed by the Government as being needed to achieve their economic and social objectives, even these terms have been regarded by some groups as a platform on which to base further demands.  The consequences of a continuation of these trends are higher redundancies, slower growth in employment and an inflation rate above the target set at the beginning of the year.  This pattern cannot be sustained as it is entirely incompatible with the overall targets set for the economy.</P>
    <P>The application of the 1978 national agreement resulted in substantial improvements in real incomes and in real living standards and these were added to by the generous taxation and other concessions granted in the 1978 budget. Against this background it is unwise and unfair on the part of the more powerful groups to be still pressing for extra benefits.  In the longer term they will gain no advantage if they continue on this course.  Others will follow their example and there will be a continuing spiral of rising costs and rising prices.</P>
    <P>1978 has been a good year for those at work but the improvements gained this year will be set at naught and jobs will be lost if the present trend of excessive demands is not reversed.  If we were to join the European Monetary System&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we were to join the European Monetary System we would be in the company of others who are accustomed to lower rates of inflation and pay increases, and we would not survive in this company if we continued with the level of pay increases we have been enjoying this year.  Our unit wage costs would move out of line with our competitors and we could not rely on currency adjustments to keep us competitive.  We would have the opportunity in an EMS situation to sustain a high level of growth and to bring inflation down, but we would not be able to do this without income moderation.  It is imperative that this be appreciated by all sections of the community.</P>
      <P>As has been said, the Government are the largest employer in the country.  It is hardly surprising, therefore, that industrial disputes will sometimes occur in sectors for which the Government are ultimately responsible.  Since there has been adverse comment recently on the state of industrial relations in the public sector, and since the Government's policies in this area obviously have wide-reaching effects, I will say something about pay policy in the public sector. The success or failure of the Government's overall strategy for economic and social development hinges on the development of policies at national and individual enterprise level which will assist in the achievement of industrial peace and, at the same time, prevent excessive income increases which would adversely affect competitiveness and employment.</P>
      <P>Given these overall economic requirements, the Government, as the largest employer in the country, have a special obligation to ensure that policies followed within their own area of direct influence are fully consistent with national objectives.  At a time when the Exchequer pay and pensions bill is of the order of £1,000 million a year, they also have more than ever an obligation to see that the taxpayer is getting value for money.</P>

      <P>For these reasons, a co-ordinated approach to developments in public sector pay is essential. This is in no way unique here.  A coherent public sector pay policy is to be found in almost every country in Europe.  Unfortunately, it is a fact of life that the objectives of moderation in incomes on the one hand and industrial peace on the other may conflict with one another at times.  Indeed, industrial relations, like all affairs involving human relationships, require an element of flexibility and compromise.  There must be realism and flexibility on both sides and there must be an adherence to agreed procedures and institutional arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have to take a stand when developments are taking place which, though they might benefit sectional interests would clearly be in conflict with the requirements of the national interest.  The Government are fully committed to the pursuit of a fair, equitable and orderly system for the evolution of incomes both throughout the economy and in their own direct area of responsibility.</P>
      <P>As for the social policies of this Government, I would emphasise that the Government consult as fully as possible with the representatives of management and unions, in accordance with our belief that only those policies which have the general support of the responsible representatives of the social partners have any chance of success.  Only three weeks ago the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and myself had the latest in a series of meetings with delegations from the Irish Employers' Confederation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable in a democracy that the interests of different sectors will sometimes clash.  In such instances, the Government have to perform the function for which they were elected.  If the policies pursued by the Government for the welfare of the community as a whole sometimes conflict with the narrow sectional interests of some, such polices are hardly socially perverse.  Rather are they socially responsible policies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I wish to support in the strongest possible manner the motion that Dáil Éireann notes with concern the state of industrial unrest and calls on the Government to take urgent steps to reduce worker alienation caused by their socially perverse policies.  The amendment reads that Dáil Éireann supports Government policies aimed at promoting industrial, economic and social progress and rejects any suggestion that these policies are contributing to industrial unrest.</P>
      <P>This amendment is the most dishonest and untruthful amendment laid before the House while I have been a Member of Dáil Éireann.  Despite the Minister's speech from somewhere over the rainbow, in the past 18 months we have witnessed the worst period of industrial unrest in the past 20 years.  That is an undeniable fact of life.  The Minister's ostrich-like attitude to this serious deterioration in labour relations confirms my belief, and the belief of many others, that he has lost the confidence of the workers by his lack of concern and activity in this very important field.  Can he deny that, as we approach the end of the year, hopes are fading fast for a new and vital national wage agreement and pressures are mounting daily for better pay and working conditions by further substantial groups of workers?</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, how can he say Government policies are aimed at promoting industrial, economic and social progress?  If they are so aimed, they are badly off target.  How can he adamantly reject the theory that their policies are contributing to the scourge of industrial unrest which has hit our economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This serious situation has been admitted recently by a Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Gibbons, who furthermore threatened corrective measures to resolve the situation, which threat, I may add, did not go unnoticed in certain quarters.  Is that type of attitude not confirming the original motion and contributing still further to a greater deterioration?  Ministerial threats will not resolve or lessen the present tension that exists in the industrial sector. What is urgently and vitally needed is genuine concern for the needs and living <Col N="701" /> standards of our workers.</P>
    <P>Prior to the last general election there had been a long period of relative stability in industrial relations, even in the face of a vast world economic recession. That was a tribute to the responsible attitude of the trade unions and the work of the Labour Party's Minister for Labour.  Unfortunately the last general election took the lid off.  The Fianna Fáil election manifesto was like a brochure for entering the promised land.  Taxes were to be cut, there were to be jobs for all and the consumer was to spend his way to prosperity.  People took all this at face value.  Unfortunately, the attitude of restraint that had been carefully nurtured by the previous Government in their four and a half years in office was shot to pieces by Fianna Fail's immoral grab for power.</P>
    <P>Now what is the situation?  Fianna Fáil want to put the lid back on again. They have threatened additional taxation, the reintroduction of the taxes that were removed last year, the taxation of children's allowances, the abolition of food subsidies as well as cuts in health, education and social welfare.  All these threats are allied to a silent and a stealthy increase in the cost of living which is cutting into the living standards of every household.  It is no wonder that workers are uneasy when the promised land turns out to be the land of threats and price increases with the new spectre of a harsh budget promised by both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture calls all this an unhealthy labour scene.  If it is, then he and his ministerial colleagues are directly and personally responsible for the sickness.  It was they who promised the economic miracle.  It was they who raised expectations.  Nobody is responsible for the current situation except the party that published that election manifesto of 1977.</P>
    <P>Great damage has been done to the system of industrial relations that was carefully built up by the last Government. The Fianna Fáil Government have become panic-stricken and Ministers are threatening corrective measures.  What precisely does this mean?  What corrective measures has the Minister for <Col N="702" /> Agriculture in mind?  Let him come clean and tell the people.  Better still, why does not the Minister for Labour, Deputy Fitzgerald, inform us of these measures?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that this Government have taken a definite lurch towards the right&mdash;clearly manifest in a concern for the wealthy and vested interests in our country, now their strongest supporters following the abolition of the wealth tax and other such financial reliefs.  They have come a long way from being a party of the plain people of Ireland, with Taca now more rampant than in their heady days of the sixties.  Undoubtedly they have lost their social conscience and this has become more apparent in the area of promotion of local authority responsibility for the provision of accommodation for our workers.  I speak from experience as a member of a local authority who, because of a recent ministerial directive, are no longer responsible for the rehousing of those workers in receipt of a gross weekly income of £75 approximately, without any regard for their existing bad accommodation, the size of their families and finally their take home pay which in a test case I submitted was £54.</P>

This regressive departmental directive is a social injustice and a very definite and vicious policy to disown their responsibility of providing proper accommodation for those who cannot afford to do it themselves.  Surely the Government's lack of concern for these people will increase tension and unease among our workers and create greater alienation in our community.  These harsh housing guidelines prompted a recent editorial in a local paper which read as follows:</P>

      <P>It is not very unusual for a housing applicant to be told that he is earning too much to qualify for a county council house, although he might reasonably expect in such circumstances to be judged a suitable candidate for an SDA loan, but when he is told that the £54 a week which he brings home in his pay packet bars him from any such form of assistance to provide housing for himself and his family, the outrageousness of the situation rankles.</P>

      <P>Why has it taken so long for the Minister to deliberate, apparently he is still deliberating, on this very important matter?  The question of local government may not be either fashionable or popular, as the almost empty House and the empty gallery this evening indicate.  But if in the morning people were to wake up and find that many of the services they take for granted were under serious threat because of inadequate financing, the situation would be changed dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Toward the closing stages of the Second Stage debate on the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, when the Minister was replying, I raised the question of when local authorities would be informed what would be their percentage increase.  From memory I recall the Minister saying he was not obliged to inform local authorities of the increases until at least 23 November.  We are now well past that date and local authorities do not know yet how much money they are to get for the coming year.  Is the Minister in a position now to tell the House how much money is to be made available for local authorities in the coming year so that responsible publicly appointed officials and their democratically elected councils can decide to apportion those funds in order to provide regular, substantial and necessary services in the area of local government throughout the <Col N="705" /> country?  Can the Minister tell us this evening what percentage increase is to be made available this year?  This is not a question to which I alone wish to know the answer.  Every county and city manager has been crying out for this information since after the August holidays when the traditional process of preparing estimates began for the coming year.  I understand that some local authorities have despaired of getting the information they require and have begun a process of preparing their own estimates, independently of a direction or an indication from the Department of the Environment as to what the figures will be.</P>
    <P>My second question is to ask the Minister why it has taken so long for a decision one way or the other to be reached.  In other words, if the answer to my first question is that there is a certain percentage increase, why has it taken so long to formulate the amount?  But if the answer should be that the figure is not available, what is the reason for it not being available?  Either way local authorities have drifted from their traditional position of preparing estimates in the months of September and October to preparing them in the last month of the year.  Anybody who has been a member of a local authority knows that the estimates meetings are held in one month and that the council meet in the next month to decide whether to ratify those estimates.  The process is a two-month one if it is to be carried out properly.  I assume that the Minister for the Environment still has some care and consideration for the process of local government.  Last year was a transitional year.  It was a period when election promises were being implemented. There was a period of adjustment within which reasonable allowances were made by this side of the House, as the record will show.  But the same cannot be said for 1978.  We want to know now why it has taken so long to reach a decision and whether this delay is to be the norm for future years or at least for the period during which the Minister is in office.</P>
    <P>My third question follows reasonably logically from the last one.  If local authorities must wait until the Minister <Col N="706" /> for the Environment is given an indication from the real government for the environment&mdash;the Department of Finance&mdash;can the Minister outline either here or directly to local authorities the process whereby the percentage increase is calculated?  We have not simply abolished rates on residential dwellings. We have radically and totally altered the way in which local authorities finance all their activities.  There was a time, given a certain amount of discretion from the Custom House, when local authorities decided effectively how much money they wanted initially and proceeded on that basis.  A portion of that money then came from central funds by way of direct Government grant.  But the initiative, such as it was, rested with the local authorities.  However, that initiative has gone totally.  The coffin for it is currently enshrined in the Committee Stage of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill which is proceeding slowly through the House.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about the abolition of domestic rates but about the change in the way local government services are financed.  From this arises my third question.  Can the Minister indicate how the percentage increase is calculated in the Department?  In fairness to the Minister I must remark that this question was asked before but on that occasion I got a very garbled and clever answer from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  The Minister being aware of the answer I got then presumably might tell us if the basis, as indicated in that reply, is the basis on which the proposed increase in the revenue for local authority financing, that is the rates, is to be calculated or has the procedure been somewhat more refined?  Can the Minister let us know the formula whereby local authority finance needs are calculated and projected?</P>
    <P>My fourth question relates to the last. If there is such a formula&mdash;and I presume the Minister is not flying by the seat of his pants all the time&mdash;is it a national formula or does it relate to each major local authority?  In other words, is the calculation of the financial needs for the provision of local government services calculated on a national basis or do <Col N="707" /> the individual financial requirements of separate local authorities come into the calculation?  Is it possible to envisage, for example, under that formula or by whatever other means the Minister may have for defining how much money can be made available to local government? Is it possible that some local authorities would get more money than others or would be allowed to raise more money than others?</P>
    <P>They are the four questions I am placing formally before the Minister and in his ten-minute reply he obviously does not have a lot of time to answer all of them.  I do not know what the procedure is in this House, but I am proposing to take only 15 minutes and not the full 20 to which I understand I am entitled, and to give the Minister time to reply to those four questions.  I urge upon him to use fully those 15 minutes and to take his time in replying, but to reply comprehensively. What is at issue is either the continuation and survival of local government services in some or all of our local authorities, or, alternatively, the maintenance of certain levels of employment in some or all of our local authorities.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to add a supplementary to my question in relation to the calculation formula that the Department have.  What factor or variable component do they put into the formula that allows for items of unforeseen expenditure such as provision for the national wage agreement?  If they can reasonably say that we cannot anticipate the final outcome of a bargaining process, will they consequently allow local authorities automatic rights to overdraw their allocation in order to meet the terms of the national wage agreement in 1979 or of a Labour Court award which would be the legal responsibility of that local authority?  Lest I am not making myself clear, I draw the attention of the Minister to the situation that occurred in Kildare County Council.  As reported in the local press, the county manager there was faced with a Labour Court recommendation proposing an increase in funds of a particular kind.  He sought permission from the Department of the <Col N="708" /> Environment for extra cash in order to pay it, was refused that permission and was faced with the choice of effectively reducing the workload of that labour unit within the local authority in order to pay the wages.</P>
    <P>If I can conclude within the 15-minute period, let me reiterate.  Does the Minister know what the amount is going to be?  If so, can he tell us now?  Secondly, can he state why it has taken so long, until now, and how much longer is it going to take?  Thirdly, what is the formula for calculating the increase?  Fourthly, is it a national aggregated one; in other words, is the Minister lumping the development needs of Dublin County Council with the development needs of Leitrim County Council, to take one obvious extreme case, and is he assuming that the percentage increase for one authority is the same as that of another? Finally, in the calculation of that formula, what provision does he make for the unforeseen expenditure which must arise simply within the context of the national wage agreement alone?  There are other areas in which it could arise also, but let us deal with something clear and specific and for which there is a precedent.</P>

      <P>I will not detain the House more than one minute.  I remind the Minister that next week is the last week in which estimates can possibly be considered, the following week being Christmas week.  That means that estimates cannot now be considered this year by councils.  How does the Minister reconcile that with his oft-repeated assertion that councils are still free to order priorities in expenditure in local authorities?  This, of course, is wrong. Would the Minister like to answer that question?  I am particularly keen to know how the money was found in the local authorities this year to meet two national wage agreements.  How was it that in Dublin Corporation £1.8 million <Col N="709" /> did not mean any job losses while £.85 million under the environmental improvements scheme meant 225 extra jobs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to clarify some facts.  The law surrounding the preparation of estimates and the holding of estimates meetings by local authorities is contained in the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955.  Sections 9 and 10 of that Act require local authorities to prepare estimates of expenses and to hold estimates meetings during a period or periods to be prescribed by the Minister for the Environment.  The present period is prescribed under the Public Bodies (Amendment) Order, 1977 and the period is at present from 23 November to 31 December.</P>
      <P>Deputies are aware that important changes have taken place in regard to local taxation in the past 12 months or thereabouts.  First of all, the Government decision to de-rate domestic and certain other types of property came into effect for the first time this year.  I have already explained in my Second Reading speech on the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill that the cost of de-rating has certain implications for the Exchequer. This must be obvious to everyone. A sum of about £80 million was involved for the current year, 1978.  The cost has to be fitted in with the needs of other programmes and services.  These other programmes include, of course, the capital requirements of local authorities as well as the many other services and programmes financed by the Exchequer. Many of these services are vital to the creation of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be clear enough that in the situation I have outlined the level of increase in local rates through the domestic rate grant is closely tied in with national budgetary considerations.  I have made no secret of that or of the fact that there is a need to ensure that continued harmony of local and other programmes of expenditure will continue. This harmony can best be brought about in present circumstances by making sure that the level of increase in local <Col N="710" /> rates is such that it fits in with the broader national budgetary scene for the coming year.  The good sense of waiting until the national budgetary considerations have advanced to an appropriate stage will be obvious to everyone.  This is what I have been doing and what is required of me.  I now assure the House that the relevant national budgetary issues are very well advanced and the necessary considerations are likely to be finalised within a matter of days.  I hope then to be able to issue a firm decision on the limit of rate increases for 1979 also in a matter of days.  I understand fully also that the position may have caused certain inconvenience to some local authorities.  I regret this, but the hard fact is that it was unavoidable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I did consider prescribing a new period altogether for local estimates, but I felt that this might cause greater upset to local councillors and to the staffs of their respective local authorities.  With the prospect of a very early decision, I decided that it was better to let the present period stand for this year.  I should mention though, that where any local authority have a practical difficulty&mdash;and with Christmas coming in during the estimates period, between 23 November and 31 December, as has already been mentioned here&mdash;it is open to any local authority or any rating authority to apply to me for a departure from the Public Bodies Order to enable them to defer their estimates meetings into January if they decide that it is necessary, and already a number of local authorities have applied to do this and I intend to grant their applications.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn asked a few questions. First of all he referred to the present Bill before this House which is now at Committee Stage.  He described it as a coffin for abolishing local authorities or some such thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We gave an undertaking to derate domestic dwellings, community halls, secondary schools and the remainder of farm out-buildings.  It was necessary to bring in this Bill to give it proper legal effect.  This is the important point.  Second Stage came before this House.  It did not apply only to what this Fianna Fáil Government were doing during the current year of 1978 with regard to rates.  It also legalised what was done by the previous Government when they gave a 25 per cent reduction in the rates by way of the Exchequer becoming responsible for 25 per cent. The two were involved in that Bill.  It came up before the House and the Labour Party called a vote.  As it transpired they did not have enough Members in the House to have that vote when the numbers were called and counted but what it means in effect is that the Labour Party were voting against the action that their own <Col N="712" /> Minister, Deputy Tully, and the last Government took.</P>

      <P>There were too many non-runners on that occasion.  Deputy Quinn mentioned taking into consideration such matters as national wage agreements.  There have been national wage agreements for a number of years. The estimates meetings took place at the usual time, November-December.  As far as I recall the national wage agreements were never agreed until February-March so local authorities still had to make provision for those before there was any derating.  That is point number one.</P>

They can establish their own priorities with regard to how that £80 million was spent last year.

So we have the Labour Party, who are supposed to stand up for the less well off people, still wanting to continue to have these people rated.  That is exactly what they did.

      <P>(2)  It is not possible to say at this stage whether any extra cost will arise.</P>
      <P>(3)  The general policy is to convert the larger manual telephone exchanges where there is difficulty in maintaining a satisfactory manual service to automatic working as soon as practicable, that is, as soon as buildings can be made available and local network problems resolved.

      <P>(4)  The 603 subscribers' lines at present served from Kells manual exchange will be connected to an automatic exchange at Kells.  In addition to provision of the automatic exchange, the engineering works involved include underground cabling in Kells, provision of extra switching equipment at Navan and Drogheda and change of subscribers' equipment at Kells.  Initial costs are expected to be of the order of £350,000 rising to about £900,000 according as further works are completed.</P>

      <P>Grants are not available for the purchase of secondhand houses. However, I announced in December, 1977, an attractive scheme of house improvement grants, which is being widely availed of, for such houses.  This scheme, which is effective from the 1 November 1977, provides for normal grants of up to £600 for reconstruction work, £200 and £150 for the installation of water and sewerage facilities, or where such installations are provided as part of group schemes, maxima grants of £300 and £250 respectively.

      <P>I have been examining the position of certain youth organisations with financial difficulties which had accumulated over the past years.  To help the organisations in question and as a &ldquo;once only&rdquo; measure I will be introducing a Supplementary Estimate for £62,000 in Dáil Éireann in the very near future. This money will be allocated among youth organisations already in receipt of grant aid from my Department.</P>
      <P>Details of the precise amounts payable to each organisation will be announced as soon as possible after the Supplementary Estimate has been passed by Dáil Eireann.</P>

      <P>Some of the recommendations contained in the report on Adult Education in Ireland have already been implemented. For example: (i) There has been a continuous growth in the amount of funds made available to vocational education committees for adult education purposes. (ii) Adult education officers have been sanctioned on a experimental basis for two VECs, in Counties Meath and Kilkenny.  (iii) Most VECs have appointed adult education sub-committees. (iv) Many adult education organisations are affiliated to AONTAS&mdash;the National Association of Adult Education and a grant at the rate of £10,000 per annum is paid to AONTAS.  (v) Many organisations are making progress in the provision of literacy classes. (vi) Grants made available by the Department of Education to voluntary organisations such as Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Tuaithe, the College of Industrial Relations and the Dublin Institute of Adult Education have been increased since the publication of the report.</P>
      <P>The desirability and practicality of further development on the lines of the other recommendations in the report will have to be considered in the context of the future overall provision for education, and within this provision, the availability of funds for adult education.</P>
