      <Col N="204" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 20 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point was being made that the provision whereby the Minister for the Public Service controls the operation of the pension fund or alterations in its constitution, and subsequent alterations of it, is one which seems, according to the Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service to have only been applied in one or two cases which he can recall, Nítrigin Éireann being one.  I should like to know if it is the policy of the Minister for the Public Service that in all legislation a provision like this be inserted.  If so, will he state if this provision was in the Shannon Free Airport Development Bill yesterday?</P>
      <P>My main point is that if it is justified to control pension funds in the public service in the way that this Bill does, it should be done once and for all in one Bill for all pension funds in the public service.  If that was done we would have uniformity.  We would not have, as in the present case, State bodies which have been the subject of legislation in recent years being subject to control because the Bill afforded an opportunity for the introduction of control while other State bodies, for some reason or another, have not required legislation governing their activities and are not subject to control because no opportunity arose.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister of State should reconsider this issue as I understand he has responsibility in this field himself and come to a conscious decision to deal with all State bodies once and for all in relation to this issue or else abandon the exercise.  We should not continue in this piecemeal fashion of dealing with one body now and one body at some other time.  I should be glad if the Minister of State would respond on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is that it is the policy to have such provisions introduced. <Col N="205" /> It is certainly the policy of the Government to control pay and pensions for all bodies.  The ACC pension fund is a contributory scheme, 50 per cent contributed by the staff and 50 per cent by the company, and the company guarantee the pension fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State respond to Deputy Bruton's question by telling us if it was included in yesterday's Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be possible but it does not arise under this Bill.  It is the intention to have the provision in each Bill when the opportunity arises.  It may have been overlooked in some Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister of State answer the other point I put to him as to why this is not done comprehensively and once and for all for all State bodies rather than having a piecemeal situation where some bodies are covered and others are not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point there but that is a bigger question.  The position is that where it was possible to introduce such a provision this has been done.  In other cases where it has not arisen so far, the Minister for the Public Service has been in touch with the boards concerned to ensure that they keep within Government guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that some semi-State bodies can get away for four or five years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  As I said, the Minister for the Public Service has been in touch with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>He has no authority over them when there is not a provision in the Bill relating to that organisation. Therefore, he can make recommendations but he cannot ensure that the recommendations are implemented. It is right to say that some State bodies are controlled completely by legislation while others are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State say what his policy is in relation to pension funds?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A general question of policy in relation to that matter will arise on the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may make a respectful submission to the Chair, we are being asked to give power to the Minister to regulate pension funds. Before giving him that power the House is entitled to know what his policy is and how he proposes to exercise that power.  I submit that that is relevant.  The House should have such information before a decision is taken. Therefore, I am asking the Minister of State what guidelines he is giving this year to State bodies within his control in relation to pension funds.  Is there any standard rate of contribution? Is there any standard rate of benefit for different grades?  Is there any recommended level of relativity between contributions and benefits within which the Minister is insisting that the State bodies stay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy is to move towards uniformity in pensions. That is why this provision is necessary. This means that the board, if changing the pensions or superannuation will have to approach the Department of the Public Service.  That Department is gradually moving towards a uniform pension scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Uniformity at what level?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is to be uniformity in pensions they have to be uniform in some form.  If one is trying to move the level of benefits down among some State bodies who are considered to be overgenerous and up among other State bodies considered to be undergenerous there must be some standard towards which one is moving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <P>The Deputy must appreciate that other State bodies are not under discussion here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that.  The Minister of State has stated that he is anxious to move the ACC, in the exercise of the powers he has under this Bill, towards what he describes as a uniform level of pensions which will apply throughout the public service.  This is a proposal to exercise a power under the Bill in relation to the ACC, to move it in a direction, and we are entitled to know what that direction is before we grant the power to the Minister.  For that reason I have asked the Minister of State to tell the House what the uniform level of pension is.  Presumably there is some body which he considers to be at the right level.  He should tell the House the name of that body so that other bodies will know whether they are going to be brought down or up. For instance, does he wish to bring it to the level of contributions in the civil service?  Is it that he does not want any body to be giving more to their employees than civil servants are getting?  I am helping the Minister of State now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the Minister has answered my question but because the Ceann Comhairle does not wish me to pursue the issue I will not do so.  The Minister of State has told us that it was a uniform policy to take powers of this nature governing pension funds but I should like to draw his attention to the fact that in the last Bill dealt with here, that in relation to SFADCo, control was taken over the remuneration and allowances of the chief executive of the company but there is no power similar to that sought by the Minister in section 20 of this Bill concerning pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience in Government I know that all Bills are circulated to all Departments so that the Bill dealing with SFADCo must have had the approval of the Department of the Public Service but yet they did not insist on the inclusion of any control on pension funds in that Bill.  They have insisted upon and obtained such a control in the Bill before the House.  In other words there is not, as the Minister claimed earlier, a consistent policy being applied.  There is one rule for ACC employees and a different one for the employees of SFADCo.  Why is this inconsistency being allowed to take place?</P>

      <P>I know it was questioned in the debate in 1947 and this issue was debated at length by the late Deputy Hughes.  He felt that this was an onerous position, that all that was needed was for the corporation to say that the debt existed and <Col N="212" /> that if such a certificate was issued the unfortunate individual, who was the recipient of this statement from the corporation, had to go to court and prove he did not owe the money even though the corporation did not have to go to court.  They could just send on a bit of paper.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon on that occasion said that if the Agricultural Credit Corporation were to issue a certificate that the Captain of the Guard, who was a Mr. Byrne at that time, owed the Agricultural Credit Corporation £1 million he would have to appear in court to prove that he did not even though the ACC did not have to appear in court.  There is some doubt regarding the equity of this proceeding. I realise that as this has been law since 1947 and if there was any abuse of the power contained herein by the ACC we would have heard of it.  I have not heard about any abuse and I concede that point in advance to the Minister.  This is the first time the existence of those powers has been the subject of review for 30 years and I wonder if we should have a little more justification of the necessity for this apparently rather severe power?</P>

      <P>We are dealing with what is the proper form the law should take governing the relations between the citizens and bodies such as the ACC.  I have heard this argument put forward time and time again and I probably used it myself when I was sitting on the same bench as the Minister of State, that of course people will behave reasonably and of course this is the last resort.  That does not stand up in law.  There is no legal requirement on the ACC to behave reasonably.  This section stands on its own.  There is nothing in it which says <Col N="214" /> that the powers contained in section 21 shall only be exercised after the ACC have done (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e). There is not even anything in the section, whether or not it is worth a lot, that the ACC shall behave reasonably in the exercise of this function.  I ask the Minister to consider inserting a provision that notice must be given and also inserting a provision along the lines he has stated&mdash;he is the best man to draft this as this is his suggestion&mdash;that this power would only be exercised as a last resort.</P>

There is no question of the citizen in any way being misinformed of what is happening.</P>

      <P>I have not the slightest doubt of either the <i>bona fides</i> of the Minister or the ACC in this matter at this point in time.  I want to make it clear that I am not questioning that.  I am questioning the unqualified power which is being given in this section to the ACC for an indefinite future period.  That is a different thing.  We are living in a very free and healthy society at the moment where powers of this nature can only be exercised subject to check.  I want to be sure that the Bill will be so drafted that at any future time protection will exist regardless of the political complexion of the society in which the law will then be operative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I would be satisfied if the Minister would give us an assurance now of his intention to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to the effect that the powers contained in section 21 will be tempered by a provision as to notice.  If what the Minister has said is true, that is, that the person concerned will know already that he is liable to have this proceeding operated against him, such provision should not cause the ACC any additional trouble.  Presumably they would <Col N="215" /> be giving the notice anyway, but it would be an additional protection to have the provision in law.  Secondly, we would welcome an assurance of the introduction of an amendment to provide that the powers will be exercised only in a last-resort situation or after other proceedings have been exhausted. The Minister may be in a better position than me to draft such an amendment.  He knows the various other proceedings that the ACC can go through before reaching what he described as a last-resort situation in which the powers of section 21 would be exercised.  I would ask the Minister to draft an amendment for the purpose of ensuring that these other proceedings must be gone through first and I should be grateful if he would let us know now whether he would be prepared to act on those lines.</P>

      <P>In regard to the provision that it shall be lawful for the ACC to make such alterations in their memorandum and articles of association and that such alterations shall be in a form approved by the Minister, there are a few points I wish to make.  This legislation was drawn up primarily to make credit available to farmers and, in particular, to those farmers who need funds in order to develop their farms; but, as I have said here on previous occasions, the ACC have not been discharging that function as it should be discharged.</P>
      <P>Down through the years the situation has been that many of those farmers who are facilitated with credit by the ACC are people who could very well do without such credit.  But they seek this credit for their agricultural pursuits so that they might avail of any subsidised rate and also in order not to disturb their capital invested elsewhere.  The type of farmer we should be helping is the one who has no resources to help him to develop his farm.  It is impossible for some small or even medium-sized farmers to convince the ACC of their credit worthiness. The first obligation of the corporation as a State agency should be to farmers in this category.</P>

      <P>I consider that this is one of the most useful sections in the Bill and I want to say a few words on the use of the section by the ACC.  One could describe it as the more flexible side of the policy of the ACC.  It is based on the creditworthiness of the borrower.  Through the years most moneylending institutions were very security-conscious and were anxious to secure every penny given to the borrower. This has been removed and it is a welcome development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the question of borrowing for the buying of machinery should be examined.  In a great many cases lending institutions who operate hire purchase, as well as the ACC, charge abnormal interest rates.  I have <Col N="221" /> always believed that the creditworthy farmer should be in a position to use his machinery as chattel to borrow money.  I am prepared to accept that once the machinery is paid for it can be used as chattel to borrow money. We have not yet accepted that a borrower, instead of using the HP system, should be able to buy a tractor or other machinery and use it as a chattel to buy that particular machinery.</P>

The creditworthy borrower should use that as a chattel and borrow at lower interest rates.  The HP interest rates are abnormally high, not particularly so with the ACC but certainly with some outside companies where the rates are as high as 26 per cent.  They fool people by saying 10 per cent but that really means 25 per cent or 26 per cent. People think they are paying 10 per cent but it is actually 26 per cent when paid on a monthly basis.  I would ask the Minister to encourage the ACC to change their present HP system for people who are creditworthy and allow them to borrow money for machinery on a chattel basis, whereby a new tractor can be put against the money at a different interest rate and not at HP terms.</P>

As Deputy Callanan said, the ACC are reasonably fair but the majority of lending agencies attached to the commercial banks are very unfair because they charge exorbitant rates of interest ranging from 30 per cent down to about 15 per cent.

Would the Minister of State not agree that a statement of the reasons should be supplied and that statement lodged in the Library if the power is being exercised by virtue of an agreement on the part of the Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
      <P>Coming back to the point about licensed banks, there is nothing here which says they must be recognised. The Minister could, if he so wished, recognise at his own total discretion some back street moneylender and give him all these powers.  There should be protection against the arbitrary exercise of this sort of power.  I do not suggest the Minister would act in other than a responsible way.  That is not the issue.  The issue is whether the law is properly drafted to meet every possible contingency and every possible policy that might be adopted by every possible occupant of this Ministry.  I would ask the Minister to give an indication that he is prepared to confine this recognition to licensed banks because that will ensure that the Central Bank will be involved and that recognition will be granted only if the Central Bank okays, so to speak, the bank.  That would rule out back street moneylenders, and where the Minister withdraws the certificate of recognition he must supply to the bank and to the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas a statement of the reasons for that withdrawal.</P>

We are concerned not with interpreting the law or giving an opinion on the law, but with making law, which is quite different and more important. The Attorney General's interpretation is not necessarily sufficient.  I have not seen the ruling in question so I cannot comment on whether it is well founded or not, but knowing the person in question, I would imagine it is.

      <P>We just cannot assume that arbitrary powers of this nature will be exercised in a reasonable fashion.  We must assume the opposite. We must assume at all times that powers given to Ministers under statute will be exercised in an unreasonable and unfair fashion.  If we do not have that assumption as the basis for approaching legislation we will not build in the proper protection.  There is not adequate protection here against the arbitrary exercise of this power by some Minister in the future.  When the Minister says, it is not necessary, I presume that is a reference to its not being necessary under the present Minister, because the present Minister is a reasonable man.  That is not an answer to the point I am making.  We are enacting legislation which will last.  If one reads back through history over the last 30 or 40 years we can recognise how countries became totalitarian under the apparently legal forms, by legislation that was enacted.  Powers were given but they were used for different purposes than originally intended so as to create a totalitarian situation.  Germany is a very good example.  We must be very careful to impose a proper check on such legislation. The Minister could paralyse the banking system, by withdrawing recognition from all banks and could prevent them from operating in the normal way without reason.  If the Minister <Col N="228" /> wants to paralyse the banking system he has extensive powers to do so.  Such powers should be checked.  I submit that the Minister should consider my amendment carefully between now and Report Stage.</P>

The result is that for people who are obtaining services from the Exchequer or who are committing offences against the law of the land the penalties they pay are not increasing as fast as the level of taxation, although these people are receiving <Col N="230" /> services or committing offences and therefore are morally liable to have the costs imposed on them increased.</P>
      <P>There is a strong case for the Minister to introduce a fines and fees Bill which would bring together the fines and fees under all legislation, and such a fines and fees Bill should be introduced in the House every two or three years to make sure that fines and fees in general throughout the public service are appropriate to the level of inflation or deterioration of money values in the intervening period.  If such were done revenue could be obtained over a wide range of Government activity and thus the burden on the ordinary taxpayer who has to pay the cost of these offices would be reduced.  The ordinary taxpayer who has no interest in the register of chattel mortgages is now paying a much larger proportion of the total cost of that office than he was in 1928 when the fees were originally set.  In other words, we have had a drift in policy whereby that office from being originally more or less a consumer service which was paid for by the consumer has gradually become a public service paid for by the taxpayer who will be gaining nothing from it.  This is an example of a shift in the burden of taxation which is occurring solely because fine and fee values are not being adjusted to take account of inflation.  We have this creeping change in the burden of taxation over time and it should not be allowed to take place.  I was urging this when I was in Government.  I urge the Minister that, as we have a Finance Bill which changes taxation every year, there should be a fines and fees Bill which changes fines and fees throughout the public service on a regular basis so that it would not be necessary to wait until, for instance, there is a Bill dealing with the courts of law to change the fees in this case. There should be an ongoing process of fee change and fine change also, because maximum fines in many cases of offences are still the same as they were set in the 19th century.  I would be glad of the Minister's comment on this.  I am aware that he cannot give me an answer immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In that event there is no excuse for them not having been altered.  The Minister for Justice is responsible and I would like the Minister for State to draw his attention to the matter.  In fact, the Minister for Justice should be proposing this and not a member of the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>After all, he is going to get the revenue and not we.  I would like to refer to section 26 (6) whereby:</P>
      <P> (6) The contents of any register of chattel mortgages shall not be published or disclosed nor shall any copies thereof or any part thereof be issued to any person except that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>There are two cases here in which I query the permission being granted to inspect the register of chattel mortgages.</P>
      <P> (a) a recognised lender may at any time by requisition under the hand of the solicitor or law agent of such recognised lender require the county registrar to inspect the register and to provide the recognised lender with certified copies of any entries therein relating to the stock of any person named in the requisition;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have 15 recognised lenders according to the Minister.  Any one of those could under this provision require the county registrar to have provided to the bank the full details of the chattel mortgages of any person in the State even though the bank had no dealings with that person or there <Col N="232" /> was no proposal that they would have dealings with that person.  For instance, a bank who wanted to build up a file on everybody in the state so that the bank would know exactly the credit-worthiness of everybody in the state regardless of whether they had any direct personal concern with the credit-worthiness of that person, could go through the electoral register and send a notice to the county registrar saying, &ldquo;We want to know the situation of every one of the people on the attached list&rdquo;.  They could send to the county registrar the electoral registers for all constituencies and the county registrar would be obliged to supply them with certified copies of all entries relating to everybody in a constituency.  That is not appropriate, because the credit-worthiness of a person and whether any property such person may have is subject to chattel mortgage are matters of great privacy. We have a tradition in this country of not disclosing matters of this kind to one's neighbour or to other people.  This power is a dangerous one and as I have said, we should be suspicious at all times in passing legislation of this sort and we should be suspicious of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would be a great deal more suspicious of a wide variety of banks exercising powers of this sort because we do not have direct control over them.  They are not acting on behalf of the Minister and their activities cannot be questioned by the Oireachtas whereas the Minister's can.  Yet we could have a recognised bank looking for an abstract of the entire register regardless of whether they had any interest in the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (c) the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture may obtain information in regard to the entire register.  We are aware that the Revenue Commissioners will be ininterested in the situation of farmers from the point of view of tax, and the Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Minister for Finance.  Is it not possible under this provision for the Minister for Finance to authorise one of the Revenue Commissioners to go along to inspect the register in relation to a number of farmers and that <Col N="233" /> people would know immediately the credit position of farmers?  I do not sympathise with farmers who try to evade tax but I insist that we should know whether this power can be exercised in the way I have suggested.</P>
    <P>Another question arises on subsection (8) under which the Minister for Justice may make regulations in regard to maintaining the secrecy of the register.  I suppose we have there an assurance that the Minister for Justice can prevent the possible abuses I have mentioned but, not knowing what is contained in these regulations, we have not got that assurance.  Therefore I should like the Minister to tell us about regulations the Minister for Justice has made in this matter.  It is no use laying such regulations before the House.  They should be subject to debate in the House and the normal 21-day sitting rule should not apply. I suggest there should be an amendment to subject the matters contained in subsection (8) (h) to the assent of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>On subsection (6) (a) and (c) in relation to access to the register, we must agree there is some protection there.  If banks were not given this freedom they would not be in a position to discover if properties concerned in loan applications were already mortgaged. There must be some provision so that banks can know whether properties in respect of which loans are being sought have been already mortgaged. The EEC are proposing more open registers on a national scale.  The powers here are no greater than those given under Revenue Commissioner statutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point that if there is a loan application the banks must know the credit situation.  However, I fear that under these provisions banks could make inquiries about people regardless of whether they had loan applications and they could accumulate a large dossier on people in a certain area. That would be an abuse of this power and it is possible under the law as it stands.  Therefore I suggest there is a good case for an amendment to limit <Col N="234" /> the powers in this respect to inquiring into the operation of a particular borrower only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Banks should not be allowed to use this provision to enable them to inspect the register and to get information on every person in the State.  I suggest it should be possible to draft an amendment limiting the power to cases where there have been applications for credit.  I suggest that the power should be restricted to instances where the bank could produce the loan application in the applicant's handwriting.  Such an amendment would not interfere with the operations of the banks who could say that the applicant must give a written request that he has looked for credit. The Minister did not deal with my point about the regulations which have been made by the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>This is a very natural request.  When you read the section and study it, you see the powers given <Col N="235" /> to any money-lending institution.  They can request the registrar to give information without giving reasons. Deputy Bruton is making a very reasonable request if it is not already covered by the Department of Justice. Any moneylender can ask the registrar to give him a list of a number of persons in his area about whom he wishes to get information on chattel mortgages.  He can build up this dossier for himself.  There should be some restrictions whereby he would have to give some reasons as to why he is asking for such information. This is very important.  The section should not be agreed to until we have such assurances.  I would not be prepared to agree to it until we have an assurance that it is covered by the Minister for Justice.</P>

He has not given us any indication that he would be prepared to introduce an amendment at a later stage to cover this matter if it is not covered by the regulations of the Minister for Justice. The House is entitled to an assurance from the Minister, or to the information. We have got neither yet.  I am looking now at section 26 (10) which refers to regulations made under section 24 of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1947, which will remain in force when <Col N="236" /> this Bill is enacted.

      <P>If the mortgagor under a specific chattel mortgage&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a) sells or otherwise transfers the ownership or possession of stock which is the subject of the mortgage without having given to the mortgagee at least 7 days' previous notice in writing of his intention to effect the sale or transfer, or</P>
      <P>(b) having sold or transferred the stock or any part thereof, does not within 7 days after the sale or transfer pay to the mortgagee all sums secured by the chattel mortgage or such lesser sum as the mortgagee may in writing agree to accept,</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, this provision is backward thinking.  There will be a certain amount of interference by the ACC in the running of farms. If there is a chattel mortgage on 30 or 40 cattle a farmer will be required to get authority from the ACC to sell seven or ten cattle.  That does not make sense.

      <P>It is there quite clearly in every section.  However, in reply to the Deputy's query regarding the difference between a floating and specific chattel mortgage, a specific chattel mortgage is for specific stock or machinery.  A floating charge is one that is taken on the stock from time to time on the land.  A farmer could buy in cattle and have a floating charge on them.  He could sell some of them and buy more and the floating charge transfers to the new cattle</P>

      <P>I wish to inquire about the conditions laid down in subsection (1).  I take it that they are enforceable in civil law between the borrower and the lender whereas if the conditions laid down in subsection (2) are breached they are criminal offences. It is only in respect of matters contained in subsection (2) that a fine would arise.  While accepting that subsection (1) (b) is a matter to be interpreted at civil law between two parties who would be more or less equal with no question of prosecution, I am wondering if the concept of fair and reasonable value as to the price at which goods must be sold is easily defined.

      <P>Deputy D'Arcy raised a question regarding a specific chattel mortgage and a floating chattel mortgage. I think this is an advantage to the borrower.  Am I correct in assuming that if I want to borrow for a specific item I get a mortgage on that item alone?  If I buy machinery and have a mortgage on that, my interpretation is that I have a specific mortgage on that item and it does not affect the rest of the farm.</P>

      <P>A floating mortgage is an entirely different matter.  A specific mortgage is for a specific item, whether stock or machinery, and a mortgage is taken on that only.  That is very important from the point of view of farmers.  I can see the point of the ACC having a check on a specific matter such as that to make sure that the person concerned does not dispose of what is mortgaged.  This does not affect the rest of the farm. I should like the Minister to let me know if I am correct in my interpretation.</P>

      <P>I should like some information regarding the type of regulations the Minister for Justice has been making as to the prescribed form contained in subsection (1) (b).  Subsection (4) states:</P>
      <P> The Minister for Justice may make regulations in relation to any matter referred to in this section as prescribed and &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; in this section means prescribed by such regulations.</P>

      <P>Another point was raised here when this Bill was discussed before&mdash;the sale of goods which have been seized.  I think it is relevant to this section.  It was suggested that the sale should always be by auction to ensure that the full value was obtained. However, there is provision whereby, if the auction is not successful, they may sell privately.  I suppose there is a slight danger they could be sold for under their real value in that situation.</P>

      <P>It is a question of whether or not the county sheriff knows sufficiently well how to sell them to get their maximum value.  Not being a businessman he might not sell them on the best market, for example, on as good a market as a farmer would <Col N="243" /> sell them.  We all appreciate that county sheriffs, for their sins, are lawyers.  They might not know the cattle market as well as others and might not know as well how to sell them or get the best value for them.</P>

      <P>I have no amendment to make.  I would merely ask the Minister to ensure that, in so far as he can, wisdom will prevail, that good market knowledge prevails on the part of sheriffs selling goods to ensure that the best value is obtained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an interesting provision here saying that so long as any money remains owing for principal or interest or costs on the security of a chattel mortgage, the mortgagee may between the hours of sunrise and sunset on any day on which a civil process may be served....  In other words a civil process must be served between sunrise and sunset.  I knew of a person some years ago who used to arrive home and, seeing the process server at his door, would look at his watch&mdash;he always used to carry around with him, because he was that sort of man, a little form which told him the official time of sunrise and sunset&mdash; wait at the corner of the street until ten seconds after official sunset, then <Col N="244" /> march in and the process server had to go home; there was nothing he could do.  That man continued on that merry way for the duration of his life.  He was able to do quite well, moved house a few times and was never really caught.</P>
      <P>I wonder what is the justification for stipulating between the hours of sunrise and sunset.  I suppose it is because one does not want people being disturbed in the middle of the night.  But the situation I have described is not a desirable one and should not be allowed to happen, that people should be able to evade their proper obligations in that way.</P>
      <P>Again I have no remedy to suggest. I wonder would the Minister consider the matter and see if something could be done.  I realise that primarily it is not a matter for him.  It is concerned with the whole question of debt collection which applies not merely to chattel mortgages but to all forms of civil process.  It is an area of law which might be examined.  Perhaps&mdash; and I say this very tentatively because there may be consequences&mdash;it should be referred to the Law Reform Commission to examine whether the debt collection procedures are fair to borrowers. There is the danger that some people quite unscrupulously can get away with a great deal in this field. Of course, the result of their activities is that their interest rates, expenses and so on are much higher on legitimate borrowers who do not force lenders to go to all the lengths necessary in order to comply with the terms of the law.  I should not like to see any change made in the law which would be detrimental to genuine borrowers having difficulty.  Perhaps a body such as the Law Reform Commission or the Committee on Court Practice and Procedures might examine this to see whether such matters as the hours of sunrise and sunset and other matters of law could be scrutinised to ensure that they are in line with modern practice.</P>

While money remains due on the security of such mortgage it creates a floating charge in the mortgagor's stock for the time being on the land to which the mortgage relates.

      <P>This section contains a provision whereby a mortgagor can have a floating chattel mortgage converted into a specific chattel mortgage. If the mortgagor defaults in payment or is in breach of other conditions of the mortgage the mortgagee must take an inventory of the stock on the land, serve notice in writing on the mortgagor declaring that the chattel mortgage has become fixed and within seven days send a copy of the notice and the inventory to the circuit court office or offices where the mortgage is registered.  The floating mortgage becomes fixed from the date of service of the notice.  All the provisions relating to specific mortgages then apply to it.

      <P>Am I correct in interpreting this to mean that this gives landlords suing for rent, rate collectors, or income tax people priority over the proceeds as well as the ability to initiate the proceedings?

The ACC were selfish in certain cases where they had a priority charge.  They will not allow a borrower to have a second charge taken out in the banks and at the same time they will not give some people sufficient money for their needs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This is a very far reaching section.  Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P> (1) Where a charge in favour of the Corporation for the repayment of a loan is registered as a burden affecting registered land, then, subject to subsections (2) and (3), the charge (including interest and the costs and expenses of all legal proceedings instituted by the Corporation for the purpose of realising the amount at any time owing on foot of the charge) shall as against the land be in priority to and shall override any equitable claim against the land.</P>
      <P>It seems that people who might not have notice of this registered charge and who would have equitable claims against the land if equities had not been discharged or if there was an equitable deposit of deeds someplace might have this equitable claim wiped out.  To be fair to the Minister, we are dealing with a highly technical area.  When one speaks about equitable deposits and claims one is getting into a very technical area; but at the same time if this is doing what I, a general practitioner, think it is, it is going very far.  It seems to me to be discharging equities the handy way or discharging equities without, in effect, going through the ordinary procedure which the Land Registry would normally require, that is notice to anybody who might have an equitable claim against the land.  If it is proposed to do away with the rights of people who have equitable claims without notice to them it is going too far and is unfair.  If the Minister has not the information now perhaps he could clarify the position on the Report Stage.</P>

If an insurance fund is being established to compensate people whose claims might be affected that is all right, but if there is no such insurance fund to compensate those people it is an infringement of the rights of property.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that if A is registered as owner of land subject to equities and if one of the equities is the right of a next of kin of a previous owner to a share in the land that next of kin is protected by what is known as the equity note.  It seems to me that this section means that the ACC take the other person in priority to the person whose claim is protected by the equity note.  If that is the case it is very high handed and is an infringement of the right of the next of kin who has a claim on the land.  If that is not so I would like an explanation on it.</P>

      <P>I see Deputy Fitzpatrick's point of view.  Even though the ACC get loans without having to go to all the bother of whether or not equities are discharged and all the other things that one has to go through to become the registered owner of a holding of land, I am afraid that in the west of Ireland that there are so many people who are not registered owners of their places that very few people would be able to get loans from the ACC.  Do the equities not guard the person who has a charge, even though the ACC give the loan and they are supposed to get the charge on it?  I believe that nothing can get past the Land Registry in regard to the registered owner.  I believe that if the case went to court the Land Registry and the equity charges that would be against the State would still hold against the ACC. It is a good thing to have the short cut in the Bill so that one has not to go to all the bother which one had to go through to get a loan from the county council to build a house. One had to become the registered owner of one's place before one could get the loan.  If one had to wait for all that to get an emergency loan to do something a lot of people would be left without the loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe if this was tested in court that the Minister would win out on the equities all the time if anybody had a charge against the land.  I believe that land registry is the way to become the registered owner.  I do not believe <Col N="256" /> anybody can take precedence over the registration.  This is a short cut that has been there and according to what the Minister says there has not been any trouble.  If anything is done to destroy this short cut a number of people will not be able to get loans.</P>

      <P>(<i>CavanMonaghan</i>): I agree with Deputy Callanan and the Minister that if the right is registered on the folio there is no problem.  It is there and nobody is seeking to take it away.  Let us take the case of A who was registered as owner of some land subject to equities and notwithstanding that he is so registered his brother, who had to go to England to earn a living and is only there four or five years, might own onethird of this farm and there is not any word about him on the folio.  A goes to the ACC to get a loan of £10,000 and the farm is worth £15,000.  The ACC look at it and say: &ldquo;You are the registered owner and we are not worried about equities.  We will give you £10,000 and your brother can go to hell.  We are not a bit concerned about whether or not he has a claim.&rdquo;  It is not even necessary to notify the brother in England.  Under this section his claim takes second place to the charge in favour of the ACC for £10 000.  I know that it might be impossible to get in touch with the brother and that if we were to serve notice on the brother it might hold up the thing in a ridiculous way and it might cause undue delay.  I believe an insurance fund should be established as there is in the Land Registry in the case of mistakes made by the registrar of title or some of his civil servants.  That insurance fund should be extended to cover cases such as those I have in mind.  I do not consider that unreasonable.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I would ask the Minister to look into this.  What is not understood is that there is in the Land Registry an absolute title.  If there is an absolute title the folio means what it says and the registered owner is registered against all comers, but there is also a limited title or a title subject to equities.  The title that is subject to equities means that A is registered subject to the rights of anybody who <Col N="258" /> has claims against that land and can prove them.  If one wishes in those circumstances to have the equity note discharged one must put in affidavits, tracing the title way back&mdash;it used to go back for 40 years but perhaps it is not quite so long now&mdash;and serving notice on anybody who can be claimed.  Then one gets an absolute title.  What I am afraid this is doing is confirming the taking away of those claims that are protected by the equity note.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am all in favour of cutting out red tape and delays, but the sensible way to get around this matter is to extend the insurance fund in order to protect the rights of anybody whose property is taken away by reason of this section.</P>
      <P>I disagree entirely with Deputy Callanan that, in the instance I took, the ACC would have to pay first the brother living in England or elsewhere. The very opposite is the effect of this section which means that that outstanding claim can be ignored and that the ACC would have to be paid first. In the event of anything being left over the brother living outside the country could claim it.  It would be reasonable to extend the fund which would have to be contributed to by the State, presumably.  We are told, though, by the Minister that the experience is that these claims very rarely arise.  Therefore, there should be little objection to extending the insurance fund.</P>
      <P>While it may be said that similar provision to that contained in this section has been in existence for the past 20 years or so without causing any trouble, now that we are reenacting the legislation, the time is opportune to review it and to improve it in order to copper-fasten the rights of genuine owners.</P>

      <P>I apologise both to the Chair and to the Deputy for my interruptions but I still contend that in the event of a man not having absolute title it is the ACC who are in trouble in the event of somebody making a claim against an estate that is being sold.  In other words, this section would not take precedence over an absolute title in the event of a sale. Therefore, the ACC are running that risk in facilitating people while not ascertaining the position regarding possible claimants to a holding.  As a public representative I have seen how these cases work out in practice.  They could prove to be bad bargaining on the part of the ACC.</P>

So far as the ACC are concerned their mortgages take priority over equitable claims.  I am in favour of that so that loans may be facilitated because for the one claim that might arise, hundreds of transactions could be delayed.  I am suggesting to the Minister that he should provide for the protection of claims of genuine equitable owners if their rights are destroyed and that that should be done by the insurance fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this section is designed to provide some measure of protection for people with an equitable interest in land in respect of which the ACC have a priority charge and that it provides also that the corporation will have priority in respect of other lands apart from those in respect of which the priority charge exists.  That is the effect of subsection (1).  Subsection (2) makes provision for the ACC to repay money to equitable claimants.  In what circumstances would the ACC repay money to equitable claimants?  I note also that they will pay interest on the repayments at rate applicable to the charge.  I should like a little more interpretation of that. Obviously, the appropriate rate of interest would be one which reflected the real depreciation in the value of money from the time at which the equitable claimant became entitled to something in the possession of the ACC and the time of payment.  There is the danger that the rate applicable to the charge, whatever that may mean, might not reflect the true situation of inflation.</P>
      <P>Section 40 (1) provides:</P>
      <P> A priority charge on registered land which is not a permanent improvement charge on the land shall as between the mortgagor and equitable claimants (other than the mortgagor) against the land be deemed to be charged on all and every (if any) estate and interest in the land to which the mortgagor was at the date of the registration of the priority charge or becomes at any time thereafter beneficially entitled in indemnification of all equitable claims against the land by equitable claimants other than the mortgagor.</P>
      <P>I should like to know the reason for the exclusion of a permanent improvement charge amongst the priority charges covered.  I should be interested to know the thinking behind that.</P>

I should be glad if he would explain the sort of situation in which a mortgagor would pay money to the corporation under subsection (2).  How would the situation arise in which a mortgagor, who would presumably be another person who had lent money to the person who owned the land upon which the ACC had a priority charge, would have to pay money to the ACC?  How would that arise and why?</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): All that presupposes that there is something left when the ACC are finished.  It reinforces my opinion that we should have the insurance fund.  Deputy Callanan thought that section 40 proved that what I was saying <Col N="262" /> is correct, that the ACC have priority under section 39 and section 40 is there to provide that as between the owner whose rights have been taken away by the ACC and the man who originally got the loan, the equitable claimant can follow to his heart's content the man who originally got the loan and the remainder of the land, that is, provided the ACC have not sold the farm leaving nothing behind. That is all the more reason why the simple device of the insurance fund should be included to protect this man and prevent him from chasing hares or moonbeams which he may never be able to catch.</P>

      <P>There is a slight difference between what is referred to in this section and in the other section.  I understand that if anyone else has a mortgage on the land the ACC have the first claim.  This is well known.  One must give deeds to the ACC and anyone else who gives a loan is a fool.  I mentioned the cooperatives yesterday when talking about what the ACC could do to help.  One does not get money from the ACC without giving the full deeds of all one's property.  We were talking earlier about someone who was not known to the ACC who had a claim on the land.  Anyone who gives a loan without getting the deeds is taking a calculated risk.  My deeds were with the county council while I got a county council loan.  I had no security; it was given away.  One does that of one's own free will and this is were the difference lies.  We were talking in one instance about someone who had not full title and then we were talking about someone who gave a loan without getting security in the form of deeds.  I am open to contradiction but I think that is the position.</P>

A typical case arises where the Land Commission have decided to allot a particular holding to an individual <Col N="264" /> and have permitted him to start using the land, subject to the payment of a rent, before he is finally registered as owner of the land, a process which may take several years.

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): What this section is doing is applying section 39 to land which is not registered but is subject to the payment of an annuity.  There is a great deal of such land and the fact that a person is paying an annuity does not mean at all that he owns the land.  In some cases it is the auctioneer's name that goes on the receivable order if he pays the annuity, but that does not mean the auctioneer <Col N="266" /> owns the land.  What the Minister is saying here is that, if the land is not registered and an annuity is being paid to the Land Commission, the Land Commission will issue a certificate to the effect that the person paying the annuity is in possession of the land and then the ACC can give a mortgage. The ACC cannot take priority over all and sundry and the arguments I made in favour of extending the insurance fund to section 39 cases applies here with far greater force because the person who gets himself registered in the Land Registry, subject to equities, is likely to have some interest in the land but a person could be noted just as a squatter who had not acquired even a squatter's title.</P>

      <P>Is the Government still claiming, as it claimed in June 1977 when in Opposition according to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i>, that there are 160,000 people unemployed?  The recent White Paper said that there were 107,000 unemployed.  Is the Government claiming now that since June 1977 they created 53,000 new jobs?</P>

      <P>The 107,000 refers to those who are registered as unemployed. There is an unknown number of people who do not register for <Col N="267" /> one reason or another and it is difficult to estimate.  Our estimate of 160,000 was as accurate as we could make it at the time.</P>

      <P>I have had discussions with and have sought the views of the Medico-Social Research Board and the Council on the Status of Women on this question.  I had a meeting with the Irish Medical Association during which they conveyed to me their views on the issues involved.</P>

      <P>This kind of answer is simply evading the issue.  Is the Minister aware that since 1974, since the McGee decision in the Supreme Court, the law has been defective, and refusing to act and correct this matter in the Dáil is simply compounding the irresponsible and cowardly decision of the previous Government?  Is the Minister not acting in exactly the same way?  This is an urgent and important matter and the Minister has the power to do something, so why does he not do it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is completely misinterpreting the situation. This Government recognise that the present state of the law and the situation generally is unsatisfactory and because it recognises that, it has firmly decided to legislate to deal with the situation.  Prior to legislating I am endeavouring to get the considered views of those who are in a position to offer guidance and advice in this very sensitive, delicate area, which is a wise thing for me to do as a legislator. I must get the widest possible spectrum of views on this issue before I bring the proposals before my colleagues in Government.  The Deputy cannot possibly regard that procedure as irresponsible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister sought legal advice on the power of the health boards to undertake this work without changing the legislation at all?  If they have this power would he not consider it a lot simpler and better politically for his party and his Government if the health boards would undertake this task without any changes?  Would he not also consider that it might be part of the public health programme that this be undertaken without changing legislation?</P>

With regard to the barracking from Deputy Browne, he and I probably differ in our approach.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>Discussions were commenced in 1976 between officers of my Department and representatives of the firm of Hoffman La Roche on the question of the price levels in Ireland of certain of the firm's products, which had been considerably higher than the United Kingdom levels for some years previously.  Although this price differential has been progressively reduced, the firm agreed, in the light of the disparity in earlier years in prices and in the interest of continuing good relationships, to donate four computerised analysers to hospitals in this country. These machines were installed in St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, the Regional Hospital, Limerick and Ardkeen Hospital, Waterford, in the period July to September 1977.  They are machines used for the automated analysis of specimens.  The price of the four machines would come to about £220,000.</P>
      <P>This arrangement had been negotiated before I became Minister for Health but I have looked over the papers relating to it and I am satisfied that a reasonable compromise was made.  The question of the reasonableness of the prices charged for the drugs involved was not easy to determine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the one hand, reductions in prices in the United Kingdom had at one time left a wide disparity between the level of prices there and in Ireland but in recent years the prices in the United Kingdom had risen while those for Ireland had remained static for about five years and had thus become relatively favourable.  I am also aware that during the period under discussion (1972 to 1977) price levels <Col N="274" /> in other EEC countries and elsewhere for the drugs in question were considerably higher than in the United Kingdom and Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if medical cards held by pensioners and widows have been taken up for review; and, if so, if he will ensure their speedy return so as not to inflict undue hardship on the holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy's question relates to medical card holders who are in receipt of non-contributory old age and widows' pensions.  Medical cards for those are not taken up for review but continuing eligibility may be checked periodically without taking up the card.</P>
      <P>In the Eastern Health Board area medical cards for such old age pensioners are not reviewed regularly but are issued on a long-term basis, covering a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if there is any truth in the reports <Col N="281" /> which have been circulating in some papers that owners of those cards were being asked in many instances to fill up complicated forms which many of them were incapable of filling and that, in the event of their not filling those forms, the cards were being held from them indefinitely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the card is coming towards the end of its period of validity the holder of that card would be issued with a form some time before the expiration of its validity and asked to complete the form, but the card would not be taken up pending the completion of the form.  If the Deputy suggests some of these forms are too complicated, that is something I will certainly take note of because in all these areas we are endeavouring to simplify these forms to the greatest possible extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    <P>The total numbers who received institutional <Col N="282" /> assistance in each of the last three years were: 1975&mdash;21,215; 1976&mdash;21,625; 1977&mdash;19,754.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has seen a report of the massive increase in the numbers of admissions of whooping cough cases to Clonskeagh Fever Hospital, Dublin; and if, in the light of this, he is satisfied that the immunisation campaign carried out by his Department is adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report to which the Deputy refers and indeed I should say that I am aware of the increased incidence of whooping cough in the community generally in 1977.</P>
      <P>The availability of a vaccination against this disease is widely known and the service for giving it widely publicised.  There has been, as the Deputy knows, considerable controversy about this particular vaccine which has obviously had its effect on the uptake of the vaccination and, in that context, I have been advised that efforts to advocate it to parents by way of an advertising campaign would be likely to be counter-productive.  Nevertheless, it remains a recommended preventive medical procedure by my Department where no contra-indications exist in individual cases and, in the last analysis, it must remain to parents to decide whether they will avail themselves of the procedure after the necessary medical consultation or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there is considerable public concern and fear about having children vaccinated against whooping cough, would the Minister's Department consider initiating a programme of public <Col N="285" /> education to explain the incidence of brain damage post-whooping cough vaccination and the dangers of whooping cough itself?  If the Minister were to initiate this programme of public education and also give an assurance to the parents that, where there were contra indications, there would be no pressure on them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am asking the Minister to have his Department issue a statement to the effect that, in specific cases where there would be a danger, they would advise against vaccination and in this way they would allay public suspicion and encourage greater participation in the programme.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of patients presently housed in the temporary structures in St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, County Dublin; the length of time these structures have been in existence; and the plans his Department have for the final resolution of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of patients in the buildings known as the temporary buildings is now 191.  These buildings were erected in 1890.  Their use will be phased out by the Eastern Health Board over the next few years and in the meantime maintenance works have been carried out to the buildings.</P>
      <P>The plans include the transfer of 70 of these patients to a new unit which was recently completed.  When certain other improvement works at the hospital have been completed later this year, a further 30 can be moved out and the conversion of 12 houses in the hospital grounds into hostels will accommodate another 60 of the patients who are now in the temporary buildings.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider visiting Portrane and the temporary buildings at the hospital? They were built as temporary buildings in 1890 but now they accommodate mentally retarded adults.  The conditions in which they live are deplorable.  In one case there is one toilet for 96 women.  I would also ask the Minister to look at the files in this case.  In 1971 a former Minister for Health, the late Mr. Childers, promised that the temporary structures would be abolished that year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to give this figure with any accuracy. The number is likely to be quite small, however, because persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts, who constitute the great majority of those with limited eligibility, do not figure in it.  All insured persons who were eligible because their earnings came within the £3,000 limit in July 1976 are still eligible, irrespective of any subsequent change in their earnings.  I should add that any person who no longer satisfies the standard criteria of eligibility may still qualify for services without charge if the chief executive <Col N="291" /> officer of the relevant health board considers that payment for the required service would involve hardship.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that there is a need for a two-fold increase in the present number of public nurses. The working group which surveyed the workload of public health nurses recommended in 1975 that the number of such health nurses employed by the health boards should be 1,152. The number of posts at present is 1,045.  My aim is to reach the number recommended by the working group within two years.  To this end I have approved of two extra training courses in Cork and Galway and this allows for doubling the intake of trainees.</P>

The extent to which drugs are prescribed and dispensed at these <Col N="295" /> clinics varies from area to area.  In recent years the practice, which I am anxious to encourage, is developing whereby patients attend for only a limited period at the psychiatric clinic and are then referred back to their family doctor for continuing treatment.

      <P>While no survey of the aged living alone has been undertaken by my Department a number of surveys relating to old people have been undertaken on both a national and on a local basis.  For example, in 1976 the Society of St. Vincent de Paul initiated a survey on old people living alone; the Economic and Social Research Institute expect to publish a preliminary report on the economic circumstances of the elderly in June next and surveys on nutritional requirements and health of old people are in hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that since 1966 arrangements have existed for each public health nurse to compile and keep up-to-date a register of old people resident in her district.  This procedure was <Col N="296" /> endorsed in 1975 by the working group which reviewed the workload of public health nurses.  The needs of the elderly are given a special priority by health boards.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 to 33 inclusive, together.  There are some, 1,800 places in the nurse training schools in this country for general nursing and for psychiatric nursing.  Most of the training in general nursing is carried out in the voluntary hospitals.  The number of places available is considered sufficient to meet the needs of the nursing services in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> There is very keen competition for places in the nurse training schools specially those for general nursing and some applicants who are not successful in getting places here go to the United Kingdom to do training.  Some of the nurses who train here emigrate after completion of their training and equally some nurses who are trained elsewhere subsequently return here to take up nursing.</P>
    <P>The position is kept under review but, in general, there does not appear to be any need at the present time for increasing the number of training places.  At present a working party are examining the role and education of nurses, including recruitment policies, and I expect to have a report from that working party by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Information is not available as to the number of girls who having failed to get places in nurse training schools in this country, go to the United Kingdom for training.  I am informed that approximately 600 nurses originally <Col N="298" /> registered in the United Kingdom applied in the past year for registration on the Irish register kept by An Bord Altranais.  This does not necessarily mean that they took up nursing in this country but it does indicate that they were interested in applying for posts here.</P>
    <P>As regards ensuring that Irish girls who fail their nursing examinations in British teaching hospitals are informed of the reasons for such failure, I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to make representations on this matter.  I have no reason to believe that these girls find it difficult to ascertain the reasons for their failure.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a table showing, for each health board, the number of applications for nurse training received and the number of places available in each of the past three years.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first budget to be introduced since this Government returned to power.  It is firmly based on our election manifesto and represents the initial stages of implementing the strategy for economic and social progress set out in that manifesto and further developed in the recently published White Paper on National Development, 1977-80.</P>
      <P>This budget is of particular significance because it is the first for a number of years to be set in the context of a formal and positive commitment to medium-term planning.  It is crucial to our plans to revitalise the economy and set it on a path of faster, self-sustained growth.  The increased public expenditure and the tax concessions for which it provides will give an impetus to economic activity and help create the conditions under which the private sector can take over as the engine of growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial" RHead="Statement, Budget, 1978. - The economy in 1977">
    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - The economy in 1977</Title>
    <P>Last year, we achieved the highest growth rate in the EEC and the second highest in the OECD.  The economy <Col N="350" /> expanded by over 5 per cent&mdash;twice the EEC average and well above the OECD average of 3½ per cent.</P>
    <P>The Economic Background to the budget, which was published on 24 January, gives a detailed review of the economy in 1977 and I do not propose to dwell at length on that topic today. Growth apart, the most notable development in 1977 was the dramatic fall in inflation.  The annual average fell from 18 per cent in 1976 to 13½ per cent last year.  Even more significant was the fall in the 12 months to mid-November, when prices rose by less than 11 per cent, compared with over 20 per cent in the 12 months to mid-November 1976.</P>
    <P>There was also useful progress in raising employment and in tackling unemployment.  Because of our rapidly growing labour force, a reduction in unemployment requires a much greater increase in employment.  Last year, non-agricultural employment was about 12,000 higher than in 1976, while on a seasonally adjusted basis the Live Register figure of unemployment fell by about 6,000 in the second half of 1977.</P>
    <P>Strong investment, strong growth in industrial exports, as well as in private consumption, were notable features of 1977.  The growth in industrial investment and exports&mdash;the latter rising by over 17 per cent in volume for the second year in succession&mdash;is particularly encouraging.  The balance of payments deficit remained reasonable, at about £160 million.  Buoyant tourism, yielding a large surpus on invisible trade, was a major contributory factor.</P>
    <P>The strong private capital inflow resulting from the rising trend in industrial investment contributed to the increase of £245 million in the reserves during 1977, bringing them to £1,200 million by the end of the year.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement," RHead="Budget, 1978. - Review of 1977 Budget Outturn">
    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Review of 1977 Budget Outturn</Title>
    <P>These were the more important economic indicators for 1977.  I might appropriately at this stage deal with last year's budget&mdash;which still had half of its course to run when the present Government took office.  The outturn figures on both current and capital account were close to the <Col N="351" /> original estimates.  Allowing for the reclassification of certain items of expenditure, which has already been referred to both in the Estimates volume and in the Public Capital Programme booklet, and on which I shall speak in more detail later on, the deficit on current account was £201 million compared with the original estimate of £220 million; expenditure on the public capital programme was £659 million, or only £3 million short of the estimate.  These small variations, however, concealed a number of significant changes in individual items of revenue and expenditure.  Immediately we took office, the ban on public service recruitment was lifted and new job-creation in the public sector got under way rapidly in the second half of 1977, with particular emphasis on recruitment of extra gardaí and teachers; the system of marriage differentiation in public service pay scales was abolished with effect from 1 July 1977; capital spending on roads, local improvement schemes and environmental works was expanded and effective measures were taken to ensure that there would be no repeat of the massive underspending of capital allocations which was a feature of the previous year.  In the event, there was an increase of 20.3 per cent in public capital programme expenditure over the 1976 level.  I might single out for special mention the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the increased demand for whose services accounted for an excess of £20 million.</P>
    <P>Even with the additional manifestorelated spending and some other excesses which had not been budgeted for, there was a total saving of £73 million on current expenditure.  The bulk of the saving was on the cost of servicing debt and was due to the fall in interest rates and the improved performance of sterling.  The lower level of unemployment also led to a saving on social welfare costs.</P>
    <P>The expenditure saving was nearly matched by a shortfall of £54 million on the budget estimate of revenue, some of it intentional and deriving from post-budget policy changes. The removal by this Government of <Col N="352" /> motor vehicle duties from all cars up to and including 16 horse-power cost about £13 million.  Secondly, there was the modification, by the previous Government, of their policies for the taxation of farming profits which accounted for a further £20 million or more and will also affect the yield in future years.  Reductions in excise duties from tobacco and in VAT receipts accounted for most of the balance of the shortfall.</P>
    <P>The net result of these variations was that the current budget deficit fell by £19 million.  The small saving of £3 million on public capital programme spending, together with some other variations in capital resources led to a net reduction of £9 million in the borrowing requirement on capital account.  In all, therefore, the Exchequer borrowing requirement was reduced by £28 million, from £573 million, as originally estimated, to £545 million.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement," RHead="Budget, 1978. - Exchequer financing in 1977">
    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Exchequer financing in 1977</Title>
    <P>The 1977 borrowing requirement of £545 million was about 10.2 per cent of GNP, a reduction on the 1976 figure of 11.3 per cent.  While these percentages are high by EEC standards they represent a considerable improvement on the 1975 position when the borrowing requirement was 16.3 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Net receipts from sales of Government securities on the domestic market, at £408 million, financed three-quarters of the total borrowing requirement. The most satisfactory feature of this was the record level of sales to the non-bank public, which is a clear indication of confidence in our economy &mdash;an expression of confidence which was reinforced by the fact that a large part of the investment came from abroad.  It may to some extent also reflect a certain lack of suitable investment opportunities in the private sector.  Sales of Government securities to our domestic banks also increased substantially.</P>
    <P>The market in Irish gilts has grown dramatically in recent years and leads us to look with some confidence to this source to finance much of our development over the next few years. <Col N="353" /> However, the particularly buoyant sales during the past year may not be repeated because of increasing investment opportunities in the private sector.</P>
    <P>There were significant reductions in Irish interest rates during 1977, thereby encouraging investment in the main sectors of the economy.  International rates showed some signs of firming towards the latter part of the year and the indications are that movements will be moderate in the period ahead.  Taken in conjunction with the reduction in inflation, this should provide a more favourable environment for investment than has been experienced in the recent past.</P>
    <P>Small savings through the Post Office and Trustee Savings Banks in 1977, at £102 million, also showed a very big increase on the previous year's figure of £53 million.  Together with sales of domestic securities, they financed almost the entire borrowing requirement.</P>
    <P>The only foreign public loan raised by the Irish Government in 1977 was a successful issue of Yen Bonds on the Tokyo capital market.  This issue was proceeded with as much for economic and trade reasons as for the funds it provided.  The balance of direct external borrowing consisted mainly of loans from the European Investment Bank for specific capital projects.  The $300 million credit arranged in 1976 was not called on because of the success in raising funds domestically.  The credit has been renegotiated on much better terms having regard to the more favourable conditions now available on the international syndicated credit market and it will be available towards the financing needs of 1978.</P>
    <P>Monetary policy for 1977 was framed with the aims of accommodating economic recovery and of contributing to a further reduction in the rate of inflation, thus establishing a secure base for employment expansion. Though final figures are not yet to hand, the indications are that bank credit to the private sector during 1977 was broadly in line with projections. This growth was assisted by considerable inflows of capital through the banking system, which in part related <Col N="354" /> to industrial investment.</P>
    <P>Another favourable factor was the record savings which accrued to building societies during the year.  This enabled £120 million to be provided for the housing programme.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement," RHead="Budget, 1978. - Economic prospects for 1978">
    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Economic prospects for 1978</Title>
    <P>We enter 1978 with industrial output rising faster than its trend rate for the past decade and with considerable buoyancy in both the agricultural and services sectors.  Employment is increasing, although more slowly than I would wish.  There has been notable success in the campaign to reduce inflation. The decline in the exchange rate added considerably to our problems over the past few years, because of the pressure it put on our consumer prices through rising import prices. This decline has now been reversed and the exchange rate should not move far from its present level during 1978.</P>
    <P>The outlook for world economic activity is only marginally encouraging, even if the major economies do not falter in their aim to achieve faster growth.  The EEC Council of Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs and the European Council have both endorsed a strategy proposed by the Commission which is intended to increase the Community growth rate to 4 to 4½ per cent in 1978.  There should be expansion in our foreign markets of much the same order as last year.  However, competition abroad will be tougher, given the present degree of industrial spare capacity internationally and the stronger currency position.  This need not necessarily be worrying.  Experience in 1977 has shown that, if income increases are moderate and competitiveness is thereby increased, we can substantially increase our market share.  I am confident that, with the co-operation of the social partners, we can repeat this performance : growth in industrial exports can reach double figures again in 1978 and the Government target of 7 per cent growth for the economy can be achieved.</P>
    <P>If income increases are in line with the manifesto target of about 5 per cent, the Government's taxation reliefs and other proposals will result in a <Col N="355" /> significant increase in purchasing power.  This, allied with the boost to consumer confidence from the reduction in the rate of inflation, should ensure that private consumption will contribute to the improvement in economic growth.  The year-on-year increase in consumer prices should be in single figures by mid-February for the first time since 1972.  It should reach 7 per cent during the year in accordance with the manifesto target.</P>
    <P>The buoyancy of domestic demand, together with the increase in public capital expenditure, should lead to a rise in domestic investment.  The improvement in competitiveness resulting from the Government's economic proposals should also stimulate investment in the exporting sector and lay the foundation for the continued export-led growth which is vital for the White Paper employment targets.</P>
    <P>Any grand strategy to combat major problems can raise other questions. We have paid particular attention to the balance of payments and its effects on our reserves position.  We possess substantial reserves.  At £1,200 million they are equivalent to over 4½ months imports; but excessive growth in consumption would rapidly run them down.  With the growing domestic and external confidence in our economy, the external reserves should benefit from an acceleration in the rate of private capital inflows, particularly for investment projects, so that a balance of payments deficit of £350-£400 million for 1978, while large, is nevertheless supportable.  It is a factor which we shall continue to watch carefully.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Incomes</Title>
    <P>As I have said, 1978 could be a very good year, with fast growth, increased employment and much lower inflation.  But this depends on us as a community; we could equally turn it into a year of lost opportunity. Moderation in income increases is of crucial importance to the Government's programme for economic and social improvement.  If developments in 1978 were on the wrong lines we would compound our unemployment and inflation problems and the targets <Col N="356" /> of the White Paper could not be met.  Given the scale of our unemployment problem and the prospective growth of our labour force, 1978 must be a year of determined and fast progress.</P>
    <P>It is essential therefore that the increase in incomes this year be a moderate one.  The primary reason is, of course, that the growth in our output and employment depends mainly on our ability to sell what we produce.  If incomes grow too fast, so do costs, and we could price ourselves out of our markets, both home and export.  Excessive increase in costs also hit employment by making this country less attractive as a manufacturing location at a time when the competition for investment is exceptionally keen.  The logic of the argument is inescapable : if we are permanently to reduce unemployment and to create viable employment, we must restrain our costs and, therefore, growth in our incomes.</P>
    <P>This argument holds with particular force at the present time.  We could hardly pick a worse year than this to quicken the pace of increase of incomes and prices.  Firstly, international competition will be tougher than in recent years.  Secondly, the fall in the exchange rate has been reversed, so that the effects of any lessening in our competitiveness will hit us all the more quickly.  Only the economically suicidal would decide that 1978 was the year to dispense with moderation in incomes.</P>
    <P>All sections of the community have learned the danger of inflation.  We came to the brink of hyper-inflation some years back, and we had the sense to step back.  We have made some progress since then but the Government do not feel that it is fast enough.  The manifesto package aims at reducing inflation to 7 per cent in 1978.  The latest indications, which are supported by forecasts from independent sources, are that the target of 7 per cent is well within reach if the Government's pay target is accepted.  The reduction in inflation is all-important to bring us in line with our EEC partners with whom we trade, but we cannot hope to achieve this target if incomes rise excessively.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Finance, I am <Col N="357" /> acutely conscious of the purchasing power of money.  The Government's obligations as an employer and commitments in regard to the weaker sections of the community are directly reflected in rising public expenditure. Every 1 per cent increase in pay rates adds some £8 million to the Exchequer's annual pay bill.  This money would have to be diverted from other pressing needs; if it were used for job creation, it could finance almost 2,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>I cannot stress too strongly that we are not against real increases in incomes and living standards.  We believe that people should live better. We also see the need for increases in real incomes to expand consumer demand so as to increase the domestic market for our producers.  What is of importance is how these advances are achieved.</P>
    <P>Excessive increases in money incomes would only lead to a transitory rise in real incomes.  Higher prices would quickly erode any real gain enjoyed for a time by those fortunate enough to retain their jobs.  Increased costs would mean a loss of existing jobs for others, leading to additional social welfare expenditure and, consequently, increased taxation.  The result would be to depress the economy further.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that improvements in real incomes are best secured in present circumstances through moderate increases in nominal incomes associated with personal tax concessions.  For the year 1978 our target is for pay increases of about 5 per cent.  To make this acceptable, we have already reduced or abolished rates, motor taxation and social insurance contributions and are proposing concessions in personal taxation&mdash;concessions which will result in substantial gains in after-tax pay for wage and salary earners.  Adjusting for the expected rise in consumer prices this year, there will be a considerable improvement in real take-home pay, and this will be a lasting improvement, not an illusory one.</P>
    <P>I should like to clarify aspects of the pay target proposed by the Government. The target was formulated <Col N="358" /> only after careful and detailed examinations of the requirements of the economy in both the short and medium-term.  Demands for flexibility and for adjustments in line with inflation have to accommodate themselves to the need for pay moderation.  The Government's commitment is unequivocal and, if agreement to such moderation cannot be achieved, we shall have to take the necessary measures to ensure that excessive increases, if any, are recovered from those who secure them.  The Government would be failing the community if they did not take such steps.</P>
    <P>Of course, corrective measures could not completely eliminate the damage to the economy from excessive income increases.  No feasible Government action could prevent some rise in costs and, as a consequence, loss of markets and rising unemployment.</P>
    <P>I am naturally hopeful, however, that this situation will not arise, but if it does and as soon as it does I shall come back to the Dáil with proposals to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Government appreciate the difficulties which face the represeneatives of both employers and trade unions who are at present seeking to negotiate a new national agreement. Such negotiations are never an easy matter.  This year they are made more difficult by the tensions which inevitably build up during a period of economic recession and its attendant constraints on incomes, employment and opportunity.  Nonetheless I am quite sure that the social partners appreciate that their restraint was not in vain.  The proof of this is to be seen in the fall in prices over the last six months and in the opportunities for an attack on unemployment which are now presented to us if a moderate agreement for 1978 is achieved.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Job creation</Title>
    <P>When we took office we already had a well-developed strategy to cope with the economic and budgetary situation which confronted us.</P>
    <P>Despite the resumption of economic growth there was, and is, no prospect that unchanged budgetary policy would, of itself, be sufficient to bring <Col N="359" /> about a large reduction in unemployment, or to cut the rate of inflation to an acceptable level.  The huge increase in unemployment since 1974 has had a direct impact on the budget by forcing up the cost of government services, through social welfare payments and by reducing the buoyancy of revenue.  It has been one of the main contributors to the high Exchequer borrowing which has been incurred in recent years.</P>
    <P>Thus, while the Exchequer borrowing requirement as a proportion of GNP had by end-1976 come down from its mid-recession peak, there was little prospect of any further significant reduction until such time as the problems of unemployment and inflation had been adequately tackled.</P>
    <P>The choice facing the Government was clear&mdash;either to take immediate action to restore balance to the public finances or to tackle unemployment and inflation boldly as a first priority. To give priority, in the short-term, to achieving a further substantial reduction in borrowing would have involved a severely deflationary budgetary stance which could only increase unemployment yet again, and might well destroy the basis for renewed growth in the economy.  It would, indeed, have been self-defeating from a budgetary point of view since rising unemployment would depress revenue and add to expenditure and borrowing.  It would have meant indefinite deferment of the most clearcut and pressing national objective&mdash;that of providing employment for as many people as possible as quickly as possible.  The Government chose instead to tackle unemployment and inflation head-on through this budget and the other measures implemented since taking office.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Budget 1977 job-creation package</Title>
    <P>Our predecessors had introduced a £55 million package involving direct job-creation and employment incentives in the January 1977 budget.  We welcomed this while in Opposition; our criticism was directed at the delay in introducing such measures.  Far from discarding it, therefore, we wished to <Col N="360" /> see it pursued to a successful conclusion and I issued instructions to that effect to the spending agencies concerned. In spite of this, a substantial shortfall, which the end-June review by the Department of Finance had shown to be in prospect, emerged at £12.5 million by the end of the year. In particular, only £0.8 million of the £4.35 million provided for schemes of employment premiums was actually spent&mdash;realising just over 4,000 jobs to end-1977&mdash;far short of the 11,000 envisaged to end-February 1978.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget," RHead="1978. - Job-creation measures introduced since July 1977">
    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Job-creation measures introduced since July 1977</Title>
    <P>Clearly these measures did not go far enough.  An altogether more radical approach was required&mdash;wide-ranging job-creation by direct Government action combined with a systematic assault on the factors which frustrate growth in output and employment in the economy.  On assuming office, the Government had a clear view of their priorities in this regard.  Our mandate was unambiguous&mdash;get the country moving again and provide more employment.</P>
    <P>We set ourselves specific short-term job-creation targets.  These were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;10,000 extra jobs in the public sector for which we proposed to allocate £50 million</P>
    <P>&mdash;5,000 extra jobs and £30 million investment in the building and construction sector</P>
    <P>&mdash;5,000 extra jobs from spending £20 million on youth employment projects.</P>
    <P>No time was lost in setting about the task.  Department and State-sponsored agencies were directed to give priority to the identification of worthwhile job opportunities capable of early implementation. Suggestions were invited from the public : their views are always welcome.  Notwithstanding the difficulty attached to drawing up and implementing expenditure plans in the second half of a budget year, we were sucessful to the extent that by the end of 1977 more than 5,000 jobs had actually materialised under the Government's job-creation strategy.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to <Col N="361" /> the attainment of the target of direct creation of 20,000 jobs is firm.  Job-creation spending was given top priority in settling the 1978 departmental allocations.  With the exception of provisions made for implementation of other manifesto commitments, to which I shall refer later, expenditure on many on-going services was sharply curtailed and in some cases actually reduced in order to contribute to the funds required for job-creation.  The Government's programme can be viewed under three main headings&mdash;public sector, building and construction and youth.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement," RHead="Budget, 1978. - Job-creation&mdash;public sector">
    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Job-creation&mdash;public sector</Title>
    <P>By the end of 1977 a total of almost 4,700 new public sector posts had been created since the Government assumed office.  Over 2,000 of these jobs have actually been filled at a cost to the Exchequer of almost £2.5 million in 1977.</P>
    <P>About 2,000 of the new posts created arose in the civil service&mdash; mainly in the prisons service and for telephone development and revenue collection.  As many as 900 new posts have been created in the teaching service and 890 in the health services.  An increase of 500 in the strength of the Garda Síochána has been authorised.</P>
    <P>The impetus of job-creation in the public sector will be maintained through 1978.  I have made provision for a further 6,560 posts, bringing the total number of new posts to be approved since July last to almost 11,250.  The financial provision contained in the 1978 Estimates for all of these posts is £26 million and the full year cost is about £40 million.</P>
    <P>The new posts to be created in 1978 arise mainly in the health services where 2,400 extra jobs will be provided. In addition, about 2,350 jobs will be created in the education sector and 1,250 in the civil service, again mainly in the areas I have already indicated.</P>
    <P>The public sector job-creation target of 10,000 extra jobs will, therefore, be exceeded by some 1,250 posts.  The posts involved are new in that they do not include provision for filling vacancies in existing staff complements.  The <Col N="362" /> Government have been careful to avoid indiscriminate post creation simply to achieve a numerical target.  All of the posts are related to specific and urgent needs&mdash;reducing overcrowding in schools, security, improving the quality of the health services or enabling essential civil service tasks to be discharged.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget," RHead="1978. - Job-creation&mdash;building and construction">
    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Job-creation&mdash;building and construction</Title>
    <P>Having regard to the importance for employment of the building and construction industry, the Government, inside two weeks of taking office, allocated additional funds for increased investment in roads and sanitary services, local improvement schemes and environmental works.  Provision was also made for minor improvement works at vocational schools and for a start on the new Beaumont hospital.  Expenditure recorded on these schemes by end-1977 amounted to £5 million and jobs realised amounted to 2,170&mdash;1,670 of these are direct jobs.  When account is also taken of the massive boost to output and employment in the construction industry as a result of the increased SDA loan and income limits and the scheme of grants for first-time purchasers of new houses, total additional employment realised at end-1977 is estimated at 3,170 direct and indirect jobs.</P>
    <P>The real impetus to construction activity in 1978 will, however, be provided by special allocations made for this purpose in the departmental Estimates published last week.  A total of £43.2 million has been allocated for projects involving increased spending on building and construction with a direct job potential of almost 5,000. These include £12.6 million on educational and hospital building involving an additional 1,070 jobs; £11.5 million for increased spending by the IDA on factory building and site development which will provide extra jobs for 1,100 workers and £4.25 million on water supply and sewerage schemes involving a further 800 jobs.</P>
    <P>Thus £48.2 million will be spent between 1977 and 1978 on creating more than 6,600 building and con <Col N="363" /> struction jobs.  These figures are in respect of direct job-creation and do not, therefore, include associated indirect employment to be provided in, for example, the building materials sector.  Additionally, the increased SDA loan and income limits and new house grants schemes will generate about 1,500 direct and indirect jobs in a full year.  In all, 1978 public capital expenditure allocations affecting the building and construction industry amount to £458 million&mdash;£86 million more than in 1977.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial" RHead="Statement, Budget, 1978. - Youth employment">
    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Youth employment</Title>
    <P>The Government regard youth employment as a critical and priority issue.  Demographic changes now under way in this country are of immense importance for employment generally and for the employment of youth in particular.  The 1975 EEC labour force sample survey showed that almost 50 per cent of the total population is under 25.  Unemployment in this age group in 1975 constituted almost 44 per cent of total unemployment even though the labour force under 25 years of age represented only 30 per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>Any government which did not respond to this problem would not be doing their duty.  It is to the young people of this country that we look for a spirit of enterprise and innovation.</P>
    <P>Our special concern for young people has already been made evident. I am providing a special allocation of £5 million to-day to finance schemes for youth employment.  Apart from substantially increasing the number of training opportunities with AnCO, which is expected to have a through-put of 15,500 in 1978, and greatly improving the employment incentive scheme so far as it applies to the employment of school leavers, we have taken the innovative step of setting up the Employment Action Team to devise schemes to stimulate youth employment. The Government have already examined and passed a number of schemes put forward by the team and these will now be implemented.</P>
    <P>These schemes are as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" />&mdash;A Work Experience Programme</P>
    <P>&mdash;An Environmental Improvement Schemes Programme</P>
    <P>&mdash;The recruitment of 150 first-year construction industry apprentices by local authorities, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;The provision of financial assistance towards the cost of a community-based survey relating to unemployment problems in the Ballyfermot area, with a view to the possibility of further assistance for similar projects.</P>
    <P>The team will also have the job of monitoring and advising on quick implementation of these schemes.</P>
    <P>In all, I estimate that special employment schemes targeted specifically at young people will generate 5,000 jobs.  Of course, many of the total of almost 18,000 extra jobs to be created by direct Government action in building and construction and in the public sector will be filled by young people. As a result of this and the other stimulatory measures I am announcing to-day, I am confident that our young people will quickly find new opportunities opening up for them which will allow them to play their full and proper role in national development.</P>

    <P>The job-creation initiatives that the Government have taken since assuming office and which I have outlined above bring the total number of jobs to be created by direct Government action to 22,860, or well in excess of the 20,000 promised in our manifesto.

    <P>In speaking about youth employment I touched on the employment incentive scheme.  The provision in the 1978 Estimates for the scheme is £7 million compared with actual expenditure of £0.8 million last year.  I should like to remind employers that the improvements which have been <Col N="365" /> made in this scheme make the employment of extra workers an ex-tremely attractive proposition for employers wishing to expand output.  The premium payable for school leavers has been increased from £10 to £14 a week.  The scope of the main scheme, under which a premium of £20 a week is payable, has also been extended substantially&mdash;to hotels and to the catering industry, to the services sector generally, including banks and insurance companies and also to the building and construction sector on a trial basis.  Finally, the scheme will now run for all of 1978.</P>

    <P>Still in the context of job-creation, I should like to refer to the &ldquo;Guaranteed Irish&rdquo; campaign announced recently by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  This is an area where each individual can help in job-creation.  This cannot be too strongly stressed: everyone is involved. The Government's aim is to induce, over a three-year period, a 3p in the £ switch in spending from foreign to home-produced goods, yielding about 10,000 extra jobs.  The provision in the 1978 Estimates for this scheme is £680,000&mdash;a trebling of the 1977 expenditure of £227,000.  This expenditure may be relatively small in relation to the other provisions for job-creation, but there is no gainsaying the tremendous boost to employment which would result from even a relatively small shift in purchases from imported to home-produced goods.</P>

    <P>From job-creation, which spans both current and capital expenditure, I turn now to more general comment on public expenditure and the Estimates as published last week.  Since the Exchequer, from 1978 on, will finance directly all roads expenditure hitherto financed through the Road Fund, legislation <Col N="366" /> to wind up the fund will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Details have already been given of the reclassification of certain expenditures so as to bring them into line with the national accounts classification. As a result of this there is a net transfer of about £12 million from current to capital account in 1978. The corresponding adjustment for 1977 amounts to £8 million.  These changes do not affect the Exchequer financing requirement&mdash;merely its apportionment as between current and capital account.</P>

    <P>The 1978 Estimates volume takes account of this reclassification and details the day-to-day running costs of the various departmental services, apart from those charged directly on the Central Fund.  Excluding the items which I am announcing to-day, non-capital supply services will cost £1,869 million in 1978.  This is some £272 million or 17 per cent more than was spent last year.</P>

    <P>Debt service costs rose from £278 million in 1976 to £334 million in 1977.  The 1977 out-turn was, in fact, £41 million less than was estimated at budget time last year.  The difference, as I have already said, was due mainly to a significant reduction in interest rates on domestic borrowings and to the increase in the value of the pound in relation to those foreign currencies which make up our foreign debt.  Even with the assumption, which I am making, that these favourable conditions will continue, the further borrowing in 1977 and 1978 will increase the debt service estimate in 1978 by about £70 million.</P>

In recognition of the financing problems experienced by the special schools for handicapped children, I have approved an increase of one-third in their rates of capitation grant with effect from the 1977-78 school year.

My estimate of total receipts for 1978 from tax and non-tax revenue, as shown in the White Paper Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure, is £2,054 million&mdash;an increase of £297 million or 16.9 per cent on 1977.  This estimate includes the additional buoyancy which will be generated by expenditure on job-creation and other manifesto commitments.</P>
    <P>The tax revenue estimate of £1,744 million included in the total anticipates a 7 per cent growth rate for the economy in 1978.  As to the non-tax revenue estimate of £310 million.  I <Col N="369" /> should mention that this allows for the effect on receipts of a 1 per cent reduction I am making from today in the lending rate from the Local Loans Fund.  This will benefit future purchasers who avail of SDA loans, as well as contributing further to the stimulus we are giving to building and construction.  The cost to the Exchequer in 1978 will be about £250,000.</P>

    <P>The generation of additional employment and the reduction of unemployment, towards which so much of the Government's overall strategy is directed, has of course to be seen in social and human terms rather than simply in abstract economic terms. While pursuing this priority objective, the Government are determined at the <Col N="370" /> same time to maintain and improve the social services generally as far as possible.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Increased weekly payments</Title>
    <P>Weekly social welfare payments generally were last revised in October 1977 to take account of cost-of-living movements from the previous increase in April 1977.  The Government are satisfied that social welfare recipients should participate in the prospective growth in the wealth of the community generally.  They have decided, there-fore, that weekly social welfare payments, including health allowances, should be increased by 10 per cent from April next.  However, in view of the continuing growth in farm incomes, unemployment assistance rates for smallholders whose means are assessed notionally and whose net land valuation exceeds £15 but not £20, are to be excluded from this increase. The 10 per cent increase represents a substantial improvement in real terms for social welfare recipients.  Those fortunate enough not to have to rely on the social welfare services for their main source of income will not cavil at this increase for the less well-off. It will mean an increase of £2.55 a week in the maximum contributory old age pension for a married couple both of pension age and under 80. Their new rate of pension will be £28.15 a week.  In the case of a married man with three children receiving unemployment benefit, the increase will be £3.25 giving a total of £35.40 a week.  A contributory widow pensioner with two children will receive an increase of £2.25, bringing her pension to £24.40 a week.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Unemployment assistance for women</Title>
    <P>The Government are committed to work towards the elimination of discrimination against women in the social welfare code.  A main area of discrimination has been unemployment assistance.  In order to be eligible for unemployment assistance, a widow or single woman at present must have at least one dependant or a minimum number of contributions. The Government have decided that single women, including school leavers <Col N="371" /> and widows, will be entitled to claim unemployment assistance on the same basis as men.  To allow sufficient time to complete the necessary administrative arrangements, the operative date of these provisions will be 1 October 1978.  The cost involved is £1.6 million in 1978 and £6.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The live register will, of course, be affected by this extension of the unemployment assistance scheme.  I estimate that, as a result, it could increase by about 14,000 towards the end of the year.  However, the impact will be readily measurable by reference to the consistently small number of women hitherto in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Any appreciable increase in their numbers will be ascribable to this easement in the qualifying conditions for unemployment assistance, and not to any underlying increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing measures, the Government have also decided on a number of smaller, but nonetheless significant, improvements in the social welfare code including, for instance, increases in maternity and death grants.  A full list of these improvements, which will cost a quarter of a million pounds in 1978, will be found in the document setting out the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In aggregate, the social welfare measures which I have announced to-day will cost the Exchequer £21.7 million in 1978 and £33.2 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The Government are conscious that they are responsible to the taxpayer and insurance contributor, and indeed to the community at large, for ensuring that there will be no significant abuse of the social welfare code.  The Minister for Social Welfare is tackling this problem and is confident that the elimination of abuses will lead to economies of at least £2.5 million in 1978.</P>

First, I propose to have a telephone <Col N="372" /> rental subsidies scheme provided for veterans living alone, similar to that for old age pensioners.

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - TAXATION POLICY   Personal income tax   Personal allowances</Title>
    <P>I now come to my proposals for changes in the personal income tax.  I have already indicated that the increase in the main personal income tax allowances proposed in the manifesto would be sufficient to improve real disposable incomes significantly, taken in conjunction with the Government target of a wage increase of about 5 per cent.  I propose to increase the single allowance by £200, from £665 to £865, and to increase the married allowance by £630, from £1,100 to £1,730.</P>
    <P>At its new rate of £1,730, the married allowance will be double the single allowance.  The existing allowance of £230 for working wives will be maintained. These measures should be of particular benefit to married couples. Combined with a pay increase of 5 per cent, this would give an increase in weekly after-tax income of £6.52 or 11 per cent for a married man with two children, who is on average industrial earnings of about £70 a week.</P>
    <P>The abolition of rates on domestic dwellings and the abolition of motor vehicle duties for all but large cars will also mean a good deal more cash in the pocket for the average family in 1978.  Savings in motor <Col N="373" /> vehicle duties for a modest family saloon should work out at about £1 a week.  Rates savings will, of course, depend on the type of accommodation which a family has.  The average savings here should be about £2 a week for a local authority tenant: for a family purchasing a three-bedroomed semi-detached house in the Dublin area the saving could be £4 a week or more.</P>
    <P>All in all, therefore, the average family can expect to be at least £9 to £10 a week better-off in terms of disposable income by virtue of these particular measures.</P>
    <P>In line with the increase in the single allowance which I have mentioned, the personal allowance for widows and widowers will go up from the present level of £735 to £935 that is, an increase of £200.</P>
    <P>I have never accepted the view that all pensioners should be automatically exempt from tax, regardless of their income.  I feel that the best way to tackle the tax burden of pensioners is to increase the special age allowance available to persons aged 65 years or over, and this I propose to do.  The existing age allowances of £45 for single or widowed persons and £145 for married persons are to be increased by £35 in each case, that is to £80 and £180 respectively.  Taken in conjunction with the other increased allowances which I have announced, this will result in a significant improvement in the position of pensioners who are paying income tax.</P>
    <P>The cost of all these increases in personal allowances will be £63.4 million this year.</P>

It has been represented to me that, in view of the percentage limitation, the retention of the cash limitation is inappropriate.

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Premiums on life assurance policies</Title>
    <P>The income tax code gives generous tax relief in respect of premiums paid by individuals on life assurance policies.  Up to 1953 the fraction of premium qualifying for relief was one-half. In the budget of that year, with a view to ensuring the development of the Irish assurance industry, the qualifying fraction in the case of new policies with Irish companies was increased to two-thirds.</P>
    <P>The Irish life assurance companies have improved their share of the market to the point where they now account for over 60 per cent of premium income.  Moreover, investment in the Irish economy by non-Irish companies, now exceeds 90 per cent of their Irish liabilities.</P>
    <P>The Government have accordingly decided that, in the case of all policies taken out after today, the fraction of life assurance premiums qualifying for tax relief will be a uniform one-half. The tax relief will continue to be available at a taxpayer's marginal rate of tax.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the tax treatment of life assurance is generous and life assurance can be expected to remain a specially attractive means of long-term savings and family protection.</P>

    <P>I am satisfied that this position is unfair to many employees&mdash;in particular to those who have to use their cars extensively for business purposes. Accordingly, I have decided to repeal the relevant 1976 legislation, with effect from 6 April next, thereby restoring the previous basis on which the value of the benefit to the employee was computed by reference to the actual amount of private mileage as compared with total mileage.  The cost of this relief will be £2 million in 1978.</P>

It can lead in certain circumstances to a situation where an employee's after-tax income towards the end of the year might be somewhat less than it was at the beginning of the year.  In view of this, the Revenue Commissioners at my request, have prepared a new Table A which will have the effect of spreading the tax deduction evenly throughout the year.</P>

    <P>As I said at the outset, this budget is designed to create the conditions under which the private sector can move ahead and take over as a prime generator of economic growth and employment.  One of the most important ways in which a Government can set this process in train is by so tailoring the taxes which business has to bear as to ensure that the spirit of enterprise and expansion is positively encouraged.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Special incentive for manufacturing companies</Title>
    <P>Under a three year scheme introduced last year, manufacturing companies generally can enjoy a special 25 per cent rate of corporation tax provided that they expand activity to meet certain minimum targets.  For 1977 these targets were an increase of 3 per cent in employment and an increase of 5 per cent in volume of sales over 1976 levels.  I propose that for the remaining two years, 1978 and 1979, there will only be an employment target to be met.  Manufacturers will therefore qualify for the special 25 per cent corporation tax rate for each year if they increase their employment by 3 per cent in each year.  Credit for extra employment created over the target rate can be carried forward to the next year within the period of the scheme.  In any case, all manufacturers will have the option of qualifying in 1978 and 1979 by reference to a 3 per cent increase in employment over the immediately preceding year, if that is to their benefit.</P>
    <P>I trust that my simplification of the targets and my announcement now of the employment test for 1978 and 1979 will create a favourable climate in which manufacturers can plan ahead with confidence and so encourage early expansion of manufacturing activity and employment.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Capital allowances</Title>
    <P>As regards capital allowances allowed to industry for tax purposes, Deputies will be aware that &ldquo;free depreciation&rdquo; for new plant and machinery enables the entire cost of such investment to be deducted straightaway for tax purposes.  It is on a permanent basis in the designated areas.  In the rest of the country, however, it has been subject to renewal at intervals of two years since its introduction in 1971.</P>
    <P>The current two-year period is due to end in March 1979.  The purpose of the short-term basis of free depreciation in the past was to stimulate early investment by manufacturing industry as well as to keep options open in the matter of the long-term level of capital <Col N="377" /> allowances for new plant and machinery. The Government have decided that the need for industrial growth would be better served by allowing free depreciation for plant and machinery as a normal and continuing feature of our capital allowances arrangements for the whole country.</P>
    <P>For industrial buildings, the initial capital allowance at present stands at the accelerated rate of 50 per cent which is also on a temporary statutory basis.  Having considered the matter, I propose that free depreciation will be available to industrialists for their expenditure on new industrial buildings with effect from tomorrow.  This means that as much as 100 per cent of the capital cost can be written off in the first year, if so desired.  The allowance will be on a net cost basis as at present &mdash;that is to say, net cost after deduction of grants payable.  The detailed provisions in relation to capital allowances will be included in the Finance Bill.</P>

It is most desirable that the possibilities for growth of small firms be fully exploited to the national advantage.

    <P>I propose to raise the present corporation tax thresholds for small companies from £10,000 and £15,000 to £25,000 and £35,000, respectively.  The revised thresholds will be for the purpose <Col N="378" /> of applying the 35 per cent to 45 per cent range of rates and the 45 per cent rate, respectively.  In order to give a useful boost to the companies' cash position in 1978 by reducing their current tax payments in respect of 1977 profits, I propose to backdate the increase in thresholds to profits from 1 January 1977.  The cost to the Exchequer is £400,000 in 1978.  I am confident that this will provide a welcome stimulus to small companies.</P>

It has lent over £145 million in this country, mainly for the public capital programme, since our accession to the European Communities.

    <P>Exchange rate changes can impose considerable additional costs which cannot be foreseen when a loan is taken out.  I have decided, in principle, therefore, that the Exchequer should assume the exchange risk liability on borrowing by the Industrial Credit Company from the European Investment Bank for on-lending to small firms in the manufacturing sector. I have also arranged that the Industrial Credit Company's margin for administration expenses in relation to this scheme will be at a specially low rate.  I hope the way will now be <Col N="379" /> clear for an expansion of the bank's lending operations in Ireland.

This measure is intended to be of a temporary nature.  It will be reviewed when the fully pay-related social insurance contribution system comes into operation.  In any event, it will end as soon as the British scheme is terminated. The scheme will come into operation from the beginning of April and details will be announced as soon as possible.

It is intended as another substantial contribution by the Government to the process of reducing the rate of inflation to a level at which price increases are not disruptive either of private living standards or of the economy generally.  It is a positive contribution because for the most part excise duties are flat-rate and not a percentage of the price of the product.  Thus the longer the excise duties remain unchanged the more the relative weight of these taxes in the price of the goods concerned diminishes.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Wealth tax</Title>
    <P>When the wealth tax legislation came before this House in 1975 it was opposed by the present Government basically on the grounds that it was detrimental to the economic interests of the country at its present stage of development.  I see no reason to change that view.  There were indications of an outflow of badly needed private funds in 1975 and 1976 and, while one cannot be definite about the reasons for the outflow, it seems to be more than coincidence that it occurred at the same time as wealth tax was introduced.  This, of course, is only one side of the coin.  The other side is the amount of capital which would have flowed into the country were it not inhibited from doing so by the very aura of a wealth tax.  The amount involved can only be conjectural but, taking both sides of the coin together, one certain result emerged: existing jobs were lost and jobs in prospect never came to fruition. The wealth tax has undoubtedly created a psychological climate in which investment and risk-taking have been at a decided discount.  Among other demoralising side-effects is the discrimination against Irish business. I have decided for these reasons to abolish wealth tax with effect from 5 April next.</P>
    <P>The cost in the present year is estimated at £8.5 million.  If my hopes about the effects on entreprise of the abolition of wealth tax are realised, the small size alone of this figure will give the lie to any critic who might suggest that this Budget favours the wealthy. It is insignificant in comparison with the hundreds of millions of pounds of new job-directed expenditure allocations and the across-the-board tax concessions I am providing for today.</P>

    <P>The present Government never opposed the principle of a tax on capital gains but they did consider that instead of a flat rate of tax there should be a sliding scale under which the speculator would pay more tax than a person who had spent the best part of a life-time building up a business. I propose with effect from 6 April next to introduce, in the case of the <Col N="382" /> generality of assets, a new scale starting at 30 per cent and reducing in three-year spans to nil after 21 years. The period of 21 years will run from the date of acquisition of the asset, irrespective of when it was acquired.  In the case of a limited number of assets, shares and development land, for instance, a flat rate of 30 per cent will apply.  In all cases adjustments will be made to allow for inflation as measured by the consumer price idex.  The changes will not result in any cost to the Exchequer in 1978 as capital gains tax is paid a year in arrears.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Capital acquisitions tax</Title>
    <P>Again the Government have no quarrel in principle with the capital acquisitions tax.  I do propose, however, to increase certain thresholds.  In particular, I intend to double the threshold in Tables II, III and IV of the Second Schedule to the Act which, I believe, were fixed at too low a level in the first instance.  These changes will, of course, involve readjustments to the various ranges within these tables.  The cost of all the adjustments is estimated at £1 million in 1978.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Heritage houses</Title>
    <P>Last year An Taisce published a report which was a plea to the Government to come to the aid of our heritage houses, gardens and collections which are a significant national asset&mdash; economic and educational as well as artistic.  In particular, the council of An Taisce considered that the new capital taxes had serious implications for these houses and would endanger elements of the country's heritage already under serious pressure.</P>
    <P>The Government are sympathetically disposed towards the preservation of heritage houses and do not think that the nation should lightly run the risk of losing valuable and irreplaceable cultural assets.  It is true that the changes in capital taxation already announced by me will bring relief but this is less so in the case of capital acquisitions tax.  I propose, therefore, to consider how best to draft legislation aimed at relieving these properties of capital acquisitions tax.  Questions of definitions will have to be decided <Col N="383" /> and I consider that relief should be contingent on public access being allowed to the properties.  It is difficult to estimate what the cost of this concession is likely to be but I am allowing £200,000 in respect of the present year.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget," RHead="1978. - Farm incomes and the taxation of farming profits">
    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Farm incomes and the taxation of farming profits</Title>
    <P>After decades of depressed and unstable price levels and insecure markets, the farming sector has, thanks mainly to our membership of the EEC, enjoyed considerable advances in income in recent years.  In the coming years, farmers can continue to plan against the background of security of markets for their output.  We have now a solid basis for greatly expanding the contribution of this sector to our economic well-being.  This is an opportunity that must not be missed and the community looks to the farmer to exploit it to the full.</P>
    <P>Everyone accepts that farmers should make their due contribution in taxation.  It is the policy of the Government that this contribution should be equitable having regard to progress in the level of farmer incomes while, at the same time, bearing in mind the special nature of the agricultural industry and its development needs.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that the Government undertook in the manifesto to make certain changes in the system of taxing farming profits. The Government intend to honour these undertakings and provision to give effect to them will be made in the forthcoming Finance Bill.  I will briefly list these changes.</P>
    <P>The notional basis of assessment will be retained as an alternative to assessment on the basis of accounts. Farmers will, however, be required to remain for three years with whatever option they choose because switching from one basis to the other could provide scope for unfairly minimising tax liability.</P>
    <P>Full-time farmers will be allowed a single payment date in the income tax year, namely, 1 January.  Consequently, the White Paper, or prebudget, <Col N="384" /> estimate of revenue from full-time farmers in 1978 falls to be reduced by £5 million, that is the amount which they would have paid in September next under the former two-payment-date system.</P>
    <P>Contractors' fees will be allowed as a deduction before assessment of income on a notional basis.  Allowances will continue to be given for wages of employees who are registered for PAYE and social welfare purposes.</P>
    <P>Full-time farmers will be allowed the amount of their preceding year's rates on land as a credit against their tax bill.</P>
    <P>There will be a system of income-averaging for farmers.  Discussions are being held with the farming organisations with a view to arriving at an appropriate system.  Discussions are also taking place on the system of valuing breeding livestock for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, it is our policy that taxation of farmers takes due account of progress in farmers' incomes.  These incomes have more than doubled in the four years since the introduction of farmers' income taxation in 1974.  In the income tax year 1977-78 the yield from taxation of farming profits is expected to be about £14 million.</P>
    <P>This return must be regarded as low in the light of the increases which have taken place in farm incomes. The Government have therefore decided to increase from 65 to 90 the multiplier which is used to calculate a farmer's notional income.</P>
    <P>The Government have also decided that the threshold for liability to income tax should be lowered from £75 rateable valuation to £60 rateable valuation. This will bring a further 7,000 full-time farmers into the tax net, making about 22,500 farmers in all liable for income tax.  The effect of the foregoing measures is that farmers will pay about £24 million in tax in the income tax year 1978-79.</P>
    <P>An announcement has already been made by the Minister for the Environment to the effect that farmers with rateable valuations of £75 or over will no longer be eligible for rates relief by way <Col N="385" /> of the agricultural grant, resulting in a saving to the Exchequer of about £7 million in 1978.  The Government have decided that the rateable valuation ceiling for determining eligibility for such rates relief will in future be the same as the valuation threshold for income tax liability.  The effect of this decision will be that in 1979 farmers whose rateable valuations are £60 or over will not benefit from the agricultural grant but they will be able to set their 1978 rates against their tax bill.</P>

    <P>This Government have always recognised the importance of the activities of co-operatives in the development of Irish agriculture and fisheries.  We gave a commitment to restore an exemption from corporation tax in respect of such activities.  A provision will accordingly be included in this year's Finance Bill to exempt certain profits made by these co-operatives as from 1 April next.</P>
    <P>Apart from some modifications, the exemption will be similar to that enjoyed by agricultural and fishery co-operatives up to 6 April 1976.  The Government are satisfied, however, that the best interests of Irish agriculture and fisheries would not be served by allowing sales to the Intervention Agency to benefit from the exemption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Value-Added Tax (Amendment) Bill 1977 passed its Second Stage in November.  That Bill arose out of an EEC Directive of 1977.  The date for the coming into operation of the Bill, when enacted with any necessary amendments, depends on a number of factors. <Col N="386" /> Representations have been received on different points and I am considering them.  Moreover, decisions may be taken in Brussels postponing the date for implementation of the directive by those member states&mdash;the great majority&mdash;which have not yet enacted the necessary legislation.  I cannot therefore at this stage be specific about the likely timetable for the Bill or say when the new arrangements will come into operation.  Adequate notice will be given.</P>
      <P>I should mention that I propose to add provisions to this Bill for a considerable increase in the turnover thresholds for compulsory VAT registration of traders.  I have been impressed by representations made to me that the existing thresholds, which have been unchanged since VAT was introduced in 1972 are too low.  The increases I have in mind raise the present thresholds generally by about 50 per cent.  The cost to the Exchequer of this change, which will come into operation in due course, will be £250,000 in a full year.</P>
      <P>I am sure this will be welcomed by many small businesses.  Additionally, the Revenue Commissioners are actively pursuing at my request the question of simplification of VAT returns and records, with particular concern for the smaller businesses.</P>
      <P>There are two VAT matters affecting farmers for which I will also be proposing to add provisions to the Bill.  These are the flat-rate credit and the treatment of cattle marts.</P>
      <P>The 1 per cent VAT recoupment allowed to VAT-registered customers of unregistered farmers was abolished in 1976.  This deprived farmers of compensation for VAT borne by them on machinery and other inputs.  We have already announced our intention to restore recoupment and I propose that this be effected within the 1978-79 income tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exact date will be linked with an arrangement which I have in mind in relation to the bringing of cattle marts into the VAT system under EEC requirements.  This will involve treating the marts as dealers in cattle for VAT purposes.  The result will be that their commission will effectively bear <Col N="387" /> VAT at 1 per cent&mdash;instead of the 10 per cent which would be the case if the VAT system were applied to them in the ordinary way.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Deficit</Title>
    <P>I opened with a current deficit of £265 million.  On the expenditure side I have added about £69 million, allowing for the social welfare savings.  From this, however, I am deducting £20 million for unspent balances in the hands of Departments at the end of 1977. This leaves me with a net addition of about £49 million.  On the revenue side of the account I have given tax reliefs costing a total of about £91 million. In all, therefore, I am adding £140 million to my opening current deficit, bringing it to £405 million.</P>
    <P>To this must be added the Exchequer borrowing requirement for capital purposes of £416 million, leaving me with an Exchequer borrowing requirement of £821 million for 1978, or 13 per cent of GNP&mdash;no higher than that envisaged in the manifesto.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement," RHead="Budget, 1978. - Financing the 1978 borrowing requirement">
    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Financing the 1978 borrowing requirement</Title>
    <P>It is the Government's general aim to finance as much of the borrowing requirement from domestic sources, particularly from the non-bank public, as is consistent with not depriving the private sector of the credit necessary for productive purposes and with not competing unfairly with other savings institutions.  The Government intend to keep foreign borrowing to the minimum amount necessary to ensure the maintenance over the medium-term of an adequate level of external reserves, having regard to the impact on those reserves not only of deficits on the current balance of payments but also of <Col N="388" /> repayments due in respect of existing foreign debt.  It is not necessary&mdash;and we do not intend&mdash;to finance any of the manifesto requirements from external sources.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the $300 million credit which was renegotiated last year is available for 1978.  After providing for the refinancing of some £50 million repayments in respect of existing foreign debt, this will yield approximately £100 million towards this year's borrowing requirement.  The question of further foreign borrowing will be decided from time to time having regard to the criteria which I have just mentioned; it is, however, our intention to take advantage of long-term funds being provided by the European Investment Bank for capital projects.</P>
    <P>The methods of raising funds from domestic sources are kept under constant review in order to ensure that they make their optimum contribution towards financing the Exchequer's borrowing needs.  With this in view, I propose to make certain changes to improve the attractiveness of some of the Government savings media.</P>
    <P>I am increasing the maximum amount which a person may hold of the 9th Issue of Savings Certificates from £5,000, as fixed in 1973, to £7,500.</P>
    <P>I am increasing the maximum amount which persons of 65 years or over may hold of Index-Linked Savings Bonds from £500 to £750.  I am also increasing from £40 a month to £50 a month the maximum amount which a person may invest in the Index-Linked National Instalment Savings.</P>
    <P>I expect the gilt-edged market to be a significant contributor to funding Exchequer borrowing needs in 1978. One of the main requirements of the market is that a wide variety of securities should be available to meet the demands of the many different types of investors.  For this purpose I am creating two new fixed-interest rate stocks which will be open for subscription on Tuesday next, 7 February.  The first is a short-dated stock, has a coupon of 8½ per cent, a yield to maturity of approximately 9½ per cent and will mature in March 1981.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> The second is a long-dated stock carrying an 11½ per cent coupon, a yield to maturity of slightly under 12 per cent and a final maturity in November 1999.  Full details of these stocks will be announced in the national daily newspapers on Friday, 3 February.</P>
    <P>I also intend to issue in the near future a variable interest rate stock. The main features of such a stock are that the capital value remains relatively stable throughout its life while the return on capital moves in line with current short-term interest rates.  This type of stock should hold particular attractions for certain investors as against the more general fixed-interest stocks.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement," RHead="Budget, 1978. - Public Expenditure Policy">
    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Public Expenditure Policy</Title>
    <P>The overriding consideration in all that I have been saying so far in this statement is the Government's firm intention to come to grips immediately with unemployment and inflation.  A deliberate choice had to be made between this course of action and the no less vital need to restore stability to our national finances.  That need was emphasised in the manifesto and it will be tackled with the same determination as our other objectives.  As the manifesto made clear, we are prepared to accept a high level of public borrowing&mdash;13 per cent of GNP in 1978&mdash;only as a temporary feature of our overall strategy to restore economic stability and confidence.  It must be greatly reduced next year and the following year.  In order to bring this about the deficit on current account also has to be drastically reduced. Apart from the assistance which can be expected from revenue buoyancy arising from economic growth, it is my intention to bring about this reduction by restraining public spending and by a thorough-going reassessment of public expenditure priorities.</P>
    <P>A critical review of all spending programmes is, of course, a standard feature of the annual Estimates review carried out by my Department.  In the nature of things, however, this tends to concentrate on immediate needs and value for money.  I am speaking now, however, of a more fundamental look at the whole spectrum of Government <Col N="390" /> spending.</P>
    <P>There are many long-standing expenditure programmes, which are still active, although the justification for the original decision to commit Exchequer support may have long since disappeared.  There is a <i>prima facie</i> case for saying that an expenditure programme that has survived essentially unchanged for many years must, by definition, need reappraisal in the light of to-day's needs.  In a somewhat different category are expenditure which were originally introduced for purely short-term purposes and are still maintained largely because, for one reason or another, the time has never seemed appropriate for their removal.  Yet another category concerns the payment of operating subsidies to agencies on the grounds that their operations have a social or economic value which is not reflected by their revenue-earning capacity.  The social value of these operations, however, appears always to be equated to the subsidy needed, no matter how high this proves to be.  This equation will also be critically examined in the review.</P>
    <P>My Department, with the co-operation of the other Departments concerned, will commence work on this review immediately.  The review will form an integral part of the systematic review of policy areas referred to in the White Paper on National Development. It will obviously not be possible immediately to cover the entire field of Government expenditure in the required depth, but it is my intention that a progressive approach on these lines will become a normal feature of the machinery of expenditure control, so that over a short period of years the entire field of Government expenditure will have been subjected to a searching, in-depth, reappraisal.</P>
    <P>The process of analysis and judgment involved in this reassessment, of itself, will not be enough.  The political will to act on the conclusions reached, even if this means reducing or terminating outdated programmes, must also be present.  The Government will not be found lacking in this regard.</P>
    <P>The process of curbing public expenditure <Col N="391" /> will be assisted by the reform of public service structures and methods.  The Government accept that the reform programme requires sustained political commitment and to this end have appointed a Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service.  I intend, with his assistance, to push forward as rapidly as possible with public service reform, concentrating initially on the most urgent areas, as envisaged by the Public Service Advisory Council.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial" RHead="Statement, Budget, 1978. - Conclusion">
    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1978: Financial Statement, Budget, 1978. - Conclusion</Title>
    <P>The Government's aim over the remainder of the present decade is sustained growth of about 7 per cent a year accompanied by a progressive reduction in the numbers out of work. These are ambitious targets but the Government are prepared to accept this challenge.  There can be unforeseen problems and there may be set-backs&mdash; that is why we will be reviewing our economic and social plans each year&mdash; but I think the best guarantee for the years ahead is what the Government have accomplished to date and what we can now look forward to doing in 1978.</P>
    <P>It is fatally easy to adopt the attitude that we must trail along behind the large developed countries and wait for them to pull us out of our troubles.  We can rationalise this by facile excuses, by saying that we are a small country, that our industries have a small home market, that our techniques in production and marketing are relatively unsophisticatetd and so on.  Thankfully there are signs that this defeatist attitude is on the wane.  Many home-based Irish organisations in both the private and public sectors responded to the difficulties of recent years with an abundance of initiative and drive.  Some public sector companies are building up excellent reputations, particularly in developing countries where skills acquired here are being applied under much more difficult and challenging conditions.</P>
    <P>Their success is ample evidence that we can respond exceptionally well to challenges which require the application of all our skills and energy.  The Industrial Development Consortium <Col N="392" /> will provide a further valuable stimulus from the public sector side by identifying and tackling obstacles to growth.</P>
    <P>Government policy during the past six months has been consistently directed at restoring the confidence lost during the past few years.  This budget is providing £80 million worth of new, job-directed, expenditure and more than £150 million of tax concessions, inclusive of the abolition of domestic rates.</P>
    <P>The first test of whether we as a nation are prepared to make the most of these opportunities will be found in the outcome of the present negotiations for a new national agreement.  It is our responsibility as a Government to point out the path that should be chosen, and we have done all in our power in today's budget to encourage the social partners to follow this path. In return we are seeking, and are entitled to expect, the support of all the community for our proposals.  To-day's budget will ensure the protection and expansion of purchasing power.  It demonstrates that excessive wage demands are self-defeating&mdash;self-defeating not only for the economy but for the individual, in so far as the Government will take action to ensure that any excessive pay increases are recovered from those who secure them.</P>
    <P>While the Government hope that everybody will play their part in making economic advance possible, they are entitled to expect that business will make the most of an environment favourable to growth. Competitive labour costs are not of themselves sufficient to ensure the success of our drive for greater industrial expansion.  They are only one element and must be accompanied by others&mdash;by imagination in meeting the requirements of the market, by the development of new products, by energetic selling, by diligence in the maintenance of quality and continuity in supply and by investment in plant and equipment.</P>
    <P>It is only right that profits should recover from the set-back experienced during the recession.  But the community can justifiably expect that increased profits will be used in productive <Col N="393" /> investment and job-creation. Socially irresponsible waste and conspicuous consumption have no part in our economic strategy, any more than unproductive speculation.</P>
    <P>The Government can only do so much.  They cannot guarantee the creation in the private sector of that vital spark that leads to business growth.  There is ample evidence in many prospering enterprises that there is business creativity in Ireland; we need far more of it if we are to solve our economic problems.</P>
    <P>Our producers must grasp the opportunities which the Government's strategy is throwing open to them. They must exploit the advantages flowing from the enhanced competitiveness which moderate income increases will yield.</P>
    <P>They must plough rising profits back into their businesses and raise investment and output.  And it is imperative that they develop also a keen sense of responsibility in relation to the overriding need to create more jobs and reduce unemployment.  In the coming years private sector investment decisions should always be directed at increasing employment to the maximum extent consistent with market conditions.</P>
    <P>The opportunities being offered through today's budget must be grasped now.  The temporary increase in the Exchequer borrowing requirement <Col N="394" /> for 1978 will be justified fully if the challenge is taken up by workers and employers alike.  If it is not it will not be possible to repeat the prescription.  A repetition of public borrowing of this year's proportions is unacceptable to the Government. We have made it clear in our manifesto and in the White Paper that, after this stage, stability will be restored to the Government's finances through revenue buoyancy and control of expenditure. For this a dynamic private sector contribution to the process of development is essential.</P>
    <P>We have a mixed economy and both the private and public sectors have contributions to make to its development. We expect that the initiatives in the budget will receive a positive and energetic response from the private sector.  Our basic purpose is the creation of a dynamic economy which will enable us to achieve our national and social objectives.</P>
    <P>Our approach is a pragmatic one. It is not dictated by ideological dogma. If there is an inadequate response from either sector we shall take appropriate action in the interest of the whole community.</P>

      <P>Hearing that loud cheer for the budget from the Minister's backbenchers one can only wonder whether we are in a real world having regard to the fact that the Minister has managed to borrow 13 per cent of our GNP.  This is hardly the sort of financial responsibility we were told we could expect on Fianna Fáil's return to office.  Of the money being borrowed, 50 per cent is for the purpose of financing the current deficit.</P>
      <P>I recall being told as a child that the catchcry of Fianna Fáil was that while we must suffer now good times are around the corner.  We now have the reverse of that policy&mdash;the good times are here but we will suffer for them at the time of the next budget.</P>

      <P>It is almost a year to the day that one of the Deputies then in Opposition stood up here and solemnly warned the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, that increasing current public expenditure which is financed by borrowing does not produce either growth or employment. Today that Deputy is the Minister for Health, part of a Government which is now proposing the exact opposite. One begins to wonder whether the Minister for Finance had the benefit of his advice in that regard.  It would be unkind to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>He has been doing that for the past four years and today he is being given the opportunity to open up again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be unkind to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to remind him of his series of articles 18 months ago in <i>Business and Finance</i> in which he went to great <Col N="418" /> lengths to prove that the budget deficit could not be closed by any realistic estimate of future growth.  After all, he has enough embarrassment in explaining to an increasingly doubting public how a former Trinity professor of economics does not know the difference between an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment.</P>
    <P>This budget is little more than the pay-off for the collection of political promises offered by the Fianna Fáil strategists to the public under the guise of what they alleged was a coherent strategy.  In 1977 this economy grew at a rapid rate and it grew as fast as, if not faster than, we projected a year ago.  At that time the Fianna Fáil Party were at great pains to show that there could be no growth, that inflation would accelerate and that workers should not accept the tax package offered to them in the pay deal.  In the event the national wage agreement was accepted.  It was accepted because through the tripartite conference the Government convinced the employers and the trade unions of their good faith.  It was accepted because the Government offered a reasonable package of employment-creating expenditures and tax cuts.  They also pledged&mdash;and they carried out that pledge in the spring with subsidies on dairy produce and town gas&mdash;to do all in their power to prevent price rises from eroding the after-tax increase in income.  It is now virtually certain that the CPI figure for mid-February will show an annual inflation rate of less than 10 per cent and under the pay tax deal in 1977 most incomes rose by at least 10 per cent, so some real after-tax concessions were obtained. Our task in that budget 12 months ago was to maximise employment growth within the constraints imposed by the budgetary position.</P>
    <P>In 1977 there was an increase in employment of 15,000, according to the Taoiseach's recent speech and much of this employment growth was soundly based in industries achieving rapid export growth and in the provision of services to a growing economy.  Regrettably, unemployment did not come down at the same rate but we stressed that the relationship <Col N="419" /> between employment and unemployment was complex, that the end of emigration had meant that it was more difficult to hold unemployment constant, let alone reduce it, and that improvements in unemployment benefits had tended to increase the average length of stay by the short-term unemployed on the register and this increased the overall average.</P>
    <P>The lesson from 1977 is now clear. If unemployment as measured by the live register is to be significantly reduced, policies will have to be precisely targeted to the group of unemployed. This was the thinking behind our proposal for a national manpower agency which would have the responsibility of providing some form of useful employment for those registered as unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed. The trend in registered unemployment was the only dark spot on the otherwise sunny horizon in 1977.  Real gross national product is estimated to have risen last year by over 5 per cent, way in excess of any of our other partners in the EEC.  This growth was not fuelled by an unsustainable rise in current Government spending.  The Department of Finance estimate a rise of only 2 per cent in volume, compared to a real 12 per cent rise in the volume of exports, a 15 per cent rise in industrial investment and a 5 per cent rise in consumption.  Nor was this growth achieved at the expense of the balance of payments.  The deficit rose fractionally to £160 million, far less than the level of private capital inflows.  Official external reserves rose by £245 million during 1977.</P>
    <P>I might mention that between December 1972 and December 1977 our foreign currency reserves rose by £768.5 million.  This almost matches the rise in external Government debt. Our net foreign position has not altered greatly over the past five years, in spite of the rise in oil prices which involved Ireland, like so many other countries, in foreign borrowing.  The evidence is that in 1977, as in 1976, the overall balance of payments was in surplus, that is, that the current deficit was more than matched by the direct foreign capital inflows for investment, <Col N="420" /> much of this investment in Irish industry.  There are few two-year periods in Irish economic history about which the same can be said.</P>
    <P>We recovered well from the recession because we in Government did not lose our heads.  We did not refuse to borrow abroad rather than cut expenditure severely or raise taxes unduly when circumstances required it; nor did we fail to recognise that borrowing when things get tough is justified only if we accept the need to conserve resources when times improve. In 1976 we recognised that Government accounts were in fundamental imbalance and we took the political risk of raising taxes.  The result was that the borrowing requirement and the current deficit began to decline to more normal levels.  Of course, there can be debate about strategy but higher capital spending on schools, roads and hospitals will invariably involve the hiring of more teachers, nurses and doctors and other personnel.  There is not a simple distinction between current and capital expenditure in these areas.  It made no sense in 1975 to lay off or fire public service workers, as the present Minister for Economic Planning and Development then suggested, in order to fund the building of more hospitals and schools which, of course, we would not have the personnel to run.</P>
    <P>As the economy recovers there is a pressing need to redefine policy so that real growth in Government expenditure is reserved for essentials and to reduce current spending as a proportion of GNP and current borrowing as a proportion of total borrowing. This we did in 1976 and again in 1977 by maintaining the pace of economic growth, which is high by international standards.  I think it is not widely appreciated that from 1975 to 1977 current Government spending as a proportion of GNP declined from 37.5 per cent in 1975 to 37.2 per cent in 1976 to 36.7 per cent in 1977.  The direction was clear even if the amount was small.  Excluding debt service charges the decline was more dramatic, from 30.7 per cent in 1975 to 29 per cent in 1977.  Today the Minister has irresponsibly reversed this trend at the <Col N="421" /> cost of higher future taxation and cuts in expenditure.  Current spending after this budget, even allowing for a 7 per cent real growth rate, will be 37.7 per cent, a rate in excess of 1975 when the economy was in a severe slump.</P>
    <P>In the past two years we have also seen a steady shift away from borrowing to meet current expenditure.  In 1975 43.1 per cent of the Government's borrowing requirement was accounted for by the current deficit.  By 1977 it was down to 37 per cent and, if one includes funds devoted to implementing the Fianna Fáil manifesto, it would have been down this year to 33 per cent.  Again, the direction was right and, again, Fianna Fáil have reversed it and today we learn&mdash;I think it must be a world record&mdash;that 50 per cent of Government borrowing is to go to pay for the current deficit.  This far exceeds the highest proportion recorded in 1975 which was at that time subject indeed to a sustained attack by the then Deputies Colley and Haughey.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue, was not a Member of the Dáil then but the other two Deputies I have mentioned were.</P>

      <P>Borrowing to create jobs is what we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that in a moment.  By implementing their manifesto promises which concentrated on current expenditure revenue Fianna Fáil have directed expenditure away from investment and employment towards current consumption.  It is an irresponsible policy and one unsuited to the needs of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let no one think this Government's promise, or threat, to reduce current spending in future years will be implemented painlessly.  Between 1971 and 1977 non-debt current expenditure rose by 5.3 percentage points of GNP.  Expenditure on health, education and social welfare accounted for 2.5 percentage points but, and I think this is the important thing to note, social welfare accounted for only 0.9 per cent of the rise.  Going back to 1971, when social welfare levels were miserable, old age pensions were appalling and, in the assistance category, assistance <Col N="422" /> was not paid to those under 70 and unemployment levels were around 60,000, thanks to sustained emigration for a decade or more, we would still reduce current spending as a percentage of GNP by only 0.9 per cent, less than the amount by which Fianna Fáil have raised here today the share of GNP taken by current spending.</P>
    <P>It is evident now that future cuts will have to be in health and education. Yet that is not the message the electorate got in June 1977 when the manifesto promised an expansion of these very services.  Even in 1978, when the Minister has abdicated any fiscal responsibility, education in the Book of Estimates has only barely kept pace with the increased numbers while increased health costs and the fee increases being liberally offered by the Minister for Health will absorb the extra provision for the health services. Of course, this will be the last good year.</P>
    <P>In 1977 the broad based expansion combined with Government restraint on current spending formed a firm basis&mdash;the words used by the Taoiseach in opening the Adjournment Debate before Christmas were &ldquo;a firm foundation&rdquo;&mdash;for growth in 1978. The Exchequer provision was improving and, without the implementation of the Fianna Fáil manifesto, the 1977 deficit would have been £177 million and might have been lower still if revenue growth had not mysteriously slumped in the last quarter of the year, a slump which the revenue estimates for 1978 indicate to be unique.  It could be that the Minister strove hard to ensure that the 1977 deficit was as high as possible in order to make the 1978 proposals appear less outrageous.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are prepared to risk all and gamble all in one mad budget fling.  The people should remember that it is not the Government's jobs or incomes which are being risked. The price of failure for them is, at worst, Ministers' pensions and seats on the backbenches.  For many others, the ordinary people outside this House, the risk is their livelihoods, their prospect of even staying in Ireland and their real standard of living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> This type of budget has been defended on a number of grounds.  It will encourage pay restraint.  I fail to understand how, by promising now to do something in future, anybody will be encouraged to adopt the straight and narrow path.  It is a peculiar form of logic running right through the Fianna Fáil manifesto, their White Paper and their budget today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been defended on the grounds that it will encourage pay restraint, encourage confidence among investors, expand the economy and create jobs, and that it is only a temporary strategy, part of a wider plan.  Now, if we examine all these arguments, we will find them to be hollow.  There is no sign of pay moderation.  The national wage talks have broken down and may never resume if the employers continue to offer 5 per cent maximum.  Fianna Fáil have seriously upset the whole structure.  It is a structure that has proved valuable in the past in pay bargaining by introducing with, of course, the maximum ambiguity pay proposals into a general election campaign.  Trade unions and their members know that Fianna Fáil promises were made to the nation as a whole, to all workers, trade unionists or not, to the self-employed, to the widows, the old age pensioners, the farmers and every other category in the economy and cannot be rescinded because the Government have been unable to get ordinary trade unionists to accept a 5 per cent pay limit.</P>
      <P>We now hear that the Minister will be coming back to the House if he does not get a pay deal of 5 per cent. We are not told, of course, what measures he will take.  Will he cut the old age pensions?  Will he take back £1 reduction in social welfare stamps? Will he restore rates even though ratepayers may, perhaps, have no say at all in the pay deal?  It is outrageous of the Minister to come in here and threaten the people that he will, if necessary, ensure moderation through legislation if a national wage agreement is not achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> The Government of course have themselves contributed greatly to the breakdown of the pay talks.  The revenue estimates show a rise of income tax for 1977 of over £140 million.  That will cost every income-tax payer about £4 a week and this budget offers them £1.70 a week back in a tax cut.  What kind of a deal is that?  How much encouragement does that give workers to accept a 5 per cent pay deal?  The trade unions will have read the Government's White Paper and they see the current deficit and they, like us, say: &ldquo;Do you remember the four years of Fianna Fáil tirades against current spending?&rdquo; I think there is a fear, and it is a very real fear, amongst workers and others on low incomes that as soon as the ink is dry on the national pay agreement Fianna Fáil will abolish the food subsidies, children's allowances and so on with the explanation&mdash;not taking the blame themselves, blaming Brussels&mdash;that the EEC made them do it.  Already in this budget they have abolished the October social welfare increases which we introduced to supplement the annual April increases and most Deputies and the majority of people outside this House remember the tirades by Opposition Deputies at that time when we sought to apply these increases selectively.</P>
    <P>Fears over future policy are not, of course, confined to workers.  Investors may have received some relief today in capital tax provisions but they too will be able to see the temporary nature of today's events.  They know that in one year the Government will be desperate for revenue and they fear the requirements of political survival will force the Government to raise taxes all round and restore, perhaps, that favourite of Deputy Colley's, the 80 per cent top tax rate which was in operation when Fianna Fáil were last in Government.  Anybody who has a worth-while project today has to ask himself what are the Government's future tax intentions.  The answer from the budget today and the White Paper before Christmas is &ldquo;silence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This budget is supposed to generate employment and expand activity. Where are the jobs? Where is the <Col N="425" /> expansion?  In the last quarter of 1977 the expenditure on supply services was £435.9 million.  This represents an annual rate of expenditure of £1,744 million if it were continued right through 1978.  If we look at the supply services for 1978, excluding the £13 million cost of reducing the social welfare stamps and the £63 million cost of the abolition of the rates, we find that the expenditure for 1978 is £1,792.8 million.  This is a rise of only 2.7 per cent over the last quarter of 1977 at an annual rate.  It is not even enough to meet the expected rise in inflation on the Government's figures of 7 per cent between November, 1977 and November 1978.  Where is the provision for jobs for teachers, nurses, doctors and gardaí promised in the manifesto?  Similarly the public capital programme, to which this budget has added nothing, shows very little job potential.</P>
    <P>Excluding allocations for housing the public capital programme shows only a 12 per cent rise in 1978.  This is barely enough to keep pace with the inflation forecast by the Economic and Social Research Institute, at 10 per cent for investment goods.  It also compares unfavourably with the 26.7 per cent rise between 1976 and 1977 which gave an actual volume increase of 7½ per cent.  There will be very little job growth in the non-housing public capital programme.  This leaves housing as the Government's main hope for employment growth.  With the 40 per cent growth in expenditure it might appear here that prospects were good, but we know from the White Paper that the Government target is 27,000 houses this year.  This represents only a 10 per cent increase on 1977.  We know that by the end of the year local authorities will be cutting back on employment and construction. The £40 million increase will have gone to builders in higher prices.  It will have replaced private savings in paying for houses and will replace building society loans.  The effective cost of the Government's 2,000 extra houses built in 1978 will be £16,000 to £20,000 per house, and only a handful of jobs will be generated in the construction industry.  Most of these have probably already occurred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> We had a series of questions down today about the actual increase in employment in Government Departments in the second half of 1977 and according to the Government's figures the total came to 3,300, which is a far cry from the 5,000 promised.  We should point out that most if not all of these jobs were provided with money provided by us in the 1977 budget.  This Government are trying to claim credit for job creation that was approved in the 1977 budget.</P>

      <P>The budget contains absolutely nothing for the job seeker. Young people were promised £20 million for jobs but have been palmed off with £5 million.  We must presume that most of the balance will go to reduce the capital taxes.  When they have had time to digest the contents of this sham budget a lot of young people will be asking themselves what kind of a country are we living in.  As for the budget being part of an economic plan, all we can say is &ldquo;what plan?&rdquo;  The White Paper was a dishonest attempt to get civil servants to approve of the manifesto, without much success, because the wretched June document is beyond redemption. We argued strongly that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development should be required to produce forecasts of revenue expenditure for the years ahead.  He has not done so, so everybody is waiting for the axe to fall and is looking around to see how Fianna Fáil will get the money to finance this year's mad extravagance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes announced by the Minister today are very minor in relation to the £3,000 million budget for which he is responsible.  By concentrating on the provisions in today's announcement we might be in danger of losing sight of the total picture.  The 1978 revenue estimates show a rise in tax revenue, excluding car taxes, of £275 million.  This represents over £90 a year for every man, woman and child or about £5 per week for every person in employment.  We are aware that the key words in this budget are &ldquo;tax cuts&rdquo;. Rates relief is worth £62 million, car <Col N="427" /> tax £25 million and the cut in the social welfare stamp by £1, £13 million and the measures announced here to-day are worth £90 million.  In the manifesto we were told that the cut in the stamp for lower paid workers would be a great incentive to employment. This is another bit of the peculiar logic that has been running through Fianna Fáil thinking in the last couple of years.  Offsetting all that, are increases in rates of £7 million to the farmers added to all the other burdens that are placed on them today. Overall, we have tax increases of £275 million and tax reductions including the rates of £83 million.</P>
    <P>Thus net taxes will rise by £192 million or £3.50 per week for employed persons.  We are asking the workers to accept a 5 per cent pay increase, and the net effect of the budget and the projections for the future is that they will be asked to pay back £1.75 in tax over the coming 12 months. That is not the juiciest looking carrot I every saw.  The income tax relief offered by the Minister totals £63 million. In reply to a question today we discovered that to adjust the income tax code by the 11 per cent or so inflation over the past 12 months would cost £52 million&mdash;£29 million for allowances and £23 million for increases in the tax bands.  Thus real tax cuts equal only £11 million.  This is what we are asking the workers to accept instead of pay increases.  When the present Minister for Finance was in opposition he continually pressed for the indexation of income tax.  In Government the Minister has changed his tune and is trying to buy pay restraint not through real tax cuts but through notional cuts that leave taxpayers hardly any better off than they were a year ago.</P>
    <P>I welcome the £5 per week to help those in the clothing, footwear and textile industries.  It is tragic that this was not introduced five or six months ago when it became clear that the British were retaining their employment protection scheme for a longer period.  As the Minister pointed out earlier, the money was available at that time in the employment incentive scheme <Col N="428" /> which we introduced in the 1977 budget, but was not taken up.  At that stage the money could have been paid and could have removed at least the fear of unemployment.  This is not employment creation.  This is the prevention of people losing their jobs.  It is for a limited time.  The tone of voice the Minister used in drawing attention to it would make it appear very limited, and it is exactly 25 per cent of what is being given across the water.  The rate in England is £20.  Here we give £5 six months too late.</P>
    <P>I cannot welcome the abolition of the wealth tax.  We in Fine Gael have no hang up about the wealth tax but we do see its effectiveness in helping to achieve wage restraint and to bring about a wage agreement.  The Minister has done a number of things that will make it virtually impossible for him to get a wage agreement of 5 per cent at this time, and a 5 per cent wage agreement is exceedingly important for the country at the moment.  I suggest that by abolishing the wealth tax at this time the Minister is going to make that impossible.  Maybe that is part of his strategy.  Maybe he wants to make a wage agreement impossible to allow him to bring in legislation.  He has said twice in his speech that the Government will take action here unless there is a wage agreement.</P>
    <P>The wealth tax was a new tax, and I should remind the House of the circumstances under which it was brought in.  It was brought in by us in Government with other capital taxes as a substitute for that most inequitable and unfair tax of estate duty on death. The wealthy were not caught by estate duty because they were able to make provision to see that their heirs avoided estate duty.  It was the middling to small businessman and farmer who were caught and many of their farms were sold and many of their businesses went bankrupt and had to be sold up when the owners died.  It was in substitution for that most unfair tax that we brought in the three capital taxes, as they are called.  People will ask why the man who lives off his capital of £500,000 in a big house worth £250,000 and who is paying no rates should contribute nothing directly to the State, <Col N="429" /> while the average worker earning £70 per week with two children will have to pay some portion of his wages every month into the coffers.  You are not setting the scene there for wage restraint nor can you expect a response from people who have to count every penny every day to live from week to week.</P>
    <P>We in this party have absolutely no hang-up about the wealth tax.  If there was a better way of devising a tax that would ensure that all sections of the community pay their fair share towards the services which we all enjoy from the Government we would have no hesitation at all about adopting it. The Minister would have been far wiser in this regard to adjust his thresholds and rates of inflation to make allowance for the anomalies that are undoubtedly in this new tax and which had become obvious after three years in operation.  He would have our whole-hearted co-operation in that, but to abolish this tax at this time is dangerous and will have consequences not just in wage agreements but maybe in the very structure of our society.</P>
    <P>I come to what will undoubtedly be the most controversial matter in this budget, the farm taxes.  I can imagine the talk in the pubs of Ireland tonight. Can you imagine what they will be saying about you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in Wexford after all you promised them last June?  The Minister will be called &ldquo;the farmers' friend&rdquo;.  Deputy Haughey carefully distanced himself over the last six months from any of this circus economics, saying in private that they must be crazy, saying nothing in public except that he wanted more money for his Department&mdash;speeding the caravan down the hill.  The farmers little realised when they were offered the wonderful tax concessions at the time of the election that they would have to pay for them in another way.  Farmers paid £14 million in income tax under the Coalition.  Now Fianna Fáil have clawed back half as much as that again in the abolition of the rates relief.  The average development farmer now faces substantial increased taxes.  Under Fianna Fáil economics a tax cut this year turned out to be a tax increase <Col N="430" /> even if it was postponed for a year. The proposals have rightly been described by the President of the IFA as savage.</P>

      <P>I will say one thing about the social services and increases there.  As most people know in this House and outside it, the children's allowances are the money used by the housewives of Ireland as one of the main means of running their households. They have not been increased. There is no question of the housewife getting any increase in what she regards as one of her main sources of income.  That is another thing that will be noted, and there is no point in the Minister looking horrified when I draw these things to his attention. I can assure him that the people around the table trying to negotiate a new wage agreement will read the fine print in this budget.  I can see by the look on the Minister's face that he thinks I am doing great harm to the wage agreement negotiations.</P>

He has introduced an irresponsible budget at exactly the wrong time, when the economy is beginning to improve.  It is a gamble based on borrowing 13 per cent of GNP.  The appalling thing is that the loudest cheers heard in the House during his speech came when the Minister announced with great pride that he would borrow 13 per cent of our GNP and that 50 per cent of that would go to meet the deficit on current borrowing. If he thinks this is financial responsibility, Deputy Colley has forgotten more in four years than I thought was possible.

      <P>Will this budget be a great leap forward?  The answer is that it will until the next budget.  When will that come?  We have already had four bites from the cherry: we have had the removal of the cheese subsidy, one budget; the cutting of farmers' rates relief, two budgets; the cutting of the gas subsidy and the removal of the fertiliser subsidy.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing that we have heard here today provides any firm basis for belief that job expansion on the scale required will occur in 1978 or the years thereafter.  There was a Deputy some years ago who, after some good news had been given by Ministers of the day, used to say: &ldquo;Wonderful things have happened in our day&rdquo;.  That Deputy bequeathed to his son a job as Minister of State.  If that Deputy had been here this afternoon during the first outburst of applause from the Government benches he would have noted that it occurred when the Minister announced the abolition of the wealth tax.  It tells us things about the composition of the Soldiers of Destiny in 1978, and I have no doubt that that Deputy would have said today: &ldquo;Wonderful things have happened in our time&rdquo;.  He would have said that a time has come when the Legion of the Rearguard, the poor men whom Deputy Blaney evoked at an Ard Fheis some years ago, can cheer to a man, or a woman, when the announcement was made of the abolition of the wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that in a budget which puts in pawn so much of the country's future through foreign borrowings for very doubtful purposes, to the tune of £821 million, almost £10 million is being spent on the abolition of the wealth tax.  It tells us a lot about their social priorities and their tax reform motivation.  What-ever else can be said about the budget, it brings very good news for the 5,000 payers of wealth tax.  Judging by the <Col N="434" /> applause from the Government benches when the announcement was made, Government Deputies at least have the interests of those 5,000 at heart.</P>
    <P>Who are those 5,000 and what was the purpose of the wealth tax?  As Deputy Barry has told us it was in lieu of death duties.  It was chargeable at a single rate of 1 per cent with exemption thresholds to be at £100,000 for married people and £70,000 for single persons.  The principal private residence and its contents, and live-stock in certain cases, were specifically exempt from the tax.  They were the thresholds for the 5,000 people who paid roughly £8 million last year. They are the people who had first call on the attention of the Government this afternoon.</P>
    <P>We all know there are many inequities in the tax system.  Members of the previous administration were aware of these inequities but they ruled the country in very difficult times.  Had we the opportunity given by the present growth in the economy to this Government, no doubt the abolition of the wealth tax would not have been a priority of ours.  There were far more pressing reforms in the whole taxation area which called out for early attention.</P>
    <P>As is to be anticipated from the level of borrowing which allowed the Minister to satisfy members of his party, perhaps in the short term, this budget will not meet with the condemnation it so richly deserves.  If we could visualise the Minister as a chef, we could say that the pleasant repast he served up to his Deputies to-day may prove to be less pleasant in its after taste in 1979 and 1980.  Questions like what does the budget do to sustain an improvement in the employment situation go unanswered.  The overall budget strategy and the things mentioned in the White Paper leave one with little confidence that an early dent will be made in the numbers on the unemployment register.</P>
    <P>My primary disappointment with this budget is the continued lack of evidence that the Government are <Col N="435" /> serious about tackling the present intolerable unemployment figure.  There is no evidence that there will be productive employment which can be sustained on an expanding basis for our growing population.  There is no provision which suggests any ability on the part of the Government to provide that.  The question may be asked, and has been asked by Deputy Barry, how does the budget enhance the prospects of a national wage agreement, the achievement of which the Minister has said is of very serious significance for the success of the proposals in his budget?</P>
    <P>Such measures as the abolition of the wealth tax cannot help us to reach the kind of consensus needed for a national wage agreement.  The Minister made an ambiguous utterance such as he is fond of making about national wage agreements.  He believes that historically he is the sole author of such agreements.  He has often said in this House and elsewhere that the first agreement would not have been possible without the threat of force by him in 1970.  He repeated that argument on somewhat similar lines in the final sentence of his speech here to-day. Obviously he considers agreement on 5 per cent in the wage talks to be extremely important.</P>
    <P>Measures like the abolition of the wealth tax, capital gains tax, the other changes made, the very little real improvement in welfare payments &mdash;the absence of such an improvement, in fact&mdash;the total absence of any change in children's allowances, and the niggardly approach to the equalisation of the unemployment assistance rates between men and women will not achieve that agreement.  If one accepts, as the Government do, the philosophy of borrowing abroad for current purposes, surely such matters as the equalisation of unemployment assistance rates between men and women should be treated with more despatch and haste rather than making the poor excuse that we have to wait until later in the year to do it.</P>
    <P>The taxation reform in the budget does not do much to gain acceptance of the all-important national wage <Col N="436" /> agreement.  It does little to provide a climate for the provision and expansion of productive employment.  Some changes have been made in relation to the expansion of employment opportunities in the public service, but they are not as great as is suggested in the Minister's speech.  He talks about the manifesto commitment to gaining 5,000 new jobs in 1977.  It is not at all clear from his statement today that these have been achieved.  From Dáil questions we are not satisfied that they have been achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard today that 3,300 have been achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talks about the posts which have been allocated and those which have been filled.  Those filled amounted to about 2,000, and those allocated about 4,000. We will be going through the Minister's speech and his forecasts for the future with great care during this debate. On first reading there is no confidence for the belief that the unemployment register can be reduced by the figures mentioned in the manifesto last year.</P>
      <P>No equity in the taxation system has been achieved.  There is no real evidence of the Government's serious concern about the unemployment position. Criticisms of the provisions in the manifesto are valid when we consider the budget.  The recent White Paper is the offspring of the manifesto, as is this budget.  Electoral appeal rather than economic common sense dictated the terms of that manifesto. If immediate criticism of the budget is not offered, the point must be made to the public that the borrowing engaged in by this administration is a form of deferred taxation only.  Already some of the interest on the borrowings the administration to which I belonged were forced into, a policy correctly adopted by us during a period of extreme recession, is already due. There is no doubt that some of the repayments on these increased borrowings will be due in the lifetime of this Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If increased taxation is not on the agenda this year, one cannot say the same about the years 1979, 1980 and <Col N="437" /> 1981 with confidence as a result of the measures taken here today which have been greeted with such rejoicing by Deputies on the other side of the House.  The White Paper said the budget would underpin financially the policies outlined in the White Paper. We have now gone to the point of increasing our borrowings to 13 per cent of GNP from our figure of 11 per cent last year.  There is a proviso in the White Paper that this will be rectified before 1980.  If we are increasing our borrowing this year, this is to be rectified in an unspecified fashion in the years ahead.  I the White Paper and in the budget there are ominous signs that the way this bill will be paid off may not be quite so popular with some Government Deputies when the time of reckoning comes.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper we have a classical example of the stop-go policies which almost brought the British economy to bankruptcy and made Britain a mendicant at the World Bank.  I am not against a properly managed expansion of the economy but it cannot be pretended that this is a properly managed expansion of the economy.  The economy is expanding already; it expanded last year and it will continue on that course this year. To suggest that an open economy like ours can be primed further by borrowing without affecting the balance of payments will not be supported by many economists.  The conclusion must be that the origins of that kind of economic course had little to do with economic wisdom or with the national interest but had more to do with election promises given in panic and in a desire to return to office.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I categorised, perhaps innocently, the politics of the White Paper: in referring to the provisions in the manifesto I said that Fianna Fáil had engaged in &ldquo;bingo&rdquo; politics.  Perhaps the manifesto was the evidence of intention on part of the Fianna Fáil Party to gamble massively at the time of the election with the future of the country.  It could be said that Fianna Fáil entered the casino with the White Paper, that with today's budget the roulette wheel has begun to turn and a bet of almost <Col N="438" /> £821 million has been placed in a mad gamble by the Government.  The real gamble for the people commences with today's budget.</P>
    <P>Government Deputies may go away happy with the news they have learned today.  One would not have to be wildly partisan to suggest that the description of the White Paper given by the Minister for Economic Development and Planning as a &ldquo;gamble&rdquo; is a literal description of the course embarked upon by the Minister for Finance and the Government.  The point has been made that this was not always his attitude. He was very critical of the previous Government when they were forced to borrow in totally different circumstances, when it was correct to borrow.  Obviously it is correct to borrow when consumption is at a low level, when there is no chance of a pick-up in the economy, but it is not correct when the economy is expanding rapidly, as is happening in our case now.</P>
    <P>Of course questions will be asked. So far as we are concerned the area of most question will be with regard to job creation and there the Government are on very weak ground.  The main thrust in their job creation proposals is the construction area.  If one looks at the bulk of that public capital expansion occurring in the construction building area&mdash;an increase of almost £40 million&mdash;it is difficult to see that increase being carried forward in the whole construction and house building area.  We will be asking the Minister for Finance how much of that increase in the construction area is summed up in the £1,000 grant.</P>
    <P>It has been our sad experience so far that the £1,000 grant has not been a gain to the prospective house owner but has gone into the pocket of the builder.  Anyone who has watched house prices in recent months will realise that they have gone up approximately by the same figure as that given in the grant.  The only person one can call to book for that state of affairs is the Minister for the Environment who allowed it to happen.  The grant has not been of benefit to the ordinary young house purchasing couple. The price of new houses has risen. <Col N="439" /> dramatically and the result has been an increase in the profits of the builders.  Side by side with that, the building societies have reduced the amounts they are prepared to lend as a result of the availability of the £1,000 grant.  Prior to this some building societies were prepared to give a 90 per cent mortgage for new houses but now they have reduced the proportion to 80 per cent.  Thus they are frustrating the ostensible objective of the grant which was supposed to help people find a deposit for a new house. It would be interesting to know what proportion of the increase in the moneys allocated here is considered to be included in the £1,000 grant.  I do not see many new jobs flowing from the public capital programme.  There is no reliable estimate or forecast regarding the number of new jobs expected to be created as a result of the capital increase in building and construction.</P>
    <P>In many areas of the budget very specific action is undertaken, especially in relation to capital gains.  The Government's intentions are very clear. There is a completely unproven case that it will lead to job expansion.  The Minister for Finance said that many people who found themselves liable for the tax fled the country.  If they fled certainly there are 5,000 doughty survivors on 1 February 1978 who are paying the tax.  One wonders at the veracity of the statement that they fled the country because they were asked to pay a small amount of wealth tax especially when one considers that that tax was introduced in substitution for death duties.  One questions the priorities of a Government who could deal with such dispatch with such a matter when there are so many other inequities in the taxation system.</P>
    <P>I do not think the PAYE wage and salary earners will be impressed by the allowances made to them in this budget.  I do not think they will be struck by the fairness of the Government's actions here this afternoon.  It is all very well to say it would cost more to do something for them, that it costs commensurately less for the 5,000 people affected by the wealth <Col N="440" /> tax.  In all taxation matters it is the sense of justice that must not be outraged. I believe that sense of justice and fair play will be outraged when those affected by PAYE consider whose plight is the more grave, theirs with their families, or the plight of a tiny minority of 5,000 people.  I cannot believe they will be satisfied, that they will consider it a necessary response to their situation.  In the context of a budget that goes in for such heavy borrowing I do not think they will be satisfied that the Government have confined themselves to the allowances outlined in the manifesto. One must consider Dáil questions before Christmas.  I do not think questions throughout this year will reveal any greater evidence of action.</P>
    <P>One must wonder also about the fate of the Buy Irish Campaign expected to deliver 10,000 new jobs. Buy Irish campaigns have been engaged in by governments in the past with great enthusiasm but very little result.  Nothing this Government have done so far convinces me that their present campaign will meet with a fate different from that of similar ones in the past.</P>
    <P>It is interesting also to consider the gamble on which the Government are embarking in the context of what is happening in Britain.  We are still linked to sterling.  Despite the addition of a good deal of fresh economic talent in this Cabinet the view may persist there that the sterling to which we are linked is the same old sterling of the last few years, subject to periodic devaluation and that perhaps that may be depended on in the future to bale us out of certain difficulties that might otherwise occur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy is mistaken. It was he and his colleagues who depended on that, not this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway I want to tell the Minister about the sterling of the British Labour Government, now hard currency and will be in the foreseeable future.  Considering the interdependence of our trade with theirs it is interesting to ponder what happens <Col N="441" /> when we engage in economic strategy based on increased borrowing.  On the assumption that the old situation no longer obtains in Britain we are linked to a hard currency, as good as any there is.  It is not too fanciful to make a prediction that the logic of the course of massive borrowing, this extra priming of the economic pump, embarked on by the Government today reversing the downward trend of the previous Government, in times when the economy is expanding in the context of a British economy run on close monetarist lines, brings the possibility of a visit by a delegation of the IMF to Merrion Street in the next few years as they probe the weakness or otherwise of our currency in its link with that hard currency in Britain.</P>
      <P>The view of what has been done in the budget today may not gain much support at present.  This Government have at least four or five more budgets to go.  After all, they have the inestimable advantage of a majority of 20. Obviously they cannot bolt from any economic mess by suggesting that they lack a political mandate; they have all the political mandate they want.  There-fore, I suppose we can predict with safety that this Government will be here for almost their full term to carry out whatever economic salvaging may be necessary.  Whilst those points may not gain much support or credence here today, obviously I hope&mdash;because we can get rid of this Government without the aid of the kind of apocalyptic situation I am describing&mdash;it does not happen, but certainly I believe that the risk of it happening is brought appreciably nearer by the kind of economic policy being embarked on by the Government today.  It is all the more strange it is being embarked on by the Minister who spent so much of his time in opposition chastising the previous Government for their sins in relation to borrowing.  I do not wish to chastise him on that score.  That has been done far more authoritatively in the other House last week by Senator Whitaker.</P>

If it comes near to taking place this budget of the Minister will be seen as the first step on that road. In a budget which went in for such heavy borrowing, devoted to defraying current deficits, it is miserable to note a 10 per cent increase for the single man and old age pensioner&mdash;£1.50.  It is miserable to note that, even under the banner of reform, on an under-taking solemnly given to the women of Ireland, given to show their sincerity in contrast with the failure of the outgoing administration, unemployment assistance for women should not be made equal to that of men until 1 October.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have these reliable estimates of the number of new jobs we can expect in the building industry; a good deal of the money provided may go into the builders' pockets; it already has.</P>
      <P>The employment incentive scheme was extended recently to hotels, to the building industry.  So far no figures have been given as to the probable expansion of jobs in these areas.</P>
      <P>I said this budget did little to enhance the prospect of a National Wage Agreement.  Some might even say that it militates against the possibilities of that agreement since it does so little to meet certain of the public requirements made by trade union leaders. Neither do I believe that the taxation measures undertaken will be regarded as sufficient.  In an effort to gain agreement on a National Wage Agreement I cannot understand why the Government have not been more willing to listen to ideas on job creation from the trade union movement instead of rejecting out of hand, as they have through the Minister for Industry Commerce and Energy, the suggestion of a national development corporation. Instead we have had the consortium of semi-State bodies which, like the action committee on employment, seems to be expanding every day with yet an extra semi-State body representative attending.  That committee met last week and it will be our job during this term to find out exactly what they discussed last week other than the weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is strange that an idea of that sort cannot be accepted from the trade unions.  Apparently the view is held by this Government that the trade unions are good enough to be lectured to on wage moderation and that there <Col N="444" /> can be no two-way traffic in ideas.  The lecturing, the advice, all must come from the Government to the trade unions.  If the trade unions respond, even in a sincere fashion, on some innovation&mdash;an institutional change that they think might be helpful&mdash;it is rejected, and that has been the fate of the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>There is that last section of the Minister's speech in which he makes once more a thinly-veiled threat, before he breaks into Gaelic in his salute to the brothers, that this is not an ideological party, that if certain things do not happen there will be other consequences. As I say, in the past the Minister has duped himself on the origins of the present system of national wage agreements.  I do not believe that this Government have engaged in sufficient preparation for a national wage agreement.  I remember a period when the Ministers opposite sniped day in and day out, attacked and ambushed every week the possibility of agreement on a national wage agreement, sabotaged day after day in the Dáil.  We do not propose to do that.  I still hope for the signing of a national wage agreement because, having been involved in it, I know how important it is for the economy.  We do not need a calamity to put the Government out of office.  That will happen in its own good time.  I do not believe that this Government worked hard enough to get a national wage agreement.  First of all, in their eagerness&mdash;and it is relevant to mention the manifesto because the White Paper is the offspring of the manifesto as is this budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an old tradition in the Fianna Fáil Party of looking into your heart.  It was a method favoured by their founder. When he wished to know what the common people thought, he looked into his heart.  Whether the reading was always accurate is another matter.  The provisions of this budget and of the White Paper were in the direct tradition of looking into their collective heart and they decided on a 5 per cent figure for this year.  I am suggesting that at the very start, in their eagerness and for no more profound a reason than their desire to get back into office, they lifted that figure out of the air, as they have lifted the figure of 3 per cent leading to a switch in consumer spending on Irish goods.  It fitted in with their other figure and they are now at this point, without adequate preparation or consultation with the trade unions, attempting to browbeat the trade unions into acceptance of a figure decided on by them without consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am suggesting that the taxation reforms brought forth by the Minister today will not be considered satisfactory by the trade unions.  But I still say that whoever is responsible for contact with the social partners should meet without delay with the trade unions to see if a possibility exists for another national wage agreement.  I think they will be facing hard and searching questions.  They will be facing hard questions from this House within the next few days and they will certainly be facing them from the trade unions.  Whatever the attractive features of this budget are, fuelled as it is by massive borrowing when our nearest trading partner is battening down the hatches, it will be questioned whether this profligacy on the part of <Col N="446" /> the Government at this time impairs the capacity of the State in 1979 and 1980 in engaging in a corrective course, if that is necessary.  We do not have worries about the economy in 1978. Our worries are about the economy in 1979 and 1980.  Today we seem to be depriving ourselves by the measures outlined in the budget.  We seem to be going the wrong way about dealing with probable economic problems in the next few years if there is this downturn in the business cycle.  If the world trading environment turns against us we will not be able to take corrective action because we have decided on this course today.</P>
    <P>We would not be doing our duty if we refrained from pointing out these dangers in the stance adopted by this Government.  Unemployment is still intolerably high.  Even with the return of growth in all the major industrialised countries we see high unemployment. The question is whether it has more to do with structural problems in the economy itself.  If that is the case, then the kind of priming of the building industry, in which this Government put their main faith for restoring employment levels, may not be the appropriate response.  However, all has been decided in the manifesto and confirmed in the White Paper.  We went to the casino and placed a bet of £821 million in the names of Deputy George Colley and the Ministers of this Government.  The Opposition, particularly the Labour Party, will hold them accountable for the fate of that bet.</P>

      <P>Earlier I had been adverting to the fact that some changes are being made in this section to alter some provisions of section 42 of the 1947 Act.  The Minister indicated that in his view what are involved are merely changes of wording and that they have no substantial effect.  However, it is desirable that the House be made aware specifically of the changes being made in a case such as this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is only the Minister's assurance.  Before we agree to a change of this nature we should be told precisely what the change is.  It is very desirable that legislation should be introduced in this form of a composite section which updates and incorporates all existing law, stating it once and for all in a new form.  One of the difficulties in proceeding in that fashion rather than adopting the traditional means of amending legislation&mdash;that is, specifically removing particular words and substituting other words&mdash;is that in using the form which the Minister is using, and I applaud him for it, the change that is being made can be masked.  Unless one has the text of the 1947 Act in front of one and compares it line by line and word by word with the text of the 1977 Bill, one does not know the exact changes being made. This is the case here.  I have asked the Minister to say what the exact changes are in section 42.  He admits that changes are being made and says that they are changes of wording and not of substance.  He should be prepared to substantiate that by saying what the changes are so that the House may see that what he is saying is correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with unregistered land.  I am strongly opposed to one of the procedures laid down by the ACC.  This procedure has been carried on for a long period.  If a person obtains a loan from the ACC for the development of land of say, £5,000 or £10,000, if it is a family farm and there is a right registered on the folio in the Land Registry or on the title deeds and there is a claim in favour of a father and mother if they have signed over a farm to a son or daughter, this father and mother are obliged by the ACC to renounce their rights in favour of the ACC and they give the ACC first charge on the folio.  The point I want to make is the priority of charge in favour of the corporation is such that the ACC will have power to sell a farm, though the father and mother may have transferred the farm to their son in the form of a family settlement. It is wrong that a farmer acting in the best interests of his family and the farming community in general is obliged to take second charge in the registry of deeds.  This is one example and I feel it is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are often other rights in favour of sons or daughters.  The position is that the ACC have first rights and first charge on the family farm.  It is set out that the instrument effecting the charge is duly registered <Col N="456" /> in the registry of deeds.  The family farm can be sold if this person fails to come up with the money.  It can be sold against the wishes of everybody.  I am not satisfied with the position as it exists.  In circumstances where there are charges registered on title deeds and there are rights in favour of a father or mother or son and daughter, the ACC are wrong in that a farmer who wants a loan to develop his farm has to go to his parents and tell them that he cannot get a loan because of the charge on the title deeds.  He must ask his parents to renounce his rights in favour of the ACC.  This is morally wrong, though legally I can see the reason for it.  The ACC will not give the loan until the parents have renounced their rights.</P>
    <P>If the person fails to meet his repayments, the situation is that the ACC have the first rights.  It is a simple matter of those giving the money calling the tune but it should not be so in this instance.  The ACC should allow the rights of the family to stand on the title deeds.  We are continuing something that is wrong.  A person who needs money for development purposes is not in a position to argue because he is in a weak bargaining position and he must agree to the conditions.</P>
    <P>A difficult situation can arise.  If a father signs over his farm to his son and the son falls into difficult financial circumstances because a herd of cows suddenly goes down with tuberculosis or brucellosis what then is the position of the father who gave the farm to the son?  Can the farm be sold over his head?  The Minister cannot give an assurance to the House.  I believe this is something that should be dealt with because it is an important matter.  It is something that can easily arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Enright has said is quite correct.  A father signs away his rights.  There must be some security for that father in the situation Deputy Enright talked about.  The ACC have first claim, as the local authority have when someone builds a new house.  Money is got on an individual's security.  What is the alternative for the ACC?  Would that body accept two independent sureties? <Col N="457" /> People might not like that because they do not like letting others know their business.  This is different from what we were discussing earlier.  I do not know how one could mortgage the farm and leave the parents out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned there will not be many people in my area paying income tax.  I am trying to clarify the position in the case of a mortgagee who gets into difficulties. I know the ACC bend over back-wards in trying to get the money without compelling a man to sell up but they could compel a man to sell.  I would like to know if Deputy Enright has any suggestion to make which would meet the situation and enable the parents to remain.  Then the difficulty would arise that the ACC could not compel a debtor to sell to pay his debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Had Deputy Enright been here earlier he would realise that the points he has made are not relevant on this section.  The ACC are not given power of priority where there is a caution registered in the Land Registry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I think Deputy Enright's point is that the ACC insist on the assignor postponing the right of residence or a life interest before giving a loan to the assignee and he regards that as undesirable.  He argues that the ACC should give the loan subject to a right of residence in favour of the parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with priority of charges in favour of the ACC.  The first charge a parent <Col N="458" /> retains when he signs a farm over to his son is a charge in favour of himself and his wife.  There is a charge of residence and a charge of maintenance. There may also be a charge for a payment of £15 or £20 a week on the title documents.  Here we are dealing with priority of charges in favour of the ACC.  The first priority that body wants is a charge on the property and it will not give a loan normally subject to negotiation and the first charge will be that that body is charged as registered on the title documents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact it does not. The section provides:</P>
      <P> ... the charge (including interest and the costs and expenses of all legal proceedings instituted by the Corporation for the purpose of realising the amount at any time owing to the Corporation on foot of the charge) shall as against the land so charged be in priority to and shall override all estates and interests in and all incumbrances and burdens on the land which may be subsisting at the date of the instrument except the said periodic (Land Commission) sum....</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to agree with most of what I am saying. Deputy Callanan is from Galway and I am certain that if a person there is trying to get a loan from the ACC and a parent has a right on the folio registered in the Land Registry the person is normally compelled by the ACC to have the right moved to a second charge in the folio, giving the ACC the first charge.  This rule applies not only to the ACC but to the county councils.  For instance, in the transfer of a county council house they normally only agree to the transfer on a life interest.  The county councils leave the father with a life interest in the property with a fee simple passing to the son.  In the ACC, where a normal business transaction occurs between father and son, the father transfers to the son, and puts on a charge of perhaps £20 per week for residence and maintenance support.  At <Col N="461" /> that stage that is the first charge.  The ACC then move this charge to a second charge giving themselves priority.  That is the priority of charges in favour of the corporation that I referred to.  I feel that the corporation should not be allowed to have this priority.</P>

      <P>I have not had experience of a case such as that referred to by Deputy Enright, but according to what the Minister is saying the ACC in section 42 need not look for a first charge.  This is something new to me. As far as I knew if one were looking for a loan from the ACC the first charge of the place would go to the ACC.  Section 42 apparently gives the ACC the right to give loans to people and not necessarily to have the first charge.</P>

      <P> unless that person agrees to the contrary, be determined as if sub-section (1) had not been enacted.</P>

      <P>Because the Bill is providing for the cases the Deputy mentions and if private arrangements are made between the borrower and his parents, relations or descendants on the one part and the ACC on the other, that is a matter for themselves. Everybody knows, as Deputy Callanan has pointed out, whoever is lending money will look for priority in relation to what he is lending the money on, but where such cautions exist in the Land Registry the ACC cannot get priority over them.  Whatever private arrangements are made nobody could legislate for them and they do not have to be covered here.

      <P>According to what the Minister of State has said it is more or less optional for the ACC to give loans without getting the charges. If you write in that they cannot get these charges you are doing away with the power of negotiating a decent loan. If a man goes to the ACC for a loan and the law is that the ACC cannot get the charge of his father and mother on the folio, the ACC can say.  &ldquo;We will give you £X.&rdquo;  That may not be enough and he cannot give the full charge to get enough money.  You are throwing a lever back at the ACC to give limited loans which may not be enough for the development that the borrower wishes to carry out.  The ACC use the excuse that they cannot <Col N="464" /> get the full charge from the holding on account of the charges already on it. At present, according to the Minister, it is optional to do a private deal and give the whole charge, or a person can get a loan without the full charge.  The man will have to say that he cannot give the full charge, that his father and mother cannot help him even if they want to, if that is written into the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not understand how the section will work and I should welcome an indication of the type of situation which would give rise to this &mdash;the limitation on the manner in which money paid by the ACC can be used.  Obviously if a tenant for life borrowed money on the strength of his interest, which could terminate long before the investment financed by the loan bore fruit by way of income which would enable repayment of the loan, a problem would arise.  Under this section the money will not be paid to the tenant for life but to trustees where trustees exist, and in cases where such trustees do not exist and the valuation of the land does not exceed £100, the money will be paid to trustees to be nominated by the Minister for <Col N="466" /> Agriculture.  I should like to be told how this will work in practice.  I am not qualified to say whether this is a good idea because I am not very well acquainted with the settled Lands Acts. I cannot see why there is this provision limiting valuations to £100.  On the face of it it does not seem to make a great deal of sense.</P>

      <P>Section 47 deals with charges by the person who is a tenant for life under the meaning of the settled Acts of 1882 to 1890.  Sub-section (1) provides that any such person may borrow from the ACC for permanent improvement purposes which are defined in section 37.  The money has to be paid to trustees already existing.  Subsection (3) provides that if the borrowing has been done on behalf of an infant as full owner and no trustees exist, the ACC, with the consent of the President of the High Court may appoint two persons to act as trustees to handle the loan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should look at subsections (3), (4) and (5). Subsection (4) provides that in other cases where no trustees exist, provided that the rateable valuation of the prospective borrower does not exceed £100, the Minister for Agriculture may appoint two persons to act as trustees. Under subsection (5), the borrower, or trustees in the case of an infant, may charge all the lands comprised in the settlement with payment of the corporation loan, and such charge may rank as a priority charge in favour of the corporation.  Subsection (3) is new, as of now, the ACC are precluded from giving loans in such cases unless trustees are appointed by the courts. The precedure now proposed should be more expeditious.  There is a small change in subsection (4) which increases the rateable valuation limit from £60 to £100.  This accords with the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that tenancies for life are not very common.  They arise mostly in cases of widows whose sons or daughters will come into full or limited ownership in due course. First, I wonder can the Minister explain why it is necessary to have all these procedures of paying the money to trustees.  Secondly, what happens if the money is granted to a tenant for life who embarks on substantial expenditure with borrowed money in the natural anticipation that he or she has 40 years to live and will have adequate time to raise the amount of money necessary to repay the loan over the period in which the investment which has been made with the loan in the first place is bearing fruit and earning income?  What happens if that person dies prematurely?  How will the ACC get their money back?  Will the residuary owner, the person who comes into full ownership when the tenancy for life is finished, have to bear the cost of repaying the loan undertaken by his or her predecessor, entitled the tenant for life, to do things which he or she may not have wished would be done at all?  Is that equitable?</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied also that I understand the reference to £100 PLV as against £60 PLV.  I can understand that circuit court limits will be raised from time to time but I cannot see why circuit court limits should necessarily be followed in a case such as this.  I cannot understand why the situation envisaged in subsection (4) could not arise just as easily in the case of a farm with a valuation in excess of £100 and why the procedures in sub-section (4) would not be just as relevant in the case of a farm with a valuation of £101 as they are in the case of a farm with a valuation of £99. Perhaps the Minister would explain why this figure has been inserted.</P>

Does that entitle trustees to borrow for livestock?  I understand the words &ldquo;permanent improvement&rdquo; to mean improvement of buildings, fields, draining, building of sheds, silage pits, and so on.  What is the position of persons who have a life interest in land if they wish to borrow money to enlarge their herd of cows or to buy cattle or for some other purpose?

      <P>I will try to reply to some of the points raised.  First of all, the Settled Land Acts which deal with tenants for life provide for trustees. This was a means of protecting the future owner of the property, the present one being merely a tenant for life.  Deputy Bruton made a point about where the permanent improvement charges remain with the land. Presumably the permanent improvement will have enhanced the value of the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it then that &ldquo;permanent improvement&rdquo; includes the purchase of cattle, sheep, and so on.  They do not sound terribly permanent to me in that their life expectancy is limited to a number of years. Normally they are turned over in the course of three to four years.  Then they are sold.  They do not strike me as being permanent improvements.  If I have the Minister's word on it I am prepared to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the ACC the appropriate body to decide this matter? In effect, the decision as to whether something is a permanent improvement directly concerns only one person.  That is neither the ACC nor the tenant for life.  It is the person who, in the event of the tenant for life dying, will have to meet the cost.  He is the only person who is really concerned as to whether or not the improvement is genuinely permanent and therefore something from which he will benefit as well as having to pay for it.  It seems to me to be an unsatisfactory situation that the ACC can decide to grant a loan safe in the knowledge that they will get their money back anyway.</P>
      <P>I realise that the trustees under the Settled Land Acts or the trustees appointed by the Minister under sub-section (4) will have to satisfy themselves too that the money is being lent for a permanent improvement.  The decision as to whether or not the improvements are permanent rests with the ACC.  It might be desirable to say in the section, just to make assurance doubly sure and to ensure that the trustees do not act irresponsibly, that as well as the ACC, they shall be charged with satisfying themselves that the improvements are permanent and will, therefore, benefit the person who will inherit in the event of the tenant for life dying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the trustees under the Settled Land Acts that may be met in the principal legislation.  This sort of responsibility may be imposed on them there, but I should like to be satisfied by the Minister that it is.  I wonder if the same thing applies to the trustees appointed by the Minister for Agriculture. <Col N="470" /> The Minister has not answered my point about the £100 valuation limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It is clear that the object of section 47 is to enable the agricultural Credit Corporation to advance money to a tenant for life.  I concede that the general objective behind it is a laudable one because it is undesirable that land should remain derelict for the want of capital but the object must be for permanent improvement purposes.  I do not agree that the purchase of livestock comes within the definition of &ldquo;permanent improvement purposes&rdquo; or that the ACC have a general discretion.  The term &ldquo;general improvement purposes&rdquo; is defined in section 37 as follows:</P>
      <P> (a)  constructing, altering, improving or repairing buildings on the land,</P>
      <P>(b)  making on the land improvements of a permanent character calculated to increase, or facilitate or conduce to the increase of, the productivity of the land,</P>
      <P>I do not think the purchase of live-stock would fall into that category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The provision set out in (b) in my opinion refers to drainage, <Col N="471" /> the cutting of fences, the clearing of the land and so on.  The section also contains the following provision:</P>
      <P> (c)  any other purpose, which will be or is intended to be of permanent or long-term benefit to the farm business conducted on the land,</P>
      <P>(d)  paying the costs and expenses of borrowing the money secured by the charge and giving security for the repayment thereof;</P>
      <P>What is clearly intended here is the erection of buildings and fences and drainage work which will have a long-term effect.  Is there any obligation on the ACC&mdash;I do not think there is&mdash;to see that the money is spent on permanent improvements?  I do not think that is the case and perhaps that would be too great an obligation to place on the ACC.  What will happen if the ACC advance £5,000 to the tenant for life to do drainage work and instead of doing that work he goes off to Cheltenham and loses the money?  I assume the only remedy the remainderman has is to follow the tenant or his representatives and if he is the kind of man I have described that might not achieve very much because he might not have any money left.  I take it this is the case where the ACC will have to make up their minds whether to lend money to the applicant concerned. I assume they would act in a prudent manner and would advance probably only half the money until the permanent improvements were made.  I would have some concern for the remainderman if the ACC were to lend money left, right and centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are speaking about in this section is something that the ACC would deal with very infrequently, perhaps only once a year. It is important that there should be provision to allow the trustees or the persons nominated by the President of the High Court or by the Minister for Agriculture to obtain funds for the purchase of livestock for the farm.  It appears to me that the trustees will be <Col N="472" /> allowed to obtain money to erect farm buildings and to carry out reclamation work and so on but they will be restricted to borrowing money for these purposes. The ACC will have a charge on the property which is quite normal but the people concerned will not be able to obtain money from any other financial institution to buy livestock. Even though the trustees carry out improvement work they will be restricted from stocking the land because they will not have the money.</P>
      <P>Section 37 does not make provision for livestock and I cannot see how anyone says it does.  The Minister should make provision for this.  The trustees may be forced into a situation where they have to let the land.  I accept that land prices for lettings are exceptionally high but I think the land should be used for grazing on behalf of the people concerned.  In addition, if land is let on a regular basis, when the remainderman obtains it it may not be in a very good condition.  It is essential that there be some permission to include not only permanent improvements but also to make provision for the purchase of livestock.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision that the trustees may, with the consent of the President of the High Court, nominate two suitable persons, I should like the Minister to tell us who is regarded as suitable.  Will the people concerned have a knowledge of farming?  Perhaps the Minister will tell the House what he means by &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; in that instance?</P>

      <P>Many points have been raised and answered by the speakers themselves.  In section 37 we went through the definition of &ldquo;permanent improvement purposes&rdquo; and I shall repeat it for the benefit of the Deputies.  I said that the definition of &ldquo;permanent improvement purposes&rdquo; is being extended in this Bill.  Up to now such purposes were defined as improvements to land and buildings only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since other improvements, such as investment in extra machinery or live-stock, may also be of permanent value to the farm business, it is proposed to extend the definition to include any <Col N="473" /> purpose which will be, or is intended to be, of permanent or long-term benefit to the farm business conducted on the land.  It could include loans for livestock.  That is a matter for the ACC.</P>
    <P>I shall deal with a few of the other points raised.  Deputy Bruton asked about the £100 limit in subsection (4). He asked why it was included.  That limit is there&mdash;assuming that the bigger farmers could afford to go to court themselves&mdash;to save people under £100 valuation the expense of going to court.</P>
    <P>There was a point raised by Deputy Enright about the kind of people to be appointed.  I presume they will be people who will be in a position properly to manage the business of a particular farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but suppose the loan was initiated in 1973 when cattle prices were very good, when <Col N="475" /> there was a lot of livestock bought.  As we all know, the price of cattle collapsed in 1974.  If the tenant for life were to die of shock in 1974 when he discovered what happened to cattle prices, leaving the remainderman sitting there with what was allegedly permanent benefit&mdash;which might be calves one could hardly sell at that time; as we all recollect the market was not good for cattle that year&mdash;the remainderman might have felt he had not been adequately protected under the legislation.  That would not have happened in 1974 because this proposal was not law at that time.  I am in disagreement with Deputy Enright on this point and we shall have to sort it out before an amendment goes in.  Due caution should be exercised by all parties in this matter to preserve the rights of the remainderman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I agree with the Minister that possibly subsection (c) of section 37 is sufficiently wide to include live-stock because it refers to the business carried on.  The general idea behind this section was to enable the ACC to advance money benefiting both the tenant for life and the remainderman. There can be no doubt about that.  If the stock does not pass on to the remainderman, as it very frequently and almost certainly does not, I cannot see how advancing land money to the tenant for life to buy stock&mdash;which he may sell himself and charge that on the land, saddling the remainderman with it&mdash;can be equitable as between the tenant for life and the remainderman. That is something that would need to be examined and something <Col N="476" /> about which the ACC would need to be very careful.  It was never the intention in the Bill that money should be advanced to the tenant for life for his purposes alone, for his working of the land, that he could sell out the stock and, when the land passed into the remainderman's hands, would come to him saddled with debts and mortgages in respect of which he reaped no benefit whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <P>It is not possible at this stage to say when the proposed revised scheme for the transfer of pension rights between public sector organisations will be finalised.  The scheme is complex and more than 50 organisations have to be consulted about its terms.  In the meantime civil servants are allowed, subject to certain conditions, to reckon pensionable service in the Defence Forces, Garda Síochána and national and secondary teaching.</P>
      <P>Of course, existing arrangements under the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963, enable pension rights to be transferred between organisations designated under the Act as approved organisations.  Most State-sponsored bodies and the universities have been so designated.  The aim of the proposed scheme is to facilitate further transfers by introducing a greater degree of flexibility than is at present allowable under the Act.</P>

      <P>Staff relations in my Department are largely dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  There are two standing sub-committees of the Departmental Conciliation Council, consisting of management and staff representatives, whose function is to examine and recommend changes in staff-management communications procedures and in the disciplinary code respectively.  I have arranged for a comprehensive review of staff rules and regulations to be undertaken departmentally and the staff organisations have been invited through the Conciliation Council to give their views on changes they would wish to have considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Dublin Gas Company that the cause of the gas leak in Amiens Street last November was a fracture of an 8&rdquo; gas main.  The company state that the fracture was caused by road subsidence but I understand that this is disputed by the Dublin Corporation.  I am informed that the incident was exceptional in that an escape of gas which, in retrospect, would be regarded as a moderate one gave rise to much dislocation in the area.  A number of factors were responsible for this situation, the principal one being that at an early stage a Gas Company supervisor informed the Fire Brigade that the escape was a major one.  Another factor was that the gas entered sewers and telephone ducts and was detected at points 220 yards north and 50 yards south of the actual source of escape. As a result rail and road traffic in the area was disrupted because of precautionary measures taken by the Fire Brigade and the Garda.  Following the incident the company carried out a thorough investigation of its emergency procedures and hope that this will lead to improvements in the operation of the system.</P>
