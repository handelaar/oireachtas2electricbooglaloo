      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, through you could I ask the Taoiseach if, having had an opportunity to consider the matter further, he will follow the precedent set by the Minister for Home Affairs in relation to the postal dispute in 1922 by supporting the suspension of Standing Orders to allow a debate on a matter of urgent necessity, namely, the telecommunications dispute, or give Government time for this purpose?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered the suggestion made by the Deputy yesterday.  As the House is aware, when he raised the matter I indicated that it was my belief that a debate on the delicate issues involved in this strike would not be conducive to a settlement.  I still sincerely believe that a debate now would not be helpful. It is not my intention to accede to the Deputy's request.  Of course, that does not  the Deputy from repeating it next week if he wishes.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept the fact that this dispute is not one external to the Government and it is not one in which any movement towards a solution is occurring&mdash;the two circumstances in which his argument that discussion in the House might be unhelpful could have some validity.  But, as it does not fall into either of these categories, his argument against discussion of it when there is ministerial responsibility directly involved does not really hold or stand up.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he appreciates that, under the previous Government, there was a long-standing precedent that, on matters of urgent public importance, the Minister responsible would make a statement to the House, and the responsible spokesman would be given a reasonable opportunity of responding and there would be no further debate? Does he not think that at 5 o'clock this evening it would be appropriate, in view of the growing critical situation in the postal and engineering dispute, that the Minister should make a statement and allow the responsible spokesman for Fine Gael to reply and the spokesman for the Labour Party to add his contribution?  I do not think we would in any way exacerbate the situation.  At least as a minimum courtesy, the Taoiseach will appreciate that the House is entitled to know what is happening.</P>

      <P>I do not want to exacerbate the situation any more than the Deputy does, and I would not like to say anything which would in any way adversely affect the situation, bad as it is.  I should like to point out to the Deputy that his party had an opportunity of raising the matter&mdash; indeed I invited him to raise it under the priority rule for Private Members' Business&mdash;but he put down a motion on a different matter altogether.  I am not suggesting the situation is exactly the same now as it was then, but I still <Col N="685" /> repeat my sincere belief that any action in the House now would not be helpful, and I should like to leave it at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I suggested we will not know how good or how bad this budget is until we see what is contained in the next budget.  The date of the next budget and its contents will allow a verdict to be passed on the success or the failure of this budget.</P>
      <P>This budget has been described as a calculated gamble.  The gamble element in it is the fact that the Minister has relied to a very large degree on the private sector for the realisation of his aspirations.  I asked last Thursday if the private sector are unable to deliver the goods for whatever reason &mdash;and I outlined several, not least being the fact that coming out of a very high inflationary period and out of a very deep period of recession is hardly the time to expect the private sector to provide the level of investment, increased ouput and increased employment at which the budget is aiming&mdash;and if the private sector are not able to meet the aspirations of the Minister's budgetary policy, will they be expected to take the blame, or will the blame more properly be laid at the door of the architects of that policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that there has been an over-reliance on the private sector. While the gauntlet, as it has been described, has been thrown down to them, I am seriously in doubt as to whether they will be able to meet the challenge and the expectations the Minister has put forward to them this year.  I quite appreciate that there is a very valid theory to be put forward against over-reliance on the public <Col N="687" /> sector and against the public sector creating too high a proportion of new jobs.  I do not believe the Minister's suggestions in the budget about the private sector are attainable by them.</P>
    <P>I seriously suggest&mdash;and the experience of the election last summer bears this out&mdash;that there is not as great a work ethic among a great number of people as there was in years gone by.  It is regrettable that to some extent people are prepared to go for the soft option.  That seemed to be true in the election last summer.  If people were offered an alternative between a substantial rise in take home pay and an increased number of leisure hours, if the rise in pay were to involve additional work, I am afraid a section of the community would prefer not to get a rise in take home pay but to get further time off rather than having to work harder in order to earn more money.</P>
    <P>I am a little afraid that that sort of feeling in people's minds has been developed partly because of the high inflation levels that have been running over the last three or four years, and, to a large extent, because of the type of Dutch auction created during the election campaign.  The impression was given then that if there was sufficient electoral voice in favour of reliefs or grants, the political parties, in order to obtain power, would be prepared to meet those demands, whether justified or not.  If the general public are given that impression over a sustained period of time they will be inclined more and more to go for the soft option.  It is a valid and legitimate aspiration for any political party to want to gain power but a political party that tries to do this by offering soft options, by giving the impression to the public that if they exercised their electoral muscle strongly enough they would concede to them whatever they asked, cannot within 12 months turn around and introduce a budget such as this one.  That budget put it up fairly and squarely to the private sector, to the industrialist, the entrepreneur and working people, and the Government expect the public to react sharply and patriotically to make a success of their budgetary <Col N="688" /> policy.  I do not think that can be done if the people less than 12 months ago were given the impression that the soft options were there for the taking if they voted for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The concept, at a time such as this, of borrowing 13 per cent of GNP, or more than £800 million, is a heavy burden to ask any economy to bear, particularly an economy coming out of a recession and trying to shake off the worst effects of a world inflationary crisis.  It is questionable whether at this time when the country is trying to stay out of the high level of inflation and keep it low we should go back to borrowing at an all-time high level so as to finance a current deficit.</P>
    <P>I hope the budget works.  It is most important that the policy laid down by the Minister is successful this year. If it is not it will have serious repercussions in the coming years.  If the economies of our near neighbours and trading partners improve dramatically and ours slides back again because the budget does not work we will be put in a doubly disadvantageous position.  From the point of view that we should go into the eighties in a good financial position it is important that this budget is successful.  I do not agree with some of the thinking behind the budget or the reliance on the public sector.  I do not agree with the extent of the borrowing but nonetheless that is the Government's policy and, therefore, a duty devolves on all of us to ensure that it works for the country's sake.  A dilemma that faces all members in opposition is that from a political point of view one is inclined to hope that a government's budget will not work but from a national point of view there is a duty on all people elected in any capacity to urge the public to endeavour to make it a success.</P>
    <P>We must urge the industrialists, the entrepreneur, the business man, the other social partners and those in the work force to endeavour to increase output, create additional employment, work harder, accept the economic facts of life and accept the fact that this is the Government's budget, and to do all in their power to ensure <Col N="689" /> that the budget will succeed.  I said on several occasions here that to some extent the whole concept of democracy and the democratic institutions as we know them in Western Europe will be at risk over the next ten or 15 years and unless there is careful budgetary and employment policies, careful managing of the affairs and operation of government policies, governments, as we know them in democracies, may not be around in the same shape or form in 15 years' time.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the level of borrowing it is proposed to initiate in order to bring about the success of the budget.  Some consideration should have been given to an increased dependence on indirect taxation.  There should have been some real link between the level of our borrowing and the level of our current spending.  The level of our borrowing has been set because of the need to meet certain electoral promises made by the Government and because of the considerable gamble being indulged in by the Minister in order to try attain his goal. There does not seem to be a link between the level of borrowing and the level of spending.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that in the budget there was no consideration given to the raising of the £2,000 interest limit as far as borrowing by the individual is concerned, especially by the person who it was hoped would be encouraged by the budget, the people at senior level in industry.  The budget sought to get them to refire industry and provide additional employment. They are the sort of people who, through personal borrowings or borrowings to finance the operation of their cars or their mortgages to purchase homes, might be at the top level of £2,000, or beyond it.  It is fair to point out that that £2,000 limit was introduced in 1974 and the time is now more than ripe to increase that ceiling of £2,000.  I would have thought, in order to encourage that type of businessman in his personal outlook and in the way he approached his job whether he is self-employed or working for somebody else, that it would have been a much better concept to reduce across the board all <Col N="690" /> rates of taxation rather than scrapping the wealth tax.</P>
    <P>Some effort was made by the previous Government to reduce the top levels of income tax charged to the private individual.  I believe an encouragement should have been given to the private individual or to the management class to produce more and to employ more.  It would have been better to have given that encouragement by reducing the top levels of personal income tax rather than by the ill-conceived scrapping of the wealth tax in order to benefit a small number of very wealthy people many of whom are not employers and others of whom will not employ possibly another half dozen people because of being relieved of the burden of wealth tax.  Some of those could employ a lot more people but they are likely to go for the soft option: they are delighted they have not to pay wealth tax, but they will not do anything about employing even one extra man.  It would have been better to have gone for the much larger group of people who are in the direct business of employing men and who are likely to take on extra people and increase output.</P>
    <P>Wealth tax was introduced as part of a package which replaced the far more discriminatory estate duty.  There was a great clamour at that time particularly by the people who would be liable to pay death duties on the death of a parent or very close relative. The public gave a great welcome to the announcement that death duties were to be abolished.  Perhaps it could be argued at the time wealth tax was introduced&mdash;at a time when Europe and the world were becoming involved in a deep recession and inflation was becoming higher month after month rather than year after year&mdash;it might have been more prudent and certainly of better electoral advantage if the introduction of the wealth tax was suspended until the rate of inflation began to go down and the recession did not bite as deeply.</P>
    <P>The previous Government made a promise to scrap death duties and introduce a more equitable form of taxation. They grasped the nettle.  Surely <Col N="691" /> when we are shaking off that recession and interest rates are falling, this year was not the right year to abolish wealth tax.  This was the Government going for the soft option and hoping that the people who supported them financially in the election campaign last year would be pleased.  I do not believe it was a good financial ploy to abolish wealth tax now.  The nettle was grasped by us, and releasing it at this time is, I believe, the mark of a party with a basic flaw in their outlook.  If they gave a reduction in the high levels of personal income tax it would have been a much better way of stimulating people to work harder.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy's party introduce it again if they got back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The financing of a country's operation differs from time to time.  I believe the total saving to the public by scrapping the wealth tax is about £10 million.  I do not know what share of that will be enjoyed by some of the larger farmers and what share of it will go to other classes. The point has been made&mdash;I do not know how valid it is&mdash;that because of the change in the multiplier, lowering the threshold and having to pay for far more in rates a great number of farmers who up to this did not pay wealth tax and some of whom did not pay income tax as well as those who paid wealth tax will collectively this year pay more in taxation than was taken from them by wealth tax.  If that is the case surely there is an indication of sleight of hand on the part of the Government.  On the one hand, they tell the farmers they are abolishing wealth tax and, on the other hand, through a more complicated system they are hoping to achieve over the next 12 months a greater return and get more farmers into the tax net than there were through wealth tax.  That should be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rates for farmers are to be charged against income tax payments.  If a farmer shows a nil profit return and consequently is not liable for income tax at all he will still be liable for <Col N="692" /> rates.  If he was a businessman he would be entitled to charge rates against his accounts and carry forward his loss.  I am surprised, considering how very vocal the organised farming groups were during the last few years whenever there was a suggestion of any move whether here or through the EEC which might adversely affect them, that very little representations have been made on this.  I am amazed at the puny representations that have been made by the farming organisations on behalf of the middle farmer because he is the fellow who got hit hard.  He has been brought into the tax net.  The threshold is being reduced.  The middle farmer of £60 to £70 valuation has lost the agricultural relief and is being made to pay far more rates than before. The multiplier has been jacked up. There has not been a great deal of talk about that middle farmer from those who operate farming organisations although there was a great deal of talk in the last couple of years about the large farmer being hard done by.</P>
    <P>I find this quite extraordinary because all the political indicators are that if any group of farmers changed their political allegiance more than any other in the last general election it was the middle farmers; it was not to such a large extent the farmer who was already taxed or the farmer whose valuation was so low that he had never even heard of income tax.  It was the farmer of £60 to £70 valuation who was told consistently, day by day, by Fianna Fáil during the election campaign that if &ldquo;that other crowd&rdquo; got back they would tax him.  All the indications and surveys show that it was the middle group who changed their votes out of a fear, instilled in them by the party now in Government, that if the previous Government were returned they would be made pay tax. What they conveniently forgot to tell them was that Fianna Fáil would make them pay tax in a big way and pay rates in a big way and pay tax at a higher multiplier rate, that they would abolish the fertiliser subsidy and would double veterinary fees in factories, that they would remove the subsidy on cheese so that the housewife and the <Col N="693" /> producer would suffer.  They did not tell them that the remaining food subsidies would be scrapped, which I believe is part of the background budgetary strategy which has not yet been announced.  I am convinced that before 1978 is out, the other food subsidies introduced by the last Government to help the housewife, especially the poorer housewife, in meeting the cost of basic foodstuffs and to help the producer, will be scrapped.</P>
    <P>As I said in relation to something else yesterday, the man-in-the-street often says when a budget has been introduced: &ldquo;I do not know how they are going to take it from me but they will get it from me some way.&rdquo; That is one of the ways they will get it.  I am convinced that they are going to scrap the remaining food subsidies. If so, that should have been announced in the budget, just as the 28 per cent increase in the health contribution stamp, introduced yesterday, inappropriately by the Minister for Health, although it is really a taxation measure should have been announced in the budget, just as the intention to increase the level of health contribution was announced in the Financial Statement in 1977.  If it is not the Government's intention to scrap the remaining food subsidies, they should state that categorically.</P>
    <P>Democracy and democratic institutions in Europe over the next ten to 15 years are at risk.  Therefore, it is to be hoped that budgetary policies and Government management of affairs will be carried out at the highest level so as to rekindle&mdash;I deliberately use the word &ldquo;rekindle&rdquo;&mdash;public confidence in democracy and democratic institutions.  I am becoming increasingly fearful that the public are losing faith in democratic institutions; that they are losing faith in the ability of this House and other democratic parliaments to deal adequately with day-to-day crises as they arise and with long-term difficulties.  The deliberate blocking and exclusion of consideration by this House of, for instance, the serious economic and social difficulties being created by the existing telephone crisis, the blocking <Col N="694" /> of discussion by this House and of possible solutions by the House&mdash;all that sort of thing&mdash;shakes public confidence in the ability of the House and consequently of elected representatives and ultimately of democracy to work in a meaningful way. That is happening not just here but in Britain and the continent. It is happening throughout the democracies.</P>
    <P>Those who more than anybody else are losing confidence, if they ever had it, in democratic institutions are the young people.  They are losing it because of their disillusionment after the high promises offered to them when they were school-leavers and as they went through school, as compared with the opportunities available to them and the moneys they can attain and the prospects that would appear to be available to them in the workplace, not just in this country but throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the problem of youth unemployment has been concerning the leaders, not just of small economies like ours, but of the strongest economies in Europe and has been discussed at length by heads of State in the European Economic Community on more than one occasion. No one has been able to suggest a solution or to put forward a plan to create sufficient jobs to provide full employment or near full employment for young people.  Even the strongest economies will not be able over the next ten years to provide sufficient jobs for their young people.  This country has the highest proportion of young people relative to the entire population in Europe.  Perhaps for some historical reason, perhaps because of the traditional blood-letting of emigration, the make-up of our society is different from that of some of our European partners.  Emigration is no longer a soft option of a Government or a soft answer.  In addition to having the highest proportion of young people relative to the population, we probably have the highest proportion of young persons unemployed in the EEC.  I am inclined to think that we have fewer real plans and less real hope of providing full employment for that high <Col N="695" /> proportion of young persons than many European countries have.</P>
    <P>I do not want it to appear that I say this in a political way but I do not think that the sort of things the Minister for Labour has been talking about that or the Youth Employment Action Team has been talking about or that are contained in the proposals put forward by that team which the Minister outlined in the House last Thursday and which were reported in the Press over the weekend will satisfy young people or restore their faith in democracy.  I do not believe that the thousands of young people will be satisfied when they are told that 800-900 will be given crash courses with a view to becoming physical fitness instructors and will be sent out in a temporary capacity to train other young persons in physical fitness.  I do not believe that they will regard that as the panacea for all their ills.</P>
    <P>I agree that it is a good idea that local authorities are being allowed to take on apprentices.  That will amount to 150 permanent jobs.  I do not think they will be satisfied with being told that 20, 30 or 40 of them will be allowed to become involved in a project in Ballyfermot doing a census.  A census provides useful statistical information but all the jobs the Minister announced, something in the region of 1,000 altogether, apart from the 150 apprentices, are temporary and of short duration.</P>
    <P>The fourth aspect of the scheme, to which I did not refer, is a scheme to have young people work on environmental projects, building parks, clearing up definite areas, working on the foreshore and beaches.  This is a very good idea in concept and useful for those of us who are members of a local authority; we shall get many jobs done that we have wanted done for years and it will improve the general ambience and appearance of scenic areas but it will not create a long-term solution for young people.  They will be offered 1,000 part-time jobs, some of which will run for a few months, some perhaps for six months.  That will not meet the expectations of those who are unemployed, those who have never <Col N="696" /> worked, those coming out of school next year who will have no employment waiting for them.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that in ten years' time some people could be well into their 30s and never have worked in their lives, never have been in gainful employment; their only source of income, apart from their parents, since they left school will have been the State in some form, unemployment assistance or welfare allowances.  That will not improve the general character of the Irish people or make them have confidence in democracy.  It will not induce them every three or four years to continue to vote for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour.  We can all come in here and not be allowed talk about strikes, about issues that are putting people out of employment until such time as those issues are over and dead. People will not continue to accept that. They will not accept Deputy MacSharry as a Minister of State or Deputy Creed as Chief Whip for the Opposition.  They will not be interested in those things if our coming here and going through these exercises does not ultimately provide them with jobs and put a wage packet in their pockets on Friday evening.  We are failing and we are not alone in failing, because our counterparts in Europe are failing.</P>
    <P>We all regularly get a very good magazine, the <i>OECD Observer</i>, which deals at length with youth unemployment in the OECD countries and the top level conference of OECD Ministers which took place some time ago in an effort to provide solutions for the youth unemployment problem, and the conclusions they came to are frightening as to how to cure European unemployment&mdash;the creation of jobs through increased economic activity whenever possible, the intensification of special measures to increase employment opportunities for youth and without breaching existing labour protection of young workers and an improved transition from school to work.  That is the best OECD could do towards suggesting how Europe is to provide millions of new jobs over the next ten years.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I do not know the solution; I am not just critical of this Government. <Col N="697" /> I am reflecting on the fact that democracy is at risk and every Government and every political party had better realise that and get down to meeting the needs and legitimate aspirations of young people if they want to continue to have democracy work and be accepted and respected. For instance, I do not think that young people who were promised a £20 million scheme to create employment last summer during the election campaign will be very enamoured of the budget announcement in January of a £5 million scheme.  I am not sure that a £20 million scheme would have met their wants but they will certainly feel more frustrated and more sour and disillusioned when they discover that the promised £20 million scheme turns out to be a £5 million scheme.</P>
    <P>In regard to the document &ldquo;Principle Features of the Budget&rdquo; I was a little surprised to find in relation to the claim that 5,000 extra jobs had been created in the period between the Government taking office and the end of the calendar year, that it was claimed that just 5,000 extra jobs had been created.  There was a breakdown into small figures such as 30 people directly employed on hospital building, 500 here and 140 there, and all that came to 2,170 in the public sector. Underneath that there is a column: SDA loans, income limits and new house grants&mdash;1,000 extra jobs, direct and indirect to the end of 1977.  Where did the extra 1,000 jobs come from? I do not see how they came in the public sector through the increase in the loans or new house grants.  I do not see how 1,000 jobs can be clearly shown to result from the increase in new house grants in the private sector. If they are there, I am delighted, but it looks as if the Government were in the region of 1,000 jobs short and the type of area that cannot be identified and in which things cannot be proved or disproved is an area like this and it is a simple area in which to include 1,000 extra jobs and say: &ldquo;There they are; we created them and we have reached a target of 5,000.&rdquo;  This deserves some explanation.</P>
    <P>As regards employment generally in the next decade I think the official <Col N="698" /> figure for the work force at present is in the region of 107,000.  It is interesting to look at the figures put forward by the City of Dublin Planning Office and also by the County of Dublin Planning Office, based on the existing population of Dublin City and County together with a very modest figure for net immigration, a figure of 5,000 per annum moving into Dublin from the country.  We estimate that probably a higher number than that have moved in on average over the past ten years but, assuming an average 5,000 per year moving into Dublin over the next ten years and taking the existing population&mdash;not the 1971 census&mdash;as the two planning officers jointly know the population to be within the nearest 20,000 or 30,000 it is estimated that by 1991 there will be a total work force in Dublin of 460,000 people.</P>
    <P>For that work force there will be 392,000 jobs available and that will only be so if between now and 1991 we manage in Dublin, through the IDA.  Government agencies, and local authorities to create 3,750 jobs a year. I take that figure because the highest average rate of job creation ever reached in Dublin was 3,750 and that was in the period 1961-1971.  We have never got anything like that since.  If we could get back to equalling that figure between now and 1991 there would be a total shortfall of 68,000 jobs for the work force.  If we created 2,500 jobs a year in Dublin&mdash;the second highest average of new jobs created in Dublin ever&mdash;per year every year until 1991, there would be something in the region of 93,000 jobs short, almost as many as there are officially unemployed in the whole country.  That is what I am talking about when I say democracy is at risk.</P>
    <P>We are talking about up to 100,000 of the workforce in Dublin being unemployed in 1991, some of whom will never have worked.  We are talking about between one in four and one in five of the total number of people available for work without a job; we are talking about a very high proportion of them never having had a job, some of them in their thirties or forties who have never had money in their pockets unless it was State <Col N="699" /> aid in some form or another.  Do we think they will meekly go out every three or four years during the elections to vote for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour?  They certainly will not. In my view this budget has not done anything to help improve their belief that democracy will work for them. These people are already in our Dublin schools.  It is not a case that these numbers can be controlled through an alteration in the birth rate and there is nothing in this budget to impress those potential unemployed.</P>
    <P>I turn now to social welfare benefits.  It is wrong to give an across-the-board increase in social welfare as was done, whether it is for 15 per cent, 10 per cent or 5 per cent.  Of course that is a simple thing to do. The Minister for Social Welfare does not have to worry about it too much nor do the people administering the scheme.  Calculations can be done very easily.  Because of very high unemployment it could be suggested that certain people on social welfare benefits are getting too high a level, while there are many more socially deprived people who are getting too little, and sometimes nothing at all from the social welfare system.  To give a 10 per cent across-the-board increase is in no way improving their situation or even allowing the situation to stand still.</P>
    <P>The widow, the old person, the weak, that small number of people who are not organised and do not have an electoral voice, are not able to shout for themselves or exercise political muscle on political parties at election time and force them to offer them a soft option.  They will never change a Government.  They cannot put enough political pressure on a political party which is so mad to attain power that they will make any offer they think will bring them an extra block of votes.  It is ridiculous to think they will keep pace with the ordinary workforce or even with some of the people at the other end of the social welfare scale who are also getting a 10 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>The old age pensioner and the widow will not benefit from the soft <Col N="700" /> options given to the workers.  They will not benefit from the abolition of car tax.  The old age pensioners will not benefit from the increase in the personal income tax allowances.  Unfortunately from their point of view most of them are not near the level of being able to pay income tax.  They will not benefit from the abolition of rates because people on very low social welfare benefits have not been paying rates for years.  They do not have the additional real benefits that might accrue to a worker who might be enticed into agreeing to an 8 per cent wage increase because he is also getting these benefits.</P>
    <P>To offer 10 per cent to the aged, to the widows and the weak who cannot fight for themselves, is making them worse off than they were last month.  That is not the mark of a Government with a social conscience.  That is not living up to the promise the Government made that they would keep all social welfare benefits at least in line with the cost of living.  They will not be in line with the cost of living nor will pensioners be in line with the people in the workforce and consequently that it is very unfair.</P>
    <P>It was regrettable that there was a return to the concept of a once yearly increase in social welfare benefits. There should have been an allowance that from the autumn there would be a review if the cost of living had materially changed and there would be provision for an additional payment to social welfare recipients, especially the weaker members.  That was not done.  During the general election this Government clearly said they would keep all social welfare payments at least in line with the cost of living. There was no increase in or mention of children's allowances.  They are part of the social welfare code.  By not giving that increase the Government clearly broke their manifesto promise.</P>
    <P>Another promise was made in the manifesto&mdash;to remove all areas of discrimination against women.  No steps have been taken to make women equal. In this budget not even lip service was paid to them.  A few weeks later the Minister paid lip service to the well-heeled and articulate women.  I <Col N="701" /> doubt if many of those women the Minister so roundly condemned benefited from the abolition of the wealth tax.  The Minister benefits every year when he does his financial sums because he is making them pay tax on the double by taxing them through their husband's taxation accounts.  During the elections they must not have put on enough political pressure or shouted loudly enough or perhaps they did not make a big enough contribution to party funds.</P>
    <P>Another undertaking was given in the manifesto in relation to social welfare and that was that Fianna Fáil would introduce additional tax concessions to encourage the development of voluntary health insurance.  I am not sure what that means because at present payments to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are allowable against tax.  The voluntary health insurance mentioned in the manifesto was not in capital letters so perhaps it was being suggested that additional forms of insurance would be tax-allowable also.  I tabled a question on this to the Minister for Social Welfare and was told it would not be answered here because it was more appropriate to the budget.  When the Minister is replying perhaps he would explain what this additional tax concession to encourage the development of voluntary health insurance was all about, why it was not mentioned in this budget and when it is going to be introduced.</P>
    <P>As far as social welfare is concerned, I have been calling for a long time for index linking of all social welfare benefits and of tax allowances.  This should be done after ensuring first of all that social welfare benefits are equitable, that those at the weaker end will be given a fair share of the cake.  We are moving further away from that concept when we give a flat 10 per cent increase across the board and say: &ldquo;Forget about them now, we have done something.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For the sake of the country I hope the budget will work, but I have doubts because of the level of borrowing. The Minister for Finance has committed the Government to a drastic reduction in the current account deficit and I do not see how that can be <Col N="702" /> done if the budget fails.  If there is not an increase in employment and an expansion in the economy, if £416 million of borrowing is to go to finance current account deficit, disaster could ensue.  The taxpayers and the general public will suffer greatly if this budget fails because it will mean a series of severe budgets.  If it fails because of over-reliance on the private sector, the businessman will be blamed and the Government can say: &ldquo;We gave you the opportunity and this is all your fault.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is why the concept in the budget is wrong, the concept of over-reliance on the private sector and on borrowing, and the amount that is to go to financing current account deficit, which is too high.  However, as I have said, from the country's point of view and in the interest of the continuance of democracy I hope it will be successful. That is not probable but I would exhort everyone to play his part in making it a success, although that is not a politically attractive thing to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the advantages of speaking late in this debate is that one has been afforded an opportunity of seeing how the budget has been received in the country. There is little doubt in my mind that the reception of the budget in every sector of the community has been one of encouragement and satisfaction. The budget is incentive charged and at this moment is acting as a catalyst to stimulate the economy on a day-to-day basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economy has been under siege in the past two years by a variety of factors.  Prior to last June private enterprise here was suffocated in a climate of raging inflation.  It is very well to refer to international inflation. Anybody who has examined international inflation figures will appreciate that Ireland stood out as the poor relation of Europe in this respect.  Continental countries had put a halter on their inflation rates and had monitored them in recent years. Not so with us, prior to last June. From 1973 to 1976 we had a cumulative inflation rate of 75 per <Col N="703" /> cent, so talking about international inflation rates is completely erroneous. An attitude was cemented in our business community that it was no longer worth their while to invest in expansion endeavours, in business enterprise.  Our economy was choking to death.</P>
    <P>The set of proposals in the budget are carefully designed to stimulate the economy and to create jobs directly or indirectly.  The previous speaker mentioned a soft option and said that people would take it rather than taking work when work is offered to them. I challenge this emphatically.  Any psychologist would argue that the right to work is one of the five basic needs in man: he has the right to fulfil himself in work.</P>
    <P>This is why the entire emphasis of the budget has been placed on creating jobs.  Otherwise dissatisfaction sets in and people are not content with the soft option.  The budget has shown confidence in the people.  It has spelled out that the Government have no desire to hamper human endeavour, that they are relying on private enterprise, and of course rightly, because the very essence of democracy is dependence on a healthy economy, where private enterprise is working at full strength and is not being choked by a high level of bureaucracy.  The lungs of society cannot breathe if burdened by too much interference, by unnecessary bureaucratic reins.  As I have said, work is the basic option and that is what Fianna Fáil want to give to our people.  From that everything else will follow.</P>
    <P>A serious error was made by the previous administration when they cancelled the idea of having a national census, something essential for future planning.  It was a serious omission and it is heartening to note that we are to have a census in the near future.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most urgent need in recent years was to have a review of the level of personal allowances.  In the three-and-a-half year period prior to 1976, with cumulative inflation running at 75 per cent, personal allowances were increased by only 33 per cent.  This of course had a very serious <Col N="704" /> effect on wage and salary earners who suffered a severe loss in purchasing power.  The money was not of any use to them.  The wage or salary earner was like the rat on a spinning wheel&mdash; the faster the wheel spun the faster the rat had to move to stay still.  That was very bad because it created a demand for higher and higher wages.</P>
    <P>Perhaps even worse than that is the demand from certain employees for wages and salaries to be negotiated on a take-home pay basis as they find that their money is not worth its salt from a purchasing point of view.  The Minister for Finance must be credited for his generous review of these allowances, which amount to nearly 60 per cent in the case of married persons.  I would like to see every consideration given to large families.  There is a tendency nowadays towards smaller families, but I would like to see a great emphasis being placed on larger families and the benefits if possible being directed in future planning to this area, because they are the hardest hit.</P>
    <P>Only last Sunday some very prominent businessmen pledged their confidence in the budget and showed their willingness to invest very large sums of money again in industrial expansion. This is what is happening.  Anybody in business will tell you that the dark clouds have lifted and that at last there is an air of freedom and a willingness on the part of the Government to show that they are prepared, if the effort is put in, to give every push they can to increase their businesses.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the wealth tax, the title of which I have always felt was a misnomer.  The sum involved in its abolition will be £8.5 million in 1978, and this sum will be easily offset by the inflow of capital back into the country over the next year or two.  The capital gains sliding scale has shown a very imaginative approach on the part of the Minister for Finance.  A careful examination of the sliding scale will readily show that by it families who have spent many years building up their assets will not be penalised by being forced to sell in order to meet the burden of a crippling demand to finance capital gains.  This is an imaginative approach to the subject <Col N="705" /> and is to be welcomed.  On the other hand, rightly so, this measure will catch the person with a get-rich-quick mentality, who capitalises on the short-term, overnight gain.  This type of speculator is of very little use to the economy.  I would also like to refer briefly to the exemption of our heritage houses which is also a very welcome move.  Ireland is not a vastly wealthy country.  It is a young nation. Padraic Pearse said that any time an Irishman would see a penny he should blush.  In other words there was an attitude that Ireland was not entitled to have any wealthy classes.  Of course we are.  We have self-respect. Our nation is entitled to stand on its assets.  We are not a wealthy nation at all in the European context, yet this taxation that was finger-pointing to the little wealth that existed in the country was to penalise on a year-to-year basis whatever assets were held here.  The real point about wealth tax, and it has not been referred to, is that it was of very serious concern to many middleclass people even though they did not have to pay it at the time.  They could see in the future that perhaps some radical Government would turn the switch and bring a great many people into the net of this taxation for reasons that could range from trendy leftist policies to those embracing totalitarian and more extreme views. It must always be borne in mind that the vast majority of Irishmen and women spring from a farming or rural background, and some element of property ownership has been part of that background; so much so, that even when they find themselves no longer part of the rural community from which they came they still retain the idea of property ownership, and the concept of taxing whatever holding they have is alien to that idea.</P>
    <P>I must also stress that any Government who initially proposed a rate of 2½ per cent, the rate proposed by the Inter-Party Government, must either have no knowledge of the effect of such a proposal or, in the alternative, they had made a conscious decision to abolish the concept of private ownership of property.  The wealth tax was put into operation at a very high <Col N="706" /> inflation level, which meant that within a year or two so many people would have been brought into this taxation that it would not have been directed at the few so-called wealthy people. Everyone would have been paying it. Fortunately, the electorate last June were unremitting in their opposition to this taxation.  The legislation was adjudged by many senior lawyers to have aspects which infringed on our Constitution.  It has also been alleged that the abolition of wealth tax would sound the death knell of this Government. Certainly anyone with common sense can readily see evidence to the contrary, in a great inflow of money back into the country.  All are delighted to realise that inflation is coming down at such a rate.  At the moment we are apparently running at a 9.5 inflation rate.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister for Finance to examine the possibility of introducing a 25p coin into our currency as quickly as possible.  Many business people find there is a need for such a coin, as the gap between the 10p and 50p coins is too great. We read about a shortage of 50p coinage due to meters and so on that have been graded up to these coins. This could be met if a 25p coin were introduced.  Many charities would benefit substantially from the introduction of a 25p piece.  Most international currencies adopting the metric system have a 25p or similar coin denomination in their range of currency.  This, in turn, would relieve the state of the necessity to contribute in these areas.  People are reluctant to contribute 50p because they are unable or unwilling, yet they would be willing to contribute 25p to charities.  They feel 10p would be too low.  This area is worthy of examination.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with a matter which is so important that it needs continuous reiteration, that is, the Buy Irish campaign.  The Minister and many other speakers referred to the need for a more vigorous approach to this campaign.  I welcome this.  It cannot be stressed too often that an extra 3p in the £ spent on Irish goods produces 10,000 new jobs.  I have always felt salesmen hold the key to <Col N="707" /> the success of a Buy Irish campaign. It is very difficult for the housewife on a day-to-day basis to be constantly aware of the type of goods she is buying, Irish, foreign, and so on.</P>
    <P>I was very encouraged this morning to read in the papers that the Government will spend £1 million through the Irish Industrial Council for a promotional campaign in selling Irish goods.  We will have to air this idea of selling Irish continuously.  Goods placed strategically in supermarkets sell automatically.  Owners of supermarkets tell people readily that, if they place their goods on a particular part of the supermarket floor, they sell easily.  It is all very fine to appeal to people to buy and sell Irish, but I would like the Minister to examine the feasibility of rewarding purchasers and sellers of Irish goods with tangible gifts to make this campaign succeed. If the vendors of these products set out to do this seriously, I see the ratio of Irish goods reaching a 50:50 level very quickly.  That is not the case at present.</P>
    <P>Will this happen of its own accord? I do not think so.  We are to spend £1 million in promoting the sale of such goods and this is an excellent approach: vigorous advertising, constantly keeping the idea before the minds of the sellers as well as the buyers.  Could the Minister examine the possibility of giving some type of saving stamps to purchasers of Irish goods?  The housewife would be delighted to participate in such a scheme, and so would children.  They buy something Irish and they actually receive some reward.  It could be a type of Green Shield Stamp, an Irish Savings Stamp, some tangible gift.  The idea would catch on very quickly.  This is an area which could be examined, and perhaps a pilot scheme could be introduced for certain products.</P>
    <P>There is a national aspiration to participate from the patriotic point of view and to feel people are doing something for their country.  Some reward would spur them onwards. Green Shield Stamps are given to purchasers of goods generally, and why <Col N="708" /> not have some type of saving stamps for buying Irish?  Bonuses could also be given to stockists of Irish goods. We have to make this campaign succeed. We can advertise, but if people do not get their teeth into this and make it work on a day-to-day basis, the effort will have been in vain.  Perhaps there is some way of reducing the level of VAT on Irish products.  If the Minister could come up with some idea which would not contravene EEC regulations it would be very useful from a practical point of view.  This type of thing operates in other countries and gifts are given for the purchase of home-produced goods.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the self-employed. A few short years ago, in a very uncertain and disturbed economy, an organisation was formed in Ireland, the Irish Federation for the Self-Employed, which represents nearly 320,000 employers engaged in a wide variety of activities, shopkeepers, self-employed professional people, directors of small companies, and so on.  The frustrations voiced by those people fell on deaf ears until this Government were returned to office.  Today they are trading and working in a 9.5 per cent inflation situation, two-and-a-half times less than when that organisation was formed.  It is now opportune to call directly on people like self-employed people, who laid off employees when they had to, to set about righting the situation and to actively re-employ people to increase their business enterprises.  The attitude cannot be to take all and give nothing.  People have a social obligation.  We know what the alternative is.  We know what we could return to unless this effort is made.</P>
    <P>The Government have set about a job creation programme.  They have put their confidence in private enterprise and the self-employed.  As they did last weekend, private enterprise must respond actively and continuously.  If we all put our minds and our wills to the proposals and work with the incentives afforded to us in the budget, we will find a completely different situation this time next year.  There is every reason to <Col N="709" /> feel Ireland can move forward rapidly if we have confidence in ourselves. We are not going to get our economy expanding unless our base level is economically sound, and that is what the Minister has stressed.</P>
    <P>The Government will employ directly 11,000 people and will generate as many jobs.  There is no point in trying to play about with figures because we are on target this year with our job creation programme. My call is to private enterprise to respond as actively as possible.  It has been given its greatest chance by a forward-thinking Government and it is idiotic to suggest that the Minister for Finance is gambling.  It is ridiculous.  Democracy was founded on private enterprise and the pioneering spirit of people who were prepared to get out and work but not be spoonfed.  The Government have taken one step back and have said to private enterprise: &ldquo;There is your stage on which to operate.  You are being given every possible encouragement and you should now take up the challenge&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that business has been shell-shocked and numbed into a feeling of asking itself if it is worth while going forward.  It is now obvious that it is worth while going forward.  The signs are there that people are taking up that challenge again but it will take time.  We must not look to the State for all the answers; we must look inward also and state that we are prepared to make the effort if it is worth while.</P>
    <P>As far as the social benefits are concerned it is obvious that as our economy expands and the nation becomes more prosperous all will become more prosperous.  That is an obvious and straightforward fact for anybody to understand.  If the economy slides back again the underprivileged will be hardest hit, but if the economy moves forward everybody will gain with that expansion.  That is a principle that is so obvious to see that it does not need further clarification.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> No society can live without an ideal to inspire it or a clear understanding of the principles that guide its organisation. More than any other people the Irish feel this basic need to understand. Once citizens know by what principles they are being governed and the future they are headed towards obviously there will be a more settled attitude in the country.  There is no doubt that this budget will have the way forward for the country and give this clear understanding of the principles that guide the organisation of our economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The economy did not crack.  We are all here as solid as ever.  I understand that the budget debate is the big event of the year in this House.  Many people expected to get something out of the budget but one thing that ran through it was the fact that the better-off come out on the right side.  We have had many a description, particularly by the media, of the budget that it was an economic gamble, a gambler's budget but I believe the budget, in one way or another, will affect the economy and future budgets.  The reason I say that is because I believe it was based on the Government trying to fulfil their election promises, but at the same time they deceived the general public by introducing certain measures.  One of the biggest single issues facing our country at present is the employment of those on the unemployment register and the employment of our young people leaving school.  I question the policy of the Government in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker made plea after plea to the private sector.  He said they must come forward now, but he did not tell us the areas in the private <Col N="711" /> sector that must come forward.  With the exception of the building construction industry the other areas were not specified.  I must compliment the Minister for his initiative in the area of building construction.  The private building sector is an important area and one which I felt during the last 18 months of the previous Administration was somewhat neglected.  However, we must not fool ourselves.  We will not build a sound economy on bricks and mortar and there is more to achieving that aim than helping the construction industry.</P>
    <P>One of the major factors in the budget was the decision to borrow 13 per cent of GNP.  That was a serious step simply because so little of that money will go to the production side of our economy.  Even the £5 million set aside for the creation of jobs among our young people is questionable as far as the production side is concerned. It has not been spelt out whether it is going to do this always.  It is my opinion that the creation of jobs should ensure that they are not just created for one year and that when they are created they are producing something the following year.</P>
    <P>It is only right that we should look at the figures for the past seven or eight years on the different sides of the economy.  In 1973 industrial employment stood at 213,000 while at the end of 1977&mdash;the figure is an estimate&mdash; it stood at 210,000.  The civil service, taking into account all those on the Government payroll, was 127,000, but by the end of 1978 it is estimated that it will be 161,000.  It is grand to create jobs of this type and to tell all Departments to expand but we cannot lose sight of the fact that jobs in the industrial sector have declined.  All new jobs created in the civil service this year will be financed by borrowing.  They will have to be maintained in the years ahead and will not contribute any production to the economy.  I question this policy because the economy in future years will have an increasing load to carry because of the creation of all those jobs in the civil service. There should be a proper balance.  We have borrowed £8 million for the civil <Col N="712" /> service.  We are told there will be a scaling down of this borrowing but when we borrow for the civil service this year to create jobs within the civil service those jobs will have to be maintained and more money borrowed next year.</P>
    <P>Encouragement is given to the private sector for job creation.  What happens if this does not work and the private sector do not come up with the jobs that are expected?  The Minister for Finance said he will review the situation but he has not said what steps he is prepared to take.  It is only right that we should be fair in our speeches, although I have heard very little fairness from the Government side.  I welcome the increased allowances given in the budget to the PAYE sector.  A great many of the PAYE earners hand over their earnings to their wives after the deductions are made.  They will now have more money to hand over.  What about those workers who are under £50?  Many of those people have large families and have not got one penny out of the budget.  They feel very aggrieved. There have been many compliments paid to the Minister for the relief he has given to those on PAYE but I can assure him that the people I have spoken to are very aggrieved at the lack of interest shown to those under £50 a week.</P>
    <P>The majority of those people have no cars so they do not get any benefit from the tax taken off cars.  They will not get much benefit from the rates being taken off houses.  It is impossible for me to put a figure on the number in this category but no doubt the Minister has the figure.  He has only to look at the insurance stamps and he will find out how many people are under £50 a week.  All the road workers in Wexford are under £50 a week.  I presume, with the exception of Dublin, that the road workers right across the country are under £50 a week.  All the farm workers are under £50 a week as well as a fair share of our industrial workers.</P>
    <P>I am not against social welfare increases but those people find very little between their take home wages and the take home allowance from the Labour Exchange of people with three <Col N="713" /> children.  There is no incentive for those people to work.  The Minister by neglecting those people has taken away their incentive to work because they are too near the people who benefit from social welfare.</P>

      <P>The Minister's party have carried it on and have forgotten those people.  Some employees in this category have told me that the people on social welfare have almost the same money as they have.  This is very unrealistic and will have its impact on employment.  We have heard a good deal about the social conscience but there is very little social conscience when one thinks about those people.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to old age pensioners living alone.  Those of us who have always had a good table and are most unlikely to have anything else see, as we make our rounds from one election to another, social problems of one kind or another practically in every street.  I believe the non-contributory old age pensioner who is now on £13.60 a week has not sufficient for his or her table or to provide for such necessities as heating.  The person drawing the non-contributory old age pension living with a family will not have to provide heating and in a great many cases will not have to provide food.  There are a great number of people living alone who have been neglected over the years and are further neglected in this budget.  Many of those people have to go to bed without proper heating and without the proper amount of food to sustain them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to refer to the wealth tax, which was a very controversial issue right across the country.  I want to make my position quite clear.  I did not agree with the previous Government in their policy in relation to the implementation of this tax.  I always believed there should have been special concessions in relation to the extension of business, particularly where there was a possibility of creating jobs.  Secondly, the starting point of the wealth tax was too low <Col N="714" /> and, thirdly, there was no inflation clause in it.  I made those points before. However, I do not agree with the complete removal of this tax.  There is a need for it, taking into consideration the two points I have made.  No farmer under 400 acres should be considered for wealth tax.  The inflation clause should work from one year to another.</P>
    <P>What have the Government done in removing the wealth tax?  They have given the green light to big farmers to buy up land.  They are already doing it.  The wealth tax was a disincentive to that.  No doubt, the Minister has at his disposal the necessary information to prove that statement.  There is great need for redistribution of land. There are 64 per cent, approximately, of farms of less than 50 acres and the Land Commission now accepts that these are non-viable and that the farmers concerned need land. The wealth tax was a disincentive to big farmers to buy land and gave the small farmer some hope of doing so. The weakness of the Land Commission at the present time with regard to the purchase of land is evident.  In a few cases land has been sold by the courts and the big farmers made the price so high that the Land Commission could not purchase.  That is the position that obtains at the moment.  The removal of wealth tax has encouraged farmers to buy land which is so badly needed by small farmers.  It has been a mistake.</P>
    <P>Estates are growing.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows them, and I know them.  I can mention estates in Wexford that have reached the 2,000-acre mark.  They will continue to grow. People get very greedy.  The more they have, the more they want.  They have been given the green light to go ahead and ahead they will go.</P>
    <P>I come now to a great talking point in the general election campaign, farmer taxation.  I have here a summary of the Fianna Fáil manifesto on this taxation.  As a farmer and as a person associated with farmers for the last 19 years, I consider this manifesto to be the most dishonest statement ever put before an electorate.  I describe it as dishonest in the extreme because it <Col N="715" /> created a climate of thinking among farmers that they were walking into a land of milk and honey, that everything would be right with them if Fianna Fáil were returned to office.  It worked, I am prepared to admit. People who had backed Fine Gael for a long number of years were not prepared to back us any further.  The reason given was that we brought them into the tax net.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us read it.  This is a summary of the Fianna Fáil policy:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will allow rates on land as an instalment of a farmer's tax bill resulting in a tax saving for farmers of £10 million.</P>
      <P>But what has happened?  The Government have pushed that back one year. So, in fact, the farmers will finance the county councils, interest free, for one year.  They did not spell that out in their manifesto.  They have also removed the remission of rates.  This was the most serious aspect for farmers over £75 for this year, for farmers over £60 valuation for next year and, of course, they will probably move it down to £60 the year after that.  That seems to be the trend.  I consider that absolutely dishonest.  I will read the Minister's statement on the farmer, income tax, profits:</P>
      <P>After decades of depressed and unstable and insecure markets, the farming sector has, thanks mainly to our membership of the EEC, enjoyed considerable advances in income in recent years.</P>
      <P>And thanks to the efforts of our Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Mark Clinton, over the past four-and-a-half years, he could have added.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> In the coming years farmers will continue to pay against the background of security of markets for their output.  We have now a solid basis for greatly expanding the contribution of the sector to our economy's wellbeing, an opportunity which must not be missed, an opportunity which the farmer will exploit to the full.</P>
    <P>Fair enough.  That is OK.</P>
    <P>Everyone can accept that farmers make their due contribution in taxation.</P>
    <P>I have never said that farmers should not make their due contribution.  My attitude during the election campaign was that farmers should make their due contribution and I never went back on it.  It cost me votes.  While we may say things that are a little sideways, we must be somewhat honest.  I never said that farmers should not pay their fair share of taxes.  On the other hand, farmers pay a great deal of hidden taxes.  I continue the quotation:</P>
    <P>It was against this background that the Government undertook in the manifesto to make certain changes in the system of taxing farmers' profits.  The Government intend to honour these undertakings and provision to give effect to them will be made in the forthcoming Finance Bill.  I will briefly list these changes.</P>
    <P>We come then to the multiplier system.  The Minister must think farmers are naïve if he expects them to accept the notional system.  I understand this matter will be further debated in the House.  The farmer must guarantee that for the next three years he will remain on that system, without the Minister giving any guarantee whatever that the multiplier will remain the same, that is at 90 units.  I, certainly, will encourage the farmer organisations to take up this issue with the Minister and with us because, if the multiplier is increased to the same degree as it was increased this year, the farmers who have opted for this system will pay £700 extra next year.  That is what it means in money <Col N="717" /> terms.  There is a hidden trap here, which the Minister and the Department know about, in asking farmers to stay on this system for three years. There is not a word in the manifesto on that issue.  It just says they will guarantee to maintain the notional system.</P>
    <P>Farmers were attacked from three different angles: the loss of rates remission, the lowering of the valuation to £60 and the removal of subsidy on phosphatic manures.  In my constituency the removal of the rates remission has had a very severe effect in the Mackimore area.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows the plight of the people in this area.  He represented the area for a number of years and was always sympathetic towards the people there.  The removal of rates remission had a serious effect on the income of the people in this area.  The quality of the land is poor.  Efforts are being made to have it declared a disadvantaged area.  The valuation ranges from 60p in the £ to 110p in the £. The people concerned do not pay income tax.  Therefore, they have nothing against which to charge the rate.  In Wexford, 600 farmers have to pay £330,000 extra&mdash;these are people whose valuation is over £75&mdash;in rates to Wexford County Council.  These are approximate figures.  I have not the figure in respect of a further adjustment down to £60 valuation.</P>
    <P>It would seem that it is the policy of the Government to make the land pay for the removal of rates on private dwellings.  This is a very unfair development, particularly in respect of the Mackimore area where people have high valuations and low income.  They must pay their rates to Wexford County Council and they cannot get the money back because they pay no income tax.</P>
    <P>The removal of subsidies on phosphatic manures was a backward step, because one of the greatest deficiencies in our soil is phosphate.  With only £4 million involved the removal of this subsidy was very shortsighted.  It was a blow to the small farmer who depends on maximum production in contrast to the large farmer who can flip off a few tons here and there.  The <Col N="718" /> small farmer cannot do that.  This subsidy cost the taxpayers £4 million while the wealth tax cost them £8 million, but the Government chose to remove the wealth tax while throwing the full cost of phosphatic manures back on to the farmers.  This will affect production in one way or another and will have most effect on the small farmer.</P>
    <P>I deplore the lack of any initiative in the budget in relation to sheep policy.  There is a subsidy on sheep but there is great room for expansion in sheep breeding.  Some consideration should be given to sheep farmers who have been hard pressed for the past couple of years mainly due to the insistence of the French Government on not allowing any sheep imports.</P>

I believe the French knew more about our sheep industry than we did and as a result of their stipulation only 25 per cent of our sheep will qualify for that market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard many appeals, particularly from the previous speaker, to the private sector to come up with jobs.  With the exception of the building industry the areas have not been specified in which these jobs will emerge.  Are the farmers not part of the private sector?  I believe they are.  Yet we have attacks on them of one type or another.  Before the budget the Minister for Finance saw fit to take certain steps.  He removed the remission of rates before the budget.  He took one step after another.  Only last week the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="719" /> asked farmers to pay another 60p per head on their cattle slaughtered in the factories.  This is all an attempt to extract more money from the agricultural community.  I have always believed that agriculture should be developed to its full potential: I know it is not possible to get the absolute full potential but we should aim to get as near as possible.  Yet, 25 per cent of our land is lying idle.</P>
      <P>The budget will discourage ordinary family farmers.  A country's first aim should be to produce what it consumes as far as possible and it should then encourage production for export.  Both the agricultural arm and the industrial arm should be encouraged as much as possible but the terms of the budget give no encouragement for agriculture. I accept that there is a fair amount of encouragement in it for industry but one will not work without the other.  Somebody has said that a well-off agricultural community gives a well-off country.</P>
      <P>I did not want to introduce any bitterness into the debate and I do not think I have done so, but I say that in the budget the better-off came off best and, as I see it, it was an attempt to fulfil election promises at the expense of the poorer section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLeonard" hpid="Mr. T. Leonard Mr. T. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget has been pretty fully aired by now and I believe the general public are very favourably disposed towards it.  One could discuss many aspects of it and this has been done, but I wish to confine myself to a few points.  In 1973 Fianna Fáil proposed total abolition of rates on domestic dwellings and certain other buildings.  At that time Fine Gael and Labour were very vocal in rejecting this idea.  They claimed it could not be done.  We have been consistent down the years and on every occasion on every platform we indicated that if returned to office we would abolish rates.  Now that we are in office one must agree that our thoughts were right.  This penal tax has gone and I am sure people of all political shades are happy that it has gone.  The dread of annual demands for rates coming through the letter <Col N="720" /> box was not a pleasant consideration particularly for people who could ill afford to pay.</P>
      <P>In money terms the abolition of rates represents a considerable saving for people in the middle income group. Those on £20-£25 valuations will save anything from £150 to £250 per annum.  Those in local authority dwellings will also make a considerable saving.  These people, now free of the rates burden, will find better uses for that money, particularly those with young families of school-going age who have to provide clothes, books, bus fares and so on. This will be of great benefit to them.</P>
      <P>One aspect of rates abolition that is causing some concern is the rate content on private accommodation. In our manifesto we indicated that landlords of private accommodation would be expected to pass on this relief to their tenants.  It has been suggested that owners of flats and other rented accommodation might be reluctant to do this, but I trust this will not happen.  The Minister for the Environment expressed concern about this problem and I am certain he will ensure that tenants in private accommodation will benefit from rates abolition.</P>
      <P>I suggest that that Minister consult with his colleague the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to set up within the National Prices Commission a section to adjudicate on the rates element embodied in private dwellings.  I do not know if this can be done, but I appeal to the Minister to think seriously about it.  If it cannot be done, he should think about setting up some kind of rates tribunal.  There are many people, particularly in Dublin, living in rented accommodation. It would be a great pity if these people were denied benefit from rates abolition.  Rates abolition is also of benefit to landlords because it enhances the value of their property and if at any stage they contemplate selling it would make it a more attractive buy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned VAT, and there are two points I should like to comment on.  He proposed to increase the turnover thresholds.  Throughout my constituency there are many small <Col N="721" /> shopkeepers, grocers and dairies which are subjected to immense pressures from the big combines all over the city.  Most of these small businesses are barely existing.  They work seven days a week from morning to night and are making a very small profit. Before the budget I made representations to the Minister on behalf of these small traders.  I wish to thank him on their behalf for giving this matter some consideration.  The existing thresholds have been unchanged since VAT was introduced in 1972, and these people have been ignored for the past five years.  The increases mentioned by the Minister were 50 per cent for small grocers and small shopkeepers.  This will give these people an incentive to hold on to their businesses.  They will be able now to sell at more competitive prices although initially they are paying value-added tax at source.  In addition, they will not have the added chore of writing out VAT returns.</P>
    <P>It has been said that community centres are now the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing.  I am of the opinion that the small shopkeepers in all areas are equally as important to the local people.  House-wives coming from Mass or from leaving their children to school often congregate in the local family grocers and, with time on their hands, stop to talk to their friends.  In that way these small shops are of benefit to the local community.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister mentioned possible amendments in the VAT legislation at present under consideration. In this connection I should like to renew my appeal to him on behalf of an organisation&mdash;I am not making this appeal on a parochial basis although this establishment is in my constituency&mdash;the Royal Zoological Society, which is of national and international importance.  Under the proposals in the amendment these people will be obliged to charge VAT on admission charges and this will be a very serious strain on their resources. I do not have to remind the House that the Zoo is a valuable tourist attraction.  It is one of the best laid-out zoological gardens in the world and is a source of enjoyment for many thousands of young and old people <Col N="722" /> year in and year out.  We in Dublin take great pride in the Dublin Zoo. We believe it is one of the best amenities in the country, situated in the beautiful Phoenix Park.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that if VAT is added to the admission charges a falling off in attendance numbers might occur.  Their last financial statement on the Zoo indicated they were just making ends meet.  One must allow for the fact that in winter attendances at Dublin Zoo are sparse. They depend almost entirely on the summer trade, particularly tourists.  If attendances drop further they will be in dire circumstances.</P>
    <P>In making this appeal to the Minister I would draw his attention to the fact that the zoo authorities plough back any profits they make.  They provide new enclosures and have built replacements.  They have replaced animals and they take pride in the fact that they are exporting wild animals. If attendance fees are increased the attraction of the zoo will drop.</P>
    <P>I have felt strongly about the points I have made and I will end by repeating that the budget has been well received by the general public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Leonard that there is little new one can say on the budget. This has been the longest budget debate in my experience in the House.  Much of it has been concentrated on the need to create new jobs, rightly so, because there is a general awareness in the House as there is throughout the country of the need to cater for the many young people annually coming on the labour market, school-leavers and others.  Thank God we are not exporting our unemployed as we were, but that leaves us with the need to find more openings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have been making great play about the jobs they have created in the public service.  I agree there was need for more gardaí, especially in view of the crime figures released today.  More gardaí are needed not only in Dublin but in cities and towns throughout the country.  Extra teachers are necessary as well if we <Col N="723" /> are to reduce the teacher-pupil ratio. However, I do not agree with the creation of new jobs in health boards because to my knowledge they are already top heavy from the point of view of staff.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Department of the Environment could play a big part in job creation because there is an enormous amount of work to be done by local authorities on roads and other such projects.  I can speak particularly about the Cork County Council area, the biggest in the State.  Our county roads are in bad condition and unless something is done about them in the near future they will be beyond redemption and it will cost ten times as much to have them brought up to the standard necessary to meet present traffic needs.  The position is so critical that the Fine Gael members of the council have tabled a special motion to deal with it.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development has said that he would meet his job target even if he had to employ people to dig holes in the roads and to fill them in again.  There is no need to do that in my area.  What we need are workers to close them in.</P>
    <P>We could create extra jobs in cleaning up our towns in amenity schemes. There are openings in the fishing industry in which we have only scratched the surface.  That is why it is important that we concentrate on conservation and on expanding our fleet and our processing and marketing organisations.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is another area which could provide extra jobs.  Few people in this House are aware of the full potential in job creation in expansion of agricultural industry in the millions of acres that are lying derelict.  Particularly in the dairying industry if you can encourage somebody who is producing 100 gallons of milk a day to increase that to 150 you will find jobs in the production, transport, processing, right through the line up to marketing. These are areas we have to examine and exploit for further job creation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> The same applies to forestry and this is a consideration for the Department of Fisheries now that forestry is the responsibility of that Department. With all those acres of land I do not see why we cannot employ people to go ahead with afforestation.  There seems to be reluctance on the part of the powers that be to remove people from unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and the dole queue and transfer them at a little extra cost to productive jobs such as I have mentioned.  We should grasp the nettle and say: &ldquo;You are getting £25 dole and we will give you £45 if you go to work on the road or in forestry.&rdquo;  I am glad the Minister of State.  Deputy Wyse, is here because he is responsible for the Board of Works.  What is being done under arterial drainage and so forth to create employment?  I assure the Minister of State and the Government that my party are concerned about unemployment and we will give all the co-operation necessary in order to create the extra jobs.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another aspect of the budget which was mentioned by Deputy Brady.  He said it was wrong of the Opposition to describe the budget as a gamble.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development described it as a gamble.  The Minister for Finance described it as a gamble, and the Minister for Labour also suggested that it was a gamble.  It is not an aspect of it that I admire.  Ministers and politicians may gamble with their own affairs but they should not do it with the affairs of the nation.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy mentioned the taxing of farmers.  It is said rightly by farmers in general, by farming organisations and some politicians, that farmers should pay their fair share of tax.  It is only right that they should, like anybody else, pay their fair share of tax, but the point is that there is the option for farmers of the notional system or the accounts system.  I would like to see all farmers accepting the accounts system because the accounts system is important in the development of the agricultural industry not alone for the payment of tax but for their own benefit.  It is new and farmers are a little concerned about tax.  It is here <Col N="725" /> that the Fianna Fáil Party exploited the farmers in the general election-not those who were taxed but those who were afraid of the unknown.  The Minister has said to the farmers in this budget: &ldquo;Whatever system you opt for, you will have to stay with it for three years.&rdquo;  If the Minister for Finance expects farmers to stay with the notional system there must be a commitment from him to them that there will not be any change in the thresholds or in the multiplier.  If farmers opt for the notional system and stay with it for three years it is quite possible that there will be major changes in that system during that time.  I will quote the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, discussing farming taxation and expressing his opposition to it in the budget debate of 1974.  I quote from the Official Report of 4 April 1974, Volume 271, columns 1515 and 1516:</P>
    <P>... Now that the Minister has his toe in the door he will push it more and more.</P>
    <P>There is a rhyme to it.</P>
    <P>Obviously, they anticipate and fear that the £100 norm of land valuation&mdash;according to a completely outdated criterion, incidentally, the Griffith valuation some 100 years old now&mdash;will be reduced according as the Minister feels it necessary and, of course, as the Revenue Commissioners advise.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance expects farmers to accept the system without any commitment from him that is a very relevant statement by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Taoiseach who presided over farmers' taxation and the proposal which the Minister, and I understand the Revenue Commissioners, brought before the Cabinet.  It rings hollow now. He then made the point that the £4½ million collected from the farmers at that stage by way of taxation could go to £10 million, £20 million or £30 million.  Further on he says:</P>
    <P>In making that point, they indicate that rates are already a heavy imposition on many of them, especially the progressive ones.  Therefore, there would be now a much stronger <Col N="726" /> case to extend the Fianna Fáil policy of relieving homes, of relieving agricultural land from rates, if the incidence of income tax is going to bear more heavily on farmers as time goes on.  It has been pointed out&mdash;and I think the point has been well taken&mdash;that farmers are the only producers whose means of production would be subject to income taxation.  Another point which I think has been well taken is that about 50 per cent of their output, 50 per cent of their product, goes for export, whereas those in industrial production enjoy complete freedom of taxation from profits deriving from those industrial exports.  This is a point the Minister will have to take into account&mdash; obviously he has not done so at this stage&mdash;in order to ensure that fair taxation will be applied across the board.</P>
    <P>There has been an amazing change of heart and of attitude on the part of the entire Fianna Fáil Party since the now Taoiseach made that statement in 1974.  I repeat that the farmers must pay their fair share, but in no way will that have to interfere with the expansion of the agricultural industry and with the provision, as a result, of extra, much-needed jobs.</P>
    <P>This budget has caused quite a lot of discussion, and, let us be honest, it was well received by the farmers. Some reliefs were granted, particularly in relation to income tax, to other sections of the community.  People felt that, whatever is going to happen next year and the year after, we are getting something now and are delighted to get it.  What frightens me and quite a lot of people in this regard is that we are borrowing £820 million in order to provide these reliefs.  There seems to be a belief in the Department of Finance and amongst the Revenue Commissioners and certain politicians that you can borrow yourself into prosperity.</P>
    <P>I do not think that £820 million borrowed this year, with current expenditure of £416 million, is a healthy sign. This money will have to be provided. As reported at column 1507 of the <Col N="727" /> Official Report of 4 April 1974, the Taoiseach also said:</P>
    <P>If we add to increased borrowing for capital purposes the £66 million deficit which this budget has deliberately and negligently provided for, we find that Government borrowing for the year will amount to a colossal sum of £320 million, an increase of about 40 per cent over that of last year.</P>
    <P>That is the first big problem which this budget creates.  We all know that borrowing has to be paid for out of current income.  We all know that if anybody borrows money ultimately he will have to make it up in the following year or years.  At the rate the Minister is now borrowing, a huge deficit is being built up and it will come to be met out of current taxation.  The Minister made no effort to provide for that borrowing this year and hopes, like Micawber, that something will turn up for him in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Taoiseach.  The money has to be paid back.  I agree with him that if you borrow today you must pay tomorrow, and if you do not repay it somebody else will have to do so.  The huge sum borrowed must also be serviced at a very high rate of interest.  I am not an economist but I know you cannot borrow yourself into prosperity. I relate the running of the country to the running of a business or farm.</P>
    <P>I also want to mention social welfare. I want to criticise the Minister for not reducing the qualifying age for a non-contributory pension to 65 years. The National Coalition, about which we hear so much criticism from the Fianna Fáil benches, reduced the qualifying age from 70 years to 66 years.  It had stayed at 70 years since 1912. There is discrimination against the non-contributory old age pensioner as against the contributory pensioner. People who served the State in one way or another up to that age deserve better.</P>
    <P>I mention this because it is relevant to the agricultural industry.  It is important to the nation as a whole that farms should be held by younger <Col N="728" /> people.  Recently a survey was published by the agricultural advisory service and by the institute in which it was stated that decisions at farming levels were made in the vast majority of cases by people over 55 years of age.  That is bad for the country.  The modern young farmer who has graduated through Macra na Feirme and who is involved with the advisory service is far more competent to run a farm than people of 55 years of age and over.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why people inherit farms so late is that older people have not got security once they hand over their farms.  If they hand them over to a son or daughter, they do not feel secure.  We should be encouraging early retirement.  An effort was made in that direction under the EEC retirement scheme.  Incentives were given to people who were not able to work their land to hand over their farms under that scheme.  I will offer some criticism of that scheme on another Estimate because I think enough is not being done to develop our land.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Government for not increasing children's allowances.  When we are here smugly debating the budget, we do not realise that mothers and housewives looked forward to an increase in children's allowances.  This is a very valuable service to wives with domestic problems and mothers of young children.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to this huge borrowing.  Where will this money come from?  Are we to borrow abroad? Are we to pay a high rate of interest? We heard a considerable amount of comment on the fact that the wealth tax was removed because money was going out of the country.  I do not accept that for a moment.  I am not being political when I say that, because I think the National Coalition were a little out of touch in this regard.  In the Finance Act introduced in 1967 by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance, for the first time in the history of the State the secrecy of the banks was broken and the Revenue Commissioners were given a right to income tax on interest over £70 earned on <Col N="729" /> deposit accounts.  That is why millions of pounds left the country and went to England, the North of Ireland and other places.</P>
    <P>People with investments did not want to come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners and have to pay income tax.  They felt that if they came to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners they would be screwed in some other direction and they would be liable to tax.  That was a bad system and, since 1967, the threshold was never increased.  That is not an incentive to save.  We must encourage and induce people to save.  I am not talking about people with huge investments. I am more concerned with people on PAYE who are contemplating getting married or getting a house and who want to save money.</P>
    <P>People have more confidence in the banks than in any other finance company or system of investment.  There-fore, most people with money to save or to spare put it into the banks.  If a person is saving for a house or for some other purpose, and paying his fair share of tax under PAYE, and he invests money in a bank he will be liable for tax on what he is saving to get married, or build a house, or buy a farm.  This area should be examined. Long before now, the Minister for Finance should have increased the threshold from £70 to £370 or £570 or some realistic figure so that people would have an incentive to save.  I have no doubt that millions of pounds left this country in the ten years from 1967 to 1977, although probably not so much recently because interest rates are low and the attraction abroad is not there.</P>
    <P>I am sure many Deputies have had the same experience as I have had. When people reach the qualifying age for a non-contributory old age pension they have to fill out a form and they look for advice from Deputies.  Every Irish person is patriotic and it is embarrassing when they say: &ldquo;I have money invested in Manchester, London, Liverpool, Derry or Belfast, must I declare it?&rdquo;  It is not a matter for Deputies to advise them in that regard but that is a regular feature of applications <Col N="730" /> for non-contributory old age pensions.</P>
    <P>That is wealth any nation can ill-afford to lose.  Bearing in mind the fact that we must borrow £820 million abroad, I would go so far as to grant an amnesty to such people if they agreed to invest in an industrial fund here which could be used by the ESB, the ACC or the IDA.  I would also suggest that the tax rate on the interest earned on that money should be very low.  They should not be hounded as to where they got such money if they invested it in the country.  The Minister should examine the possibility of establishing such an industrial fund because it would mean more money for the IDA and the ACC.  We would be able to expand our agricultural industry, an industry which is starved for capital.  I am aware that in September 1976 in a small dairying town in the midlands, £1 million was sent abroad to be invested.  I should like to know what amount of revenue the Government receive from investments or savings here where the interest paid amounts to more than £70. Irish people do not agree with investing money abroad but one cannot blame them for trying to avoid paying income tax on such investments.  I accept that they are breaking the law but we must remember that their savings could prove a valuable asset to us if invested at home.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Buy Irish campaign I do not accept that Irish people deliberately buy foreign-made articles. However, I do not think they realise what will result if they buy foreign-made articles.  We should use the media to point out to our people the importance of buying Irish in the context of job-creation and industrial development.  I have no doubt that any Irish product can compete with foreign-made articles.  There is little more I can add in relation to the budget at this stage of the debate and it is not my intention to repeat other points made but I hope the points I have raised will be investigated by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Although there is little any of us can add to the budget debate at this stage those of us who have not <Col N="731" /> contributed are anxious to put our points across and have them recorded. This budget could be described as a challenge and an opportunity.  It is an opportunity which if fully availed of can restore greatness to this nation.  In spite of the statements of Opposition speakers there is an air of optimism throughout the country and I believe the budget will encourage and promote greater understanding of the urgent need to tackle the cancer of high and widespread inflation which is still a cause of grave concern.</P>
      <P>It saddened and disappointed me to hear the new Leader of Fine Gael claim, in the course of his contribution, that there was little chance of the national pay agreement being ratified. When I heard that statement I was convinced that he had not yet come to grips with reality and was out of touch with the real problems that face the Irish people.  Some days later he did an about-turn and called on trade unionists to back the pay agreement. That was a step in the right direction. I assume that some of the more enlightened members of his party asked him to change his tactics and his mind in this regard.  That was sound advice. However, the Labour Party, his partners in the National Coalition, have different ideas about that agreement. We have all heard speeches from Labour Party members and their partners in the trade union movement suggesting that workers vote against the acceptance of the pay agreement.  One thing is certain, they want to wreck our economy.  Members of the Labour Party and trade unions were given more than their fair share of coverage by the media in their campaign of deliberate destruction.  I would not include the Fine Gael Party in that campaign because I believe the vast majority in that party are sound and sensible people who have an interest in the welfare and future of the country.  We all hope that at some stage sanity will be restored to the Labour Party and the trade union movement, people who should be participating in the campaign to reshape our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget sets out to rebuild our <Col N="732" /> economy.  It contains a policy of reconstructing and rebuilding our democratic institutions so that a better life can be secured for all our people, irrespective of their religious or political affiliations.  I appeal to all trade unionists who have a vote in the national pay agreement to vote for its acceptance, because it is the guarantee of their future, their wives', their families' and their country's future.  I was glad the Leader of the Fine Gael Party reversed his thinking in the matter and appealed to the thousands and thousands of trade unionists who will be voting for acceptance or rejection of the National Pay Agreement.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his budget speech said that our success and the success of the budgetary proposals hinge on the success of the National Pay Agreement. I hope trade union members will respond to the call and play their part in rebuilding the nation and restoring it to the greatness we want.  The real message which needs to be got across to the people is that we all have a role to play in creating a healthy, Christian society.  Everybody must be given an opportunity of playing his or her part in rebuilding that society.</P>
    <P>During four-and-a-half years thousands of our people were deprived of playing their national role in Irish society.  In 1973, when the Coalition Government came into office there were approximately 73,000 people unemployed. In 1977 the figure had risen to a staggering 115,000.  I believe all that occurred because the partners in Government could not agree on a workable solution or could not agree on budgetary proposals which would set the economy on a job creation course.  There is no point in blaming the oil crisis.  We know we had an oil crisis which is still with us.  We have a crisis every day of the week and every year of our lives we will have one.  We will always hear people complaining about the times being bad. The times will be as good or as bad as we can make them.  It is our duty as Irish citizens to ensure that we all play our part in doing what we can to relieve the terrible disease of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I believe the proposals in the budget are the correct ones.  I have reservations, <Col N="733" /> like everybody else, including Deputy Creed, about the wealth tax. Eight months ago the people endorsed the Fianna Fáil election manifesto in the ballot boxes.  No election programme ever got such publicity.  All members of the Opposition seem to carry that manifesto around in their pockets.  There is no other one available apparently.  We saw the Fine Gael Deputy from Wexford use that manifesto this morning.  He possibly believes in it.  They must believe in it because they seem to read it every day. The only conclusion I can come to is that they believe in that manifesto and they believe the Fianna Fáil Government will set the economy on its course once again and every section of the community will enjoy the benefits.</P>
    <P>I also believe that certain sections of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties have not yet forgiven the people for their endorsement of that manifesto.  I believe many of them are still suffering from their defeat last June.  Their statements seem to be made in a way to do the maximum damage to the economy and to try to induce certain sections of the community not to play their role in the building of our economy.  I do not believe those people are doing a service to their supporters or a service to the Irish people.  It always amazes me that those people seem to enjoy the headlines at all times, particularly members of the Labour Party.  I am sure I will be forgiven if I describe some of them as members of a sick society.  They always seem to see the dark clouds and never see the silver lining but that is their business.</P>
    <P>The people gave the Minister for Finance the green light to go ahead and introduce the policies which were outlined in the manifesto.  This budget is just the beginning.  We all look forward to greater things in the future. The most serious problem facing us is the huge number who register for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance every week.  Any money which can be channelled for job creation activities must be used to the fullest possible extent this year. The people on permanent unemployment do not want to be there.  They want to be able to play their full role <Col N="734" /> in our society and make their contribution to the State.  The only way they can do that is by being given the right to work.  That is my concern and the concern of every member of my party. It is what the budget is about.</P>
    <P>I strongly criticise the people who are endeavouring to kill the incentive the Government are creating, the people who want to have 115,000 permanently unemployed.  The Government do not want that.  We hear people say that it was a mistake to abolish the wealth tax although some members of the Fine Gael Party have welcomed it.  I am glad they have done so because they appear to be the more enlightened section of the Coalition partners.  We must bear in mind that wealth is money and money is investment. Investment today means jobs tomorrow.  We cannot have jobs without investment and we cannot have investment without money.</P>
    <P>People who have wealth must be encouraged to use it for job creation enterprises.  Somebody said that many millions of pounds of Irish capital was removed from the country during the period from 1974 to 1976.  I believe those people would be well advised to return that capital to Irish industry and play their part in creating jobs for our boys, our girls, our middle-aged people and the thousands who are signing at the labour exchange every week.</P>
    <P>The budget is a bold and during step at correcting all the mistakes of the Coalition Government.  The tax cuts have been welcomed by reasonable members of the Opposition parties because they know as well as we do that they will benefit from the tax cuts.  They also know that the general public accept the budget as being realistic and as being a serious attempt to encourage the creation of the job activities which are so vital if we are to succeed.  For four-and-a-half years there was a succession of taxation. We all remember a day when, even without an annual budget, the former Minister for Finance increased taxation on motor spirits by 14p.  That was a serious imposition on those who had to use motor spirits in order to keep the wheels of industry turning. <Col N="735" /> That taxation was part and parcel of the four and a half years rule by the former Government.</P>
    <P>Now there is a complete change.  For the first time in four and a half years, price rises are slowing down and genuine reductions are taking place, which are welcomed by every section of the community.  Fuel prices have been showing a marked tendency to decrease in recent weeks.  That is welcomed. Fuel is vital to the economy of every European country because of the way in which we live.  We cannot go back to the horse and cart, the horse tram, the old type omnibus.  Fuel, petroleum, oil have become part of our way of life.  The recent reduction in price is welcomed because if such reductions are passed on they will induce other price reductions.  The cost of distribution will be reduced.  On each occasion that there was an increase in the price of fuel there was a corresponding increase in distribution cost and consequent increase in the price of various commodities.</P>
    <P>The tax cuts that have been introduced are to be welcomed.  An acceptable system of taxation will be beneficial. Taxation on luxury spending is acceptable and is regarded as fair.  The less well-off section of the community benefit by luxury spending by others. There are still many people who are entirely dependent on assistance in some form or other.  We have not reached the situation where poverty is eliminated.  This budget will go some of the way.  But even the more advanced countries in the world have a certain degree of poverty and will have it for a long time.  The social welfare improvements introduced in the budget are further evidence of Fianna Fáil's commitment to the weaker and less well-off section.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have a proud record in social services.  They were the pioneers. Before our entry into the EEC and before the economy had expanded even to its present state Fianna Fáil always endeavoured to look after the weaker section.  I was pleased, therefore, that that policy has continued and has been expanded in this budget.  We have a duty and an obligation to look after the weaker sections.  There is an old saying <Col N="736" /> that if one looks after the weaker sections the rich are more than capable of looking after themselves.  This budget will go some of the way towards helping the weaker sections.</P>
    <P>Members on the Opposite benches have said that the children's allowance has not been increased.  We would all welcome an increase in the children's allowance but is it not extra-ordinary that a former Minister for Finance in his budget of 1977 did not give any increase in that area?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): He did not abolish wealth tax either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet, speakers on the opposite benches would try to convince the people that they gave increases when, in fact, they did not.  In our election manifesto we did not mention the children's allowance.  That does not mean that the situation cannot be changed in the next budget.  You cannot do everything quickly.  If I have any complaint against the people at the present time it is that they would appear to expect too much too quickly from this Government.  Even the members of the Opposition would appear to be expecting too much and too quickly from this Government.  That is their business.  Sometimes, some of them seem to forget that they were in Government for four and a half years. When they entered Government they were hailed as the greatest Government in Europe that would be in office for many a day.  The people decided otherwise in June 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome criticism.  We do not condemn it.  We are a democratic society.  Every budget introduced by a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance should be criticised.  I believe in the right of the people and the right of the Opposition to criticise.  If there is not lively debate and criticism you cannot have good government.  The essence of democracy would be defeated without government and opposition. The Irish people will ensure that there will always be government and opposition.  Let us hope that we will always have a free press, free to say what they like and free to write what they like and to criticise in what way <Col N="737" /> they please.  The press has always enjoyed that privilege.  Former Ministers in former Governments did make attempts to muzzle press, radio and television.  But I am glad that the Fianna Fáil Party, the Minister for Finance and all the other Ministers would not indulge in such tactics because we believe in complete freedom and the right of the press to be free and to criticise in what way they please.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any political group should have a monopoly when it comes to radio or television.  The Labour Party seem to enjoy a monopoly when it comes to criticism by way of radio.  That is not a matter for this budget.  It is for another day.  I just mention this in passing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that an effort has been made in the budget to assist the people who cannot help themselves&mdash;the old age pensioner, the deserted wife, the widow, the orphan, the disabled.  The social welfare allocations in the budget will help those people.  As previous speakers have said, the real victims are the old, the invalid or semi-invalid who resides at home and who does not seem to have the same measure of assistance as we would like him to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But we must bear in mind that there are many institutions anxious to help the old age pensioner, the sick or infirm person who resides alone.  Those people do their work quietly and never seem to make the headlines.  I am convinced they do not want headlines; they prefer to work silently. They help to make life easier for people whom we would like to see getting larger social welfare allowances. Unfortunately, we do not have a strong economy such as in Europe, America or other places.  We must be grateful for small mercies.  Those <Col N="738" /> people fully appreciate the efforts made to assist them.</P>
    <P>If we could alleviate the unemployment problem it is right to assume that more money could be channelled in in the direction of the old, the infirm, the sick, the widows and orphans.  I stress again that the immediate task is to do everything humanly possible to reduce the number of unemployed. This Government are fully committed to that goal and it is only right that they should expect and seek the co-operation of every section.  All Irish-men should be concerned with the future of the nation.  That is why I make a special appeal to every section to make an all-out effort to ensure the success of the Buy Irish campaign.</P>
    <P>That campaign in itself is not sufficient; we must also have a sell Irish campaign.  That is very important because the customer occasionally forgets to look at the label to see where a product is made.  We have many greedy manufacturers and traders who will go to the ends of the earth to buy a cheap, shoddy product to make quick money and high profit. That must be exposed again and again because investment today means jobs tomorrow.  If we buy Irish we help to create more jobs in industry.  We spend millions importing clothing which is readily available here and is of high standard and good quality. Some manufacturers would prefer to set up their factories outside Ireland where they can draw on a pool of cheap labour and so be able to flood the Irish market with cheap goods.  We have experience of this from Taiwan, Portugal, India and those under-developed countries where a product can be made cheaply and material secured cheaply.  Such goods are being dumped on the Irish market.  Every shelf in the supermarkets bulges with foreign goods today.  That is detrimental to our job creation goal.</P>
    <P>As well as a Buy Irish campaign we must sell Irish and every store manager must be made aware of this necessity.  It is not enough that he gets a greater profit by importing foreign articles than he would get from an Irish made article.  If those people are concerned for their future and the <Col N="739" /> workers' future they must make a more positive effort to sell Irish goods.</P>
    <P>The trade unions have a very important role to play in the Buy Irish campaign because the workers' livelihood, independence and economy is at stake.  I am saddened by their lack of initiative in this field.  Only recently the Minister of State responsible for promoting the sale of Irish goods visited Athlone in my constituency.  He invited trade union representatives, manufacturers and traders to meet him that morning but the trade union representatives did not see fit to attend the meeting to promote the sale of Irish goods.  I am not yet convinced that the trade union movement and leadership are really concerned for their own members' welfare.  If they were, they would be anxious to make the Buy Irish campaign a success.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker said that some form of incentive should be given to people to purchase Irish goods.  If we are Irish and want to be called Irish, love of country and concern for its welfare and the welfare of our own people should be sufficient inducement to us to buy Irish.  I realise manufacturers have a role to play here.  They must ensure that their products are equal to imported ones, that they are acceptable and excellent in quality.  The budget provides for further injections of capital into job-creation enterprises, but it will all be for nought if the Buy Irish campaign fails.  Therefore, I add my voice to the pleas of previous speakers who stressed the need for this Buy Irish campaign.  Our survival depends on its success.  It is not right that Irish people should buy such a huge amount of imported goods.  It has been stated that if we spend 3p in the £ buying Irish manufactured goods 10,000 jobs would be created.</P>
    <P>Not only the trade unions but every organisation has a responsibility in this matter.  The Irish Housewives' Association have a responsibility.  They are always critical of price rises and so on, or they were critical in the recent past.  They should call on their members to ensure that when they go shopping they get Irish manufactured products. We should condemn the Irish <Col N="740" /> importer who has a label saying &ldquo;Made in the United Kingdom for So-and-So of Dublin&rdquo;.  I do not consider such an individual or company worthy of being called Irish.  They are enemies of our society and do not want to play their part in the job-creation effort that is so vital at present.</P>
    <P>Our supermarkets are importing food.  Yet, as a nation we are the greatest food producing country in the world.  We have enormous food surpluses. The potential for food production is great and has not yet been fully exploited.  If we are to have success in the Buy Irish campaign we must have the support not alone of the purchaser and the consumer but of the manufacturers as well.  When I speak of manufacturers I mean also the thousands engaged in agriculture.  They should buy Irish manufactured machinery where possible.  Unfortunately, the availability of such machinery is limited.  Agricultural mechanisation has become dependent on imports. Irish manufacturing industries which concentrate on agricultural machinery should have been given wider publicity. One of our oldest firms, Pierces of Wexford, are going through a very lean time.  We should be encouraging farmers to purchase their products in preference to those imported from Sweden, Norway and some eastern countries.  The proposals in this budget will not be effective without an all-out effort by all sections of the community. The Irish Countrywomen's Association have an important role to play in this campaign.  They should ensure that their families are getting the opportunity to work at home.</P>
    <P>The founder members of the trade union movement would turn in their graves if they knew of the attitudes and tactics of some of the present members who are now leading that movement.</P>
    <P>I would be failing in my duty if I did not mention something which concerns me as a farmer&mdash;the topical subject of farmer taxation rates, land structural changes and so on.  No farmer ever objected to paying his fair share of tax.  In 1974 the farming community were deprived of an income because <Col N="741" /> of the failure of the then Government to realise that they were in a crisis situation. Agriculture was in a deplorable state because of the lack of export markets.  The farming community were left completely out in the cold and no immediate remedies were introduced to relieve that terrible situation.  It is only in the last two years that the farmers have recovered from that disaster.</P>
    <P>When you talk about the farming industry you are talking about an industry which carries an element of risk.  Our entry to the EEC has helped that industry enormously.  When the farmers voted overwhelmingly to enter Europe in 1972, they knew they were working in their own best interests. Any wealth generated by our agricultural exports benefits every other section of the community also.  The farming community accepted that sooner or later they would be called upon to pay their fair share of income tax.  That is all they should be asked to do and they are willing to do that.</P>
    <P>Farming can no longer be regarded as a way of life.  It is a highly competitive business.  All the new techniques and skills available should be fully utilised so that the maximum return can be got from each agricultural holding.  Every farmer should have a proper accounting system.  In the old day he went to the market, got a few pounds for his pig, bullock, cow or calf, crossed the road to the trader and paid his debts.  In recent years younger farmers have become organised.  They have adopted more businesslike methods.  The methods used in the old days were ideal because living standards were low and less money was needed because agriculture was only in its infancy.  Every farmer would be well advised to keep farm accounts to ensure his business is being run properly and also to work to a farm plan. Under the farm modernisation scheme every farmer is expected to be involved in farm modernisation if he is to enjoy any benefit from that scheme.  I am still not satisfied with that scheme. Changes are necessary in the same way as they are necessary with regard to farm accounts, rates and so on.</P>
    <P>As I said, the farmer does not object to paying farm taxation provided <Col N="742" /> he is given an opportunity of producing books which will clearly indicate if he has made a profit.  Farming is a hazardous way of life.  The disease eradication scheme is still a long way from being complete.  Many farmers have found that they are being deprived of an income overnight because of diseases in their herd.</P>

      <P>The agricultural grant which is being withdrawn is causing farmers a great deal of anxiety. Farmers who are asked to submit accounts will benefit by having the demand for rates set off against income tax due.  That is only right because that is an exporting industry.  Other exporting industries enjoy tax concessions and all exporting industries should be treated alike.</P>
      <P>Land valuations were mentioned and it was said there is need for adjustment. That is another day's work, something we will be hearing a great deal about in the future.  As previous speakers said, the main emphasis of the budget is on job creation and all of us were delighted with this emphasis and with the assistance the budget gives to job creating industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building industry is being given a boost and that is to be welcomed because it is a sphere in which jobs can <Col N="743" /> be created quickly.  We must bear in mind that many people who would be employed in the building industry would not get employment in the civil service because of their lack of educational qualifications.  The building industry has suffered badly in recent years and it is encouraging to see the recent activity in it.  We were all delighted to see the new house grants and my only concern is whether the £1,000 being given is enough.</P>
    <P>The employment premiums are also to be welcomed.  They should be available to every man and woman who takes on additional staff.  I hope this scheme will have the success it deserves but of course we must ensure the money invested in this and in other such schemes is spent wisely.  Those in receipt of these premiums should realise the responsibility that rests on them.  Every budget will have its critics but I hope that of this one the Minister for Finance, when he is introducing his next budget, will be able to say his efforts were justified, that the progress forecast will have been achieved.  It was that hope that gave Fianna Fáil their mandate last year. The way ahead is clear now and it will be achieved with the cooperation of every section.  The guidelines have been laid down in the budget.</P>

      <P>I was delighted to hear the emphasis previous speakers put on the Buy Irish campaign.  I had experience recently of having to do some domestic shopping.  I went looking for an electric light bulb and I was handed a package labelled &ldquo;Made in Poland&rdquo;.  It was a 100 watt bulb.  I said I wanted an Irish-made bulb and I was told there was not one available.  I went to other shopping centres and I could not find a light bulb made in Ireland.  In other words, this country is being lit up by foreign-made light bulbs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an appalling indictment of our home-manufacturing industry.  This budget has put private enterprise on the mat.  The responsibility has been given to it to create jobs.  The Government have given it the necessary assistance to do so.  I do not believe there is <Col N="744" /> a Member of this House who has not got the best interests of the country at heart, although we are sometimes critical of each other's approach.  In the past four years the Coalition displayed a peculiar approach.  When I was canvassing in the last election I found an air of despondency.  I found that people who previously had voted for Fine Gael were despondent and ill at ease and concerned for the future.  We see the outcome.  We have no right to crow over this.  This is the decision the people made, a legitimate decision which was responded to by the Minister for Finance in this budget.  It was his first opportunity to implement the promises and undertakings of the Fianna Fáil manifesto.</P>
    <P>In the public sector job-creation will bring about an increase of between 11,000 and 12,000 jobs at a cost of approximately £40 million.  Those jobs are absolutely necessary for the restoration of morale in the people's minds; but they are public jobs, they are not coming from the private sector.  The private sector must provide jobs in addition to those the Government have provided and are providing.  Many people have been critical about creating even more bureaucracy, but these jobs are related to specific and urgent needs.  There is overcrowding in schools.  Any Deputy living in an urban area will know what overcrowding in schools means: 45 or 50 children in a class.  There is no way that a slow child or even a bright child will have equal opportunity in such overcrowded conditions. This budget has given extra encouragement to educational establishments, particularly at primary level, by providing for secretarial assistants for principals who otherwise are over-worked and overburdened with administrative detail.  This is the sort of thing we welcome.  Primary education is something that every citizen of this country enjoys at some stage.  It is no good excusing ourselves for sending our children to private schools because the local school is overcrowded.  We have been making that excuse for far too long but now we are in the position to make provision for assistants in the schools.</P>
    <P>In this budget we have also provided <Col N="745" /> more money for the Garda.  In the last four years law enforcement in this country practically ground to a halt.  Vandalism and petty crime were at an all-time high and the morale of the Garda was at an all-time low. People complained that they could not see a garda on the beat and that after midnight they could not get a garda because gardaí were not available. Consequently, people were being abused and taken advantage of by the vandals.  This budget has provided money to increase the numbers in the Garda Síochána, and a welcome move that is.  Driving in and around the cities now one can see gardaí on foot patrol, and that is thanks to the money spent in this budget.  There is saving involved in that people feel safer.  They can get out, they go to the shops, they spend more.  They come into the centre of town.  Now they can walk up O'Connell Street, the main street of our capital city, in safety. About 16 months ago it was not felt safe to do so.  The streets of Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Galway and of all the other major cities and towns of Ireland are at last safe.  Great credit must go to the thinking behind the expenditure in this budget for that purpose.</P>
    <P>We concentrated a lot of our budget expenditure on the school-leavers and our young people.  Fianna Fáil were the first major political party in this State to involve young people at all levels of the organisation.  Five years ago we held our first youth conference, and since then young people have been acknowledged in Fianna Fáil as having a legitimate role to play.  They play a major role, and we acknowledged this in the budget by providing funds for the setting up of a national Employment Action Team.  I can only surmise that shortly we will have the results of that project.  We do not support enough projects brought forward by young people, and on this score I would like to mention the small enterprises scheme being conducted by the IDA at present.  In regard to the kind of efficiency with which these are run there is a lot to be desired.  When people go to the IDA they should be communicated with immediately.  They should be told exactly what is and is <Col N="746" /> not available.  They should not be put on the long finger.  They should not be told that maybe there will be something here, we will examine it, and then three or four weeks later there is nothing there, when the IDA knew in the first place that there was nothing there and they could not provide finance to support the project.  A number of people in my constituency have complained of this.  If more manpower is required in this area then we should as a Government provide it.</P>
    <P>Nearly £50 million will be spent on building and construction which will create more than 6,000 jobs directly, and more jobs will come from demands on the building materials supply industry.</P>
    <P>One most frightening statement I have heard in regard to this budget is that if Irish consumers spend 3p in the £ more on Irish-made products we could provide 10,000 new jobs.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, what right has the Minister in relation to examining a Dáil question tabled by a Deputy through the General Office in regard to interpreting the question as put?  Also, what right has the Minister to examine the original question and, further, what right has the Deputy to be questioned by the General Office or by your office in relation to any question he puts down and which may be subject to one or two interpretations?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of what right the Minister has in relation to a question is not one for the Chair to answer but there has to be a decision as to whether a question is addressed to the proper Minister.  That would entail necessarily the Minister having the right to see the question. With regard to the office into which the questions are handed, I am responsible and I think that the office act in a courteous and helpful manner, helping Deputies to reconstruct questions if necessary and frequently having to contact Deputies regarding the possibility of ambiguity in a question as it is framed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what you say, Sir, but I am asking by way of a point of order about the continued protection of the rights of Deputies in this House.  In this context I am merely asking whether a Deputy who puts a question has the right to be consulted in relation to its interpretation or if it is now the position that the question is passed to a Minister for his Department's interpretation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is passed to the Department to be read.  If the word &ldquo;examiner&rdquo; appears in the question I answer it on that basis.  I told the Deputy yesterday that if he puts the word &ldquo;examinee&rdquo; in the question I shall answer it on that basis.  There is far too much heat but too little light <Col N="751" /> about the whole matter.  Examiners as well as examinees can be put under pressure and I consider that I was perfectly reasonable in answering the question as I got it, but I shall answer the other one also if it is tabled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the original word, which so far as I was concerned was &ldquo;examinee&rdquo;, was open to interpretation.  What happened was that the Minister got hold of the question, which incidentally was changed in the General Office without my permission. This has been admitted. Surely then on this basis any Deputy is entitled to the same privilege.</P>

      <P>We should not be holding up the House unnecessarily in talking about something that is not in order.

      <P>In relation to (1) and (2) of the Deputy's question, I am informed by the authorities of the National College of Art and Design that planning permission was sought and obtained and that tenders were sought in respect of the extension of the college.  In fact, this is history.  We will soon be back at the battle of Clontarf.</P>
      <P>In regard to (3) and (4), I desire to state that a sum of £20,000 approximately was specifically authorised in October 1976 for payment out of the grant-in-aid to the college for 1976.  A balance of £11,900 approximately was met by the college authorities by way of savings within the general financial provision available to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy of the authorities of the National College of Art and Design that extra-mural courses should be self-supporting.  An Bord increased the fees for this purpose for 1976-77 and 1977-78.  Though there has been a fall in enrolments as compared to 1976-77, the number enrolled in the present academic year 1977-78&mdash;over 600&mdash;is approximately the same as in the academic year 1974-75.  I may add that as a designated institution the college receives its finances through the Higher Education Authority and that it has discretion in relation to the purposes for which it allocates its financial resources.</P>

      <P>In relation to the emphasis being put on second-chance education, does the Minister agree that adult education and extra-mural courses in the college should be self-financing in view of the obvious benefits to society?

      <P>The second-level schools in the city centre area, especially secondary schools, are generally large and they take in a substantial number of pupils from outside the immediate area.  If they did not do so they would have a considerable number of vacant places.  For instance, in the north central constituency area in the 1976-77 school year the total intake of second-level pupils was 1,683&mdash;942 to secondary schools and 741 to vocational schools.  The total number of primary school-leavers in the area was 1,004 and the Deputy will see that almost 700 came from outside the area. The Department would not accept that central city second-level schools have inferior facilities as compared with schools in other parts of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that children in urban areas, especially in inner city areas, are significantly educationally deprived relative to the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>Some children in inner city areas may be socially and culturally&mdash;as distinct from educationally&mdash;deprived, but so also may children in provincial towns where the problems may be on a smaller scale.  It is important to realise that problems inherent in educational deprivation have to be dealt with in the schools in which they are identified.  Nevertheless, it has also to be recognised that there is a limit to what the school can do to remedy the problems which arise in this connection. The experience gained from the Rutland Street project is useful in the assessment of this situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>I presume that the schools which the Deputies have in mind are Maria Assumpta School, Gardiner Street, Holy Faith Convent School, Dominick Street and Dominican Convent School, Eccles Street.</P>
      <P>The number of teachers in receipt of incremental salary in Maria Assumpta School and in the Holy Faith Convent School, Dominick Street in 1976-77 was 30.</P>
      <P>A final decision has not been taken to close Dominican Convent, Eccles Street, though the possibility of such closure has been mentioned.  The number of teachers in receipt of incremental salary in that school in 1976-77 was 43.</P>
      <P>The closure of the schools would take place on a phased basis and in that respect the main problem in relation to pupil accommodation would be in respect of the availability of places in other schools, particularly in the pupils' own locality for pupils who might otherwise have been admitted to one of the schools which would no longer be accepting pupils after a particular date.  This matter will receive appropriate consideration for the purpose of arriving at a satisfactory solution to any problems which may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the concern of the teachers on the staffs of the schools in question in relation to their future employment prospects.  The factual situation is that the Minister for Education in the discharge of his functions is not in a position to assume responsibility for the placing in alternative employment of teachers on the staffs of secondary schools which may close. The conditions relating to payment of allowances in respect of posts of responsibility and of special functions allowances are governed by the provisions of the Teachers' Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  The question whether a teacher who transferred <Col N="770" /> from one school to another would be paid an allowance in the school to which he transferred would depend on the nature and condition of his employment in that school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not have proposals as suggested in respect of the closure of secondary schools which are private institutions.  In the case of the closure of a secondary school appropriate action is taken to find alternative school accommodation for the pupils deprived of places as a result of the closure.  This action would include grant-aiding existing secondary schools to expand, providing additional accommodation in existing or proposed community or vocational schools, or making <Col N="774" /> the relevant arrangements for the provision of additional schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to tell the House what consultations took place between his Department and the private school authority?  What steps will he take in the Department to ensure that the school might be retained for use as a school under lay management in order that the sociological damage which could be done to the children due to the closure is avoided?  That will also avoid the question of transport to other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no power to keep a school open.  The school is a private institution and under the Constitution the people who own it are entitled to sell it as they see fit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the practice of the owners of secondary schools to notify the Minister for Education of their intention to close?  Has the Minister received any notification in relation to any of the schools which we have discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that that is a separate question.  I have had talks with some of the schools concerned.  In the case of one of the schools mentioned a final decision to close it has not been taken and, consequently, my answers cannot be as categorical as they would were the decision taken already to close the school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the reason they are closing is because there is discrimination by way of grants to them?  The balance between a community school and these schools is nearly two to one and in my view that is the reason they are closing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the concern felt in relation to the question of the possible closure of these two schools.  I must accept, however, that a decision in the matter is one for the individual school authorities and I do not consider that it would be open to me to act as suggested in relation to the Holy Faith Convent School, Dominic Street. I should also point out that a final decision has not yet been taken to close Dominican Convent School, Eccles Street and, accordingly, a statement in relation to possible remedial action in the eventuality of such closure would be premature at this stage.  I may say, however, that I have had discussions with the authorities of Dominican College School, Eccles <Col N="776" /> Street, during the course of which all aspects of the difficulties which would arise for pupils, parents and teachers as a consequence of the closure of the school were adverted to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <P>In circumstances where schools are closing on a phased basis my Department make every reasonable concession to ensure that a school will continue to have a sufficient number of teachers on the staff to provide instruction in the necessary range of subjects.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to get this question confused with the other issues.  I am talking about the situation where there might be a phasing out period, over a number of years.  Would the Minister accept that there is a strong possibility that the educational environment of the school, because of the natural lack of morale and other reasons, would tend to deprive those inner city children more than they are already deprived, as I tried to point out earlier?</P>

I can assure the Deputy of that.  As was mentioned already, the idea is to phase out, and this may cause anxiety and also cause staffing problems. However, I will not adopt any kind of doctrinaire approach with regard to staffing in those circumstances.</P>

      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 31 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>Grants towards the cost of the erection and major improvement of national schools are sanctioned subject to the condition that in each case the premises are vested in trustees by an official lease.  The lease provides that at all times for the duration of its term a national school will be maintained on the premises.  In the event of default on the part of the trustees in the matter of compliance with the terms of the lease, the Minister for Education may require a refund of the full amount of the grants paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building grants scheme for secondary schools provides that the school building in respect of which a grant under the scheme is made, or the school building together with the extension in respect of which a grant under the scheme is given, shall be continued and maintained in good order for a period of 99 years as a secondary school fulfilling the conditions for recognition prescribed from time to time in the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools and the conditions and regulations for the payment of <Col N="780" /> grants to secondary schools.  In the case of default a repayment shall be made to the Minister of such amount, not exceeding the amount of the grant, as the Minister may determine.</P>
    <P>358 schools have been given grants under the secondary schools' building grants scheme in accordance with the terms of the scheme as outlined.</P>
    <P>No building grants were paid to Maria Assumpta School or Holy Faith Convent School, Dominic Street. Grants totalling £5,200 approximately were paid to the authorities of Dominican Convent School, Eccles Street, in the period 1967-70.  A repayment of these grants would not be required in the event of the closure of the school in view of the minor nature of the works involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the requirement by his Department to pay back the grant in the event of the school ceasing to be a school is a totally inadequate sanction given to the Department in order to ensure continuity in education in any particular school, especially in regard to the high valuation of centre city properties?  Would he not agree that some stronger sanction needs to be imported into the grants scheme?</P>

      <P>I do not know what premise the Deputy's question is based on.  If you have not given any grants at all you are dealing with a property which is as private as your own private house.  I cannot understand how the Minister can have any power whatsoever in that circumstance.  With regard to a grant of £5,200 in relation to a very valuable property I do not think it would make a significant difference to have a refund of £5,200.</P>

    <Title>Financial Statement, 1978: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Financial Statement made by the Minister for Finance on 1 February 1978.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(The Taoiseach).</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying before Question Time, this budget more than anything else has placed the emphasis on the need for employment, the need to take people off the unemployment register, to take them out of the social welfare arena, to give then new dignity in their lives and new confidence in a resurgent Ireland. We are emerging after four years of Coalition Government, four years of depression and despondency, not all, I might add, due entirely to the Coalition.  There were certain outside factors that contributed to some of the depressing things that happened.  Nonetheless, the complete incompetence of that administration brought about the situation where people had not got sufficient confidence in themselves, in their nation, economically, socially or culturally.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker spoke about the attack on the freedom of the Press by the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and, in particular, on <i>The Irish Press.</i>  As a former journalist, I recognised what was happening.  It was a very dangerous situation.  The freedom to publish letters and views from people was being impugned and the right of newspaper editors to decide what they would publish was being called into question.  For the first time, I believe, in the history of this State, the freedom of expression was under direct attack from Government. Thankfully, that does not arise anymore, in the sense that with the appointment of a new Director-General in RTE we have the absolute minimum of interference in such an appointment for the first time ever and it is a very important point.  For the first time ever, there has been no political consideration in such a very important appointment.  I welcome that appointment and I want to have it on record here that I welcome that appointment and I welcome the Government's approach to this kind of appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that I would come back to the Guaranteed Irish campaign and I intend to refer to it briefly once again.  Our shops are full of imported goods, Italian silks, Italian shoes.  Yet we have adequate industrial facilities to produce the cloth required for suits and to produce shoes that are adequate, comfortable and well-designed. We should not underestimate the quality of Irish goods and the quality of the Irish workers who produce them.  Even if an Irish-made product <Col N="815" /> costs 10p, 15p, 20p or 30p more than an imported product, is it not well worth while to buy the Irish product in the sense that this will provide work for people in the industries concerned? It is OK to be a trendy dresser, to wear a silk tie, a silk suit and Italian shoes but the purchasing of these goods means, in effect, keeping yet another Irish worker on the dole queue.</P>
    <P>The social welfare increases of 10 per cent would appear at first sight to be inadequate.  We all agree that, if we could give more, we would give more.  Unfortunately, we are not as yet getting oil from the Irish Sea.  In due course, maybe, it will come.  Certainly, if inflation continues to make the dramatic decline that now appears to be on the horizon, the 10 per cent has more significance and more meaning for the old age pensioner and social welfare recipient.</P>
    <P>There is one very important factor in maintaining the real value of that 10 per cent, and that is the national wage agreement.  As a life-long trade unionist and as a member of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union for the past 15 years and a former shop steward, I would appeal to the members of that union to support the national wage agreement, to vote for it, to cast their vote for it in the same way as most of them cast their vote for the Fianna Fáil Party that is now the Government.  It will be the less well-off sector that will suffer unless this national wage agreement is put through.  A free-for-all will leave the weaker section of the community in a position where they cannot negotiate, where they cannot get their 8 per cent or 10 per cent. There will be no benefit to them.  Indeed, I believe there will be no benefit to the vast majority of people.  Jobs will be lost, fewer jobs will be created, unless the national wage agreement is put through.</P>
    <P>I have absolute faith in my colleagues in the transport union that they will vote for.  But, there is one thing about voting for and I would like to put this to the transport union. I should like to see an independent assessor at the counting of the votes <Col N="816" /> on the national wage agreement.  There is no means of telling&mdash;and this is not to cast any doubts on my colleagues in the administration of the transport union&mdash;whether or not the votes have been legitimately counted for or against.  I appeal to the transport union to accede to my request that an independent accountant be permitted to count the votes cast for or against the national wage agreement. None of my colleagues in the transport union has any doubt of my sincerity when it comes to my conviction about the trade union movement. It has been under severe attack over the years; it has had some major internal difficulties which it has resolved with some satisfaction all round, but it is in their own best interest and in the interest of the nation to give the grand plan put forward by the Minister for Finance an opportunity of making a meaningful impact in the coming year.  I think they will reap the benefit.</P>
    <P>This budget is significant in that for the first time ever it provides relief for the top income group, the people in the £3,000 to £7,000 or £8,000 income bracket.  With the elimination of rates on dwellings, tax cuts, no tax on smaller cars and increased tax allowances, it is the first time in almost 20 years that the top income wage earner has had an opportunity of at least improving his standard of living.  This is to be welcomed in that they themselves are very happy about it.  This morning I called six telephone numbers in the Dublin 14 district at random.  I asked how they felt things were going in the country generally and for themselves.  Not one expressed any dissatisfaction about the manner in which Fianna Fáil have delivered on their manifesto undertakings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am sure I got in touch with a few of the Deputy's friends.  Private enterprise <Col N="817" /> has been given an opportunity to prove its worth to the nation, an opportunity of making greater profits some of which, hopefully, will be ploughed back into jobs.  The building industry has been allowed to run down in the past four years; jobs have been lost by the score.  The redundant workers have to be paid on the dole which is costing the Exchequer money.  Now that industry has been given the opportunity to expand and develop and thousands of jobs have already been created.  There is a new air of confidence about and that is a good thing.  The Minister for Finance, who has been much maligned in the past week, has made an enormous contribution to reinvigorating the spirit of the country and developing confidence again among the people.</P>
      <P>I come from an urban constituency and I frequently hear people complain about farmers' wealth and taxation.  I am not inclined to go along with that. I am not a townee farmer-basher; the country owes a great deal to the sacrifices made in years gone by, by the farming community, and the emergence of some prosperous members in this community can only be welcomed by any fair-minded citizen.  The farmer is getting very good prices for his produce and he has brought renewed prosperity and new vigour to the rural community. The misunderstanding between the urban dweller and the rural dweller arises, in my view, from the export of cattle and other animals on the hoof, while leather and other by-products could provide thousands of jobs if only those in private enterprise and the meat factories got down seriously to developing that aspect of the industry.  Cattle and sheep and whatever else goes out on the hoof could provide limitless wealth and I hope that sooner or later this Government will intervene in some way to bring about the development of the animal by-products processing industry. It is no less a crime to export live cattle whose by-products could provide jobs at home than it is to send out raw material such as ore from the Tara mines and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that shortly we shall have a <Col N="818" /> smelter in this country.  I believe the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is busily engaged in negotiations on this matter.  One job in Tara Mines can provide 10, 15 or even 20 jobs in downstream industries.  It is a shame that instead of the Irish people having these jobs the ore is being used to provide jobs in Germany, one of the most prosperous nations in the world. I would have no scruples about where this smelter came because I think jobs are terribly important.  A man without a job, as we know in the past four years when we saw so many in the dole queue, is a man who could well be so demoralised as never to be able to work again.  The longer he is without a job the less likely he is to become again a useful member of the community. This Government have the mandate and the will in due course to provide the necessary support and leadership for people in the private meat industry and in the mining industry that will give them the impetus to supply the kind of jobs I am talking about.</P>
    <P>Recently we heard a lot about working wives and taxation.  In the budget the Minister announced that the single person's tax allowance would increase by £200, from £665 to £865 and the married allowance would be increased by £630 from £1,100 to £1,730, and the existing allowance of £230 for working wives was maintained.  In line with the increase in the single allowance, the personal allowance for widows and widowers will be increased from £735 to £935.  I am not trying to defend the Minister's remarks because he has a legitimate right to address himself to the question of working wives and taxation.  Working wives are not slow about addressing themselves to the Minister about the things he might do or say and they have not been slow in castigating him, unjustly in my view, because implicit in the allowances and the increases in the tax allowances for married couples, is a recognition of the rights of the working wife.</P>
    <P>If people come into the public arena on a campaign, such as that for working wives' taxation, they must take the rough and trumble of public debate. Unfortunately the press were inclined <Col N="819" /> to take the Minister's statement out of context and tried to make it stick.  That was unfair and unreasonable but they are entitled to do that and we in our turn are entitled to try to explain what was meant.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is anybody on either side of this House who would not, if he could, change the whole system of married person's taxation.  I was at a recent meeting in my constituency&mdash;300 or 400 people attended &mdash;and they were talking about the southern cross route which would cost in the region of £465 million.  That motorway scheme would be wonderful and everybody would love it because it would be good for the country but it would not be realistic because we do not have that kind of money.</P>

      <P>The cost of the southern cross route and the Dublin motorway scheme would be in the <Col N="820" /> region of £465 million.  Let us cut out the political clap trap.  That kind of money is not available.  We must and we will do it bit by bit as money becomes available.  The same applies to working wives' taxation.  In due course, in the same way as equal pay came about, working wives' taxation will no longer be an issue.</P>
      <P>The kind of campaign launched by the verbose and lovely women campaigners on this issue is unbecoming.

      <P>I want to clarify my view.  All these things would happen anyway and it is a pity that the debate in this House is based on small point-scoring.  This is very unfortunate.</P>
      <P>The people are fully satisfied with what the Government provided in this budget&mdash;renewed vigour for industry, jobs in the public sector; they removed capital gains tax which caused so much wealth which could very usefully be invested here to leave the country; they provided money for the building and construction industry, youth, social welfare increases and for the guaranteed Irish campaign.  It was up to the people to accept the challenge.  It has been said that this is a gambler's budget.  Perhaps it is but what budget is not?  Every thing you do each day is a gamble and with every expenditure you make you take a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> The people voted for the Fianna Fáil Administration which brought forward a programme, a policy and the necessary moneys to develop the economy in the right direction.  In my view Fianna Fáil in Government have done the right thing.  They have accepted the reins of leadership and will lead this country forward.  They are going to develop this country into a significant industrial nation alongside the farming community and they will do this very well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn spoke of the court in Mayo.  It was held in every constituency in Ireland and there was not a constituency in which the jury came back with a not-guilty verdict on the Coalition.  It therefore ill becomes them to accuse us now of being irresponsible.</P>
    <P>A most important relief for the top income group was the elimination of rates on private dwellings. This has put money into the pockets of people who had been paying out without any hope of relief.  I do not believe the Minister for Finance could have done any better and I congratulate him for his courage and foresight.  I have every confidence that the budget will be a success.  It has given renewed hope to the people.</P>
    <P>I hope those engaged in the private enterprise sector will deliver the jobs that have been provided for in the budget.  I cannot stress strongly or often enough how important this is.  Those in private enterprise have been complaining about the restrictions they operated under in the past four years.  Those restrictions have been lifted and if the jobs are not delivered by private enterprise they cannot complain any longer.  It will be on their heads because they have been given the opportunity, they have been given the support of the Government and of the nation.  No government in Europe has given private enterprise greater incentives and encouragement.</P>
    <P>I hope the trade unions will see the light and come in behind the budget as the people have done.  I welcome the statement by the Fine Gael leader <Col N="822" /> calling on the IT and GWU and the other unions to support the pay agreement. It was a responsible statement and I hope we will have more such displays of statesmanlike behaviour in the House.  A great deal of irresponsibility has been displayed during the debate but the Fine Gael leader cannot be accused on that score, this time anyway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Budget always capture the imagination of our people and the subsequent benefits live with us for a long time, but if warts appear on the surface they last much longer. The natural tendency of Government speakers to try to show these warts as beauty spots can be forgiven.  This budget has a mixture of both.</P>
      <P>One is always influenced in his views on the budget by the needs of the area he represents.  In my constituency there is a mixture of agriculture and industry. In County Clare we have a predominantly dairying economy and there has been much disappointment there at the withdrawal of the fertiliser subsidy. That particularly affected County Clare where 70 per cent of the valuations are less than £70.  Their attitude is easily understandable when one appreciates the amount they must lay out on the purchase of fertilisers in order to maintain the quality of their holdings. County Clare has had a singular achievement in both the quality of stock and milk yields.  That is another reason for the people's frustration at the increased prices of fertilisers and the withdrawal of the subsidy.</P>
      <P>Another reason for disappointment there was the decision to include in the income tax net farmers with valuations of £60.  There was also the increase in the £90 multiplier and this had a serious effect on farmers' income and on their plans for expansion. Fianna Fáil were loud in their condemnation of the decision to tax farmers and it is hard to understand their change of attitude.  However, we must live with the situation and make the best of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason for farmers' disappointment was that they no longer qualify for rates abatement if their valuations exceed £75.  Farmers had <Col N="823" /> also hoped to see some development of the farm modernisation scheme. They had hoped that the Government would introduce further development categories, but there is no indication so far that transitional farmers are being considered.  This is an area to which the entire Government as well as the Minister for Agriculture must devote a lot of attention.  There is a lot of congestion among small farmers in the west but there is a deep desire among them to continue on their small holdings. Now that prices for stock and milk are better there could be a great opportunity for that type of farmer, but the social welfare policy for such people has been left unchanged if the valuations exceed £15.  Therefore all is not rosy in the rural areas where there is a high density of small farmers.</P>
    <P>In the field of industry and commerce there is encouragement to employ, and there are great hopes that the private sector will react.  A lot depends on the ability of private people and companies whether public or private to market their goods at an economic price and thus compete internationally and within our own country.  In Clare the development agency called the Shannon Free Airport Development Company were assigned the job of creating employment through the establishment of viable industry within the region of Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary in the industrial area of Shannon.  This had a singular and spectacular success and the peripheral areas benefited marginally.</P>
    <P>Now it is the intention of the Government&mdash;or the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy&mdash;to withdraw from that company a function exercised by them over a long number of years and to place the responsibility for major industrial promotion on the shoulders of the IDA.  This is fine if the IDA deliver the goods to the remote and underdeveloped areas within the region, and SFADCo have broken some ice in this area but have not been completely successful in encouraging or promoting industry in areas of high density where the greatest unemployment is.  What will the position be in the years ahead <Col N="824" /> when SFADCo are no longer authorised to introduce major industry into this region?  We are now dependent on the IDA and we are also in competition with other areas of this country, and indeed with areas of higher density and with the city of Dublin.  We were hopeful, because of projected development in the Shannon estuary and demand for proper harbours and landing facilities which are available, that we would have a prior claim on major industrial development along the Shannon banks.  I hope that the IDA will realise that their function lies in the first place with the underdeveloped areas.  There is nobody other than the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and the Government to impress on the IDA that this function must get some priority. With fewer opportunities through emigration and with possibly fewer opportunities at the moment in the western area of the country we are dependent for the future on the establishment of stable, viable industry to absorb our unemployed.  I hope this change made by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy will be successful.</P>
    <P>We depend a lot on the energy and enthusiasm of the people of the IDA at this stage for major industry. SFADCo, for instance, still give the power to promote industries other than major ones.  Of course one cannot pass over that without some regret about incidents which were responsible, undoubtedly, for the withdrawal of major industry within this region.  The time has come for a much more mature and sensible approach by management and trade unions to problems which will arise within industry so as to have them settled in a rational and sensible way which will ensure the continuance of industry. This would convince others who have their eyes set on establishing an industry that the required stability is there.  It would encourage them to invest.  It is vital that balance be restored, and this should be accepted by people who will be doing irreparable harm if this union-management relationship is not improved rapidly.</P>
    <P>In this budget is was necessary to <Col N="825" /> borrow heavily in order to allow for expansion, apart from current expenditure.  It is the hope that this gamble will be successful, because none of us would like to see money wasted on projects which would not allow a good return.</P>
    <P>There will continue to be failures unless there is a follow up on companies from outside who establish here.  Perhaps this applies too in so far as native companies are concerned, but there must be this follow up in respect of management, means of production and union relations. This is necessary to ensure that these factors are satisfactory.  So far the industrial promoting agencies have not engaged adequately in such activity with the result that many companies have gone to the wall much too rapidly after being helped with a good deal of taxpayers money by way of grants and all the other forms of assistance provided by the State.</P>
    <P>Another area that is very important in agricultural expansion is the area of drainage.  In our county we are looking to the Minister of State who is sitting opposite to give us every consideration in regard to the allocation of money for major arterial drainage.  We trust that he will consider all the areas in the west in this regard in relation to the expending of the £15,500,000 from the EEC, backed up by an equal amount of help from our Government and that there will be no tendency to concentrate on one county.  If it is the case that the Minister of State is not the one to decide on the allocations, I trust that at least he will have a survey carried out in respect of the areas of greatest need.  One of the greatest areas of concern in County Clare is the threat of flooding of the major town by the River Fergus which floods periodically.  This disrupts business and homes are flooded.  In some cases business premises are destroyed.  For many years there has been neglect in so far as this river is concerned. Provision must be made to deal with the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be very welcome to meet my two colleagues and myself at any time.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision to abolish rates on private houses and to exempt from road tax cars below a certain horsepower was acclaimed widely. However, in the country there are people who have an independent outlook and who would never wish for a situation in which in practice their rates or car tax had to be paid for by others.  It would not be their wish that they be subsidised by the worker who is just getting a living wage but who is heavily taxed under the PAYE system.  The very wealthy would have no wish to benefit from the sweat and toil of those workers.</P>
      <P>We welcome the grant to be paid to first-time purchasers of new houses but I wonder whether the Minister would consider re-introducing the system whereby half the amount of the grant was paid when the work was half way through.  This system would be very welcome and would be of great help to house purchasers.  In particular, it would help those building their own houses having regard to the cost of materials and so on and it would encourage more development in that sphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While speaking on housing I should like to refer to a scheme that has been abolished but which, when in operation, was of much benefit to poor people living in very bad accommodation. The scheme which was known as the essential repairs scheme was introduced many years ago and provided for the expending by local authorities of the major portion of the cost of improvements to unsuitable dwellings. The Government's contribution in each case amounted to only £80.  This <Col N="827" /> scheme provided that a roof, windows and doors would be given to people of limited means and the local home assistance officer determined the eligibility of applicants.  We have many elderly people who are not rich, through no fault of their own.  It was not very wise to abolish this scheme for essential repairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the increased grants under the reconstruction scheme replaced the scheme for essential repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It may vary from county to county but we are still operating it in Galway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that applications already received would be serviced.  I would be delighted to know that the scheme is to continue.  It brought many benefits and improved the appearance of many houses and made them pleasant places in which to live.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment recently introduced a very helpful scheme for the improvement of the environment.  Beauty spots will be improved and car parking areas will be provided.  This work is not capital intensive but it has the potential to employ many manual workers and this will be of great benefit to many areas, particularly those which depend on tourism.  Where roads run along by the sea it is necessary to provide space in which cars can turn and such amenities are vital.  I hope that all local authorities will avail of this allocation and that we will have a much greater awareness of how vital it is to preserve the environmental aspects of tourist areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that no Minister for Finance has ever introduced a budget which was not subject to criticism from all sides of the House.  At this stage this budget has already been discussed and we have <Col N="828" /> heard all the criticism, constructive or otherwise.  A budget is judged by the people and I am quite satisfied that this budget has the full support and widespread approval of the people. Not only that, it has restored hope and confidence and this was sadly lacking during the past few years.  This budget has been well planned and, coupled with the confidence engendered by the return of Fianna Fáil to Government, it has put the country on the move and the national advance has been resumed.</P>
      <P>No document has received more mention or criticism since last June than the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  The Minister for Finance in his budget has certainly fulfilled the commitments given in the manifesto.  He has introduced a comprehensive package of measures designed to promote and secure the further economic and social well-being of every section of our people.  At this stage there is no point in going into detail on the budget as it has already been extensively discussed. I propose to deal with some of the items for which people look in a budget.</P>
      <P>The job creation measures provided in the budget are in line with those outlined in the manifesto.  We are providing much needed employment in the public sector and in the building and construction industry and also by way of special schemes for young people, who were sadly neglected during the past few years.  This is an exceptionally good start and the impetus and incentives being given to the private sector provide a sound and co-operative basis for more employment opportunities in both the public and private sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one talks about job creation one automatically thinks of PAYE. The PAYE system has been the subject of a great deal of criticism in recent years due to the imbalance in taxation.  I suggest that the Minister is to be congratulated on the substantial income tax reliefs provided in the budget.  These are the biggest and most worth-while reliefs ever provided for single and married people alike. Some sections were not happy with the tax relief and I should like to have <Col N="829" /> seen other reliefs given and perhaps other taxation imposed.  A budget cannot satisfy all the people; one must try to satisfy the majority and produce a good working budget which is acceptable.</P>
    <P>My own constituency is a fairly representative urban area and I am satisfied that the tax provisions are particularly welcome.  I am also satisfied that these measures will be of general benefit to the economy.  They can, of course, be viewed not only in economic terms but also in the social context.  They have removed the grievances and sense of frustration felt by many taxpayers.  Such feelings can be very damaging to the fabric of society.  I am satisfied that the reliefs have removed this long-felt sense of frustration.  They also demonstrate that we have a Government conscious of the needs and wishes of the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>In this context the weaker sections of our community have always been helped by Fianna Fáil.  Our record in the area of social welfare and health services is ample proof and testimony of our concern.  Even in the days of the first Fianna Fáil Government in the early 1930s when national resources were very limited, measures providing for widows' and orphans' pensions and unemployment assistance were introduced and a high priority was given to the development of existing social welfare benefits.  Similarly with regard to the health services, all the advances that have taken place during the years can be attributed to the work of Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the budget contains provisions for increasing social welfare benefits and allowances. While I should like to see higher increases, I am satisfied that the Minister knows how far he can go in providing such benefits and I know that the people accept the situation.  Many improvements have taken place in the area of health and hospital services.  In this context the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, who is in my constituency, is to be congratulated on the initiative he has taken in extending the scheme of unemployment assistance to single women and widows. <Col N="830" /> This will prove a considerable benefit to a section that hitherto has not got its fair share of the cake.  There has been an easement in the qualifications for social welfare allowances and benefits and this will prove helpful to the less well-off section.</P>
    <P>By taking these measures the Government have shown their concern for the community based on the criterion of need.  In this way all deserving cases will be provided for.  Allowance has been made for mentally and physically handicapped children and this is another demonstration of our concern. Allowances in respect of residential accommodation have been increased from £25 to £35 per month.  It is approximately four years since an increase was given in this area.</P>
    <P>In a broader sense the capital programme makes provision for major hospital building.  Not only will it provide badly needed hospitals but it will also create jobs in the building of the hospitals.  I am sure all Deputies in this House are pleased that the hospital programme is proceeding.  It was very interesting for me to be present last Monday to see the Minister for Health turning the sod for the Beaumont Hospital which is in my area.  This was referred to by the Minister in his statement.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have commented on various aspects of the budget as it affected them but I do not think separate items can be singled out while others are ignored.  A budget must be discussed in an overall context and from that point of view this budget is one of the best ever introduced in this House.  The Minister for Finance can take legitimate pride in the budget.  I am sure it will get a well-deserved response from the community in order to make it work and to get the country moving again.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker mentioned the part to be played by trade unions.  The aim of the budget is to create employment and to help the economy and, like a previous speaker, I appeal to the unions to act in a responsible manner.  I would ask them to accept the national wage agreement that is before them at the moment so that we may have the industrial peace so <Col N="831" /> necessary for any country if it is to achieve prosperity.  If we can provide the jobs that are necessary and secure the future of our economy the aims of the budget will be achieved.  The Minister for Finance will have done what he set out to do, namely, get the country back on its feet again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to speak on the budget and to compliment the Minister for Finance on the way he planned the budget and also on its presentation.  Much criticism has been levelled at the Minister regarding the amount of money he proposes to borrow but that money is for the purpose of job creation and in order to provide incentives for industry.  I congratulate the Minister on his foresight and the confidence he has in the Irish people.</P>
      <P>A year ago the previous Government borrowed a considerable sum to pay for social welfare allowances and to pay debts.  The present Minister told the House he was prepared to borrow money to provide employment and incentives for industry.  For the first time in many years a Minister has given tax reliefs to industry.  This is something that was sought for many years and I compliment the Minister on taking the initiative in this matter.</P>
      <P>As a person representing a Dublin constituency, with long associations with the building industry, I wish to compliment the Minister and the Government on their initiative in relation to the building industry.  Since this Government assumed office there has been a major upsurge in this industry, with a significant increase in the number of jobs available in Dublin.  Prior to the last general election this was a very depressed industry, going along from day to day, nobody knowing where he was going.  At that time no loans were available in Dublin and very few grants.  With the injection of capital into the building industry and on roads, the scene is very different. I should like to refer also to the £1,000 grant affecting the country as a whole and as a result of which the building industry has again improved considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> Speaking of the industrial scene generally the tax concessions allowed industrialists in this budget are something which have been sought for many years; year after year the industry was crippled by increased taxation. This year an incentive was given to industrialists, with confidence in the country and our people to invest more money at home.  There is no doubt but that this will provide many more jobs.</P>
    <P>It is not very long since I spoke in this House on the IDA Bill.  At that time I referred to the work of AnCO and called for the creation of an AnCO centre in Tallaght.  I want to thank the Government and the Minister for Finance for their foresight in providing a centre there which has given people new life.  When it really gets off the ground I have no doubt but that it will provide many additional jobs and will help in attracting industry to the area.</P>
    <P>Again in reference to Tallaght I want to compliment the Government and the Minister on the stepping up of IDA activities in the Dublin area. Over the years very little work was done by the IDA in Dublin but, since the introduction of this budget, the situation has changed completely.</P>
    <P>In regard to youth there is no doubt but that the injection of the £5 million capital has given them much hope. What hope had they for a number of years?  What was there for them except to go to the labour exchange, and indeed what they got there was very little?  Again there has been a complete change in that situation.  Jobs are starting to roll and a greater interest in life exists for our young people.  I want to compliment the Government and the Minister on the setting up of the Employment Action Team, providing proper facilities for our young people which is very important in a constituency like mine, mid-County Dublin with a new town like Tallaght which has a population of approximately 100,000 at present and a projected one of 135,000.  Heretofore no effort was made to attract new industry there.  They had to rely on old-established ones, with what-ever <Col N="833" /> hope they had of expansion.  A number of new industries came into the area but, because of circumstances operating at the time, they were unable to keep going.  I am indeed pleased with the tax reliefs granted in the budget because of which so many industries in that area have been able to provide so much additional employment.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of roads, another area in which much employment can be provided.  In the past few years very little work was carried out on our roads, with very little hope of additional jobs.  Again the situation has changed considerably with the initiative taken in this budget.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to the question of borrowing.  Much criticism has been levelled at the Minister on the amount of money he proposes to borrow. Nevertheless its one great feature is that he proposes doing so for investment purposes which, in turn, will provide additional employment.  What a change from this time last year when we heard a lot of talk about the borrowing of money and incentives given. But that money was borrowed merely to pay for social welfare benefits and for debts.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Horgan asked and was given permission to raise a matter on the Adjournment. It is the matter of the approval by the Minister for Education of increases in fees in Dublin teacher training colleges.  Deputy Horgan has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for giving me permission to raise this on the Adjournment.  I would point out that the situation is even more serious than that implied in the <Col N="834" /> wording as read out by the Chair.  The situation is not just that the Minister has approved an increase in fees chargeable by the teacher training colleges but that he has effectively directed that the fees be increased. Under the present system the colleges of teacher education are funded directly by the Department of Education and do not come under the Higher Education Authority so that, although they are privately owned and managed, the Minister plays a very large part in their financial arrangements.  Just how large a part the Minister plays in those financial arrangements is evident from a circular which was distributed in at least one of the colleges, St. Patrick's, over the name of the President, which stated that the following communication had been received from the Department of Education.  The communication reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The fee for 1978-79 will be £260 payable in two only equal instalments, the first in October 1978 and the second in February 1979.  In the case of students entering colleges in October 1978 no maintenance allowance should be paid to students living at home.</P>
      <P>In the case of your College there has been an arrangement whereby students from the Dublin area may pay £120 (in the current year) as a College fee and for this be given tuition, meals and a commuter travel ticket.  This is an arrangement which has applied in St. Patrick's college only; in the other Colleges all students have been required to pay the full fee.</P>
      <P>The Department is satisfied that the arrangements with regard to fees must be the same in all recognised Colleges.  As from October 1978 therefore all students attending St. Patrick's College must be required to pay the full fee and you are requested to ensure that there is no departure from this arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That document, which may fairly well be described as a directive, was sent from the Department of Education to the principals of the colleges concerned and, to the best of my <Col N="835" /> knowledge, was not preceded by any consultation between the Minister and the authorities of the college concerned.</P>
    <P>It is a deceptive document because, to the casual outside reader, it does not give any very clear indication of the extent of the change it is bringing about in the financing of student places in these institutions.  The arrangements students have traditionally had for the payment of fees varied from college to college. In Carysfort, for example, in previous years they had slightly different arrangements from those in St. Patrick's.  The arrangement concerned involved not only the payment of cash sums by way of fees but also the provision to the students of various benefits in kind, various subsidies such as accommodation allowances, travel allowances, meals, and so on.</P>
    <P>What is now happening is not only a very substantial increase in the fee, but the gradual phasing out of special arrangements and special subsidies, including a subsidy for the cost of living which made a real difference to the possibility of attending a teacher training college which was open to many of our poorer students.  In fact, when you calculate the actual cash value of the subsidies which are being removed, the accommodation allowance, the meal allowance, and so on, and add that to the difference between the old fee and the new fee, at least in the case of St. Patrick's you are coming up with an effective figure which is about double the cost last year.</P>
    <P>In other words, in actual cash terms when all the bits and pieces are taken into the account, the student who is entering St. Patrick's College in Dublin this year will be asked to find 100 per cent more money than the student who entered last year.  Needless to say, the student who entered last year will also have to find the increase this year.  This is a most extraordinary increase in fees.  One regrets that one cannot do something creative and original about it like asking the <Col N="836" /> National Prices Commission to investigate it.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem is that the students, in addition to being asked to pay more money, are getting less value for it, because the large and I may say welcome increase in the number of students in the training colleges has not been accompanied by a proportionate expansion in some of the facilities which make these training colleges the excellent institutions they are.  Library facilities, playing facilities and many other facilities have not kept pace with the extension in student numbers.  It might be argued that, compared with two years ago, students of today are being asked to pay twice as much in terms of fees and subsidies foregone for facilities which are only half as good as they were two years ago.  Effectively the real benefit to the students has been cut, you might almost argue, by three-quarters.</P>
    <P>There are other anomalies in the fees situation which unfortunately still remain to be cleared up.  Students who attend these colleges are given grants on quite a different level from the grants normally awarded under the higher education grants scheme.  They too have a means test.  They too are assessed differently depending on whether they are living within the college or outside it.  One of the anomalies which affects the value to the student of his education and affects the amount he has to pay to get to the college is the distance he lives from it. There have been many arguments in this House about what does or does not constitute proximity to a third-level or university institution.  One of the unfortunate things about the teacher training colleges is that as far as I know this is still completely vague.</P>
    <P>The fees the Minister is now demanding from the students are related to the overall costs of the education provided and in particular to the cost of the education being provided in training colleges as compared with universities.  The argument has been made, and I daresay may be made again this afternoon by the Minister, that the reason he is putting up the effective fees by about 100 per cent is that in the past&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will look forward to the Minister's figures on this.  In the past, and up to comparatively recently, teacher training education has been subsidised at a higher level than university education.  I should like to quote from a document published by the Minister's Department although it does not reflect departmental policy.  An article in this journal <i>Oideas 17</i>, makes a number of important points which I suspect are behind this new policy of the Minister's.</P>

      <P>On page 37 it is stated:</P>
      <P>A <i>prima facie</i> case exists for financing training colleges in much the same way and to much the same extent as universities.</P>
      <P>Training college students are not antecedently entitled to greater state assistance towards the cost of board and lodgement than comparable university students.  A more detailed study would be required to assess the effect on demand for training college places if tuition fees were made comparable to those charged in universities, and if students were assisted by means of the Higher Education Grants to meet the economic cost of their board and lodging. In such a situation the colleges would have to compete with the private sector by offering accommodation to students at true market prices.</P>
      <P>Page 48 of the same document suggests a possible policy option:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> ... training colleges be financed on a basis comparable to universities that training college students' fees be pitched at a level comparable to Arts and Science students in universities that the colleges fix an economic rate for meals and accommodation; that eligible students be assisted through the higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <P>The case that was made in this document was to some extent conditional. The document also stated:</P>
    <P>A more detailed study would be required to assess the effect on the demand for training college place if tuition fees were made comparable to those charged in universities, ...</P>
    <P>We now have a situation where over night the fees are being made directly comparable to those being charged in the universities and we are not told whether this is being preceded by the type of study suggested in this report or, indeed, what the results of such a study, if any, are.</P>
    <P>The author suggested that not only should tuition fees be raised to a level comparable with university but that students be charged economic price for things that are variously subsidised at present.  I gather that this is already happening in the case of special trainee teachers in relation to canteens in the training colleges.  I would be interested to know on what grounds the Minister discriminates between special trained teachers and other students in these institutions in relation to the prices they are being charged for meals.  I believe that the authorities in St. Patrick's have already challenged some of the assumptions in that article and that the Department have accepted the validity of some of the observation which the college authorities made about the costs of the education they are providing to the students.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that it is unfair to compare the cost for a student in a teacher training college either to the average cost of a university education or indeed, to the cost of a low-cost faculty in the university because these are professional trainee teachers.  They need a relatively high level of support and subvention.  The overall result of this policy seems to be that the Minister is consciously adopting a policy in <Col N="839" /> charging extra fees of equalising the amount of money that needs to be paid by the training college student with the amount of money that needs to be paid by a university student.  He is not doing this by bringing university levels of support up to the level existing in the training colleges.  He is doing it by dragging the training colleges down to the level existing in the universities.  This is a traditional administrative way of saving money but it is actually and positively disimproving the studying and working conditions and the chances of access to these colleges for many students.</P>
    <P>In the book which the Minister published there is a table which gives some support for the belief that the percentage of students in training colleges is considerably higher than that obtaining in the universities.  I am led to believe that those figures which relate to 1974-75 are considerably out of date and that the impact of the fee increase is, therefore, all the greater because it is falling on a larger number of students than it would have fallen on in 1974-75.  We seem to have in the teacher-training colleges and in their up to now special fee structure an example of positive discrimination by the State in favour of certain educational institutions.  It is a pity that this element of positive discrimination is now being phased out because one of the arguable consequences of this positive discrimination was that it attracted into the training colleges, or at least offered the opportunity to go to training colleges, students who could not afford to go to university because the fee subsidy scheme there was not as generous as it was in training colleges.</P>
    <P>There is a particular importance for this positive discrimination in terms of teacher training colleges because, as the Minister is certainly aware, one of the major problems related to educational disadvantaged, especially in the central city area, has been the cultural gap that exists in many cases between teachers, however well trained, however intensely committed they are to their job, and the children they teach.  It is not a question of better or worse; it is a question of two different <Col N="840" /> cultures.  It stands to reason that pupils from the central city areas, the disadvantaged areas, will tend to respond more readily to teachers who have been drawn from their own background. The heavily subsidised fee to the training colleges as it existed in the past, although it may not have attracted many students from these areas of our cities, nevertheless attracted some.  The savage upper adjustment of fees to the level now existing in the universities will remove a very socially progressive form of positive discrimination which had immense positive implications for the removal of disadvantage in our central city schools, apart from the fact that it continues to leave unsolved many of the basic anomalies which result from the fact that these colleges are not under the Higher Education Authority and that their students do not come under the general higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it interesting that Deputy Horgan should come in here to cry his crocodile tears over a modest increase in fees in the training colleges, to accuse us of discrimination and to talk in emotive terms about a savage increase.  I find it interesting and surprising in somebody who has been connected as a journalist with education for some time and was a Member of the upper House but never found time, except with regard to one motion on adult education, to push the cause of education during the term of office of the previous Administration.  I have put it on the record of the House that he had a very free hand, a freer hand than most involved in politics in that he was carrying no party whip over him during that period, to put down motions for the increase of grants and for the increase of eligibility limits, but this never happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suddenly, when a different regime is in power&mdash;a regime which Deputy Horgan opposes&mdash;and responsible for the finances he becomes all concerned about the students and their incomes. I resent also his statement that the institutions which are dealing with teacher training are now giving less <Col N="841" /> value for money.  I am confident that the strictures of Deputy Horgan will have no effect upon the very fine service which these colleges are giving.</P>
    <P>I should like to state what the position is with regard to students in training colleges.  About 50 per cent of them are benefiting in one way or another from grants.  I am glad the Deputy raised this theme to enable me to outline what the real position is, without emotion.  It may not be appreciated that among third level students generally the college of education students have traditionally occupied a very good position, as Deputy Horgan has admitted.  I contend that that is something that still exists.  At present the college fee is £225 and this covers not only tuition in full but also maintenance either within the colleges or in approved accommodation outside the colleges.  For the student who lives within the college full residence could be valued at more than £500 per annum.</P>
    <P>As regards tuition, which is also free, the position in the universities is that in the Arts and Commerce faculties the fees range from £180 to £209 and in Engineering from £259 to £277. It would be reasonable to assume that the value of full maintenance and tuition for a College of Education student is £700 per annum at least.</P>
    <P>There are various categories.  The residential accommodation is limited. For those students whose normal place of residence is outside Dublin&mdash;I may refer to Limerick as well because the Deputy refers to Dublin specifically and does not seem to be too worried about Limerick&mdash;accommodation is arranged and paid for by the college authorities.  This consists of bed and breakfast.  Free bus passes are supplied to the students to cover the cost of travel to and from the colleges and the students receive their lunch and tea in the colleges.</P>
    <P>For Dublin and Limerick students who live at home, that is to say Dublin men and women and Limerick men and women, travel costs are met by the colleges and lunch and tea are provided for them in the colleges.  In addition, by reason of the fact that they live at home, these students, as of now, are <Col N="842" /> paid a fee of £3 per week.  Those figures illustrate that the value which College of Education students get for a fee of £225 is unequalled.  Obviously the State must pick up the bill for the balance between the fee charged and the actual cost of maintenance, tuition and so forth.  In fact, the <i>per capita</i> State contribution is more than six times that of the student.</P>
    <P>In order to alleviate the problems of the less well-off students a scheme of grants and loans is in operation for the College of Education.  Over 50 per cent qualify.  The scheme, which is modelled on the higher education grants scheme, is administered by the Department.  In fact, the academic attainments and the means test are the same as those applicable to the higher education scheme.  The full grant or loan is £275 and this covers the college fee and a sum of £50 is available towards the cost of books and travel.  As I mentioned, over 50 per cent of the students in the colleges at present are in receipt of either a grant or a loan.  All but 8 per cent of those receive a grant or a loan in excess of the amount of the college fee thus qualifying for free tuition and free maintenance.</P>
    <P>The fee proposed for the forthcoming academic year, 1978-79, is £260. As the grant and loan scheme will be adjusted to take account of the increased fee, the proposed increase will not affect half of the student body, that is those who fulfil the means qualifications.  For those who will not qualify for a grant or loan, the fact that they will be entitled to tuition and maintenance for a sum of £260 represents unequal value.  I do not think anybody who is living in the world of reality would challenge or question that.</P>
    <P>Another factor which should be borne in mind in this context generally is the fact that posts are available in national schools in the year of graduation for all those qualifying for the colleges.  While no guarantee of immediate employment is given, the position is that the intake into the colleges each year is matched by the estimated number of vacancies that will be available when the students graduate.  I am proud to say that in order to improve <Col N="843" /> the pupil-teacher ratio we will have the 300 extra this year plus the trainee graduates.</P>
    <P>All in all, therefore, from the point of view of either employment prospects or financial support, while following the course, there is no doubt that the College of Education students get a reasonably good deal.  I would like to give it to them totally free but we live in a certain society, you have to exercise certain options and I consider the deal is not a bad one.  This is reflected, in fact, in the demand for places in the colleges each year.  For example, this year, the academic year 1977-78 5,000 students applied for the various competitions.  About 2,500 of these qualified for the interview and the oral tests.  There were, in other words, two successful candidates available for every place in the colleges.  I am convinced that that will continue.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a couple of points that were made by Deputy Horgan. He referred to the trainee graduates. They are being paid salaries while being trained and, consequently, are asked to make special payments that the other students are not.  I consider, seeing that they are being paid, that it is not unreasonable to ask them to pay certain modest fees.  I have here a breakdown.  The various categories <Col N="844" /> now are getting what is, in fact, worth tuition plus £480, tuition plus £585 and tuition plus £489.  I want to state now, on behalf of the Government, that we will not in any way allow any deterioration in the situation relating to the training of teachers.  We will not allow the quality of their training to be impugned.  We will continue to support them and to improve the quality of education in our primary schools throughout the country.</P>
