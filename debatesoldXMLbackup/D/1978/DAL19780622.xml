      <P>: I was given to understand that the Chief Whip of the Government party made that information available to the Chief Whip of the Deputy's party yesterday, but I can repeat it.  They are the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Bill which is now in the Seanad, the Land Bond Bill which is in Committee, the International Development Association (Special Action Account) Bill, which is on Second Stage, the Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill in the Seanad, the Mergers Bill if amended in the Seanad, the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill, which is on Second Stage and the remaining Estimates.

It is necessary, particularly from the point of view of VAT-registered traders, that they get as much time as possible to prepare themselves before the enactment of the Bill and its coming into effect, which is expected to be on 1 January next.  There are complicated factors involved, and it is intended by operating in this way to furnish necessary documentation in connection with it to members of the Committee during the recess to enable them to prepare for the Special Committee meetings during the next session.</P>

    <Title>Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Bill, 1977: From the Seanad .</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 16: In subsection (2) (c), page 9, line 32, &ldquo;fully&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;substantially&rdquo; substituted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the course of the Committee Stage debate in the Dáil on 11 April, as reported at columns 407 to 409 of the Official Report, Deputy O'Keeffe questioned the provision of section 16 (2) (c) of the Bill and wondered whether the intention underlying the provision would not be satisfied if the covenant mentioned in the provision were substantially complied with, rather than fully complied with, as was the requirement under the Bill as it stood.  The Minister for Justice undertook to bring the point to the notice of the Landlord and Tenant Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed amendment arises from an <i>ad hoc</i> recommendation which the commission made to the Minister. The commission remarked that covenants were generally construed strictly against the persons who covenanted to perform certain acts and also pointed out covenants under which a lessee is obliged to build may take a variety of forms in that questions of construction depend upon the language used.  It appeared to the commission that a number of lessees who would seem to have a moral right to purchase would be excluded under the provisions in section 16 (2) (c) as it stood. They recommended that a fair compliance with a covenant to build would be ensured if &ldquo;substantially&rdquo; were inserted and &ldquo;fully&rdquo; were deleted. That is, if the provision simply required that the covenant in question had been substantially rather than fully complied with.  That is what is proposed in the amendment that was <Col N="1729" /> agreed by the Seanad.  It arises from a recommendation by Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am glad that the Government have accepted my suggestion to have this section amended.  The amendment now proposed meets the point I raised and will ensure that persons who are anxious to gain the advantage of this Act will not be excluded from doing so because of a strict interpretation of a covenant to erect buildings on the land in question. The point I made which is now being met is that if this covenant is substantially complied with, the lessee in that event will be able to take advantage of this Act.  In these circumstances I welcome this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: Amendment No. 2 is related to amendment No. 3, and amendments Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 7 are consequential.  Therefore, we will take those amendments together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 17: In subsection (2) (b), page 9, line 51, &ldquo;twenty-five&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo; substituted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 of the Bill sets out the provisions bearing on the determination of the purchase price of the fee simple where that price is being fixed by the arbitrator.  Several of these provisions, prior to these amendments, were based on the proposition that an expectant future income that will not begin to accrue for 25 years or more has no saleable value.  In other words money will not be paid today for the sake of an income 25 years or more in the future.  Accordingly section 17 (2) (b) directed the arbitrator to take account for the rent, almost certainly an increased rent, that would be reserved on a renewal of the intending purchasers' current lease, but only where that renewed rent would be payable within 25 years.  Similarly section 17 (3) excluded the benefit of the maximum purchase price under the formula in that subsection, if the purchaser holds under a lease that will expire within 25 years, while section <Col N="1730" /> 17 (5) excluded that formula price if the purchaser's lease itself provides for payment of an increased rent within 25 years.  The provisions of section 17 that have been mentioned represent the re-enactment of corresponding provisions in the 1967 Ground Rents Act.  In the 1967 Act provisions relating to this figure for 25 years, in turn, were based on recommendations of the Ground Rents Commission who had evidence that the prospect of an increased rent after a period of 25 years or longer did not affect the sale price of the rent in question.</P>
    <P>In the course of Committee Stage debate here a question was raised as to the appropriateness of a 25 year period and it was suggested that present circumstances might indicate an adjustment of the period.  The Minister for Justice undertook to refer the question to the Landlord and Tenant Commission as recorded in the Official Report of 12 April 1978 at columns 551 to 555 and the matter was accordingly referred to the commission. The commission furnished the Minister with a recommendation and remarked that when the report on ground rents was made in 1964 ground rents had a market value of 14 years purchase, representing a return on investment of 7 per cent, and an income to commence 25 years or more in future had in consequence no marketable value.</P>
    <P>The commission compared that situation with current conditions.  On the basis of current minimum rate of interest at 10 per cent, that is ten years purchase, the corresponding figure is just over 14 years instead of 25 years and a reversion, that is, expected increased future income, more than 14 years distant is as unlikely to attract a purchaser in the open market as was a reversion 25 years distant in 1964. The commission in consequence made a further <i>ad hoc</i> recommendation to the Minister that the relevant provisions of section 17 should be amended by substituting 15 years for 25 years. This recommendation was accepted by the Minister and it gives rise to amendments Nos. 2 and 3 which are related, and to the consequential amendments Nos. 4 to 7 all of which were accepted by the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: The effect of these amendments is to introduce a pretty substantial change in the position of a very large number of householders buying out under this Act.  The situation is that householders who had more than 25 years to run in their lease would have been entitled to buy out by what I refer to as the automatic multiplier which runs at around eight years purchase, and that those with less than 25 years to run would have to go to arbitration and could be paying substantially more.  I argued strongly in the Dáil that 25 years was considerably out of date, that the intention of all parties was to try to encourage the buying out of ground rents and that on that basis the 25 years should be substantially reduced to something like one year.  The Minister undertook to examine the points I raised at the time and has now gone a fair way to meet them by reducing the term to 15 years.  The effect of this will be that anybody with more than 15 years to run in their lease will be entitled to buy out on the automatic multiplier, as opposed to having to go to arbitration and pay a substantially higher figure.  In these circumstances I do not oppose these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome these amendments. We too felt that the quarter of a century provision, in terms of leases to run, was a bit excessive, and bringing it down to 15 years and availing of the general multiplier is much more equitable.  It is a significant change in the Bill.  The Minister should be commended on his flexibility in this regard. We are grateful that he has brought it back here from the Seanad in an amended form.</P>

    <P>This is a minor drafting amendment which is intended to make clear that only tenant-purchasers of houses provided by local authorities will, under section 26 (1), be given the right to acquire the fee simple interest in their dwellings.  The section does not confer the right on tenants occupying local authority housing under weekly tenancy agreements.  A weekly tenancy agreement in writing could be a lease, according to the Landlord and Tenant Acts&mdash;see the definition of &ldquo;lease&rdquo; in section 3 of this Bill&mdash;that <Col N="1733" /> is, an instrument in writing, whether under or not under seal, containing a contract of tenancy in respect of any land in consideration of a rent or return.  Hence the need to make it clear that section 26 is restricted in scope to persons who, apart from having leased their dwellings, in accordance with the meaning of that expression in the Landlord and Tenant Acts, have also purchased them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes, it is on the way.  The purpose of the Bill is to enable Ireland to participate in the Special Action Programme agreed to by the developed country participants at the Conference of International Economic Co-operation at its closing session in Paris in June, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Conference on International Economic Co-operation (CIEC or the North/South Dialogue) was established in Paris in 1975, on the initiative of the French President to <Col N="1734" /> discuss matters of mutual interest to industrial and developing countries. Discussions covered the fields of energy, raw materials, development and finance.</P>
    <P>One of the major themes in the development area was the debt problems of developing countries.  Its importance was due to the sharp rise in their total indebtedness after 1973 they borrowed to avoid the recessionary impact of the oil price rises.  It was feared that some of these countries might have reached the limit of their capacity to borrow, and there was concern that not only would default hamper their own development and indirectly those of other developing countries, but that it would have repercussions on the international banking system.</P>
    <P>While sympathetic to the needs of the developing countries, the industrial countries participating in the CIEC did not feel that concentration on the debt problem took sufficient account of the nature of the difficulties which they were experiencing.  In particular, the European Community felt that a partial answer lay in the speedy provision of additional financial assistance and it consequently proposed at the final session in June, 1977 a $1 billion &ldquo;Special Action&rdquo; programme designed to meet the needs of low income countries facing special difficulties. This was agreed to by the other developed countries, and it was decided that the $1 billion programme be shared as follows: the EEC $385 million; the United States $375 million; Japan $114 million; Canada $51 million; the balance to be provided by Sweden, Switzerland, Spain and Australia.  Of the EEC share, Ireland agreed to contribute $1.04 million or 0.27 per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>While the original Community proposal had envisaged a multilateral action administered by the International Development Association to which both industrialised and OPEC countries would contribute, other contributors have, in fact, chosen different types of contribution varying from debt relief to bilateral measures.  The Community alone has maintained its commitment to a multilateral action in the <Col N="1735" /> form of aid channelled through the association.  In this regard, an agreement was concluded between the EEC and its member states on the one hand, and the association on the other hand, which sets out the conditions under which the EEC contribution will be administered by the association.</P>
    <P>The agreement, establishing the special action account with the association, is the subject of the present Bill. It entrusts the association with the responsibility of administering the EEC's contribution of $385 million, subject to the following general provisions: loans from the account shall be concentrated on countries with a GNP per capita of $280 or less in 1976; the association will take into account the relative poverty of the developing country and its long-term growth potential, the degree of dependence on official development assistance for external capital, the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the problems of the country, its prospective balance of payments, the composition and trend of its debt service obligations, and the extent to which its problems are likely to be met by contributions from other sources. Each special action loan will be made for the purpose of financing a clearly-identifiable, quick-disbursing pro-gramme or project and will be made available interest-free, repayments being made over 50 years, this term to include a ten year grace period.</P>
    <P>Contributions to the special action account can be made in cash or demand notes.  The lodgement of demand notes has the advantage from the donor's point of view that cash is not drawn down until projects being financed are sufficiently advanced to require it.  The agreement envisages that contributions be made in two instalments, the first amounting to 45 per cent of the contribution immediately after the EEC notifies the Association that all members have ratified the agreement, the second on 1 January 1979.  The contribution counts as part of our official development assistance programme and provision has been made for it in this year's allocation.</P>
    <P>In closing, I would like to say that <Col N="1736" /> approval of this Bill will enable Ireland to play its role in putting the special action programme into effect.  This Programme is specifically designed not just to help the poorest countries, but to particularly help those of the poorest countries whose problems have been caused to some extent by factors outside their own control.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House for adoption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: This Bill does no more than is necessary for us, as mem-bers of the EEC, to play our part in helping countries which the North/ South Dialogue identified as being particularly affected by the change in the price of oil&mdash;that, in particular, but other factors as well&mdash;almost five years ago.  At that time this country was emerging from a period in which our inflation rate was higher than that of most of our neighbouring countries and, indeed, than that of our competitors. Emigration had stopped for almost the first time in 150 years.  We had a problem of unemployment which was being steadily mastered but we could see the effect of the oil crisis, as it was called, of 1973 on our economy and the push it gave to the inflationary spiral and the damning effect that had not just on trade inside the country but also on the economies of those countries with which we were just building up export markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of some of the poor countries we were in a relatively good position to withstand the effect of the oil price increase, and sometimes I am amused now when I hear condemnation by various interests of the effect on their businesses or commercial undertakings of a rise of 2p or 3p, as occurred last week, in the price of petrol.  I think back to four-and-a-half years ago when the price of oil quadrupled.  That had to be absorbed into our economy then.  Every effort had to be made to ensure it would do the least possible damage to the economy and have the least possible effect on employment, recognising that this was a transfer of money from the pockets of our people&mdash;I am speaking of Ireland particularly&mdash;to <Col N="1737" /> the OPEC nations and the other oil producing nations.  A huge sum of money running, if memory serves me correctly, to well over £70 million a year, was removed from the standard of living of the Irish people and trans-ferred to the OPEC countries.</P>
    <P>That appeared to be a bonanza for the oil producers in 1973-74.  Some of them used the money extremely cleverly but others rather in the manner of the rake's progress.  The bigger ones certainly used the money well.  They invested it and got a good return.  They recognised very quickly that, even though they got money in large amounts into their own coffers, that would not continue if the effect of transferring that wealth from the developed western world, which was their principal customer, was going to damage the economy of the western world.  That lesson was learned very quickly, not by all the oil producing nations but certainly by the most important ones, and the acceptance of that lesson has mercifully had the effect of keeping the price of oil at a stable level for a number of years now. As one can see from the meeting of the OPEC Ministers last weekend, it is not by any means plain sailing for some of them if their view of the long-term effects on the economies of the world are not accepted by some of their partners and the price of oil is increased after January next with all its consequences.</P>
    <P>On the international scene we are told that inflation is by no means under control and it will not take much to start the spiral moving up again.  An increase in the price of oil next year of a significant nature might be just the very thing that would trigger off inflation and, from that point of view, our future is not altogether in our own hands.  Up to this we have been, of course, in a relatively comfortable position compared to some countries in Africa, Asia and South America, countries predominantly rural in character with an agricultural economy, countries which had just begun to move out of the medieval type of economy and were beginning to appreciate the value of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>Naturally the first thing that <Col N="1738" /> suffered was the use of fertilisers. Their use was reduced despite the advice from agencies all over the world, such as the FAO and so on, which had been impressing on them the value of fertilisers in order to increase crops and exports and give a better standard of living to their people.  These countries stopped using sufficient fertilisers.  Crops started to go back and the result was they could afford to use still less fertiliser the following year.</P>
    <P>It is only right that the North/ South Dialogue should have identified those countries needing instant help and provided interest free loans or grants.  In the case of the EEC it is interest free loans.  I am not sure what Canada, the USA and Japan are going to do but it is right that one billion dollars should be set aside by the better off nations to help these countries.  Apart from the charitable Christian approach it is a good investment because it will ensure that the economies of these countries are developed and the countries are not allowed to be sucked into a sphere of influence or help from countries with whose outlook and ideological approach we would not agree.</P>
    <P>That is one point that should be borne in mind.  The other is, and I suppose this should really rank first with a Christian country like Ireland, that we should appreciate that there are people in other countries who are very poor indeed, living well below the poverty line, even as we understand it, and should be prepared to give an instant injection of help without which many of these people will certainly die.  The sum here is relatively small&mdash; 0.27 per cent of what the EEC is contributing and that is really only about 30 per cent of what the total fund will be so that in fact what we are giving is .009 of 1 per cent of the total fund.  Naturally we would wish to give more.  I am not sure if this will be the total investment in this fund or if the fund will be renewed from time to time with the EEC making further contributions later on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am sorry about that.  One of the ways of bringing home to people this sense of urgency is to point out that this is entirely separate from all other funds, will be administered separately and will be distributed to worth-while projects as quickly as possible.  The Minister said that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This programme is specifically designed not just to help the poorest countries, but to particularly help those of the poorest countries whose problems have been caused to some extent by factors outside their own control.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I cannot bring to mind immediately any country whose poverty is not to some extent caused now by circumstances which are outside their control or was caused by circumstances which were outside their control 50 years ago.</P>
      <P>We are glad to support this Bill.  I can promise the House that if, in future, governments bring in proposals for this country to help the less developed countries and to see that the inhabitants of those countries are brought up at least to the poverty level we enjoy, we will support them.  The degree of poverty in many countries is totally unknown to the poorest person in this country.  We have no conception of the number of people who die simply because they do not have enough food and that applies also to children only weeks old.  Anybody who has been to Africa or the Far East will know what I mean.  They will know that on the outskirts of many fine African cities there are levels of deprivation and poverty that are unknown to the poorest Irish person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the politics of the world today are the politics of selfishness and that the haves are grabbing more and ignoring the have nots.  We are very fond of saying that we brought Christianity to Europe during the dark ages.  We are naturally concerned about our own future but we should not obscure our vision as to why we wanted our independence to run our own country.  The fight for <Col N="1740" /> freedom was not to get hold of a bit of land and grow more wheat, produce more barrels of stout or to breed better horses so that our people would have a higher standard of living, although that was part of it.  The underlying theme was that we felt we could contribute to the development of Europe and the world and that we had uniquely a message to bring to the world which was being stifled because we were not masters of our own destiny.</P>
    <P>We now have that chance and we should not allow concern about our material future to put us off our stride by what I believe is the temporary phenomenon of the politics of selfishness. If we do not see we have a role to play and a contribution to make to the development of the EEC, we would be probably just as well off without our freedom because it means nothing.  It is because we have a role to play that we wanted that freedom. The freedom which allows us to contribute to this fund should not allow us to lose sight of our duty and what I believe is the desire of our people to see that the benefits we have will be available to the people of the poorest nations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Labour Party approve this Bill, which is essentially a stop-gap measure arising out of the situation after 1973 when the poverty stricken countries borrowed to avoid the recessionary impact of oil prices. It is encouraging to note that all the indications are that for the rest of this year there will not be a further increase in the price of oil and that this could last well into the first half of next year.  Nevertheless the palliative action taken in this once-off measure is only a drop in the ocean in terms of the impact which the increase in oil prices had on the energy and raw material requirements generally of the poorest countries.  It is sobering to note that the countries concerned had a GNP <i>per capita</i> of about £150 in 1976. That by any standards is a standard of abject poverty.  We are making a small contribution when compared with that being made by countries like the United States of America and Canada. These contributions are needed and welcomed and we approve the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1741" /> A Bill of this nature focuses attention on the need for full acceptance of the role of the European Community in relation to the development of the Third World through the progressive development of world trade rather than coming to this House on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis after each crisis.  With the levelling off of oil prices in particular, now is the time for greater support for the creation of the necessary international institutions for economic progress to assist those countries.  For example, the extension of the Lomé Convention could be quite pertinent in many of the areas mentioned this morning. Therefore I trust that this minimal Bill will spur on the Community to adopt a firm and progressive position in the international relief of poverty and the creation of a new economic order to assist those countries.  We have no hesitation in encouraging the Minister to transmit, as a matter of urgency, the Irish contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I thank the Deputies for the welcome and the support they have expressed for the Bill. Regarding a point raised by Deputy Desmond I would point out that the special action account is for this contribution but that this is in addition to the European countries' contribution to the International Development Association.  Ireland's contribution is in the context of our membership of the EEC, and while the contribution is small compared with the overall amount of a billion dollars, this year our contribution to the development countries will be £9.64 million.  That includes the £596,000.</P>
      <P>We would all hope that the fears expressed by Deputy Barry would not be realised in the take-off of a round of oil price increases.  While increases in oil prices had an effect on the developing countries, it represented only some of the problem.  Another aspect of the problem was the increase in the prices of imports of commodities from Europe and other countries and the drop in exports from the developing countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This section proposes that the total amount of land bonds created and issued under this Bill shall not exceed £80 million.  That is an increase of £20 million if, as I understand it, the present limit is £60 million.  We all know that land bonds are a controversial method of paying for land acquired by the Land Commission. That controversy is due to the history of land bonds.  I recall that when I qualified as a solicitor land bonds were standing on the Stock Exchange over par.  People in those days were taking out insurance policies against the redemption of land bonds because on redemption they were losing up to £5, £7 or £10 per £100.  That situation changed considerably with the changes in the value of money and the drift started against land bonds until they fell on the market and were worth only about half their face value.  From then on they became a very controversial and objectionable method of paying for land acquired from people against their will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cash is the ideal method of paying for land which people are forced to sell to the Land Commission.  I am sure I am not disclosing any State secret when I say that during my time <Col N="1743" /> as Minister for Lands I was very hopeful of being able to substitute cash for land bonds.  However, the recession to which the Minister of State at the Department of Finance referred a moment ago occurred and it was then impossible for me to go ahead with my proposal.  But I would have expected the Government in their early days of affluence to have abolished land bonds and to have substituted cash payments.  When we are considering the payment for land acquired by the Land Commission in a way that may be less valuable than cash we are talking of taking land from people against their will.  In these circumstances one would have expected the Government on resuming office to have made a top priority the payment in cash for land acquired, especially having regard to their ability to find money to allow them abolish wealth tax, to abolish car tax, to abolish rates and so on although the benefit accruing from the abolition of rates has not manifested itself in the pockets of the people who had been paying rates.</P>
    <P>On the face of it the Government might have felt it was not urgent to abolish land bonds.  If that is the case it is because during the term of office of the National Coalition for the first time land bonds bore a proper rate of interest.  I am very glad it was in my term as Minister for Lands that the 16 per cent land bond was issued. It has now reached £120 on the Stock Exchange.  During my term also the 15 per cent land bond was issued, which is still standing at an attractive price on the Stock Exchange.  I also believe it was during the term of office of the National Coalition that the 14¾ per cent land bond was issued, which is also standing at a reasonable price on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>I want an assurance from the Minister, who is putting this Bill through the House, that future issues of land bonds will bear a rate of interest that will ensure that as far as possible they will maintain their value.  He should inform the Department of Finance that they should err on the side of generosity in fixing a rate of interest <Col N="1744" /> for land bonds to ensure that when they are issued at £100 they will not fall to £50 and £40 in value, as has happened in the past.  I know it is not in order for me to try to argue amendments which have been ruled out of order or to question why they have been ruled out of order, but Deputy D'Arcy and Deputy Bruton had what I think is a very original idea of providing that the rate of interest of existing land bonds should be revised from time to time.  This would ensure that the land bonds which are given in exchange for something as precious as land will maintain their value and will be marketable.</P>
    <P>That amendment has been ruled out of order but I suggest it was a reasonable way of ensuring that land bonds maintain their value.  People have been left destitute in former years by holding on to land bonds they got in exchange for their land and the bottom fell out of the land bonds.  We see in the paper that 8 per cent land bonds are standing at £60.50, 9½ per cent are standing at 80.25p and other 9½ per cent bonds are standing at 74.25p.  We all know that there are 7 per cent, 6 per cent and 5 per cent land bonds standing at much lower figures.  It was only during the term of office of the National Coalition that reasonable rates of interest of 16 per cent, 15 per cent and 14¾ per cent rates of interest were fixed on land bonds.  Those bonds are still holding their value.</P>
    <P>People still do not like land bonds. They object to taking them because their fingers, their ancestors' and their neighbours' fingers were burned in the past and it is a job to sell them even though they are better than cash at the moment.  I want the Minister to give a guarantee that he will ensure that generous rates of interest are fixed for land bonds.  What does he think of the suggestion of writing into the Bill that the rates of interest on land bonds issued from now on will be revised from time to time?  The object of issuing land bonds is to pay for land which in the future will be acquired from the land owners.  Have the Land Commission justified the necessity for asking for an increase in the amount of land bonds they want available to them?  It is fashionable to say that <Col N="1745" /> there is no necessity for the Land Commission now and that they are not doing any useful work.  There is certainly plenty of work for them to do. The Minister should justify the necessity for asking for an increase of £20 million in land bonds by telling us what the Land Commission propose to do with it.  There has never been such unfair competition for land as there is at the moment.  Small farmers who want to bring their acreage up to a viable workable unit have no chance of competing with the speculators, the non-farmers and the big farmers.  In today's <i>Irish Independent</i> we see that 80 acres of land in Kildare have been sold at £246,000.</P>

I am prepared to give the Deputies a fair amount of latitude on this but we are getting wide of the little Bill before the House, which only deals with an increase in the amount being provided for land bonds.  It does not deal with interest or anything else.  I understand that the interest is actually fixed by another Bill.  I ask Deputy Fitzpatrick to stay with the section which is be-fore us.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The fact that it is a one section Bill does not mean that it is not fairly wide in its scope.  It seeks £20 million worth of land bonds from the taxpayers.  I am only asking the Minister what he proposes to do with that £20 million and I am only telling him what I think he should do with it. I cannot think, with due respect, of anything which is more relevant than what will be done with this £20 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1746" /> I am not going to encroach on the Adjournment Debate by making a lengthy speech but there are a few things to be said which I think I should say.  Never before in my pro-fessional or public life have I seen such a snatch-and-grab raid for land. Small farmers are anxious to increase their acreage.  There is no way they can do that by buying land on the open market.  Today's <i>Irish Independent</i> shows that 80 acres of land in Kildare, including a house with no bathroom or toilet, was sold for £246,000, or £3,075 per acre.  In my own county, the land of a farmer who recently got 16 acres from the Land Commission adjoins a farm of less than 20 acres&mdash; that will give you an idea of the sort of farmer he is.  As he wanted further land, he talked to me about the possibility of getting the Land Commission to acquire it.  I told him I did not know whether they would acquire it or whether he would be in a position to get it if they did acquire it.  That man, with approximately 45 acres, in order to get less than 20 acres of non-residential land had to pay £38,500 for it in County Cavan, almost £2,000 per acre.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of situation in which small farmers find themselves.  They are at the mercy of everybody who thinks it is fashionable, safe and a good investment to buy land.  That is the case of the speculator, the pro-fessional man, the businessman and the big farmer.  These are the people who would not look across a ditch not so many years ago never mind working land.  These are the people who were laughing at the farmers during the economic war.  These are the people who would not bother with land during the time of compulsory tillage. Now they want to squeeze out the man who stayed on the land during that time and who is now entitled to increase his acreage.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Land Commission are working as hard as they should and I begrudge them the £20 million in land bonds because they are not protecting the small farmer.  It now takes a row to get the Land Commission to serve a notice under the Land Act to freeze land.  It has come <Col N="1747" /> to the stage where the Land Commission could be said to be discriminating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: What we are discussing now would be relevant to the Estimate but it is not relevant to this small section.  I have given the Deputy latitude but he is really going to town on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It could be said that the Land Commission are acquiring land in a discriminatory fashion.  I am not saying that they are behaving in a biased or dishonest way but they are operating in a hit-and-miss fashion.  If there is a very active politician in the area a notice will be served.  The Land Commission should operate in such a way that the inspectors will keep a fatherly eye on what is going on.  It should not have to wait until a TD, a deputation or the land league kick up a row.  That is unfair and discrim-inates in favour of some people and against others.  It is operating in favour of the powerful or the man who is prepared to kick up a row.</P>
      <P>Before I left the Department of Lands a committee was set up to advise the Minister.  It consisted of representatives from the Departments of Lands, Finance and Agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If I do not urge the De-partment to do something about the matter many farmers in my constituency and in Deputy Callanan's constituency will be invaded by speculators and land robbers of all descriptions during those four months. Thousands of acres of land will be out of the reach of the people who want <Col N="1748" /> it if the Land Commission do not get busy.</P>
      <P>We are awaiting the final report of the inter-departmental committee.  There was enough advice in the first report to protect the small farmer if the Land Commission would do it.  There is a suggestion that a priority register should be established and that the people on it should have prior access to land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I appreciate that, but I would be prepared to debate in some place the relevancy of my questioning the spending of this £20 million worth of land bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the Minister for Agriculture made a speech recently in which he outlined elaborate plans for protecting the small farmer.  He pro-poses to introduce legislation, we are told, towards the end of the year. Those of us who have had experience in office know that the end of the year might mean the end of next year. While we await the legislation, whether it is the result of this inquiry or the result of the Minister for Agriculture's own views, the small farmers will remain at the mercy of the world and thousands of acres will pass out of their reach and into the hands of people who can pay over £3,000 an acre for it in Kildare and £2,000 an acre in Cavan.  I do not want the Land Commission to mark time with the £20 million, as the Department of Finance want them to, but to remain <Col N="1749" /> active and exercise their existing powers of serving notices where they should be served.  They should not wait for Deputies or Senators to come to them with a deputation or kicking up a row.  I want the Land Commission to commit themselves to spending this £20 million operating the machinery they have now.</P>
    <P>We all know that when a new policy is being introduced, the old policy is allowed to slow down.  Indeed, it has come to a halt.  The Minister of State comes from a constituency where land is very precious and where it is even a bigger problem than it is in my constituency. He knows the machinery is there if the Department of Finance take off the brakes and allow the Land Commission to serve these notices and hold up sales to the wrong people.  Even after the sales have taken place, if it transpires that a non-farmer, or somebody who already has far too much land, is the purchaser, what is wrong with putting on a freeze notice?  What is wrong with holding it up for three months and renewing the notice for another three months under the statute until the matter is inquired into?</P>
    <P>Land is not mobile.  Once it passes into the wrong hands and remains there for some time, it is a big job to get it out of them.  I would have spoken on Second Stage but for the fact that the Bill came into the House quite quickly.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): With the knowledge I have of the working of the Land Com-mission, and the knowledge I have of rural Ireland, I would be failing in my duty if I did not say what I am saying <Col N="1750" /> now.  It is nothing less than a public and a national disgrace that the 30 acre and the 40 acre farmer is being thrown to the wolves and neglected. The Department of Finance are refusing to allow the Land Commission to serve statutory notices.  This is certainly a case of fiddling while Rome burns and standing by and marking time while small farmers are being devoured by wolves.</P>
      <P>We need viable farms and we need many farmers in the 50 acre to 70 acre category.  We could have many more of those people if the Land Commission were allowed by the Department of Finance to exercise their existing powers.  There is supposed to be no recession now. Perhaps we were affluent from June 1977 to June 1978 only, and we are now back into a recession, but this is a necessary priority.  It cannot wait, because damage is being done and small farmers are becoming very angry.  I do not think they will put up with it much longer.  I never believed in boycotts, or writing on walls, or writing on roads, or attending auctions carrying placards, but the people I am talking about are becoming very frustrated and very annoyed. There is no use in talking about machinery next year or the year after. Now is the time we want action, and now is the time the people I am talking about want protection.</P>

      <P>: It is very important that this £80 million should be avail-able to the Land Commission.  I agree with what Deputy Fitzpatrick said about orders on land sales.  Let the purchasers wait for three months while the Land Commission find out whether they are the right type of people to buy land.  I should like to see that done across the board by the Land Commission.  I have been a Member of this House for some years and I have always pressed to have this done.</P>
      <P>I was here when Deputy Fitzpatrick introduced a Lond Bonds Bill and I told him what I thought about land bonds.  At the time he pointed out to me, and rightly so, that we could afford to pay for land through land bonds only.  I said the interest should not remain static.  Land bonds at 7, 8 and 9 per cent were useless to the people who got them.  If they were reviewed periodically, even every two years, they would not stink as much as they do.  I hope the House will excuse me for using that expression.  I complimented Deputy Fitzpatrick on the fact that in his Bill they were redeemable in 26 years.  If I am wrong, the Deputy will contradict me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I understand an amendment has been put down to make them redeemable in ten years. I would like to see that done if we can afford it.  Even at 16 per cent, nobody likes land bonds.  The fact is that the only way we can afford to pay for land is through land bonds.  This has been accepted on all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission are now getting an extra £20 million.  For the past three years, when it was even suggested that there might be some control over the sale of land, there have been wholesale sales of land.  I agree with what Deputy Fitzpatrick said about fiddling while Rome burns.  I should like to see an order right across the board on all land sales until the Land Commission investigate them.  I have been pressing for this for a long time. I am a bit fed up by the fact that <Col N="1752" /> pressure has to be put on.  It is a pity in this day and age that people should have to write on the walls or stand with placards outside auctions to get their rights.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill.  The Land Commission have money, not necessarily in ready cash but in the bonds.  When this new land authority is proposed to be set up I will have a lot to say on it.  We will need to be careful when we dismiss the Land Commission.  Maybe we do not agree with everything they did, but when local committees decide who goes on a panel we could have severe trouble and get into deep water.  A lot of blood has been spilled over land and that could happen again.  I am sorry, I am straying from the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I agree entirely with Deputy Fitzpatrick when he says that when we are discussing this little one section we are discussing the entire Bill.  This one section is all that is in the Bill.  The Minister for Agriculture is coming into this House seeking the permission of the House to create an extra £20 million for land bonds. Every Deputy in the House has a right to be concerned about a number of things.  He has a right to be concerned about how this £20 million of bonds is going to be used.  He has also a right to be concerned about the quality of this thing called land bonds that is used in substitution for money. Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Callanan have a perfect right to be concerned about those small-holders who are anxious to make their holdings viable by getting an extra piece of land, but I am also concerned about the small farmer who could happen to be selling land because he is unable to work it because he has grown old or feeble.  It could be a widow who would be in this position.  The land is not being worked and it is an obvious thing for the Land Commission to move in and seek to get this land so that it can be properly used and perhaps make an adjoining holding viable.  The Land Commission should be the most attractive purchaser of land, not the least attractive.  The majority of people, particularly small people who are contemplating selling land, are frightened by land bonds and the history of land bonds gives them every right to feel like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of the bonds diminished over the years in so many instances. <Col N="1754" /> There should be some guarantee that the bonds used in lieu of money should be guaranteed throughout the period that those bonds are held by the person who obtained them in the first instance and was compelled to accept them.  It should be possible to guarantee the value to the extent that sterling holds its value so that it would be the same for those people as if they had cash in their pockets.  That is not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>It has been said in this House on many occasions that the Government's bank would not accept land bonds as collateral because they knew the dangers of so doing.  Naturally we should be concerned about both the buyer and the seller if we are going to have anything like equity in the purchase of land by the Land Commission. The Land Commission must become active, and I am pleased to see them coming in here looking for the permission of the House to create this additional amount of bonds.  I am sorry that it is not cash.  If it were cash you would get sellers much more readily and you would be much more likely to have land passing into the hands of people who should get it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>: We expected to get the cash from the EEC and we did not get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>: There is a difficulty about cash, and I have yet to see the time when we will not have difficulty about cash.  As has been said already, the Government have misused the cash they got and they now have to find ways and means of substituting something else for cash.  It would be very desirable if this could be done, and the Land Commission would be pleased if they could get cash instead of bonds.  I remember a previous Fianna Fáil Minister for Lands criticising the system he had to operate, and that will be well remembered by people who were in the House at the time.  We all regret that the system must be operated in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concern expressed may have seemed a bit wide of this little section, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle <Col N="1755" /> has said, but this little section is the entire Bill.  If we talk about the Bill we talk about the section and <i>vice-versa</i>. I hope that the Minister when he gets to his feet to discuss this sec-tion will be able to give the House some sort of undertaking that the value of these land bonds will be guaranteed to whoever receives them and that the bonds when they are created will be used for paying for the activities of the Land Commission. Buying has been more or less dormant in the Land Commission for the last 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Not three years.  Up to 40,000 acres of land were acquired in the last year of the previous Government. Therefore there is no point in saying that that Government were idle over that period, but there was a definite policy to cease acquiring land and to get on with the division of the land they had.  I see nothing wrong with getting on with a division of the land they had, but there should be no question of ceasing the acquisition of land when it can be used to increase holdings of small farmers and bring them up to a viable level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I conclude by saying that I am very anxious to come in here and express my support for the creation of these bonds.  I hope that the Land Commission will become active again in the acquisition of land and that when they acquire the land they do not sit on it for years.  I know of a case where a man was told that he could sell his own house and give an exchange. There was a question of 30 acres of land.  It has been set since and the man has sold his house.  He bought a plot beside the other plot and built a house on it and still there is no decision. Then he was told that the local Land Commission agent told him this and that it was not a top level decision. This sort of thing should not be allowed to go on.  It is misuse of State money and State bonds.  That is another reason why Members should be concerned about the use to which this additional £20 million is put to and about the quality of the bonds and the <Col N="1756" /> value of the guarantee of the bonds in the long term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>: My contribution to this Bill was more or less put down in the amendments which were ruled out of order.  These amendments were put down to help rather than to hinder and it is a pity they were ruled out.</P>
      <P>The only real change in the Land Commission over the past four or five years is that it has been brought under the Department of Agriculture.  This was a necessary step but I am sorry to see that there has been no new thinking since then.  To operate properly the Land Commission need new thinking in relation to a lot of issues relating to land bonds.  Several cases were cited as to what is occuring in different counties.  The question of selling land for land bonds is a serious question for the vendor.</P>
      <P>A new development in my county is that when property is offered for sale there is a huge amount of agitation by the locals, the Land Commission are contacted and they rush out and inspect the place and the result of all the pressure is that few people wish to purchase the land.  A price below the actual value of the land is set and the Land Commission move in.  This is very unfair and it has occurred in several places.  I know of an area where at least five meetings were held and there was a desperate amount of agitation and aggravation to the extent that the price of the land was ruined.  To eliminate this many changes would have to be made at land bond level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1934, approximately £60 million have been issued in land bonds. I accept that up to 1960 money was difficult to acquire but since then new thinking in relation to buying land for cash should have operated in the Land Commission.  Will the Minister of State tell me what amount of land the Land Commission have on hands at the moment and the cash value of it? Without wishing to criticise the Land Commission officials whose policies are dictated by the attitude of the Government, I must say that they divide land at a snail's pace.  Land has been held for 10, 12 or 14 years.  In order to create a pool of money for purchasing land it is essential that the <Col N="1757" /> land be offered for cash to prospective purchasers within three or four years.  The Land Commission are not alone offering to act as an agent for acquiring land but are money lenders as well.  This is not their role.  That is the role of the commercial banks and the ACC, who should make money available for buying land with cash, thereby creating a situation where a Land Commission representative is welcomed by a farmer who wishes to sell land.  At present they are not welcome because they pay for land in very low interest rates and these have depreciated very considerably. This is creating a climate against the Land Commission and land bonds.  We are asked to give another issue of £20 million.  I am not against it because if we do not issue this it will hold up the purchase of land across the country.  We cannot do that, but we can try to persuade the powers that be to change the system to make it more effective.  The system will have to be changed.  There were two cases in Wexford recently that went to the courts.  The Land Commission lost one of the cases and I believe will lose the other.  The people are watching the progress of the cases through the courts and will use the courts to beat the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>How much land has been purchased in the last 12 months up to the end of April?  Deputy Clinton said that he believed that the Land Commission were slowing up in the purchase of land.  Are they slowing up?</P>
    <P>In relation to the interest rate, the rate given by the Minister the last day was about 12½ per cent.  It should be at least 1½ per cent above the current interest rates in the commercial banks for people paid with land bonds in order to satisfy the people and to create a climate where Land Commission representatives will be welcomed on farms.  I am sure the Minister of State knows that when the Land Commission go to purchase land on a farm the people immediately go to their local TD to see if anything can be done about it.  It should be the other way around.  The representative should be welcomed and he should be prepared to give them the economic price, or <Col N="1758" /> the price appertaining for land on the public market at the time.  That is the way land should be bought.</P>
    <P>Delay in the purchase of land is also a serious matter.  If the Land Commission are forced through their own courts and through the law courts available to the ordinary public it can take up to four years&mdash;provided one wins the case&mdash;before one can actually purchase the land, which must be very frustrating for everybody concerned. Surely a scheme carrying such problems cannot be a success.  The Land Commission are the people who are equipped, who have the personnel and know-how to purchase such land for the small farmers of this nation.  Never before were the farmers so much in need of somebody with the right kind of power, policy and approach to guarantee them some hope of making their holdings viable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Chair has been very flexible this morning in allowing Deputies to engage in a full dress debate on this Bill.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to raise from £60 million to £80 million the total amount of land bonds which may be created to pay for land acquired by the Land Commission.  There has been a lot of debate on this issue over the years in which I participated at various times on the Estimate for the Department of Lands and so on.</P>
      <P>We all appreciate that it would be much more acceptable to substitute cash for land bonds.  Deputy Fitzpatrick will know, from his own experience as Minister, and indeed Deputy Clinton also, that it would not be possible for him.  Probably the Minister for Agriculture himself would have the same problem at present getting money from the Department of Finance to pay for land purchase in cash.  If we did not have land bonds at present possibly the acreage purchased by the Land Commission would be a lot smaller than it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned the price paid for land in County Kildare, as quoted in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>. It is a regular feature of auctions at present that land goes anything from <Col N="1759" /> £2,000 to say, £4,000 an acre.  I believe it fetches £4,000 in some parts of Cork at present.  At a price of £2,000 per acre&mdash;which is not the top of the current price range by any means&mdash; that would represent an annuity of £250.  If one calculates it at £4,000 per acre it would represent an annuity of £500.  I do not think the Department of Finance or any government could be expected to finance that kind of enterprise.  Even though we do not agree with land bonds, do not like them and have spoken against them they constitute a necessary part of land purchase at present.</P>
    <P>I shall not dwell on the issues raised by Deputies opposite.  I understand their feelings in this respect.  The Minister has said already that the Government are not committing themselves to an indefinite continuation of existing land policy.  They have indicated already that they propose to reform land policy.  To this end they have indicated that they propose to establish a new Land Authority responsible for structural reform.  Possibly at that stage there will be plenty of scope for Deputies on both sides of the House to air their views on how this authority will operate and so on.  No doubt we will all have plenty to say on it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the revision of rate of interest on existing land bonds this would involve also a revision of resale annuities based on those bonds and would be entirely impractical. Furthermore, revision of the land bond rate of interest would have to be both upwards and downwards.  Therefore it is not as easy a problem as one might expect.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy asked for the acreage of land on hand by the Land Commission at present.  I understand it is 74,000 acres.  I cannot put a market value on that for the Deputy.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1760" /> While this is a short Bill the Minister, in introducing Second Stage, may have encouraged Deputies to broaden the scope of the discussion because he did so in his brief.  Deputies will have ample opportunity for discussing Land Commission problems and land struc-tural reform in the legislation that is promised to be introduced towards the end of the year.  At present I have nothing further to say on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): As I have said in this House on a few occasions mathematics are not my long suit.  On looking at what is involved here I begin to ask myself: are the Land Commission about to fold up?  I should like to ask the Minister two or three ques-tions. First of all, perhaps the Minister could tell me&mdash;and I think it is relevant&mdash;the amount of land acquired by the Land Commission for the last available year.  The next question I should like to ask him is how much of the £20 million is committed already? What value of old land bonds is available? There seems to be a certain urgency about this Bill.  It appears to me as if some of this £20 million is already committed.  The Minister has taken £2,000 per acre as being the current value of land.  It is at least that because we know that in the more fertile counties, with better land, it is way above £3,000 per acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take a figure of £2,000.  Am I correct in thinking that £20 million worth of land bonds will pay for only 10,000 acres of land?  If my mathematics are correct that is the position.  If that is so, if the Land Commission are doing anything at all, that such represent less than four months intake of land.  Therefore, what we are having a debate about here is really giving the Land Commission authority to remain in operation for four months longer.  The Land Commission are doing nothing if they are not acquiring in the neighbourhood of 40,000 acres of land a year.  At £2,000 per acre this Bill represents 10,000 acres of land.  I put it to the Minister and to the House that that&mdash;I will go down now and say the very minimum that they ever did was 30,000 acres <Col N="1761" /> a year, although I have reason to believe that they did not do 30,000 acres last year and I would like the Minister to tell me&mdash;assuming they did do 30,000 acres, 10,000 is a third of that and represents only four months work.  Is that what we are talking about here?  Is that the reason the Bill was introduced?  Is it an indication that the operations of the Land Commission are coming to a halt?  Is it an indication that the Land Commission will take no steps between now and the end of the year to serve notices, to protect the small farmers of the west, of Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal, and the small farmers of the other areas of the country where there is acute congestion, such as Kerry, Cork, parts of Limerick, Clare, every county practically?  Is that the position&mdash;that we are only going to vote four months work to the Land Commission?</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to deal with those points because they are very relevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: First of all I should like to answer the question regarding the intake of land last year.  The total intake was 29,000 acres.  Purchases for bonds amounted to almost 15,000 acres.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes.  most of the £20 million here is to pay for lands at different stages of acquisition.  They are lands in the pipeline for which the Land Commission have been negotiat-ing and this money is needed to pay for them.  The price was agreed and fixed some time ago.  I cannot say for what length of time this £20 million will last, but the recent average price would be around £700 to £800 per acre.  That probably is not the price obtaining at the moment but that was the recent average price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Am I right in think-ing that with 74,000 acres at approximately £2,000 an acre the land acquired by the Land Commission <Col N="1762" /> would be obtained at a very low price?  The Minister of State talked about £700 to £800 an acre.  Is it not possible to use this money to speed up the division of land?  I presume the land is not given to the tenant at the price at which it was purchased.  The price is adjusted.  Could the Minister of State give us some idea of how the price is adjusted from the time the land was bought until the time it is allotted to the tenant?</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The information we have now got from the Minister of State is really quite alarming.  It appears the Land Commission acquired only 15,000 acres last year.  I thought we were doing badly when we acquired 35,00 acres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): But for land bonds only 15,000 acres.  In my time the Land Commission would have been doing well when it acquired 35,000 acres.  It is obvious now the Department of Finance has called a halt and directed the Department of Agriculture to stop acquiring land.  Surely this is not made a very valid point when he said made a very valid point when he said the snatch and grab raid is now on. There is a rumour of measures being taken to protect the small man.  These measures should have been taken six months or a year ago.  In the interim the speculators have become as busy as beavers buying land.  We will adjourn the House for the next four months and we are not giving the Land Commission enough money to carry on during those four months.  The Land Commission has been idle for the last 12 months if it acquired only 15,000 acres.  This is a national dis-grace. Small farmers are being exexploited. They are being prevented from getting land.  It is a serious business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complaints have been made over the years but I want to go on record now as saying things have never been so bad as they have been in the last 12 months.  The speculative price is far in excess of £2,000 in the Minister's <Col N="1763" /> county, in Deputy Callanan's county and Deputy White's county and it is £3,000 an acre elsewhere.  That is not good enough.  It is something that would nearly demand this House remaining in session in order to protect the small farmers.  It is no use locking the stable door after the horse has gone.  Acres of land are being bought up every day of the week.  The Mini-ster for Agriculture is alleged to have a scheme in mind.  I hope he has and that he will bring it in without delay. I hope the scheme will work and that those who have been speculating in land will be prevented from doing still more damage.  The Minister of State must know more about the problems of congestion, the fragmentation of holdings and the difficulties of small farmers than anybody else.  I want a promise from him now that section 40 will be used energetically to preserve the <i>status quo</i> and stop the wolves being let loose between now and legislation to protect the small farmers.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Clinton, I do not want to confiscate land.  I want the vendors to get a proper price for their land.  It was the Minister for Agriculture in a Coalition Government, Deputy Dillon, who was responsible for giving the farmer the value of his land.  Prior to that there was an artificial value.  The farmer got a price that would be fair to him, fair to the Land Commission and fair to the tenant.  It was a Coalition Government that put market value on the statute book.  I am really worried about the plight of small farmers between now and next year because the speculators may have got a warning.  It is equivalent to telling someone six months prior to the budget that the price of cigarettes will be increased, the price of drink and the price of some other consumable commodity.  We all know what happens. There is stockpiling.  That is what may well happen here.  I do not want to use extravagant language, but the position is unjust and unfair.  It is certainly not in the national interest and not in accordance with the pious hope expressed in the Constitution that as many as possible should be settled <Col N="1764" /> and maintained on the land.  A lousy £20 million is being voted here, four months' work for the Land Commission. I never heard worse.  Will the Minister give us some assurance that he will talk to his colleagues about what will happen now?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The situation is not nearly as bad as Deputy Fitzpatrick would have us believe.  Remember the intake over the last few years:  In 1973-74 the total acreage acquired was 17,957; in 1974 the intake went up to 21,374; in 1975 it was 27,481; in 1976 it went over 31,000 and in 1977, 29,816.</P>

This £20 million will allow the Land Commission to continue their programme over the next two years and if, at the end of that time, more money is required I am sure the Mini-ster responsible will be here looking for more money.  There is nothing to be alarmed about.  The Minister for Agriculture has already indicated that he hopes to bring in legislation before the end of the year.  That is a guarantee that the Government realise the importance of doing something about land purchase, land resale and land resettlement.  I am sure we can wait for that legislation and have a full scale debate then.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I appeal to Fianna Fáil backbenchers to save the small farmers.  They cannot trust the Depart-ment of Finance when Fianna Fáil are in power.  We heard that in 1973 there were only 17,000 acres of land acquired and when we left office the acquisition was over 30,000 acres.  That figure is going down again.  When Fianna Fáil are in power the Land Commission are throttled and stifled by the Department of Finance.  Unless <Col N="1765" /> there is a row in the Fianna Fáil Party rooms, these farmers will be robbed.  There is the evidence.  I do not blame the Land Commission.  I know the officers in the commission are dedicated men prepared to do the work.  I was there long enough to know how the Department of Finance operate.</P>
      <P>I repeat, in 1972-73 there were 17,000 acres and in 1976 that figure had increased to over 30,000 acres, and we were not satisfied with that. Fianna Fáil have been in power only one year and that figure is down again.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): On this Stage I am con-fined to talking about what is in the Bill.  This Bill proposes to extend the power of the Department to increase the issue of land bonds from £60 million to £80 million.  That is a mere bagatelle having regard to the price of land at the present time.  We know from the Minister of State that many of these bonds are already committed.  It is obvious that, even if the full amount of this £20 million were available, it only represents four months' work for the Land Commission at a moderate speed.  I hope the information we got today&mdash;that the intake of land by compulsory acquisition by the Land Commission has fallen from over 30,000 acres when we were in office to 15,000 acres&mdash;will shock the country and the Fianna Fáil backbenches into doing something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £20 million voted in this Bill is an indication that the Land Commission are not going to be allowed to do anything.  This is a tidying up operation <Col N="1767" /> to pay for odds and ends of land on hands at the moment, and nothing more.  It is like something that would be voted to a business to allow it to wind up decently and go out of business. That is what is at stake here and it is right that the country and the small farmers should know it.  This is being done in anticipation of the inter-departmental committee's activities and of the scheme outlined by the Minister for Agriculture when opening this debate.</P>
    <P>We know from him that the legislation will not be introduced until the end of the year.  Those of us who were in power know that, if there is anything of a critical nature in the line of legislation in the Land Commission, it has to go through the Land Commission, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Finance.  It will be at least two years before there is any worth-while protection for our small farmers.  In the meantime we are here after much noise, some of it created by myself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> The main objectives of this Bill are: (1) to substantially increase penalty levels for offences under the parts of the Fisheries Acts which deal specifically with sea-fishing and in particular breaches of the exclusive fishery limits of the State by foreign sea-fishing vessels; and (2) to provide for confiscation of all gear and catch on conviction on indictment; for confiscation, where appropriate, of unlawful gear and catch and lawful gear unlawfully used on summary conviction, and for possible confiscation of the actual vessel in the case of a second indictable offence.</P>
    <P>Consequential amendments have been made in the provisions for trial of a defendant and for detention pending trial or appeal and for release on lodgement of adequate security.</P>
    <P>I have availed of this opportunity of the need for amending legislation to make provision in the Bill for the following: the detention of any suspect fishing vessels in port for up to 48 hours for examination prior to the institution of legal proceedings; the complete separation of the offences of illegal entry and illegal fishing; some textual amendment of section 35 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1962; the extension of my powers to restrict the use of certain types of gear in prescribed areas; the taking of powers to regulate sea-fishing operations in accordance with an International Convention on Conduct of Fishery operations in the North Atlantic which was drawn up in London in 1967, and, finally, for the re-definition of the words &ldquo;fish&rdquo; and &ldquo;net&rdquo; in the Acts.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, that part of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959 (Section 221) which provides for forfeiture of fish and fishing gear in cases of unlawful entry of foreign sea-fishing boats within the exclusive fishery limits was recently declared to be unconstitutional in the High Court.  The basis of this judgment was that forfeiture of fish and fishing gear in such cases constituted a penalty so great that the offence cannot be a minor offence within the meaning assigned under Article 38 of the Constitution. In effect, the severity of the punishment <Col N="1769" /> placed the matter beyond the competence of the District Court. While the judgment applied only to section 221 of the Act, it must be assumed that the courts would take a similar view of any other section of the Act where provision for forfeiture arises.  While notice of appeal has been served by the Attorney General against the High Court ruling, I am advised that no advantage is likely to be gained by pursuing the appeal. Even if the forfeiture provision had remained, however, the penalties were still inadequate in my view bearing in mind the importance of safeguarding fish stocks at present.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of me because of a delay in initiating this Bill. I was well aware of the possibility of our losing the case in the High Court but no responsible Minister would endeavour to remedy possible defects in legislation while an appeal was pending; doing so would obviously prejudice the result of the appeal.  The final ruling of the court was not received by me until March and because of the constitutional and international issues involved great care has had to be taken in drafting the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will agree that although the Bill is short it is nevertheless a complex piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the increase in fine levels for offences committed by foreign fishing boats, which range from £500 on summary conviction on a charge of illegal entry to £10,000 on conviction on indictment on a similar charge to £100,000 on conviction on indictment on a charge of illegal fishing, will, in addition to the various confiscation and forfeiture provisions, provide the necessary deterrent and protection against would-be offenders. These fines and forfeitures are set out in Tables I, II and III to section 2.</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe that in some cases of summary conviction provision has been made for automatic forfeiture as a consequence of conviction of fish unlawfully caught, unlawful gear or lawful gear unlawfully used. The Attorney General considers that such provisions are not in conflict with the High Court ruling because in this <Col N="1770" /> decision the &ldquo;forfeiture&rdquo; provisions of section 221 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959 which contain no distinction whatever on the basis of the lawfulness or otherwise of the catch or gear or the use of the gear, but provide for a simple forfeiture of all catch and gear found on a boat in respect of which a conviction had been obtained, were held to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Fines for some other sea fishery offences which would affect local as well as foreign skippers have also been increased to a more realistic level.</P>
    <P>Preventing crime is better than detecting it.  I have no doubt but that the penalties now proposed together with our improved fishery protection services will convince would-be poachers that illegal fishing in our waters would not be worth while.  Further improvement in our protection services including the acquisition of an additional spotter plane are contemplated with substantial EEC aid towards the cost.  These planes are a great asset in fishery protection in helping to locate intruding vessels and while unable to effect an arrest can lead a protection vessel to the offending vessel. They can help also to provide supplementary evidence in court if this is necessary.  No change in legislation is required to enable sea fishery protection officers on board planes to give evidence in court, but of course they must be in a position to give satisfactory evidence as to the identity and exact location of the offending vessel.</P>
    <P>One secondary but very important provision to which I should like to refer is that providing for detention for up to 48 hours of vessels suspected of having committed an offence.  At present a vessel may not be detained unless charges are being brought against the skipper.  With the larger vessels now in use and the complex conservation regulations such as minimum mesh sizes and maximum bycatches in operation it is virtually im-possible for a sea fisheries protection officer to confirm at sea that an offence has in fact been committed.  The new provision will make enforcement of all sea fishery legislation much easier.</P>
    <P>The other amendments proposed are <Col N="1771" /> mainly designed to remove deficiencies in existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>: We welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister on introducing it, although it is somewhat late. Last week we covered fairly well the background to this legislation.  I should like the Minister to comment on what we consider to be a couple of omissions so far as the Bill is concerned.  He expressed the hope that the EEC will grant-aid the buying of another spotter plane.  I have raised this matter before with the Minister for Defence and I understand that the grant relates only to the actual purchase of a spotter plane or other protection vessel and makes no provision for the maintenance and the running costs of the vessels or for the cost of the provision of the personnel concerned.  I suggest that the Minister has a very strong case in this regard.</P>
      <P>We all agree that the 200-mile limit must be our territorial right and that it must be patrolled by ourselves.  If this situation is accepted by the Community we should be entitled not only to 75 per cent of the purchase price of protection vessels but to a grant in respect of the operation of the vessels, their maintenance and the cost of providing the personnel necessary to man them.</P>
      <P>We are talking in terms of about £30 million but during a period of five years the running costs of the protection vessels would be much in excess of that figure.  I wonder why the Minister did not see fit to introduce a clause, as I understand has been the case in other countries, whereby aerial surveillance can be accepted as evidence in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is the case. However, it is an interesting point and I shall refer to it in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>: In time it will be a point that must be considered seriously.  The point I am making is that if a spotter plane crew can prove by modern methods that a boat was illegally inside the 200-limit, the photographic <Col N="1772" /> and scientific evidence should be accepted in the court as proof of the illegal action.  But there is no reference in the Bill to any provision regarding aerial surveillance.  Perhaps at a later stage of the Bill's progress through the House a section could be added in order to ensure that this very important point is provided for.  We must be realistic about this.  At present we have only two proper fisheries protection vessels, the <i>Emer</i> and the <i>Deirdre</i>.  I know it is our intention to replace our mine sweepers with different types of boats during the next few years.  At the moment we have only four fishery patrol boats.  I understand that as far as the east coast is concerned the equilibrium line is halfway between England and Ireland.  We must realise that those four boats cannot patrol a 200 mile zone.</P>
      <P>We know that the air corps work hand in hand with the Navy and that the one spotter plane we have does about four sorties a week.  If the spotter plane sees any illegal boats it notifies the Naval Service and one of the patrol boats may have to travel 200 miles or 400 miles to get to this illegal boat.  At the moment when an illegal boats sees the spotter plane it moves outside the limit.  The Minister talks about patrolling our 200-mile zone, but the only way this can be done is to have a Bill brought before the House to ensure that the evidence of the people in the spotter plane is accepted and that those who are fishing illegally can be convicted of their crimes.  That is the most important thing as far as the Irish fishermen are concerned.  The Minister speaks about preventing crime but this will only happen if we tighten up our law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he hopes to get money from the EEC.  Perhaps he has knowledge from his trip to Brussels and has brought home a bag of goodies for a change.  I hope he will be able to tell us that at least half of the £30 million has been granted to us as a temporary measure until we have our final fishery agreement, which we all hope we will get.  There is no point in talking about building extra boats, buying an extra plane, bringing more <Col N="1773" /> people into the Naval Service unless we get at least part of this £30 million. I do not see the Minister with his usual smile on his face.  When I do not see the smile the news is not usually good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister spoke about the exclusive fishery limits of the State.  When he says that I take it that he means the 200-mile limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>: What way will the new limit the Minister has introduced off the Clare-Galway coast be classed?  We have two types of limits at the moment. We have the 200-mile zone and this area off the Clare-Galway coast which is reserved exclusively for the Dutch and the Irish, which Deputy Killilea is very interested in.  Does the Minister not intend to call this a different type of zone?  What happens if the French or the Germans have fishing boats illegally in this zone?  I am not a prophet and I am sure the Minister is not one.  We cannot allow the northwestern coast to be closed but we can accept an exclusive fishing zone for Irish fishermen even excluding the Dutch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>: When the new Minister for Fisheries was appointed the country expected a great deal from him.  We will not accept the total banning of this particular zone but we will accept a certain exclusive limit for the Irish or even, as has been done at the moment on a trial basis, for the Dutch and the Irish.  Is it the same fines and convictions if a German boat or a French boat is caught inside the Clare-Galway exclusive limit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk from Brussels about conservation.  It is fair to state that the Irish did not plunder the fish. It was probably the other members of the EEC who did it and we should not suffer for this.  There is a section in the Bill which deals with the definition of the net.  I hope there is some section <Col N="1774" /> in the Bill where the size of the mesh is laid down.  When we talk about conservation we must see that the size of the mesh is large enough to allow a lot of the smaller fish through.</P>
    <P>I would like to welcome this Bill on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  I hope the Minister will deal with the few points I have put to him.  Even though I have not spoken for very long the points I have made are very valid ones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Labour Party welcome this Bill which we feel is overdue.  The scale of penalties is very severe.  We must bear in mind that an extended period of unlawful fishing can be extremely profitable to the owners of the boats who dare to undertake that kind of work.  The forfeiture proposals and the scale of penalties are not excessive.  The Bill has been very carefully drafted.  We feel that the loopholes which were there&mdash;the Irish authorities have suffered embarrassment in their prosecutions to date&mdash;have been carefully and effectively closed.  The closing of these loopholes will give more confidence to the fishery protection staff and will give them extra competence in ensuring the conservation of fish stocks.</P>
      <P>In recent months the Minister has not had an enviable task.  Listening to the BBC television version of the British Minister's return from the negotiations, one can appreciate the horseplay that went on and the extreme difficulty facing our Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently there has been a new climate in relation to our expectations, which were heightened in the latter part of 1976 and in the earlier part of 1977, when there was a great deal of domestic horseplay in party politics about our fishery resources.  We are now at the bargaining table and facing reality.  Certain aspects of that reality are not pleasant.  It is not likely to be too productive in terms of the national interest, but that is the price we have to pay for our greater involvement in the Community.  There is now a more sober approach to this matter and this legislation is a mark of that <Col N="1775" /> sobriety.  I know the Minister will do his utmost to protect our interests.  I do not envy him because he will not get all that his party, the Opposition and the fishermen wish him to get.  People are now approaching this matter more rationally.  I suppose we will see the outcome of this matter during the summer recess and the House will not have an opportunity to discuss the matter until next November.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The only matter that I would question is the current cost of general protection measures on our national budget, leaving aside any subventions that we might get from the Community.  That cost must have increased rapidly in the past 12 months.  It is a cost which the taxpayer should not be unaware of, and one which is likely to increase substantially in future.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by expressing my admiration for the work now being done by the fishery protection staff, both on shore and at sea.  They have had a difficult task because our legislation has been defective.  The massive scale of their operations and the demands made on them have been exceptional.  At the same time our boats and equipment have not been capable of coping with protection work.  However, in recent years our pride and competence have grown.  I am not unduly worried about whether that competence is reflected in a number of prosecutions.  Much of our work is preventive.  If our patrols are effective it is fair to say that we will not have to drag people through the courts for every attempt to commit an offence. I hope that foreign and Irish skippers will not be tempted to breach this legislation. I wish the Minister and his staff well in ensuring its effective implementation as speedily as possible in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Bill is a good one and contradicts the accusations that were made against the Minister both inside and outside the House.  It shows that the Minister is capable of doing his job.  There is no doubt that the Minister has been given the most difficult portfolio of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> Section 5 relates to the restriction of foreign vessels and is a very adequate piece of legislation.  The provision in this section is valid, clear and necessary, and I am glad that so much consideration was given to it.  It is to the credit of the Department that the section is so well worded.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill in regard to detention are very good.  When a boat was arrested by a protection vessel it was brought to port.  Both boats were laid up for anything up to two weeks, not only the one which was detained but also the one which did the detaining. The new Bill allows that protection vessel to go back out to work. This is a very good point in the Bill. It corrects something which was quaint and old.  May be in its time it was a good idea but, as fishing became more intensive, it was a point of law which was used to facilitate others on the high seas who were raping away at their ease.</P>
    <P>The rational conservation provision in the Bill is most necessary not only as regards outer sea fish but also salmon stocks and shellfish stocks.  I hope it will be used when it appears to the public that abuses are being created by people over-fishing shellfish stocks.  I am sure it will be used wisely.</P>
    <P>The aerial survey is a very good idea.  When I was in Iceland I had the privilege of watching an aerial survey being made.  Lines of longitude and latitude were included in the photographs to show the exact location of the fishing boats.  These photographs were used very effectively in courts of law in Iceland.  They use every possible type of legislation to protect their seas.  While the provision in this Bill is not very clear, I am sure the Minister will clarify it when he is replying. I hope the machinery used will include lines of longitude and latitude so that there will be definite and positive evidence in a court of law.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a wonderful effort in Brussels to get the amount of money he received to finance this Bill. He had a tough battle to get the finance to implement it.  It will not cost the nation an enormous amount of money.  The Minister utilised his knowledge <Col N="1777" /> of Europe to get the greatest possible amount of money to service this Bill.  The Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party have endorsed the Bill unanimously.</P>
    <P>I feel so strongly about fishing and conservation that it is only right that as a backbencher I should give my opinion.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: I commend the Minister on introducing the Bill at this stage.  In his statement to the House he might have been a bit more generous to the Opposition, and in particular to Deputy Deasy.  He could have gone so far as to acknowledge that this Bill is a response to the initiative by Deputy Deasy in producing a Private Members' Bill in this area.  I should mention that Deputy Deasy was very anxious to be here to discuss this Bill but, as the House is aware, unfortunately he met with an accident which prevented his attendance to-day.  He asked Deputy White and myself to stand in for him and perhaps our joint efforts may equal what he might have been able to do himself.</P>
      <P>The Bill should be put in perspective and Deputy Deasy's contribution should be acknowledged.  I hope the Minister will do so in his reply.  I accept that there are difficulties in putting together this type of legislation, practical, constitutional and legal difficulties. We have to accept that, over the past 12 months, our seas have been open waters to foreign poachers, in particular Spanish poachers.  The record shows that the number of Spanish boats prosecuted between 1970 and 1977 was at the rate of one a year. Last year this accelerated to an average of one a month, and last month seven Spanish boats were prosecuted for illegal fishing in our waters.  These figures represent the tip of the iceberg only.  These are the boats which were caught.  We can only estimate the huge numbers which were not caught. It is quite clear that this problem had to be tackled firmly and quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On all sides of the House there is common agreement on the need to restrain and restrict the activities of foreign poachers.  The Minister said he was aware of the possibility of losing <Col N="1778" /> the case in the High Court and that no responsible Minister would endeavour to remedy possible defects in legislation while an appeal was pending. For the record it is proper to say that the Minister made a statement last December, long before the appeal was heard, that he intended to circulate a Bill in January.  In the situation which was developing more seriously month by month and week by week, this Bill should have been introduced a long time ago.</P>
    <P>Having said that, we now have the Bill before us and we welcome it.  Last week when we were discussing Deputy Deasy's Bill, we indicated that we would give the Minister every possible co-operation in putting this Bill through the House, having received an undertaking that arrangements would be made to ensure that it would be law before the recess.  To us the most important fact was that for the next six months our seas would not be open again to further and growing incursions by foreign trawlers.  From that point of view the Bill is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Bill is somewhat complex. Having made the point that we not alone wish to have the Bill become law before the recess but have been insisting on this, I must point out that it is a bit dangerous to rush these things through in a matter of hours. Possibly we must accept the dictum that desperate situations require desperate remedies.  For the future I would suggest to the Minister and the Government that a more reasonable time, a matter of weeks, should be given for the proper consideration and teasingout of problems in a Bill so that loop-holes will not be found.  One of the safest ways of doing this is to have a full and proper debate, particularly on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for substantially increased penalties for foreign poaching and illegal entry, and this is as we would wish.  The jurisdiction of the District Court is retained, and one of the fears that has been expressed is that for the sake of convenience the District Court jurisdiction would be over-used and as a result the minimum penalties provided would be all that would be levied against poachers.  I <Col N="1779" /> accept that the Bill provides that District Court jurisdiction is not to be used except on the consent of the defendant, the Attorney General and the District Justice, but there is a possible danger that because of administrative and other problems, and because of the ease of having matters dealt with in the District Court rather than on indictment, this provision could be over-used. I understand and accept that there may be technical breaches which should be dealt with in the District Court, and obviously there must be provision for this.  I would ask the Minister to undertake as far as he can that this provision enabling trial before the District Court will not be used except where breaches are of a technical nature, and that any foreign trawlers which set out to poach in our waters will be hauled up on indictment before the Circuit Court and heavily fined with the consequential effect of forfeiture.  This has caused some concern among the fishing fraternity, and I should like the Minister to put minds at ease on this point.</P>
    <P>I referred to the question of confiscation or forfeiture.  I accept that there are some minor possibilities of confiscation in the District Court and I appreciate the constitutional difficulty here.  We have got over this by ensuring that a defendant against whom it is hoped to levy such a penalty will be brought before the Circuit Court on indictment.  On this point there is one difference between the Minister's Bill and ours.  Deputy Deasy had proposed that there would be confiscation of the boat: the Minister provides for second conviction and referred in his speech to the possible confiscation of the vessel.  I believe that there may be difficulties in enforcing such a forfeiture. In the case of a second conviction this matter is discretionary.</P>
    <P>A second point relates to difficulties that may arise in the case of large companies who have a number of boats and a lot of skippers.  In the case of a Spanish company with a lot of boats which engage in illegal fishing, there could be a situation in which a boat which had a previous conviction would be excluded from a particular operation <Col N="1780" /> but none of the other boats belonging to the company would be so restricted.  In such a situation the deterrent would not be effective.  In so far as we want to have possible forfeiture of a boat as a deterrent, the Bill as it is framed is not really a deterrent. Section 4 provides for discretionary forfeiture in certain circumstances which could be evaded by some of these large-scale companies from abroad.</P>
    <P>Another major point is the matter of aerial evidence.  At the moment there is no difficulty about producing aerial evidence in court; the difficulty relates to how effective this would be.  The other problem is the lack of equipment. I understand that the Minister intends when purchasing a new plane to ensure that it has the necessary equipment to pinpoint and photograph invading trawlers.  I am very much in favour of this.  Whether with this equipment and producing this evidence in court we will find a more effective prosecution case is something we may have to discuss again in the future.  It is a step forward to have the equipment and produce evidence in court.</P>
    <P>I can see difficulties with regard to identification.  As I understand it, the requirement for fishing vessels is to have the name and number on the side.  If there is to be a growing use of aerial evidence, there should be some requirement making the name and number visible from the air, possibly painted on the top of the wheelhouse as well as on the side.  The Minister might bear this in mind, not solely in connection with this Bill but in international discussions on the enforcement of fishery laws.  I am aware that in a recent case in England evidence from an RAF Nimrod was accepted and a Spanish vessel was convicted as a result of the evidence given.  Let us provide ourselves with the necessary equipment and begin to use this type of evidence.  If difficulties arise in the future the Minister may be assured of the co-operation of this side of the House in bringing in amending legislation.</P>
    <P>A further point in this regard should be mentioned.  I can anticipate in the giving of such evidence in a <Col N="1781" /> criminal trial that officers of the air corps would be, as it were, tied up in court.  To my own knowledge in the past officers in the Naval Service have found it necessary to be in court for a considerable time.  Not alone that, but the difficulty which arose was that the naval vessels themselves were tied-up in port while these cases were proceeding. We must ensure from the point of view of the law of evidence that this is not essential, and from the practical point of view that our naval vessels and in the future any air corps planes involved in fishery protection are not grounded or, so to speak, ported for any unnecessary time.  This is very important. Our resources are limited and we must ensure that be it a naval vessel or a spotter plane they are grounded or tied up in port for only the absolute minimum of time.  We must ensure that there is no requirement that the captain of a vessel or the pilot of a plane should be the only person compelled to give evidence.  Any officer should be sufficient in those circumstances, and we should ensure that our officer corps in both the naval service and the air corps is sufficiently expanded so that any of those officers who are engaged in giving evidence on a prosecution can be replaced.  Basically, let us ensure that our limited resources by way of naval vessels and planes are used to the maximum extent, while at the same time having the evidence available in court from the officers involved in the capture or the spotting of the illegal fishing concerned.</P>
    <P>One other aspect should be referred to at this stage in the context of recent events.  This Bill provides for fisheries offences which would affect local as well as foreign skippers.  The fines in this respect have been increased.  I am not and never will be one to suggest to anyone that he or she should be in breach of the law.  I am a believer in the rule of law, but one has to accept the viewpoint of people who have the impression that there has been, particularly in the recent past, more concentration on surveying the activities of local fishermen than those of foreign poachers.  If this is true&mdash;and it has been suggested to me very strongly by people around the coast in <Col N="1782" /> my constituency&mdash;I would be very concerned about it.  We do not stand in this House or elsewhere suggesting that the law should be broken; at the same time I ask that the matter be put into perspective and that the Minister will accept and realise that the depletion of our fishery stocks is due mainly to the ravaging of our seas by foreign trawlers, and that in this context the effect of any slight straying over legal limits by our native fishermen is having only a minor effect.  In these circumstances therefore the concentration on protection&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Bill does not relate to salmon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: I appreciate that, but the protection resources of the State may be used for one reason or another, and it is in this context I raise the matter.  The Minister should ensure as far as possible that our resources by way of naval vessels, fishery protection and so on, should be directed, particularly after this Bill is passed, at full blast against foreign poachers and the concentration, which has been somewhat apparent in recent times, against some of our native fishermen should be put in that perspective.  First of all let us ensure that these foreign raiders are removed from our waters.  One of the greatest grievances of our local fishermen has been that so many foreign vessels have been coming into our waters.  They know for themselves because they see them and in that context they feel it is unfair and unjust that such a concentration should be made against them while the others are escaping.  I appreciate that this Bill is going to be one further weapon in the Minister's armoury.  The difficulty in the past was that even on catching these vessels the fine of £100 was derisory and it was worth their while to do this illegal fishing openly.  From that point of view we are anxious to ensure the passage of this Bill speedily so that it will be effective within a week or ten days.  On that basis I make the point.  Let us ensure that the Bill is put into effect straight away so that these foreign poachers may be cleared from our shores once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to the points already made, <Col N="1783" /> we are very much in agreement with this Bill and we have a considerable welcome for it.  We are anxious to get it into law straight away and even more anxious to see it enforced straight away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am very glad of the welcome that this House has given to this measure, which everybody in the House and people who are interested in the fishing industry outside the House agree is essential in view of the rather ludicrous situation in which we find ourselves because of the High Court decision in regard to sea fishery offences which limited the penalties in this very important area to fines of £100, which have been described rightly by Deputy O'Keeffe as derisory. This Bill and its passage into law quickly will ensure a very dramatic redress of this situation, as one can see by perusal of the penalties set out in tables 1, 2 and 3 of section 2 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to acknowledge the help that has been given in the introduction of this Bill by Deputy Deasy and the spokesmen of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party.  I wish Deputy Deasy well and I want to pay him a tribute in this respect.</P>
      <P>As regards the debate itself, on Second Stage certain points were raised.  Deputy White inquired about the grant-in-aid from the European Economic Community of £30 million which has been agreed by the Commission and by eight or nine member states.  That is the precise position now.  That block grant is available to us on a fixed sum basis for the utilisation by the Irish Government of that money for the purchase of planes and the construction of boats to deal with protection matters up to 200 miles from our shore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not cover operating costs. We are pressing the Community in that respect, but our main endeavour is to get £30 millions.  At the meeting of the Council of Ministers yesterday I made it quite clear that unless there was agreement on this matter by the next meeting in four weeks' time we would <Col N="1784" /> not agree to any third country arrangements being proposed by the Council with non EEC countries and that we wanted agreement so that money will be available.  On the basis that we are now guarding a 200-mile zone off our coasts since 1 January 1977 in the fishing interests of the whole Community, we have a strong case.  At the moment I am seeking to get an instalment of that £30 million, in respect of expenditure for last year and this year. I am hopeful that in four weeks' time I will secure an instalment of about £8 million from the EEC.</P>
    <P>The question of aerial surveillance was raised by a number of Deputies. There is no question that in practical terms aerial surveillance is of enormous help in protection work generally. Linked up with a boat in the sea aerial surveillance can cut a lot of waste time and energy that otherwise would have to be used.  That has been the experience in relation to the single spotter plane we have, and that is why another spotter plane is practically ready for delivery to the Air Corps. This plane will have further electronic equipment installed which will be of help in relation to photographing the location of a boat and so on.  This will provide the proper evidence backup required in Court today from the fishery officer from the Naval Service who boards the boat.  In case there is any misunderstanding, this is really a matter of evidence, a matter of practicality rather than law.  There is no need to have that incorporated in the Bill as long as the practical aids are there which are accepted by the Court as supplementary evidence to the evidence of the people making the arrest.  We are really talking about practical matters of evidence relating to the law of evidence rather than a matter that needs to be incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>To facilitate the gathering of evidence Deputy O'Keeffe suggested that the registration of the boat should be displayed on top of the wheel house rather than on the side of the boat so that it could be photographed and made available from the point of view of aerial evidence.  I understand that that method has been adopted in Canada in relation to this type of evidence, but it is not <Col N="1785" /> necessary to incorporate this in the Bill.  It is a practical matter of the protection service adopting such suggestions so as to provide the back up evidence for the boarding party of the Naval Service or the Fishery Protection Service.</P>
    <P>Deputy White referred to the fines in the area west of Ireland where we and the Dutch will be operating a fishing plan from 1 July onwards.  We propose to have the penalties that are set out here operable against any offenders in that area.  It will be a Commission Regulation, and when it is adopted I will make a regulation under this Bill which will bring breaches of that Commission regulation within the scope of this Bill.  Any further Commission fishing plans implemented around our coasts can be brought within the scope of this Bill in respect of offences.</P>
    <P>The question of a ban in the north west was raised, and that is still a matter for speculation.  The north west part of Donegal is part of the general west of Scotland fishing area, and there is some indication that the British Government may introduce a herring ban in that area which would have to be non-discriminatory.  We are preparing the various options we will adopt in the event of the British taking such a national conservation measure.  That is a matter entirely for the British at present.  As far as we are concerned we will prepare our options in the event of the British doing so. There is no question of the Community initiating any such closure. That decision was reached at the meeting in Luxembourg yesterday.  The Commission and the Council of Ministers all agreed that such a closure was not practicable and required further scientific investigation before being considered.  The British Government made their position clear at the end of the discussion.  They felt themselves free, if they decided, to bring in such a closure.</P>

      <P>: At the moment we are discussing this matter with the Irish Fishermen's Organisation.  We have already had discussions on this aspect, but it does not serve any purpose at this stage to speculate.  We must see exactly what the British will do, if anything.</P>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;net&rdquo; was raised by Deputy White.  That is contained in section 226 of the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond made a general speech welcoming the Bill, as did Deputy Killilea, who raised a point I have dealt with already concerning the aerial survey aspect.  Deputy Killilea raised also what I regard as a very important feature of the Bill, that is the detention provision in respect of the boat for 48 hours in the port so that full examination can take place and evidence be gathered to mount an effective prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe, naturally as a representative of West Cork, raised the question of the illegal fishing of Spanish boats.  Undoubtedly that is a particular feature of the whole area of the southern coast.  At present we are having very detailed bilateral discussions with the Spanish Government. The Spanish Government are also having discussions with the Commission with a view to preparing Spain's position for entry to the EEC.  I can assure Deputy O'Keeffe and the House <Col N="1787" /> that we will be very concerned to ensure that the whole question of Spanish fishing in the 200-mile zone off our coasts&mdash;particularly off the south and south-west coasts&mdash;will be regularised.  At present it is not fully regularised.  It is a question merely of putting it into some sort of regular shape.  Indeed the Spanish Government are equally anxious to ensure that some order is brought into the whole situation of Spanish fishing within our waters and those of other Members of the Community.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe raised a point about recent activities in regard to Irish fishermen around the coast. These activities do not come within the scope of this Bill.  They relate to salmon fishing which is outside its scope.  Any such moves taken by the Naval Service were designed to ensure protection and conservation of the salmon species.  Indeed I might say, in a tribute to Deputy Deasy, that these were measures advocated strongly by him here on numerous occasions over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>That, generally, was the tenor of the debate.  I think I have covered most of the points raised.  However I should like to make a few general points before concluding.  This is a very important Bill and will, I think, suffice for some considerable time as the framework within which we can proceed against all forms of illegal fishing that do damage to our fishing stocks at sea. I would hope that the deterrent aspect of this Bill will prove fruitful, that its seriousness in regard to the very substantial penalties involved will show, primarily foreign fishermen, and in regard to some aspects of it our own fishermen, that we are serious about fisheries protection.</P>
    <P>I am a great believer in legislation being a deterrent before the event rather than having to impose penalties ordered after the event.  That is the great importance of this Bill.  It introduces a dramatically new situation in which, if its provisions are enforced, certainly it will not pay anybody, to put it mildly, to break the law, there being substantial penalties ranging up to £100,000, to forfeiture of gear, <Col N="1788" /> equipment, nets, to forfeiture of fish. It is a situation in which there is a wide range of flexible charges open to the State, depending on the particular case, to proceed in the District Court, to proceed at one level in the Circuit Court or at a higher level in the Circuit Court backed up by the confiscation of the boat itself on the second offence, and by the other procedures such as detention of the boat for 48 hours after apprehension.  This Bill introduces a new dimension to fisheries protection.  It will provide the necessary statutory back-up to the excellent work&mdash;and I want to pay tribute to them&mdash;being done by the protection service, by the Navy and the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that a Community fisheries policy will be evolved over the next 12 months.  Candidly, I am not hopeful before the British general election.  I am on record as having said that and events in the past two days have shown that I was right, that there is no possibility of any movement towards settlement while the British are looking at their home electoral scene rather than at the evolution and conclusion of a common fisheries policy.  But hopefully, if within the 12 months it reaches fulfilment, I would emphasise that only then can we properly plan the future development of the sea fisheries industry, and we can do so provided only that the very complex plans and regulations that will have to be introduced to, above all else, maintain conservation of the species and their management, are backed-up by the necessary statutory measures.  This Bill will serve as that statutory instrument to show that we are in earnest about enforcing our plans and regulations, that as far as our Government are concerned we can ensure that whatever plans on fishery developments are agreed between ourselves and our other Community partners can be implemented effectively.  There is not much point in having plans and a policy agreed on a Community basis unless we as a nation have the necessary law and capacity to implement them to their fullest extent.  In that way we as a nation can derive the benefit we <Col N="1789" /> sought from whatever negotiations are concluded, by having laws available to us and having them fully and effectively enforced.  That is the real background to whatever agreement is arrived at ultimately between ourselves and our Community partners.</P>

      <P>: There are just a few points I would like to raise.  My purpose in raising them is not to be obstructive but rather to ensure that we have a good Bill.  I am concerned that what is a rather complex measure <Col N="1791" /> should not go through without being carefully scrutinised.  Section 2 contains not alone five subsections but also three Tables.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister tell the House on what grounds the Attorney General might be expected to consent to summary jurisdiction?  Would it be a case of the Naval Service or the police submitting a file.  On what general grounds would he be expected to issue a consent to summary jurisdiction under subsection (2)?</P>
      <P>In subsection (3) the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; is used.  I am anxious to clarify who this person is.  From my reading of the Principal Act I take it to be the master.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: This is of some relevance in regard to the forfeiture of the boat under section 4 but I would have hoped, if we had the time, for consideration to be given to a simple prosecution against the owner of the vessel.  I appreciate that this could cause technical difficulties because the owner might be outside the jurisdiction. Under the provisions of the Bill the owner is not really involved.  It is the skipper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The skipper or master.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the short time available we cannot really give consideration to extending the prosecution to the owner, but that is something which should be considered for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the question of these very heavy fines.  Is the Minister satisfied as to the enforcement procedure for the collection of these fines?  In the past the fine was £100 with forfeiture of the gear.  We now have fines up to £200,000 against the master.  He may not be worth tuppence, and I am wondering whether we have ensured that the fine against the master is actually recoverable by holding on to the vessel?  This goes back to the original point that the person prosecuted is the skipper or master and not the owner.  In normal circumstances the skipper would not have any equity in the vessel and the <Col N="1792" /> vessel could not be seized.  This may or may not be so, but I am very concerned that because of the very high level of fines we should have a proper enforcement procedure.  Fines of this nature will be of no use unless we can collect them, and the only way to collect them is by ensuring that the vessel is not allowed to leave until the fine is paid or a bond provided in a sum greater than the £100,000, plus the value of the fish and gear which could be used to collect the fine.  The same would apply in relation to the lesser fines of £10,000 and so on.</P>
    <P>No matter what the level, once we are running into any substantial sum I want to be assured that it can be collected.  In the past, the penalty in the District Court was a small fine plus forfeiture of fishing gear.  There was no problem.  The fishing gear was there and we took it.  There are similar provisions now.  The fine will be of substance, but can we collect it?  Is the Minister happy that this provision can be enforced in view of the fact that it is the master who is prosecuted?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Deputy O'Keeffe raised a number of interesting points. The first relates to the consent of the Attorney General in regard to a case coming within the jurisdiction of a district justice.  The purpose of bringing in the Attorney General is germane to the whole question of the international and diplomatic complications that can arise in cases of this kind.  It is important that the Attorney General should be in on the actual prosecution because he sits with the Government and is aware of the current situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> countries illegally fishing in our waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An enormous variety of offences arise under the umbrella of offences set out in section 2.  For instance, there could be a country involved with whom we had very good relations and through a technicality they may have breached one of the offences mentioned here.  Obviously, although we would have grounds for an indictment, if it was a technical offence and we were satisfied there was no serious intent, no Irish Government <Col N="1793" /> would wish to offend the country with whom we had strong relations.  In that case we would proceed by way of summary procedure.</P>
    <P>Another view would be taken if the Government knew that the ship of an habitual offending country was involved. A much stronger view would be taken in that case and the full weight of the indictment procedure would proceed against that country. The Attorney General is included in this Bill to give weight to the diplomatic and international importance which attaches to fishery offences. These offences are not like ordinary offences in our jurisdiction; they involve our relations with other countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe's second point referred to the master&mdash;section 232 of the Fisheries Consolidation Act, 1959. The master is prosecuted and liable under the governing section to which section 2 relates.  He raised the point about the firm or owner not being prosecuted.  There are practicalities against prosecuting a firm or owner having regard to the nature of international law, different jurisdictions and so on.  The only practical way to nail a prosecution down is to proceed against the master.  The master and the firm can settle their business later.  We do not have to spend months and years pursuing a firm or an owner in a foreign country.  We have the master and his boat and we proceed against him.  This is the only way to do it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe asked about collecting the fine of £100,000.  That is also related to the points I have already made.  The only person from whom we can get the money is the master.  We have the master, the boat, the equipment and the fish in our jurisdiction.  Under section 12 of this Bill the boat can be detained for 48 hours, under section 13 the boat and persons charged can be detained pending prosecution, and under section 14 they can be detained pending the determination of an appeal, and there are also provisions by way of bond which may be imposed under those sections as security.  Under sections 12, 13 and 14 we have a full procedure which enables detention of the defendant <Col N="1794" /> and whatever security is required to be discharged by him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: In regard to the question of the summary trials, I am a little concerned about the Minister's response.  The question about diplomatic, international and political considerations is one that worries me and I think it will worry the Irish fishing organisations.  What they are really concerned about is that the summary trial will be over-used and that these fines in the District Court which are so low may be the fines which may be imposed and they may not have the deterrent effect we want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

The Minister indicated that the type of factors which would affect the Attorney General were of an international, diplomatic and political nature.  This is what concerns me.</P>

    <P>The various options for dealing with unemployment have been outlined in the Green Paper,<i>Development for Full Employment</i>, published last week and, as the Deputy is aware, the Government <Col N="1796" /> invite comments from interested parties on these options.</P>
    <P>Of special relevance to the greater Cork area is the target of 3,900 new grant-aided manufacturing jobs for that area contained in the recent IDA industrial plan for 1977-1980.  Finally I should mention also the Government's commitment to the Cork Harbour Development Plan and the Cork Regional Water Supply Scheme which are important elements in enhancing the attractiveness of the area for further investment and job creation.  This is evidenced from the financial provision the Government have made for these projects in 1978 of £3.65 million and £4.75 million respectively compared with expenditure in 1977 of £1.12 million and £4.11 million respectively.</P>

      <P>: The two principal special youth employment projects which were announced in the budget were a work experience programme and an environmental improvement schemes programme.  Due to administrative difficulties the start of the work experience programme has been delayed but a pilot scheme will be launched in July and the scheme will come into full operation after the summer holiday break.  It is expected to provide 1,500 jobs this year.  The environmental programme is already under way and a total of approximately 280 jobs had been provided at the beginning of this month.  The target for 1978 as a whole is 1,000 jobs.  The total number of jobs provided under other schemes by early June was approximately 170.  It should be borne in mind, of course, that young people are filling a substantial proportion of the new jobs which are being provided in the public sector and in building and construction as part of the special job-creation programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: Even on the basis of inaccurate data regarding net passenger movements, but having regard to the fact that a figure of 1,400 has been asserted authoritatively now, would the Minister agree that an element of the decrease in the number on the live register could be attributed to those who emigrated rather than remaining at home on the dole?</P>

      <P>: In view of the fact that this debate is a kind of a re-run of similar questions in February and in view of the fact that a number of local authorities express concern at the apparent intention expressed in the White Paper did his Department, in drafting the Green Paper, see fit to re-contact the Department of the Environment?  If they did, is the <Col N="1803" /> information contained in the Green Paper the most up-to-date information received regarding housing costs from that Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes it is, because at the time of the White Paper the average cost for local authority houses was given to us as £11,000.  That was on the basis of 1977 information.  For the Green Paper we were given an average cost of £12,500 for 1978 and for the maximum all-in cost, the one that was quoted as an illustration of what some houses could cost, it was £26,000 at the time of the White Paper and it is now £26,500.</P>

The references to the action being taken to combat fraud in relation to certain social welfare services arise in the context of the general need to stringently control the costs of public services.  The Green Paper does not purport to be exhaustive in detailing the actions taken or intensified to control the costs of public services and their financing. Estimates of the savings to the Exchequer from the operation of such measures or of the extent to which the Exchequer is said to be defrauded under the social welfare code are not readily available.</P>

Measures for dealing with tax evasion of the kind to which the Deputy refers are the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners, who function independently.

      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development if, with reference to the recent Government Green Paper, paragraph 5.16, he will clarify what is meant by &ldquo;an adequate supply of houses&rdquo;&ldquo;acceptable prices&rdquo;, and &ldquo;an appropriate form&rdquo; of mortgage finance.</P>

      <P>: The Green Paper indicated that it is the Government's <Col N="1812" /> policy to ensure that as many people as possible are able to purchase their own houses rather than have to rely on rented accommodation.  It is difficult to quantify what prospective purchasers will need in this regard since this is related to a number of factors including the future rate of household formation, the size of families and the needs arising from future obsolescence, which cannot be determined accurately.  Needs will be kept under review to ensure that there will be enough small to medium-size houses available to those who require them at prices which the majority of such persons can afford.  Mortgage finance should be available from the main lending agencies to enable persons wishing to buy houses to obtain the necessary loans without unwarranted delays or unduly onerous conditions.</P>

      <P>: Would the Minister accept that, with the failure of successive Governments to control in some way the price of building land, more particularly in areas such as his own constituency, it is now quite impossible for any lower middle income family or any middle income family to buy a house at what the Minister terms in his Green Paper as an acceptable price and with an appropriate form of mortgage?  In fact, the proposition in the Green Paper is becoming increasingly illusory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: With reference to the honourable commitment of the Government to try to provide houses for as many people as possible, nevertheless the kind of language used in the question and in the Green Paper, such as &ldquo;an adequate supply of houses&rdquo;, &ldquo;acceptable prices&rdquo; and &ldquo;an appropriate form&rdquo; of mortgage finance, is so nebulous as to render the whole point of the paper and this paragraph meaningless.  What does the Minister <Col N="1813" /> mean by &ldquo;an adequate supply of houses&rdquo; and &ldquo;acceptable prices&rdquo; and will he say acceptable to whom? Would he agree that a price which would be acceptable to a builder would be very far from being acceptable to a would-be purchaser?  What does he mean by &ldquo;an appropriate form&rdquo; of mortgage finance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: It does not mean some sort of statistical quantification which I thought was under-lying some of the Deputy's desire for questions of this nature.  If the Deputy deplores the sort of language used here, I can only point out that it would become impossible to draft any document, or make any statement on anything, if you were not allowed to use language in the normal everyday sense of the term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: As the Minister knows, in many cases half the income, and in some cases in excess of half the income of the average family, is being paid to service loans for private houses.  How does he propose to reduce that to an acceptable level, acceptable to the purchaser, the loan <Col N="1814" /> payer, to, say, 30 per cent of his gross income?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: There are two points there.  First, I would have thought that in the majority or generality of cases the Deputy wants to ensure that the costs of acquiring housing accommodation do not represent an excessive burden on the household concerned.  Secondly, I would not like to imply that we have moved towards a situation where somebody would be prevented from spending on housing whatever proportion of his household income he feels is appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister accept that all the reviews and the deep scrutiny going on are forcing people into houses they cannot afford, instead of the Minister's Government providing housing for them through the local authorities?  There is to be a cut-back in local authority housing which will force people into purchasing houses which they cannot afford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development the number of miles of major roads or motorways which the increased allocation of &ldquo;up to twice the 1978 provision of £23 million for <Col N="1815" /> road improvement&rdquo; will build; and the basis on which priority is to be given to requests for such finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is not possible to give any indication of the mileages of roadway that would be built as a result of the increased investment mentioned in the Green Paper.  Improvement grants are allocated not only to build new roads but also to improve existing roads. Costs of building roads vary enormously between rural and urban areas.  As stated in Paragraph 5.10 of the Green Paper, if the additional funds are made available, the works undertaken will be chosen from those to be programmed in the road development plan promised in the Government's pre-election manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister agree that the implication of the paragraph in the Green Paper headed &ldquo;Internal Transport&rdquo; is that CIE's plans for a rapid rail system will take a lower order of priority than motorways or major road proposals?  Is that a fair inference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: No.  The references in the Green Paper are to point out the need for an adequate transport system.  Surely that has an important role to play in developing the economy.  The point is made that, on the one hand, there are quite expensive proposals for modernisation and improvement of the rail system and on the other hand quite extensive proposals for improving the roads system.  In deciding the relative allocations between the two, one has to take into account the contribution each can make to improving the effectiveness of the transport system as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware that with regard to the whole infrastructural planning of these areas for the future, the Dublin transportation study, the McKinsey Report, and public statements of local authority planners in this area, clearly show that each of the three component parts is an essential feature of the plan? Those three parts are the rapid rail, <Col N="1816" /> the motorway and certain controls on car parking.  It is not a choice of one or the other.  The three complement each other and they are an essential feature of the total plan.  Therefore, it is somewhat invidious to pick one as opposed to the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister not agree that the whole emphasis of the section in the Green Paper relating to prospective motorway construction is quite decisively to down-grade CIE's proposition for a rapid rail Dublin suburban system?  It is rather dismissive of it, largely on the grounds of job creation.  Therefore, the prospects for CIE must be very chilling in terms of their future Dublin electrification programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: In relation to the possible doubling of the allocation &ldquo;up to twice the 1978 provision of £23 million&rdquo; for roads and motorways by 1980, is the Minister aware that the cost of the projected motorway and road schemes is of the order of perhaps £500 million to £600 million at current prices and would therefore make the figure of £23 million, although commendable in itself, somewhat derisory? There is a risk that the whole transport system could become more chaotic <Col N="1817" /> than it is unless much more funds are made available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am indeed. The cost of the last section of the construction of the Bray road between Donnybrook and Booterstown Avenue works out at the equivalent of £1.6 million per mile and it is estimated that the cost of embarking on the scheme this year would be in the region of £2 million per mile.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are both familiar with that.  I am a member of Dublin County Council.  The average cost projected to build one mile of surburban motorway in 1979 is some £2 million.  Would not the Minister agree that giving £2 million to CIE for the carrying of passengers in the greater Dublin area would, on a cost benefit analysis basis, be far more productive and viable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development the form which the review of &ldquo;the pattern&rdquo; of post-primary participation, as outlined in the Green Paper, paragraph 7.32 is to take; the interests which will be consulted; and when the review will be completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Despite the fact that it is to be dealt with in greater detail in the future, I would ask the Minister for a justification of the express need for the review of the pattern of post-primary <Col N="1818" /> participation and precisely what that means.  This is the type of language that politicians and other interested people find difficult enough to understand and which I am sure the public would find impossible to understand. What is the pattern involved and why does it need to be reviewed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: Because if the economy is changing very rapidly and there are growing needs for certain types of skill, some being traditional and others new forms of skill, it is clearly desirable that the educational system and allied training systems should be capable of producing the numbers of skilled and qualified personnel required.  Therefore it is valid to review from time to time the relative emphasis on different forms of educational course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Stressing that I have been pressing the Minister for Education to review the curriculum, is the Minister now suggesting that the curriculum in schools is about to be reviewed in line with the review of the pattern of post-primary participation?

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: Despite the fact that the Deputy's question does not specifically refer to the Green Paper <i>Development for Full Employment</i>, I assume that it is being asked in this context, since the question was <Col N="1819" /> addressed to me and since the subject matter of the question is discussed in paragraph 7.33 of the Green Paper.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper stresses that the high level of benefits in this area, while paid for by all taxpayers, accrue in large part to a small and relatively privileged section of the community who also enjoy the prospect, as future graduates, of relatively high earnings. It states that it would therefore seem equitable to increase the fees charged, and points out that even a doubling of fees would still leave the Exchequer financing about two-thirds of higher education expenditure.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper makes it quite clear that the measures involving public expenditure and resources put forward in the Paper are not Government decisions but options which suggest themselves for consideration and that they will be the subject of discussion.</P>
      <P>It is not possible, therefore, to say at this stage whether or not this particular option will be adopted, or, if it is adopted, when and by how much the fees will be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Does the Minister accept that in the Green Paper in paragraph 7.33 the phrase used is that it would be equitable to increase the fees charged?  Am I to interpret from his answer that he would continue to oversee a situation where something which was inequitable would remain?  Would it not be logical if he considers the present situation inequitable to set about remedying that situation by increasing the fees?  If so, when and by how much?</P>

Have his Department explored the possibility of getting from the banks or from some bank a more adventurous system of support for third level education, whereby the burden of the State would be effectively transferred, but over a very long period, to the person who is the principal recipient of the benefit, who, as the Minister rightly says, usually comes from a section of society which is already privileged?</P>

It would appear that the reply to this question was drafted in the Department of the Environment and that this particular section of the Green Paper has already been deleted and excised.  The reply is a complete climb down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: As stated in the Green Paper, the Government's overriding objective in the social area is the ending of unemployment.  Eliminating unemployment will require that an increasing proportion of resources be devoted to employment creation and, given the limitation on resources imposed by the taxation and borrowing constraints, this implies a policy of restraint in non-job-creating areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1825" /> However, I want to stress that this does not preclude improving standards in certain areas.  The broad guidelines for restraint are set out in paragraph 2.12 as a slower growth of public expenditure than in the past on the services in question, the maintenance at least of the 1978 level of services for those who genuinely need them and income maintenance payments increasing in line with the cost of living.  Table 7.2 of the Green Paper sets out a profile of future public expenditure which the Government feel is consistent with the resources likely to be available and with giving priority in spending to action which will increase employment.</P>

      <P>: Following the decision of New Jersey Zinc Company not to commit itself to the construction of a smelter here at the present time, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy requested the IDA to review the situation. He discussed with the IDA the possible course of action and the significant issues which should be covered in the review and it was decided that the IDA should also apply for planning permission and proceed with land acquisition at the Ballylongford, County Kerry site.  The IDA are currently taking steps to submit an application for planning permission and to acquire the necessary land.</P>
      <P>Among the major aspects to be defined and considered in the IDA review are the participants in the project including the extent of State involvement, the financing arrangements, certain technical aspects, particularly the smelting process and, of course, the crucial issue of the supply, demand and price outlook for zinc metal and zinc products.  It is difficult to put a precise time scale on the review by the IDA as, due to the unsettled condition of the zinc market, it may be some time before it will be possible to make assumptions with a reasonable degree of confidence on the future outlook for zinc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development if, with reference to paragraph 4.29 of the recent Government Green Paper regarding the alleged scope for educational institutions to utilise their resources more intensively, he will indicate the evidence on which this implicit under-utilisation is based.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: Some Irish educational institutions are already providing special courses for overseas students.  This activity, which has been mainly focused on the oil-producer countries, is very welcome in that it can provide additional revenue for the institutions concerned, thus enabling them to improve the services they provide for Irish students.  When carried out on a sufficiently large scale this activity would also generate additional employment opportunities as extra staff would have to be recruited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date the degree of involvement of Irish educational organisations in this type of activity has been modest.  However, the great demand on the part of oil-producer countries for educational services suggests that this is an area of activity to which Irish educational institutions could pay more attention. For example, it might be possible to organise special courses for overseas students during the holiday periods, thus making more efficent use of existing resources, such as lecture theatres and teaching laboratories.  Again, for example, it might be possible to restructure the whole sequence of lecture terms in universities.  At present, the three terms of an academic year span about 24 or 25 weeks in most cases. It might be possible to have as many as six teaching terms per calendar year by appropriate changes in organisational arrangements.  It is for this reason that the Government indicated in the Green Paper at paragraph 4.14 that it was intended to carry out an assessment of the foreign earnings and <Col N="1828" /> employment creation potential result-ing from the export of services, including educational services.  It is hoped that the results of this study will show up more clearly the scope for additional activity of this type.</P>

What is the feeling that comes through the paper?  On what is it based?

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

In answer to the first question, I am not sure what the Deputy means by a scientific study, but some preliminary work in assessment has been carried out to establish the feasibility of these sort of proposals.  As I indicated in my reply, the intention is not to put forward any dogmatic conclusions at this point but to try to give an example of fresh thinking and our willingness to explore new opportunities and possibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development the basis of the calculation in the Government's Green Paper, page 66, <i>Development for Full Employment</i>, that, in combination, the various work-sharing possibilities could produce the required total of 65,000 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Green Paper puts forward two options for attaining full employment&mdash;worksharing and a residual job creation pro-gramme. It is recognised that in practice a combination of these options might be the most appropriate solution.</P>
      <P>The statement referred to by the Deputy is based on the calculation that 65,000 jobs could possibly be created if approximately 8 per cent of time worked this year in the non-agricultural sector were to be allocated effectively to persons who are unemployed. The paper indicates a number of ways through which this allocation might be achieved.  The precise mixture of measures which can be introduced and the extent to which each of these can be applied will depend on detailed examination and on discussion between the Government and the social partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: As I said in my reply it is recognised that in practice a combination of these options might be the most appropriate solution, but dealing specifically with the work-sharing aspect, the Green Paper points out that the reduction of one hour in the standard working week is the equivalent of about 20,000 jobs and one week's holidays is the equivalent of 16,000 jobs.  In the building and construction industry and manufacturing industries alone the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in a report on youth employment indicated that overtime working amounts to the equivalent of another 20,000 jobs approximately.  If even a proportion of that overtime could be phased out over a period that should make a significant contribution.  In addition there might be scope for a reduction in overtime working in the public sector.  Their reference to earlier retirement says that the total number of people in the 60 plus age group at present working in industry and services is of the order of 35,000.  Clearly between those three categories alone, there is more than adequate scope for achieving the whole of the 65,000 target if necessary.  Therefore, I cannot accept the tenor of the Deputy's remarks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am happy with the Minister's reply in relation to the detention of a vessel, in that the Bill covers the detention for 48 hours when certain offences are suspected and also when a person is charged and up to the time of appeal.  I was concerned that in the really important time, which is after the imposition of the penalty, there is adequate provision for the detention of the vessel in all circumstances so as to ensure that the fine will be paid.  Is the Minister satisfied that there is a provision in the Principal Act to cover this?  There is no point in imposing a fine of £100,000 unless we can collect it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: There is one other small aspect that concerns me somewhat about this section.  We would have a provision whereby a master of a vessel, who would not be an owner, would be the person who would be charged.  He would be the person who would be convicted and fined possibly up to £100,000.  He would not be the owner of the vessel and probably would not have the funds available to pay the fine.  Is the Minister satisfied as to the constitutionality of seizing and selling a vessel owned by another party to pay a fine imposed on a fishing skipper?  I am somewhat concerned that this point would be raised subsequently in legal proceedings.  We have the position that it is the master of the vessel and not the owner who will be prosecuted.</P>

While I appreciate the Deputy's point, the practicalities of the situation outweigh any constitutional or academic point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: If I recollect correctly by reference to a very rough draft.  Greater attention may have been paid to the Minister's comment last week than he realises, to the fact that he said it would not apply to Irish vessels.  I am somewhat concerned that Irish fishing boats could be seized.  I suppose if one looks at it there is far more possibility of Irish boats feeling <Col N="1845" /> the brunt of this section and the owners and skippers finding their boats seized because they have been fishing all the time in Irish waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Except that it is discretionary now.  That is the saver in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: I accept that it is discretionary. I have to look for the lesser of two evils&mdash;and I am anxious to ensure that this Bill goes through straightaway&mdash;but if there had been time I would have put down amendments to ensure that it would not apply to certain offences.  For instance, it applies to a second charge relative to the carriage of certain fishing nets on Irish sea-fishing boats.  Under section 226 of the Principal Act the fine for such an offence was very small, in fact, in certain circumstances, only £50.  As a result of the extension of this section we now find it includes provisions such as that the master or owner of such a fishing boat may find his vessel confiscated.  I am somewhat concerned by such a provision, because at all times we took the view that we wanted to stop foreign poaching.  We accept that legislation must be non-discriminatory. But at the same time there is no need to specifically include sections which relate only to Irish boats.  For instance, section 226 of the Principal Act refers specifically to Irish sea-fishing boats and certain other vessels.  Therefore, in fairness, it is not confined totally to Irish fishing boats.  I want to voice my concern at this fact.  The fishing fraternity in this country may be somewhat worried at having this sort of threat hanging over their heads.  However, we are letting the Bill go through and I cannot put an amendment down at this stage. Possibly in the context of a fisheries debate conducted with more order and time to it we may get back to this point in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other specific point to which I want to refer.  Here I am again directing my remarks against the foreign trawler.  Paragraph (a) refers to a conviction being a second or subsequent conviction on indictment under any of those sections committed on board the same boat.  I wonder is <Col N="1846" /> that the proper terminology to use. Some of the offences to which we refer in sections 221, 222, 222A, 223, 223A, 226 and 227 of the Principal Act are not actually committed on board the vessel.  I think I am correct in saying that section 221 refers to a restriction on foreign sea-fishing vessels entering our exclusive waters.  For example is the use of the words &ldquo;on board&rdquo; proper in these circumstances?  If somebody is guilty of an offence of illegal entry in our exclusive waters is it proper to say that that offence in committed on board a certain vessel?  It is a point of terminology, but I wonder if it is the correct way to have the section drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: On the last point raised by the Deputy, I do not see how it could be done any other way.  I know it is a drafting point.  What we are trying to do is to pin down the conviction in relation to the second offence in regard to the same boat. Then, under paragraph (b), the boat itself is in the ownership of the same person.  That is the only way to get at the situation having regard to the necessity to get at the same boat repeating its offence and the same owner.  However, as the Deputy acknowledges that is a matter for the draftsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the other point raised by the Deputy in relation to Irish fishermen, by reason of certain offences that are here, the matter for indictment being subject to this section in regard to confiscation of the boat, the section is governed&mdash;and let us be practical and use common sense about it&mdash;by the court at its discretion ordering the boat to be forfeited.  I have sufficient confidence in Irish courts in that respect that they will not start ordering the confiscation of a boat except in a very serious case that really warrants it.  In practice that confiscation procedure will hopefully be directed at really major offences.  I know that technically the Deputy is correct.  It can procedurally apply to some of the offences under Table I in relation to Irish fishermen in respect of an offence in regard to fish and gear, under-sized fish, wrongly-meshed nets, and so on, where there is <Col N="1847" /> a fine of up to £10,000 on indictment.</P>
    <P>Technically, on the second offence, this could apply, but in reality the courts are there to exercise common sense.  I do not have to tell the Deputy, who is a practising lawyer, that the courts would not order the confisca-tion of the boat in a case like that. Obviously the procedure is designed to get at the really serious cases involving foreign fishermen or major commercial organisations which come here and proceed to flout the law to the extent that they become liable on a second offence on indictment to very heavy penalties.  The offence must be a serious one and the court rightly has the power to deal with that offence by way of confiscation of the boat.</P>
    <P>The Deputy adverted to the point that we must appear in this legislation to be non-discriminatory.  The application of the law is a matter for the discretion of the court but, so far as the actual law is concerned, it must be non-discriminatory. We cannot appear to discriminate in any way in favour of Irish fishermen and <i>vice versa</i>.  The law must be the same for the specific offence.  The Irish fishermen would be involved if he had unlawful fishing gear or had caught unlawful fish.  That is the only respect in which he is involved and the penalties against him are set out in Table 1.  We cannot have one law for him and another for the foreigner.  I am certain an Irish court will take the appropriate common-sense view in regard to the confisca-tion of the boat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister satisfied that as this section is framed the prosecution would be able to discharge the onus of proof?  The section provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1848" />&ldquo;(1)  It shall not be lawful for any foreign sea-fishing boat to enter within the exclusive fishery limits of the State except for&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  a purpose recognised by international law, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a purpose recognised by any convention, treaty or arrangement for the time being in force between the State and the country to which such boat belongs, or</P>

    <P>(2)  If a foreign sea-fishing boat enters within the exclusive fishery limits of the State in contravention of subsection (1), the master of the boat shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is the onus of proof on the defendant to justify the lawfulness of his entry? If not, I would be very anxious that the onus of proof should be shifted to the defence and the only onus of proof on the prosecution would be to prove that the boat was in exclusive waters and thereafter the defendant would have to justify his position.</P>

He could justify it on the ground that he was landing an injured seaman, or because of some <Col N="1849" /> special quota, or some provision in international law.  As it is, the section will be inoperable because the prosecution would appear to have to negative all these things before there would be a case against a foreign trawler for illegal entry.</P>

Under subsection (2) the Minister may make regulations in regard to the maintenance of good order among foreign sea-fishing boats within our exclusive fishery limit, and subsection (3) provides that the master shall be guilty of an offence when he has done something in contravention of subsection (1).  Now there appears to be no enforcement provision.  In those circumstances there does not appear to be much point in the Minister making regulations for foreign sea-fishing boats.  The subsection does not state it will be an offence to be in contravention of any regulation the Minister may make under subsection (2).</P>

      <P>: I notice in many statutes that power is being given to the Minister which in many cases can be virtually absolute power.  I wonder what control over the Minister there may be when he is making these orders.  He can make orders relative to the conservation of fish stocks.  He can make such orders &ldquo;as the Minister thinks proper&rdquo;.  Is there some provision whereby these orders will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval?  What are the checks and balances on the making of such orders? As the section is now framed, it appears that the Minister has unlimited jurisdiction.  For instance, he could order that all Deputies from coastal constituencies when they are near the coast might wear black in case they frighten away the fish.  I use this example not really expecting such an order but merely to put on the record that I am concerned that any Minister can reserve unto himself very wide-ranging powers.  I would be very anxious to know whether any orders or regulations made under such sections would be laid before both Houses and scrutinised by the Members of the Oireachtas before they come into effect.  Some of these orders can be issued and unless they are objected to they come into effect. With the volume of paper coming out it is very difficult to have them looked at properly.  Would the Minister tell me what checks and balances there might be in relation to the type of order that could be made under this section?</P>

      <P>: The principle enshrined in this section is on all fours <Col N="1852" /> with that enshrined in section 35 of the Fisheries Act, 1962, concerning conservation of fish stocks and rational exploitation of fisheries.  That section is now repealed and is being replaced by this section.  There is no change in the wording of the Bill as it relates to the main principle of conservation and exploitation of fisheries. The purpose of the repeal is that when section 35 of the 1962 Act was enacted the limits were 12 miles and there was a need for international agreement in regard to waters of interest to us outside 12 miles.  Since 1 January 1977 we are into a 200-mile zone as far as fisheries are concerned and we do not have any need for international agreements outside the Community, which are a separate matter.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy on the importance of having such orders laid before both Houses.  The section as it now stands is still governed by section 36 of the 1962 Act which provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every order made by the Minister under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order was laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: This section relates to the special powers of sea fishery protection officers and is one of which I approve.  It occurred to me, relative to our earlier discussions on the question of aerial reconnaissance, to ask if the Minister considered there was any need for a particular provision to cover the position where an <Col N="1853" /> aeroplane spots illegal fishing and attempts to intervene.  I am not an expert on this point but I understand that if a plane comes upon a vessel fishing illegally there are internationally recognised signals whereby it can direct the vessel to haul in its nets and travel to the nearest port.  I am not sure of this point but I have heard of something of this kind.  Are we in the situation whereby any aerial reconnaissance is to be totally by way of assistance to the naval vessels, in other words, that the aircraft officers can do no more than radio to the naval vessel outlining the position of the offending vessel?  I understood that spotter planes could fly low, attract the attention of the offending vessel and by way of internationally-recognised signals direct it to travel to the nearest port.  I understand there have been cases in Canada recently where prosecutions have rested solely on the evidence of the officers of spotter planes.</P>
      <P>I am interested also in the prosecu-tion of the Spanish vessel referred to in a report in the <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of May 20.  In this case it appears that it was the crew of an RAF Nimrod aircraft who gave the evidence after a chase across the Irish Sea.  If in other countries the evidence of aircraft officers alone is sufficient for a prosecution should not the type of power we are talking of be extended to include officers of the Naval Service?  To put it another way, is it possible that a vessel of the Naval Service on fishery reconnaissance work could be regarded as a sea-fishery protection vessel?  I am merely exploring the boundaries of what might be useful in regard to the use of spotter planes and of what might be necessary from the point of view of legal battle in the future.  Is the Minister satisfied that there is sufficient statutory backing in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy has raised a very interesting point, but basically I see the immediate improvements in this area to be rather in the practical or in the technological area. We wish to have the aircraft more organised both by way of photographic equipment and ability to fix location in order to give supplementary evidence. <Col N="1854" /> The aircraft physically may not land on the boat.  Therefore, the most effective way within our present resources to conduct the operation efficiently&mdash;and we are only starting on this development here&mdash;is to maximise the efficiency of the spotter plane as an adjunct to the naval boat that must make the capture and arrest.  In that respect the naval officers have the same powers as fishery officers.  One might say that the naval officers stand in the shoes of the fishery officers when making an arrest of this kind.</P>
      <P>However, the matter is worth considering and I am glad that the Deputy has raised it.  One of the better results of this debate has been the whole emphasis on aerial reconnaissance and investigation as an adjunct to the apprehension of poaching vessels. For the moment we should concentrate on that aspect rather than on the further aspect suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Canadians use very advanced fishery protection vessels. I intend having discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Defence, in this respect.  Perhaps we could consider the system used in Canada.  Apparently the Canadians have the best reputation in the world in this whole area of fisheries protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: My advice is that the section is constitutional.  The Attorney General has advised me accordingly.  I do not see anything excessive about 48 hours detention.  Such a period of detention has been on the Statute Books for a number of years now in respect of other offences committed in the jurisdiction.  There has been much contention about the extension of the <Col N="1855" /> period but it is fairly widely accepted now that 48 hours is a recognised period of detention.  The courts have regarded this as being reasonable and I do not regard its extension from the personal offences area to which I have referred to this area as being unconstitutional or unreasonable&mdash;hallowed by practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes.  They could be so used, but again I must emphasise that we cannot discriminate in our legislation.  However, it is obvious that the power of detention provided for here is designed almost entirely to ensure that a foreign fishing boat would be dealt with in a systematic way while at base.  I assure the Deputy that this is the whole purpose of the section.  I have been talking about this during the past couple of days in Luxembourg where, I am happy to say, people are becoming concerned about our legislation.  When I was asked questions about this aspect of the situation I was able to give an assurance that our legislation was non-discriminatory. Of course, the common-sense of the courts will enter into all of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: I agree in principle with the Minister's intention and I regret that we need legislation to ensure that foreign vessels entering our waters can be searched properly. For that purpose a detention period is needed, and I do not consider 48 hours detention to be excessive.  How-ever, I am genuinely concerned that in practical terms it may be difficult to see how the provision might be used against Irish fishermen.  We are putting on the Statute Book a provision that will enable an Irish fishing boat, its skipper and the rest of the crew to be detained for 48 hours on suspicion of what may be even a relatively minor offence.  A foreign vessel would probably be charged ultimately with a serious offence, such as illegal entry or illegal fishing, but the powers under the Fisheries Act <Col N="1856" /> relate also to a large number of offences that are not as serious as those and some of which are relatively minor offences.  I accept the proposal in the practical sense and it is difficult to envisage such a power being over-used in respect of Irish boats, but I am not happy that an Irish crew could be detained on suspicion for 48 hours for possibly a minor offence. However, I must face the lesser of two evils.  I have no wish to hold up the legislation because it is important that it is enacted before we adjourn for the recess, but I must record my disapproval at the enactment of a provision such as this.</P>

The purpose of this provision is to enable investigation of offences by boats coming from outside our waters.  We are providing an all-embracing provision which will permit the 48-hour detention to apply to what may be a relatively minor offence by an Irish vessel.  I believe that, if we had the opportunity, we could probably find a way around it by providing that such powers can be exercised only in relation to those sections concerning foreign poaching.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I take it that the Deputy is referring to the current year.  It is not correct to say that my Department has made no application this year for financial aid from the European Regional Development Fund.  Our first application in respect of 1978 was submitted to the EEC Commission at the beginning of April.  The amount of Fund aid sought in respect of the projects in this application is almost £16 million which represents over 60 per cent of this country's total allocation from the Fund for 1978.  It is understood, in fact, that with only one exception Ireland's application to date covers a greater percentage of its 1978 allocation than does that of any other member State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the timing of our application, there has been some press comment about a delay in putting forward projects.  I should explain that there was difficulty at the beginning of this year about the submission of projects for assistance from the Fund <Col N="1835" /> because of the delay in Brussels in concluding the review of the Fund Regulation.  As a number of changes in the Regulation proposed by the Commission were of importance to Ireland, namely the introduction of a system of advance payments, the definition of eligible infrastructure and the rate of aid for infrastructural projects, it was considered desirable to defer the submission of the first batch of projects for Fund assistance until the completion of the review. This was expected by the early part of the year.  As soon as it became clear that adoption of the new Regulation would be delayed&mdash;in fact the review has not yet been completed&mdash;the first batch of projects was submitted to the Commission.  They will be considered by the Fund Management Committee at its meet-ing next month.  I would emphasise that the implementation of the relevant projects has not been affected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>: Having regard to the serious depletion of the stocks of salmon in the Foyle system in recent years I am fully satisfied that the arrangements for the opening of commercial fishing in the area during 1978 are fully justified. The regulations which govern the fishing are unchanged since 1976 but the seventh Monday after 1 May happens to fall some six days later in 1978 than in 1977.  I should say that the Commission proposed to defer the opening date for net fishing at sea and in Lough Foyle until the eighth Monday after 1 May and in the estuary until the ninth Monday but, following consultation with the fishermen and the responsible Minister in Belfast, it was agreed to let the 1977 arrangements stand for 1978.</P>
      <P>When the Commission was set up in 1952 commercial fishing was permitted from 15 April to 31 August.  The 1978 season runs from 19 June to 31 August.  This period is shorter than that which applies in the other fishery districts but the depletion of stocks in the Foyle area has been more serious than elsewhere and has necessitated sterner conservation measures.</P>

      <P>The annual crime report includes details of prosecutions under the 1963 regulations mentioned in the question and the report for the year 1977 is expected to be published within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>Details of prosecutions for infringements of red traffic light signals are not shown separately in the statistics.</P>

      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 175 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meath County Council's proposals for Summerhill and Dunshaughlin sewerage schemes were received in my <Col N="1842" /> Department in January and June 1977, respectively.  These schemes must be considered in the context of the amount of capital available for water and sewerage schemes and the comparatively large programme of such projects in progress at present or about to commence.  It is not possible to say at this stage when approval will issue to these schemes for which working drawings are under consideration in my Department.</P>
