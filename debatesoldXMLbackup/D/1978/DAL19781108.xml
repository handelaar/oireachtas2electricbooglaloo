I have not been allowed to raise the matter.  I understand the reason is that the Minister for the Environment disclaims responsibility in this area.  If he is not responsible, who is?  This House is voting at least 66? per cent of the money for these services, and I crave of you, Sir, to give me an opportunity on the Adjournment tonight to raise this matter.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with the major points raised by Deputies during their contributions to the debate.  I should like to dispel the suggestion made by Opposition speakers that local authorities had been squeezed for money during the current year.  They never had more money than they have had in the current year.  The £530 million available to them this year for current capital services represents an increase of £100 million on the previous year.  The cash flow and rate collection figures of local authorities are benefiting substantially from the fact that the State is now the biggest ratepayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn asked me to elaborate on the reference in my Second Reading speech to the possibility of a global rather than an individual system of valuation being applied to domestic property.  This is a matter for the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for the valuation system.  The matter of future valuations is at present being examined by him.  One way or another, local authorities will be fairly treated in this regard.  They will be given full value for the purpose of the grant which they <Col N="371" /> will be getting from the State for all new domestic property built in their areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell, referring to this matter, suggested that the only reason for the continuance of valuations is to keep the way open for the reimposition of rates.  This is nonsense.  The need for valuations of new domestic properties is to allow local authorities to claim an increased amount from the domestic rate grants and to ensure that no extra burden will fall on non-domestic property as a result of new reliefs.  It has nothing to do with reimposing rates on domestic property.  Deputy Mitchell wants to reimpose rates on houses of five bedrooms.  The fact that a person lives in a five-bedroomed house does not mean that he is rich.  You could have instances of widows and people on fixed incomes living in such houses.  These people may have had large families.  He appears to be suggesting that they should be forced out of their homes because they were once well-off or had large families.  I do not see any justice in this suggestion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell wants me to reimpose rates on rented accommodation. He wants rates to be a cost factor in the provision of rented accommodation but not in the provision of owner-occupied accommodation.  I fail to see what benefit this would confer on tenants of rented accommodation on whose behalf Deputy Mitchell is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell also referred to the position of small shopkeepers.  The small shopkeeper does not pay domestic rates. He pays rates only on the part of his premises used as a shop or a business and gets full relief on his living accommodation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn was concerned that local authorities had not been advised of the upper limit to be applied this year. There is no need for him to be concerned, because the period specified for holding estimates meetings does not start until 23 November.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the House that the primary purpose of this Bill is to give legal effect to the Government's decision to abolish rates on domestic property, community halls, secondary schools and on farm buildings which are still liable for rates.  This year alone the sum came to £80 million for this purpose.  The remaining provisions of the Bill arise directly from the fundamental changes caused by the derating.  The provisions in this Bill are designed to make the necessary changes in the legal framework within which local authorities must operate.  I can understand the position of Deputies who wish to raise other issues in this debate.</P>
      <P>When drafting this Bill we had to keep in mind the need for a fair balance between local authorities, the remaining ratepayers and the general body of taxpayers. At all times I have been fully aware of the need for keeping a sound democratic system at local authority level.  This Bill provides for all these things in a fair and reasonable way.  I should like to emphasise that there is no interference with the autonomy of local authorities, a matter which was referred to by many people during the debate.  It is their right to establish their own programmes and priorities and to spend the domestic grant as they see fit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a couple of occasions I attempted to raise on the Adjournment the matter to which the Minister referred, that is, informing local authorities of the percentage increase for rates for 1979.  Can the Minister say whether the amount will be 6 per cent, as alleged by Deputy Tully, and when local authorities will be given this information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

Some of these halls had accumulated arrears of £500 or £600. They are only paying so much on account at the moment and rate collectors cannot take their percentage because this is hanging over them.  I am asking the Minister if he would wipe the slate clean.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am well aware of it.  Did the Minister deal with the suggestion that the machinery in the Bill is not effective to pass on rates relief to tenants of domestic premises?  Is he satisfied that the provisions in the Bill, without amendment, will pass on the rates relief to tenants of flats and other domestic premises throughout the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied it is the best way it can be done.  It gives tenants access to the courts.  The percentage of tenants affected is not as great, as far as we can ascertain, as some people maintain it is.  It gives such tenants access to <Col N="374" /> the courts to recover the amount of the rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): We will have an opportunity on committee Stage to go into this more fully.  I do not agree with the Minister that the Bill will be effective in passing the relief on to tenants.  Is the Minister saying the relief will be passed on retrospectively to 1 January 1978 from which time the landlords have been enjoying the relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider, even in general terms, the suggestion I made with regard to the possibility of allowing tenants to offset some or all of their rent as against income tax? Those of us who represent areas in which there are many private tenants have evidence that such tenants are not enjoying relief in respect of the elimination of rates.  I do not know of any case in which it has happened.  Will the Minister agree to reconsider the provisions of the Bill, say next year, to see if amendments will have become necessary in the light of experience?  It may have come to his attention then that this relief has not been passed on to tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), line 38, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My reason for tabling the amendment is that this Bill, as with a number of measures, is revolving entirely around the power given to the Minister to make regulations.  If regulations are not made the legislation is useless because the Bill does nothing more than give power to the Minister to make the regulations.  I am not particularly concerned as to whether the change of &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be in subsection (1) or subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) gives the Minister discretionary power to make regulations in relation to the control of advertising while subsection (2) gives him discretionary power to include all or any of a number of requirements in the regulations. From the point of view of the legislation it would have been better if the regulations which, I understand the Minister has ready, had been set out in the Bill.  Also, from the point of view of parliament this would be a better way of introducing legislation instead of giving the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> to make regulations which the House may never have an opportunity of discussing.  For that reason I considered it would be more appropriate that &ldquo;may&rdquo; be <Col N="377" /> changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; either in subsection (1) or subsection (2).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I am not in a position to accept this amendment. However, I do not think there is any great difference between what Deputy Boland and I intend.  He appears to agree that the situation regarding the advertising of tobacco products and the promotion of their sales and sponsorship should be controlled and regulated.  I am giving myself some flexibility in this situation.  That is desirable.  It may well be that in some areas there may never be a need for regulations.  The people concerned might agree voluntarily to cease certain types of activity in which case it would be pointless to go to the trouble and expense of making statutory regulations that were unnecessary.  On the other hand I visualise the making of regulations.  That is almost certain but from my own point of view concerning the situation as it is now and from the point of view of successive Ministers it is desirable and indeed necessary to have the flexibility which the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; permits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being somewhat less than forthcoming.  He knows as well as I know that not only is he likely to make regulations under this Bill but that the draft of those regulations has been ready for some time in the Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the regulations are ready.  Not only in relation to this Bill but in relation to legislation generally, it would be preferable that if regulations have been prepared they should be included in the Bill because the real power is in the regulations. In this case if the regulations had been set out in subsection (2) the House <Col N="378" /> would have had the opportunity of determining exactly what the Minister intended. The other point is that, carried to its absurdity, the Minister is faced with a challenge that was put to him by some speakers on Second Stage, that was, that he was not in earnest in relation to the Bill and that he might never put it into effect.  Taking the Bill literally the Minister will have no obligation to put the measure into effect because of the use in the double context both in subsections (1) and (2) of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;. Therefore, the accusation could be levelled again at the Minister&mdash;&mdash;I hasten to add not by me&mdash;&mdash;that he does not intend to implement the provisions of the Bill, that after its enactment the regulations may not be published or implemented for some considerable time, if at all, that difficulties might be put forward as a reason for the regulations not being implemented, and that the justification for that situation could be that the first line of subsection (1) and the second line of subsection (2) contains the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; which is of a discretionary nature rather than the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; which would be mandatory.  However, as the Minister has indicated his unwillingness to accept the amendment, there is no point in pursuing the matter further.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), lines 38 and 39, to delete &ldquo;control and regulation&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;banning&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In tabling these amendments it was my intention to emphasise the fact that if we are serious about the adverse effects of tobacco advertising and sponsorship, if we really mean to implement what is intended in this Bill, we should not adopt any half-way measure.  To my way of thinking the phrase &ldquo;to control and regulate&rdquo; means that we will tolerate the situation and will not eliminate it.  That is why I am proposing the substitution of the word &ldquo;banning&rdquo; in this context.  As <Col N="379" /> the subsection stands we are giving tacit approval to the advertising of tobacco products.  There is a precedent for banning such advertising.  It has been banned from radio and television so what is the reason for the discrepancy in relation to other media?  We should be resolute regarding what we intend and our intention should be the banning of advertising which promotes the qualities and properties of cigarettes and other tobacco products.  The only way to discourage the use of these products is to ban advertisements relating to them.  We are not saying that we will ban tobacco from the country.  All we are saying is that we will stop its promotion in any form.  The amendment, therefore, is not unreasonable. It might pose problems for the Minister but I should like to hear his views on it and to have some indication from him of what is meant by the use of the words &ldquo;control and regulate&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much in sympathy with the thinking behind the amendment but I am sure that there are many others as well as myself who would be happy to witness a total disappearance from our community environment of the promotion of sales of cigarettes in particular.  Anybody who knows anything about the situation would like to see cigarette smoking ended but we must deal with reality.  We are not dealing with automatons but with human beings and when we are trying to persuade the community to adopt a certain course of action we must use some discretion.  It would be easy to be counter-productive in this area, to set up a hostility and a reaction to what we are endeavouring to achieve.  The most reasonable and rational people will resent any attempt to force them into certain forms of activity or to prohibit certain practices to which they believe they are entitled.  On the whole we must proceed wisely and with a great deal of common sense and sensitivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect that in the future, whether it be within five, ten or 20 years, what we are talking about now will be looked back on with astonishment.  People will be astonished that we even argued about <Col N="380" /> whether we should take any action regarding cigarette smoking.  In the course of time common sense will prevail in this area.  We have to deal with the situation we see in front of us, that is, a situation where we have an on-going industry giving a certain amount of employment.  There are a number of bodies, such as sporting organisations, which have come to rely on sponsorship by tobacco companies.  I do not think it would be wise, healthy or sensible ultimately to blunder into this situation and be completely dictatorial, autocratic and arbitrary.  Severity in itself in this area could be counter-productive.</P>
    <P>What we have to do is proceed step by step.  We must first recognise that the existing situation is completely out of control.  Our environment is being saturated with advertising and promotion activities of all sorts.  We must get some kind of control imposed on the situation.  Having established control, we must slowly but steadily reduce the impact of advertising, try to eliminate all the seductiveness, persuasiveness and attractiveness which is embodied in the present advertising of tobacco.  We have to try and inculcate the belief that smoking cigarettes is not smart or sophisticated&mdash;&mdash;in fact, it is damned stupid and silly.  We have to understand that this message must be put across to the people in a rational way.</P>
    <P>Like my colleagues I mix in the community and know that ordinary rational members of society instinctively react against a heavy hand by the authorities, by the Government, by the bureaucracy. They have to be persuaded that what we are endeavouring to do is worth the interference with people's liberty, with the freedom of action that is involved.  At the moment in any sample group of people you would get approval for what we are doing here, but you would have to put the case very firmly before them.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to Deputy O'Connell that I am in total agreement with his ultimate approach, with what he would like ultimately to achieve, but I think what I am proposing is the better way to do it, given all the circumstances that exist.  I want the Deputy to accept that I am not concerned with commercial <Col N="381" /> pressures from the tobacco companies. I am more concerned with endeavouring to see that our policies in this health education area have popular approval and support and that we do not give the appearance of being arbitrary, dictatorial and autocratic.  That is the general background to what I propose.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Deputy that while I am not prepared at this stage to accept the word &ldquo;banning&rdquo;, sooner or later we will work around to a total ban in this area.  In the meantime what I am asking for will give me enough power to do what I want&mdash;&mdash;control and regulate. Ultimately, if those powers to control and regulate are sufficiently availed of, we will have power to go as near to banning as makes no difference.  If we use the word &ldquo;ban&rdquo;it would place me in a very severe straitjacket and give me no room to manoeuvre.  There would be an immediate clampdown and that would cause a certain amount of upset and disruption to a number of innocent bystanders, people on the fringe of this area, who are not making great profits out of the sale of tobacco.  I hope the Deputy accepts that I do not intend dallying on this but I want to proceed wisely, firstly to get the situation under control and then gradually to bring about a situation which everybody would regard as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>There will be some things which will disappear almost immediately, for instance, advertising in cinemas, which has either gone or is on the way out. Next to go will be a very compelling form of promotion&mdash;&mdash;outdoor advertising. At the same time we will proceed on all fronts to control the content of advertisements, the level of attractiveness and persuasiveness and the overall limits of expenditure, with the idea of eventually getting the whole situation completely under control.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I sympathise with what Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Browne have in mind in this amendment, but without rejecting the principle of the desirability ultimately of banning everything, at this stage, I would need the flexibility which the use of the words &ldquo;control and regulation&rdquo; give me in the section.</P>

      <P>We are talking about controlling advertising, but there is nothing in the Bill to indicate that there could be a 25 per cent reduction in advertising each year, until advertising is eliminated in four years.  If we got that kind of assurance we could proceed with a certain amount of enthusiasm.  We have to make up our minds whether we want to see concerted attempts by the tobacco companies to promote the sale of cigarette smoking.  They rely on the Pavlovian effect on the person who is thinking of giving up cigarette smoking or who has given it up.  They produce very seductive advertising which makes people crave for cigarettes again.  They are undoing all the work of the Health Education Bureau and other organisations and bodies.  They are also undoing the determined efforts of individual members of the public who seriously want to give up cigarette smoking.  It is their intention to step up their advertising within the framework set out by the Minister.  I can see this only as commercial pressure with vested interests saying they will not tolerate it.</P>
      <P>Who is in command of this country? Dáil Éireann or the vested interests? They can undermine any attempts made by the Minister to curb advertising.  The Minister is manacled.  He is muzzled.  He finds himself in an impossible situation. He came in here with the best intentions in the world, but he finds that he cannot put his ideas and his thoughts into effect on this issue.  He should say to the tobacco companies that he will not bow to sectional interests.  There is a precedent for that.  A former Minister for Health arranged to have cigarette advertising on radio and television banned.  It took ministerial power and authority to get that done.  Had the Minister succumbed to the pressures of the tobacco companies at that time, we would not have got that done.  It takes a Minister with courage and determination to say: &ldquo;No. This far shalt thou go and no further.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> That is all I am asking the Minister to do.</P>
    <P>Could we have an amendment which would give us an assurance that in four years time all tobacco advertising will cease, in other words, phasing out all tobacco advertising over the next four years?  The Minister said the industry is giving a certain amount of employment. That is a very poor argument.  If we think it is giving a certain amount of employment, we should scrap the Health Education Bureau.  On that premise, the Health Education Bureau are doing a lot of harm to this industry and therefore we wonder are they seriously jeopardising an important industry.  We have to make up our minds.  Is the Minister saying we should tell the Health Education Bureau to stop undermining this industry which is giving a certain amount of employment? The Minister said it is dictatorial and autocratic.  On that premise, this whole Bill is dictatorial and autocratic. We are trying to stop the promotion of tobacco advertising.</P>

      <P>How is that relevant? I am aware of that.  The Minister spoke for almost 25 minutes so I hope my contribution will not be curtailed.  In this Bill we are dealing with a drug, so it is not irrelevant to refer to a drug abuse Bill when we are discussing the merits of this amendment.  We are either serious about this or we are not.  If we are not serious this is a charade.  I see in it a public relations exercise without giving the Bill the teeth which are needed to end tobacco advertising once and for all.  The Minister may control and regulate.  He may make regulations for control and regulation.  The real power goes out of a Bill when regulations take over.</P>
      <P>We have the interesting example of the drug abuse Act which cannot come into effect, even though it was passed two years ago, because the necessary enabling legislation has not been brought into the House.  What was the purpose of all the deliberations in the special committee of the House on drug abuse?  I spent many hundreds of hours on that committee, and the fact that the Act has not come into effect after two years is a terrible indictment of the whole process of legislating in this House.</P>

      <P>We cannot proceed unless we know what the purpose of the Bill is.  The Minister's sincerity would be more in evidence if he would bring in an amendment on Report Stage ending the advertising and promotion of tobacco products, or phasing out the advertising of tobacco over the next four years.  He is very sure in his mind about what he wants done.  He wants to end this pernicious habit.  There are thousands and thousands who literally cannot kick the habit.  I advise such patients, but you cannot be autocratic and dictatorial.  I am not talking about the public.  I am talking about the vested interests who have got at this Bill.</P>

      <P>They have decided the Bill will not have the necessary teeth.  It is a terrible reflection on us as legislators if we allow them to do that.  The public will make up their own minds.  All I am saying is that this seductive, persuasive advertising should not continue.  The people can decide for themselves.  No sustained effort should be made by tobacco advertising to undermine the determination of people who want to give up smoking, or to undermine the laudable campaign by the Health Education Bureau.  If the Minister could bring in an amendment to that effect I would be happy with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> The Minister said that he was not restricting the liberties of individuals, that he was not being dictatorial or autocratic in this, that severity could be counter-productive.  I fail to see where the severity could be counter-productive because if it is a severe measure to ban advertising how could it be counter-productive because one is not restricting the sale?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context I was thinking more of sponsorship.  The Deputy's amendment would cover banning sponsorship totally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  As the Minister is aware, I have an amendment down which could replace it very well and the Minister is also aware that there is quite a considerable amount of revenue to the State from the sale of tobacco products.  If the Minister is as persuasive with his colleague in the Department of Finance as he is with many of his colleagues in his own Department I have no doubt he could be successful in having a national sports sponsorship council set up to take over the function of sponsoring sporting events.  That could be done.  In putting this amendment down to ban sponsorship I was not just being negative about it; I suggested that a national sports sponsorship council be set up to take over that function.  The Minister would probably agree that would be the logical answer.  The revenue accruing to the State from the sale of cigarettes could be used for this purpose and indeed it would be a very laudable thing to do.  In fact I am not just being negative; I am not just saying that the Minister is autocratic or dictatorial as he seems to think but I cannot accept what the Minister says about the industry giving a certain amount of employment.  If that is what he is saying then we may as well stop and go out and drink coffee instead and abandon this Bill.  If the Minister says that the industry gives a certain amount of employment, therefore on that premise alone the Minister is wrong in having the Health Education Bureau do what it is doing because it will undermine that industry.  We cannot have it both ways.  We have got to be very sensible <Col N="387" /> about it.  If the Minister would give me an assurance that advertising will stop within four years I will be very happy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>My job is never easy, between satisfying the opponents on the one hand and those on the other hand who would say I am not going far enough.  The tobacco industry do not want this Bill.  Let us be absolutely clear <Col N="388" /> about that.  They would much prefer to go on as before and fair play to them; they are commercial interests and they want to maximise the profits of their undertakings. They would prefer no constraints at all on their activities.  Furthermore, if they must have restraints on their activities they would much prefer a nice voluntary code worked out to which they could adhere.  That is what they are doing in Britain.  They have a nice cushy, cosy voluntary code over there which does not really upset anything.  So, the fact that the Government are bringing in legislation here at all is proof that we are not bowing to any commercial pressure.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Browne in particular must admit that we have been a long time waiting for this legislation.  Members on both sides of the House have been a long time pressing for this legislation and now at last we have got legislation and it is at least some step forward.  I want to say to Deputy O'Connell and other critics of this legislation that whatever approach I may have to the administration and implementation of this Bill I am giving enough powers in the Bill to any successor of mine to do anything he wants.  The powers in the Bill are completely adequate to enable any Minister for Health to control totally, to the degree that he thinks necessary, this whole area of advertising and promotion.  Deputy O'Connell suggested that he would like to have some undertaking, for instance, about an annual reduction of 25 per cent in the volume of expenditures.  In fact that will be achieved.  I do not have the figure at the moment for cinema advertising so we will leave it out of account for the present.  But it is a step forward.</P>

        <i>Tout</i>, everything, <i>omnia.</i> In fact we will also be insisting on very strict and stringent proposals at point of sale advertising.  I just wanted to mention that fact as an indication to Deputy O'Connell that we are in earnest about this.  He made quite a play of the situation about the drug regulations.  At first sight it might appear to him that we have been dilatory in bringing in these regulations.  I would not totally reject that criticism.  But unfortunately this is a very complex and difficult situation and numerous bodies and organisations had to be consulted, agreements and so on procured and they will be in any day now.  I can assure the Deputy that they will be in certainly before the end of this month.  I will make it a target to have them promulgated before the end of this month.  I also give the House and the Deputy an assurance that the regulations will be made immediately after the passing of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in earnest about this Bill.  It hurts me a bit to be told that this is window <Col N="390" /> dressing.  The Deputy can see that one major tobacco company have withdrawn from a particularly objectionable form of sponsorship of sport and have done so just because this legislation is before the House.  That is a significant achievement.  It is a fringe benefit of the introduction of this legislation.</P>

I would ask Deputies Boland, O'Connell and Browne not to be too critical of what is proposed here.  We are dealing with an area where we have to persuade the general public.  I am not concerned with the feelings of the tobacco industry, the executives or those who control that industry.  They are in business and I have my responsibilities and we both know where we stand.  I am concerned with bringing the general public along with us in our whole health education programme.  If the general public get the idea that we are trying to compel them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is no question as to the adequacy of the powers.  Side by side with that, there is no question of the earnestness with which we intend to pursue the implementation of this legislation. Already there are significant restrictions in operation and they will be followed quickly by others.  If the legislation goes through the Dáil and Seanad this term, it would be my intention that these regulations would be made immediately, certainly before the end of the year.  I make these points because Deputy O'Connell raised serious issues and used some harsh words.  He suggested that this is window dressing, that it is a charade and that we are not sincere.  I reject all these things.  I assure the House that every word in this Bill is the product of my own and my advisers' thinking.  We have gone very carefully into it and we will be accepting some amendments later on from Opposition Deputies.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not without some sympathy for the Minister's dilemma because we know quite well that the unemployment situation is chronic and he has to concern himself with that question. <Col N="392" /> Unfortunately the same is true in relation to the rate of progress.  He is in a difficult situation in taking over-precipitate action.  I know a case can be made in regard to particular points but they must be taken in the context of the subject we are discussing.</P>
      <P>It is notable that the Minister appears not to have mentioned the one point which I think is the most important, that is, the loss of revenue.  If I were Minister for Finance I would curb the Minister for Health if he were trying to deprive me of the enormous revenue which comes from the selling of tobacco.  To do that too precipitately would obviously cause problems for any Government.  I wonder whether that is the most important consideration.</P>
      <P>It is now 20 years since 1957 when I first got the answer that the matter would be investigated, that the Minister would discuss it with the tobacco people and keep the matter under control. There were various platitudes of one kind or another, but certainly no action. The Official Report is littered with appeals by me and various other people over the years and the answers given by the different Ministers were the same as the present Minister has given us today: &ldquo;We will proceed slowly and try to do this job in a responsible way.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is where the conflict lies.  How can the Minister claim to be a responsible Minister for Health and make the kind of speech he did, full of the most frightening statistics about the damage done to the economy, putting it at its lowest, from the point of view of hospital bed occupancy, days out of work, general practitioner time taken up by people suffering from various diseases associated with smoking, chronic heart disease, bronchitis, gastric ulcer, pregnancy problems, chronic permanent physical disability and a mortality figure of 2,000 per year, and fail to take the appropriate action?  I believe the Minister would like to be a conscientious Minister for Health, and the problem is such a serious one that action must be taken at once.  We must stop the prevarication of the last 20 years.  The Minister's predecessors can be excused because <Col N="393" /> they did not have the same experience and the same knowledge that the present Minister has.  I knew from experience what the effects were and probably understood the position much better than earlier Ministers for Health did.  Now experience has taught us because knowledge has increased and the argument against is irrefutable.  There is no debate about it any more.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not have the right to either prevaricate or delay any longer, a right his predecessors had.  I did not bother making a case.  I simply repeated the Minister's speech back to him.  The statistics he gave were unanswerable, so unanswerable that it is patently obvious that something must be done.  People are addicted to a desperately dangerous practice and, in a number of cases, an obviously lethal practice.  Action must be taken by the Government and the Oireachtas.  One thinks of the suffering, the pain and the distress caused to so many.  One thinks of the disability suffered by these people.  It is not enough for the Minister to say that we will be faced with problems of employment. This argument has been used before.  It was used in the defence of opium smoking in the opium war.  There are many ways in which one could provide employment which would inevitably call forth moral objections and objections based on social attitudes, but could there be any more intelligent case against continuing an industry than that which the Minister put to the House in relation to an industry which results in at least 2,000 deaths every year, which costs the State an enormous sum, which is choking hospital beds and taking up the time of general practitioners?  Smoking is an extremely wasteful and offensive habit.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about precipitancy of action and the impossibility of taking effective action.  In the same breath he told us cinema advertising would be cut almost at once.  Poster advertising will be cut virtually immediately.  The Minister has, in fact, acted precipitately in these two particular aspects of advertising.  He has used his powers to see that his edict is carried out.  Most of us have had representations from the poster people complaining about discrimination.  Of <Col N="394" /> course, there is discrimination.  The cinema is a relatively unimportant advertising medium.  It is nothing like so powerful in its appeal as poster advertising and newspaper advertising.  We all know how important newspapers are to all of us, particularly those of us in public life.  Even if there is a ban on someone there is always some window through to the electorate.  Given a choice between cinema advertising, poster advertising and newspaper advertising we would all choose the columns of the newspapers because of the persuasive pens and the talented writers, be they engaged in supporting a particular attitude or opposing it.</P>
    <P>The really important advertising is newspaper advertising.  It is extremely clever, very sophisticated and most seductive.  There was a time, indeed, when advertising was so obvious in its appeal to adolescents that various movements tried to control the advertisements. There were questions here in the House.  Committees were set up to consult with the advertisers just as the Minister says now that he will talk with these people.  I do not blame them.  They are in business to make money.  I do not agree with them of course.  If they are to use the talents of script and caption writers to the maximum, then they must depend on the conscious and unconscious motivation these people use in trying to sell a product.  Obviously, the most important thing is to hook the young people as early as possible and then they are on cigarettes for life.  For those who understand the dangers it is extraordinary to see people continuing to smoke cigarettes in spite of the dreadful story the Minister has put forward here.  It simply illustrates, as he knows and I know, the difficulty of getting rid of the habit.  These people should be helped, people who probably do appreciate the true situation and know that it is a dangerous and lethal habit in many cases.  They should be helped, not provoked as they are by these mass advertisements one sees in the press &mdash;they are less obvious at present, I suppose because the debate is going on.  As I reminded the Minister during the Second Stage debate the flood of colourful <Col N="395" /> advertisements that came when he made his first assertion that he would do something about it were extremely persuasive, giving the general impression that this was a harmless habit and that in fact most of the film stars, sports heroes, thoughtful intelligent people, really strong, healthy people all smoked and got away with it.  That was the implication of the message.  This was an overpowering, countervailing force against the Minister's attempts and the attempts of all his predecessors to drive home the reality regarding the dangers of continuing to smoke cigarettes.</P>
    <P>It always surprises me that we waste money on this.  I have always found Department of Health advertising against smoking painfully obscure.  I end up not being sure whether it was an advertisement by the tobacco company or the Department&mdash;they were too clever.  Obviously, they were a waste of money because the amount of money the tobacco companies could spend was far in excess of anything the Minister was ever likely to be able to lay hands on.  It seems clear to us then that what the Minister should do is not bother seeking money from the Minister for Finance for a counter advertising programme but just tell the companies simply that they may not continue to advertise at all.  That seems so logical that it is very difficult to accept that there is any case against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion that it might be counter-productive, of course, we completely accept.  Again, I think we are rather illogical in accepting it.  I think it is practical reality that one should stop smoking and just say: &ldquo;No more smoking&rdquo;.  We know what happened to that in school; obviously nobody took any notice.  The strange thing is that one can tell people to stop smoking opium and marijuana or various other drugs and we do not think there is anything odd about that but we think it is impossible to do that in regard to cigarette smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> We are not asking that at all.  It is true that in socialist countries one does not have advertising and people continue to smoke.  So it is not a simple question, not a simple cause and effect matter.  It is the business of becoming addicted and then finding it difficult to give up.  At the same time it seems to be reasonable that this provocation to continue smoking &mdash;which is what a clever advertisement is&mdash;should be discontinued.  I do not see how that could be in the slightest counter-productive.  You might as well say that we do not have cigarette smoking advertisements on television now and this has had no counter-productive effect as far as the smoker is concerned.  He just has not noticed the advertisements, that is all.  It has done him no harm; it has saved the poor devil, who has just had a meal or is worried and anxious and wants to take a cigarette, the experience of seeing an advertisement telling him that it is all right to smoke.  To that extent it may help him through the crisis of trying to give up smoking permanently. I do not see any weight in the argument.</P>
    <P>Just as we were talking about the changes in the approach of Government Ministers to pushing down living standards in the Social Welfare Bill yesterday, similarly, in matters of this kind people who were selling dangerous products have had to change their approach. Obviously, pressure is put on them here and elsewhere.  There is quite a good lobby in the medical profession advocating change, advocating restriction on advertising and on the facility with which people were able to smoke everywhere they wanted to.  The response to that has been particularly clever.  In fact, one wonders whether they would greatly mind if advertising were completely banned as we suggest. Which of the two, sponsorship or advertising is the more harmful?  Sponsorship, of course, has been their reply to the pressure against advertising and the fear that it may be inevitable that some Minister would be able to exercise the same pressure as the present Minister has exercised in relation to cinemas and posters and that one day newspaper advertising will cease.  Sponsorship is a particularly interesting development <Col N="397" /> over the years and particularly&mdash;sinister is probably too weighty a word to use, but it is fascinating&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have to deal with sponsorship then.  Sponsorship is quite a different question, because it was a very well thought out assault on the opinion formers in our society.  It is a particularly interesting education to anybody interested in mind moulding techniques if one examines the permutations and the implications of the development of sponsorship over the years.  The people that the sponsors are anxious to influence are the important people in any society.  At the same time they want to get them to <Col N="398" /> lower their defences against a practice which they would otherwise oppose.</P>
      <P>It is important to look at the various organisations who have been systematically undermined and infiltrated over the years.  The control by the enormous combines of the tobacco multi-nationals is of great interest to anybody concerned with changing people's minds.  An organisation like the GAA has all sorts of connotations in our society.  The obvious national one is that it was associated with the emergent nation in the 1920s and afterwards the establishment of a national ethos and association with national heroes like Pearse.  This was a very important organisation to try to get on one's side not only for that reason but for the very important reason that its activities are concentrated on young adolescents.  The whole picture of this organisation is one of carefree, youthful enthusiasm and healthy bodies untrammelled by any disability, but full of vigour and energy with no question whatever of coronary heart disease or bronchitis and, above all, the very painful death from lung cancer as well as the other painful illnesses associated with cigarette smoking.</P>
      <P>It was very important to get the tacit approval of this organisation for the continuation of the practice of cigarette smoking.  I criticised the GAA over the years for accepting sponsorship.  It was essentially a betrayal of their responsibility to young people in a moral sense. Presumably, the Minister is serious about saying that sponsorship will go so the GAA must find other ways, which they should have done in the past, of raising money rather than being a party to a concerted assault on the credulity of young people leaving them to believe that cigarette smoking was not a dangerous habit and was not in some cases a lethal habit.  I believe that the GAA were wrong to allow themselves to get involved in sponsorship by tobacco companies.  Apparently they have voluntarily withdrawn.  They should actually be compelled to withdraw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the extension of sponsorship to various other games.  I am not sure about the Football Association.  They have the link with the beer barons, and <Col N="399" /> they are equally wrong to become party to the extension of the very lamentable drink habits we have in the country. Golf is a middle-class sport to a great extent. Professional people, lawyers, doctors, politicians, businessmen and so on take part in it.  Most of those people are influential in our society.  They are then offered considerable sums of money to sponsor very elaborate international contests and their silence is bought.</P>

      <P>I will continue to try to persuade the Minister that I have been very abstemious indeed in taking only half an hour to discuss advertising, which is a very wide ranging subject.  I could have brought in many other aspects, the underlying psychology of advertising and the whole process of changing people's minds, in a much more wide ranging way if I had chosen to do so.</P>
      <P>It is important to illustrate the importance of the influence of sponsorship in society.  There is no doubt that this has been a systematic development over the years in which all the components of the structure of society have been bought over by this device of sponsorship.  An enormous number of influential people such as doctors, teachers, lawyers and so on will not take up a positive position against cigarette smoking.  Sponsorship has also been extended to various musical and artistic parts of society, and this influential group of people feel that it is unreasonable of us to ask that they be deprived of their sponsorship.  It is debateable whether the whole idea of sponsorship is more important than advertising.  Another interesting point is that Benson and Hedges, who are cigarette manufacturers, sponsor a political correspondents' competition of some kind or another.</P>

      <P>The tobacco companies are completely cynical about sponsorship. The odd thing is that the elite in our society do not appear to understand how totally their silence is being bought. They are being blackmailed, or at least pressurised, into allowing this kind of thing to go on.</P>
      <P>I have a certain sympathy with the Minister who has had to sponsor this Bill.  There is certainly no political gain in it because so many people are sympathetic to cigarette smoking and they cannot see why we are behaving in this cranky way in asking that cigarette advertising be banned.  Could the Minister give any sort of specific timetable that we could depend on, as to how soon he is likely to phase out this? The Minister will forgive my cynicism, but I have had undertakings so many times and nothing has happened as a result of them.  Certainly this Minister has taken up a very positive position, he has made no bones about being in doubt or anything like that and has introduced a Bill.  That is all very creditable, but can the Minister give any serious timetable of a period of years in which both sponsorship and advertising will be completely banned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said most of what I have to say already on this subject, but a couple of points came up from Deputy Browne and Deputy O'Connell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a stranger from a European country or from America came into the Gallery <Col N="402" /> and listened to this debate he would undoubtedly be somewhat puzzled.  He would see what the legislation before the House was endeavouring to achieve, and if he was an intelligent and rational being he would imagine that the opposition to this measure would be coming from some vested interests who do not want any restriction or control on advertising and who have for some reason an interest in seeing that the tobacco companies were allowed to proceed uninhibited. He would imagine, so far as the Deputies talking in this House were speaking against the legislation, that was their motivation and outlook.  I am sure it is difficult to understand Deputies who are firmly committed to a positive health programme and policy, and who have campaigned for something in this area, being critical of the legislation and being, to some extent, the only opposition that the legislation has.  That must be confusing people.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a suggestion to Opposition Deputies, and I hope I am not patronising in this respect.  I suggest that they should be saying to me: &ldquo;Minister, we do not think your Bill goes far enough but at least it is a step forward.  You should now get on with implementing it and in 12 months' time when we see what you have done we will be in a position to ask you questions.&rdquo;  In my view that would be a sensible attitude for those who are so sincere and committed in their opposition to smoking. Deputy Browne asked for some sort of timetable, but I should like him to view the situation in this way: television and radio advertising are gone; cinema and outdoor advertising are going, and the next step will be in relation to all the remaining body of omnibus advertising, but that is being controlled and regulated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Omnibus advertising has gone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was using the word in its classical meaning and not in the corrupt sense.  I am not surprised that Deputy Boland goes for the corrupt interpretation of the word rather than for the pure interpretation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As television and radio advertising is gone our next step is in relation to cinema and outdoor advertising. I disagree with Deputy Browne in relation to outdoor advertising because in my view such advertising is very invasive, it is very compelling.  The ordinary man in the street cannot get away from it.  It pervades our environment. Deputy O'Connell made an important point in relation to this question of outdoor advertising, because we have to support the person who is trying to give up cigarettes or the person who has already given them up and is trying to stay off them.  That is where outdoor advertising is very relevant.  Outdoor advertising, because of its pervasive presence, is important for the person who is trying to give up smoking or, having given it up, is trying to stay off it.  I award a very high priority to getting rid of outdoor advertising, and my view one that was confirmed by the approach of the tobacco companies.  They spent a lot of money on outdoor advertising which in some ways is just as persuasive, if not more so&mdash;it is more seductive and certainly more invasive&mdash;than newspaper advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of the Minister for Finance and his interest in this matter. In the Government we have collective responsibility and we do not, as a rule, give any indication of what any individual Minister thinks about a particular issue.  We try to give a Government view, but I must say in this context that the Minister for Finance in regard to this legislation from the beginning adopted a most enlightened attitude.  He did not adopt a departmental stance, as he might have done.  As Deputy Browne said, he could have been forgiven had he done so.  The Minister indicated to me and my colleagues that while there were certainly finance implications in this legislation as far as he was concerned he was not prepared to let any financial <Col N="404" /> consideration interfere with a health matter.  As far as this legislation is concerned there is no opposition to it from the Minister for Finance or his Department. I give the Minister credit for that. From his point of view it is only common sense, because in the long run the Minister for Finance would gain more out of this campaign against smoking than anybody else.  I have already indicated that smoking, apart from the human hardship, distress and suffering it causes, is also a serious impediment to our economic progress, our economic wellbeing and development.  It also contributes enormously to the cost of our health service.  Looking to the long term, the Minister for Finance is wise in agreeing to and supporting this legislation.</P>
    <P>This legislation, with the phraseology used in the different sections, particularly section 2, gives me all the power and the authority I need to do what I wish in regard to the regulation, control and prohibition of advertising and sponsorship. Deputies can as the months go on criticise me for the manner in which I avail of those powers and the speed or otherwise with which I implement the measures, but the Bill ensures that I am able to control and regulate and, in certain instances, to eliminate certain forms of promotion of the sale of tobacco products.  On the question of timing I should like to state that the Bill will be passed this month, hopefully, and the regulations will be made immediately thereafter.  Cinema and outdoor advertising will go and the budget spent by the tobacco companies will be limited.  The volume and content and the type of general advertising will be regulated and controlled, as will sponsorship.  That is the programme of implementation which I propose to follow.  That programme will be followed diligently, and it will be open to any Member to ask me within a few months what progress has been made and to what extent are the powers in the legislation being used to see that the situation is brought under firm control. They will be in a position to see that the pressure of advertising on the individual is lessened until it disappears altogether.  I ask Deputies to say to me: &ldquo;Here is your legislation; we are giving it to you, but if we were bringing it in <Col N="405" /> ourselves we would introduce it in a much more draconian form.  However, such as it is it is welcome so you can take it away and get on with the job of implementing the terms of it.  We will look at the situation again in six or 12 months time to see how you got on&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>An American visitor to this House listening to this debate might be inclined to wonder what this was all about, but what might not be apparent to the American visitor to Dáil Éireann is that there was no consultation with the Opposition prior to the introduction of the Bill.  We were presented with a <i>fait accompli</i>; we have no say in it.  No attempt whatsoever is being made to oppose the Minister on this.  After years of badgering Ministers for Health on this issue we are presented with a Bill but we are not consulted beforehand; rather a parliamentary draftsman sits down and prepares a Bill.  It is then our job to do what we can because the opportunity will not arise again.  We can put down parliamentary questions by the hundred.  The sum total of the answers elicited is that, in a very rapid, fiery session the Minister says: we are doing all we can.  It is not right for the Minister to say we are trying to oppose him.  We are endeavouring to say to him: &ldquo;Yes, you have something there&rdquo;.  A unique opportunity is afforded us now. Does the Minister honestly think there will be another Bill presented to the House in a year, or, say, two years?</P>

      <P>There was a multiplicity of defects in the 1952 Social Welfare Act.  I have endeavoured, in vain, over the years to have them rectified. One is constantly tabling parliamentary questions with the inevitable response: it is in the 1952 Act. This is a unique opportunity and we would be failing in our duty as legislators if we could not tease out a whole Bill.  We cannot merely say to the Minister: &ldquo;That is a good Bill&rdquo;.  That would be wrong.  If the Minister's sensitivities are disturbed by our saying: &ldquo;it is window-dressing&rdquo;, so be it.  Our job is <Col N="406" /> to endeavour to get as much as possible from the Minister in the time at our disposal. That is the whole purpose of this legislative chamber.  What we are saying is that giving the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> power means that this Bill could be passed as a window-dressing exercise.  But then, when it comes to the regulations what happens?</P>
      <P>I might mention to the Minister that there is something called proposition five, the result of which should be known today in California, the object of which is to prohibit smoking in all public places.  Is the Minister aware that tobacco companies in California alone spent one million dollars in combating that? They are lobbying there on a fantastic scale in that respect.</P>

      <P>I want to get that point about the US visitor across because he would ask why do we even have to spend this time trying to persuade the Minister; surely he knows it is wrong; surely in his heart and soul he knows what is in this Bill and why can he not produce the necessary amendment?  Of course, we can criticise <i>ad infinitum</i> but we do not achieve anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that there is at present another kind of campaign being carried on by tobacco companies, that is, to engage people in large stores and supermarkets in the handing out of free samples to shoppers, saying: you might like to try these cigarettes.  This is being <Col N="407" /> done on a massive scale in Dublin at present.  Obviously the Minister did not know it.  Is that advertising; is it promoting; is it merely saying to people: &ldquo;You can have that now&rdquo;?  We want to know because those tobacco companies, with all the funds at their disposal, will think up other measures to outwit us on this Bill.  We must examine what we can do to stop these new, subtle promotional methods.  We are up against these giants.</P>
    <P>Radio and television advertising has gone; cinema advertising is going now; outdoor advertising is going.  Could the Minister tell us what other form of advertising have the research section of his Department established must go?  I presume it would be newspaper and magazine advertising only.</P>

Perhaps the Minister would let us know&mdash;with the power vested in him under this Bill&mdash;when he anticipates total advertising will cease.  He may say that it will take longer than had been anticipated; perhaps the advertising industry itself must seek some other form of income or revenue.  I realise the Minister's problems and that one cannot suddenly throw people on to the breadline.  If we could have an assurance from the Minister that he will see to it that this will be done within a specified time then I would be more than happy.</P>

      <P>This is particularly interesting information.  It leaves us then simply with the employment counter-productive element, doing it slowly, as the main argument against doing what we want to do.  Would that be correct? Are we then just simply to look at this problem as one which would worry all of us&mdash;the employment content?  What would that amount to?  How many people would be out of work?  Is there any means by which they could be deployed in any other way?  Does that constitute the major difficulty now remaining?  The other question&mdash;the speed with which it is done&mdash;is dismissed by the fact that the Minister has not taken any such attitude in relation to outdoor advertising which he says is particularly influential, that he has more or less stopped this; he says he is going to stop it immediately. He says he is not concerned with the employment content of that: is there one?  He does not feel it will be counter-productive; will it be?  and he is not worried about the speed with which he does it.  Why do these factors operate in relation to newspaper advertising and sponsorship and not operate in relation to outdoor, poster advertising and in cinemas?  What is so special about one, rendering it different from the other? Perhaps the Minister could tell us that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of revenue, this is <Col N="409" /> particularly interesting information because, if it is true, it means that the Minister is being rather arbitrary in his refusal to act.  He appeared irresponsible as Minister for Health in declining to act, if the Minister for Finance is giving him this authority.  His attitude seems to be not to bother about the money, that the finance will be found elsewhere.  All that is delaying the Minister now apparently is a few hundred jobs, and he has the idea that this is counter-productive&mdash;I do not know how the validity of that could be established&mdash;and he wants to do it slowly rather than quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is applicable to newspaper advertising why is it not applicable to cinemas and outdoor advertising? I suggest that it be banned in all of them, but the Minister is inconsistent in saying that he has this feeling that it would be a nice way to do it not too quickly.  He has this curious idea about it being counter-productive.  I do not know what that means.  People see an advertisement in a paper on one day and they never see it again.  Nobody has complained about the absence of television advertising and nobody will complain about the absence of outdoor or cinema advertising.  The Minister cannot expect us to accept as a serious argument that there is any likelihood of a counter-productive reaction to the sudden stopping of newspaper advertising.  &ldquo;Wisely&rdquo; obviously would apply in relation to the other two media as well.  Therefore that does not stand up.  We have the assurance that money is no object and finance will be found otherwise, therefore, the Minister for Finance is not to blame.  So we are going to have these powerful influences of sponsorship and advertising which are effectively the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> A record of happenings such as sickness and deaths has been created as a result of this concerted campaign to sell cigarettes.  The Minister is now in the position where apparently, by simply substituting one word for another, he can get rid of this pernicious influence which is promoting the horrific, horrendous recitation of ills which he says cigarette smoking causes.  The Minister for Health is making this personal decision as Minister for Health.  It is contradictory, irrational and completely illogical that a Minister would sit there and do this.  Either he is being completely irresponsible as a health Minister or he is not giving us the full facts.  He is protecting somebody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Whichever the Deputy likes.  That is his own interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is a very serious situation.  The Minister is not disclosing the full facts or else he is an extraordinary Minister for Health.  He has told us that he knows that this advertising process, both in sponsorship and otherwise, is extremely powerful and that outdoor advertising is extremely provocative or influential.  Therefore, he obviously must accept that any kind of advertising is influential.  Newspaper advertising, in so far as it is there every day in the home, in my view is much more influential than outdoor poster advertising, otherwise tobacco companies would not spend the kind of money which I think the Minister is going to tell us about on newspaper advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is going to permit this to go on even though he has produced no case.  The case he could have produced&mdash;I would not accept it but it could make sense to many people&mdash;is that we cannot afford to drop up to £60 million; we cannot afford to drop that kind of revenue in one year, therefore we must phase it out over a period of two, three or four years.  We cannot tolerate inroads on that kind of an income overnight. In his responsibility as a Minister he has persuaded the Minister for Finance to allow him to do this over a period of years.  The Minister has very <Col N="411" /> carefully not replied to the question that we asked him: what is the time scale projection for the phasing out of advertising and sponsorship?  He gave a very brisk imitation of somebody who is going to do something about the problem by saying, &ldquo;You pass the Bill and regulations will be made immediately&rdquo;.  Then he linked that simply to posters and cinemas.  He became very vague about all other forms of advertising, including sponsorship and newspaper advertising.</P>
    <P>This is the nub of our difficulty with the Minister.  He is being less than frank in this and he is leaving the impression now that he is concerned about the employment of a few hundred people. He might be good enough to tell us now how many people are employed in the tobacco industry.  I do not know, but I am sure it is no more than a few hundred or perhaps a few thousand.  Each year two thousand people are dying and thousands are finding their way into hospitals and into general practitioners' consulting rooms and are being disabled.  Therefore, it is very difficult for anybody to put limited employment in the scales of priorities.  I must dismiss the &ldquo;counter-productive&rdquo; and &ldquo;wisely&rdquo; arguments because they do not stand up, therefore we are left with employment, the one big argument which the Minister has removed.  So it is a personal whim of this Minister who purports to be particularly conscientious in his wish to bring positive health attitudes and to reduce illness, disability and avoidable deaths. Through his various PROs and people who promote his image as that of a really aggressively radical Minister he has given us the idea that this is the kind of action he would take if given the power.</P>
    <P>We want to give him the power and he will not take it.  The Minister for Finance apparently has given him authority by implying &ldquo;Do not bother about me.  The money is there, take it&rdquo;.  We are giving him the opportunity of banning the advertising and sponsorship at once and the Minister is the only really reactionary Member of the House.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the regulations contain a notice concerning the injurious properties of a tobacco product. Subsection (2) sets out the types of regulations that can be made and paragraph (e) of that subsection suggests there could be a requirement that the advertisements carry a notice of the injurious properties of a tobacco product. The &ldquo;may&rdquo; contained in the preamble to subsection (2) and the &ldquo;may&rdquo; in subsection (2) (e) are a double discretion.  In view of the discretionary power in the first sentence of subsection (2), the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be used if paragraph (e) is to have real meaning.</P>

    <P>This amendment relates to the same point.  Deputies will see that the wording of subsection (2) (e) is: &ldquo;indicating that the tobacco product can be injurious to the health of a person using it&rdquo;.  That is nothing more than a reiteration of the situation as it is at present.  The present warning indicates that the smoking of cigarettes may be injurious to health. <Col N="414" /> We want to be more positive, and we are changing the wording to &ldquo;indicating the risk to the health of persons associated with the use of the product&rdquo;.  That will enable us to specify precisely what smoking does as distinct from what it may do.  Amendment No. 9a is cognate and substitutes the same words in subsection (2) (f).  Amendments Nos. 8a and 9a would have the same effect.</P>

I can state firmly without fear of being challenged that medically it has been established that cigarette smoking is a danger to health, but in the case of other tobacco products to which we may also be applying these regulations it has not yet been firmly established that they are a danger to health.

    <P>I referred to his matter on Second Stage. The Minister outlined the reason why he wanted to get this type of information and I suggested that this paragraph gave him wider powers to examine the affairs of companies than might reasonably be warranted for a Minister for Health in pursuance of the objectives of this legislation.  I pointed out that in the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, section 15, there is power for the examiner to enter premises to seek information in his investigation of possible restrictive practices. The wording used on that occasion <Col N="417" /> was that the officer should be given such information as he may reasonably require. I thought it would be fairer and better in this legislation if the provision was that the information sought would be that which the Minister might reasonably require in order to ensure that the intent of this legislation would be implemented.  I said on Second Stage that, in regard to many aspects of this legislation, the Minister will have to be careful to ensure that he will not give an opportunity to any bodies affected by the legislation to have recourse to the courts in order to have their points of view vindicated.  Therefore I felt it would be better if this type of wording were used rather than the phrase in the Bill as published.</P>

In putting down this question I was not impugning the professional motives of Frank Dunlop.  He does a job but he carries out the guidelines set out by the Taoiseach.

As far as I know, it appears that an important speech I made that day was reported verbally without what I believe RTE describe as &ldquo;actuality&rdquo;.  I understand this is a picture of the person during the course of making the speech. I believe that on the same night a picture of a Minister of another regime appeared making what apparently occurred to Mr. Dunlop was a less important speech and that Minister received the actuality treatment which I did not receive.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that my function in relation to the diseases mentioned extends only to their incidence in bovine animals.</P>
      <P>I am advised that in the case of tuberculosis and brucellosis, humans may risk infection from contact with diseased animals through handling infective material, drinking contaminated milk or even through inhalation.  There is no evidence that leucosis is transmissible to humans.</P>

      <P>I have two questions. First, in view of the fact that leucosis is a new disease to this country, will the Minister state if any research is being carried out as to its communicability to humans?  Second, is there any established guaranteed procedure whereby outbreaks of brucellosis or tuberculosis are automatically referred to the health authorities by officers of his Department to whose notice they come?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last number of months a small number of reactor cattle in leucosis tests have been identified.  I do not believe that any worthwhile research into the effect of leucosis could be attempted in a comparatively free herd such as ours, but all efforts are being made to determine where the leucosis is and to remove the reactors in the usual way.  I cannot tell the Deputy what research, if any, has been done on the continent about the transmissibility of leucosis but if the Deputy wants this information he could put down a question.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give more information as to the precise method whereby these outbreaks are communicated?  The Minister is aware that there is a high incidence of brucellosis in humans and that there has been some increase in tuberculosis which may be due to bovine causes.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The underlying trend since we joined the Community shows an expansion in the numbers of cattle being slaughtered at export premises, coupled with a decline in live exports. This trend is to be welcomed, particularly in view of the employment provided at meat factories, and it is my aim to encourage it in so far as this is possible under Community regulations.  It will be appreciated, however, that the continuance of some exports of live cattle helps to maintain balance and competition in the industry and thus ensures better returns to producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible to say how much is saved and how much is lost by killing an individual beast here or exporting it on the hoof?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>What must be borne in mind here is that a considerable number of cattle of a kind which would not be suitable for slaughter here&mdash;cattle of the third or fourth quality&mdash;are exported. We want to build a reputation for first quality prime meat of all descriptions.  In that respect a modicum of live exports is <Col N="427" /> tolerable.  Since the Deputy did not ask for it I cannot give him a detailed breakdown of just how much net loss to the country there is in the export of a live beast.  If he wants that information I would be glad to get it for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>While, as the Minister said, that trend is welcome, surely he is aware that our farmers want competition, free trade to sell their cattle either on the hoof or to the marts?  Is he further aware that the farmers do not want a monopoly?  Unfortunately when the meat factories had a monopoly in 1974 they fleeced the farmers and in some cases gave them a price as low as 6p per pound for beef.  The Minister must be aware that the best thing to do would be to encourage the production of more cattle to kill in the factories and at the same time to supply the demand to England for store cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I adverted to the need for a balance in the export of live and slaughtered cattle.  I am also aware of the possibility of a monopoly situation growing.  There are two important considerations to be balanced and the Deputy would be well advised to bear them in mind.  One very important point is the employment content available in the slaughter of meat rather than its live export and the full processing of slaughtered cattle.  At the moment we are only partly processing cattle.  We recently removed obstacles to the further processing of cattle that have existed for some years and militated against further processing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That I will try to do.  I would ask the Minister whether our meat factories are suffering from any financial or other inhibitions which leave them less competitive and not able to pay higher prices either because of financial <Col N="428" /> inducements in the Six Counties or in Britain or because of any operations of the EEC?  Are there any such obstacles preventing better prices in our factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two.  One is our remoteness from the central marketing area, and we can do nothing about that.  The other is the quality of our cattle, and we can do a great deal about that.  That is not to say that the quality of our cattle is not on the whole reasonably good, but it could be a great deal better.  On the matter of trade between the North and ourselves, while the employment premium in the North may have compensated to some extent the farmers there and kept the Northern meat factories in business, it merely compensated for the far more advantageous price we get here for our cattle.</P>

      <P>Directive 159, on which the farm modernisation scheme is based, is currently under review in the Community institutions.

      <P>No, it has not been formally abandoned.  In the matter of the proposed changes to be made in the farm modernisation scheme, it is necessary to have regard to the context, and the context is the proposals made not only by ourselves but by the other eight countries.  We are looking for greater flexibility in regard to comparable income and the extension of the development category to include any farmer who is prepared to follow a plan for the expansion of his enterprise.  I do not see any condition in those terms that will exclude the conditions to which we alluded in the manifesto.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if his attention has been drawn to the finding of the Farm Management Survey for 1977 which shows that, while farmers in Munster and Leinster had an average increase in family farm income last year of 44 per cent, farmers in Connacht had an increase in average income of less than 1 per cent, while the average income for farmers in the Ulster counties of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan actually fell by 16 per cent below the 1976 level; and if, in view of these alarming findings, he has made any recommendations for a drastic change in Government policy in regard to agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The data to which the Deputy refers are based on a rather limited sample of full-time farmers in the farm management survey.  To get a balanced picture of the situation, it is necessary to look at the trends over a reasonable period of time.  Thus, the figures given for 1977 should be related to the trends in previous years covered by the sample of farms.  These trends show that between 1972 and 1976 incomes in the three counties of Ulster increased by 246 per cent and in Connacht by 161 per cent against increases of 118 per cent for Munster and 99 per cent for Leinster.  Thus, the farmers in the western counties have shared fully in <Col N="434" /> the growth in prosperity of Irish agriculture over recent years.</P>
      <P>As already announced, the Government intend to introduce shortly a scheme for accelerating drainage in the western counties and discussions have been taking place in Brussels on the formulation by the Commission of a package of measures aimed at improving the structural position of agriculture in the west of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that the Minister is satisfied with these figures as adduced for 1977, figures which may undoubtedly have come from a rather small sample?  Are they in fact an exaggeration of the situation?  Do they give a false picture of the situation and are we not to take any cognisance really of these figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to have regard, first of all, to the fact that the percentages we are talking about are always based on the percentages for the previous years.  It would be worth the House's while to have regard to the fact that in 1973 there was an increase of 58.9 per cent.  In the following year, 1974, there was a drop of 31.7 per cent. In the year after that, 1975, there was an increase of 84.8 per cent and in 1976 there was an increase of 72.5 per cent. Last year there was a drop of 15.7 per cent.  Taking the five years as a whole you have an increase of 245.8 per cent and, if you want to take an immediately pessimistic view, there is a drop from the very large increase of the previous years but that is not to say there is an overall drop.  That would be equally incorrect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of figures which point in a similar direction quoted in the National Economic and Social Council report indicating that over the period 1968-69 to 1972-73 there was a wide discrepancy in the rate of growth of output per adjusted acre in the western counties <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the country in both income and production and would the Minister not agree that there is a need for, and this is something we all hope he will get, considerably increased EEC aid and Irish Government aid for agriculture in the western areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it, despite what the Minister has said, which would appear to counter to a degree the findings of the 1977 report mentioned in the question, that he will accept the report and work on the basis that in Connacht and Ulster, even with this 240 per cent which he as ascribed to the Ulster counties and an increase of 161 per cent in the Connacht counties, these percentage increases have been from a very low base and so do not give a true picture?  Even disagreeing with the 1977 figures, which the Minister appears to do, is it not a fact that we are starting with such a low base in the western counties as a whole that working on these figures would result in a totally false picture?</P>

      <P>Regulations on grading and quality standards for maincrop ware potatoes sold on the home market were introduced on 16 January 1978.  The sizing provisions in those regulations did not operate until 17 July and were altered by regulations announced on 10 October.

Things are just going on as they were.  In respect of Question No. 12, has the Minister any information that would clearly indicate misleading information being given on the bags, which would appear to conform with the regulations the Minister has been talking about but which is totally false?

It will be obliged to be without State interference. <Col N="439" /> In the same way as Bord Bainne had to become co-operative, I would expect that any proposed national potato marketing board would have to be on similar lines.  There are other problems that are difficult of solution and will have to be solved in one way or another such as possibly providing a stabilising fund to tide people over periods of very sharp drops or rises in order to ensure a price that is acceptable to consumers and producers at all times.</P>

      <P>The main course at Mellowes Agricultural College, Athenry, which lasts a full year covers general agriculture and has been developed to suit prospective farmers in all areas, including the Connemara Gaeltacht.  A specialised course in pig husbandry and management is also conducted at the college.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If a young Connemara man goes to Athenry is it possible for him to get lectures and instruction through Irish?  I have been given to understand that a particular young Connemara man, a very competent farmer who learned his skills on his father's well run farm, was told that he would need at least 50 acres and would have to have a tractor if he was to get any benefit out of the course in the Athenry college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to say whether it is possible for Gaeltacht young men or women to receive instruction in Irish, because the question does not relate to that.  I would be glad to find out myself.  I must confess I do not know.  As to whether on 50 acres a tractor is a necessity or not I cannot say.  I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of the local advisers' word.  It seems that on any kind of reasonable land a tractor might be justifiable on such acreage. That is my opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the exchanges with various Deputies on the matter of uneconomic holdings in Connemara and the low living standards of people there and the rather scandalous admission by the Minister that this situation has existed unchanged for some years, surely some positive action should be taken of a special kind applicable to the difficult business of trying to make a living out of the kind of holdings people have there due to geographical and other physical difficulties?  There must be a special approach to the problem rather than having places like Athenry where they tend to concentrate on the big farm and where the young Connemara farmer <Col N="441" /> is unpopular and is not wanted because their activities are not directed towards the skills he would need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have thought that for small farm areas in the West of Ireland generally the two main lines that suggest themselves most in farm development are milk production and pig production.  In Athenry there is an excellent course in pig husbandry.  Even on very small acreages a pig project is a viable proposition, properly run and supervised.  I acknowledge the Deputy's assertion that in these very small acreages, very often of poor quality, the problems are rather specialised.  In saying that I think the special attention paid by Athenry to pig husbandry is aimed straight at areas such as Connemara.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While not in any way disputing the excellence of the tuition afforded not only in Athenry but in other agricultural colleges, is it not a fact that far too few of the places available in all these colleges go to students who return to the farms?  In fact is it not the situation that they are largely training schools for the Department of Agriculture up to now&mdash;in other words too few are going back to the land rather than that there is any fault in the actual education students receive there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says is, on the whole, true in both respects, that students tend to go into the Department of Agriculture employment.  In recent years the numbers are tending to go up but there remains a problem&mdash;not enough go back to the farms.</P>

Could he make it more attractive for young men committed to returning to farmers to get training in these colleges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is becoming more attractive. Where the acreage is at all adequate the rewards in farming have been <Col N="442" /> better for the last three or four years than they had been hitherto.  Deputy Blaney poses the problem of graduates of such schools tending to go out of agriculture; that was due to necessity. The rewards in a small farm anyway would not be as good as those of a Department job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>While the number of creamery milk suppliers fell during the period mentioned, total cow numbers have increased significantly and total deliveries of milk to creameries have increased by about 60 per cent.  In 1977 deliveries in fact increased by as much as 9 per cent.  The estimated increase this year is about 14 per cent.  These increases show clearly that farmers generally are aware of the profitability of milk production at current prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the almost contradictory situation that prompts me to put down this Question and to ask this supplementary question about fewer milk producers providing much more milk. Does this not indicate that there has been a complete failure to utilise the improving and increasingly remunerative milk market and its products, which the EEC have brought about, to the benefit and expansion of small creamery milk suppliers?  Instead we are making the big ones bigger and wiping out the small ones.  This is a tragedy.  The drop in numbers is drastic and yet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We had a brief discussion on amendment No. 11, the purpose of which is to delete from section (2) (g) the words &ldquo;considers necessary&rdquo;.  This relates to information which he might require. I suggested that the wording used by the draftsman in other parts of legislation, &ldquo;may reasonably require&rdquo;, would be more appropriate.  In reply the Minister said the reason he considered it better wording was that in the event of a tobacco firm disputing the information they should give, the phrase &ldquo;considers necessary&rdquo; would give him more power than the phrase &ldquo;may reasonably require&rdquo;. That is the very aspect which I pointed out in support of the amendment. If there is a dispute as to whether the Minister is over-stepping what a Minister for Health could legitimately seek by way of information on the operation of tobacco firms, the wording &ldquo;may reasonably require&rdquo; would strengthen the Minister's hand if the dispute were to find its way into the courts. I have no reason or desire, to hold up the business of the House and I would ask the Minister to consider whether he would be safeguarding himself more by using the wording which has been tried in legislation and which apparently works.  I refer particularly to section 15 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  the prohibition, control or regulation of the sale of tobacco products at prices which are so much lower than those at which tobacco products of a similar type or character are at the material time being sold that the sale at the lower prices constitutes in the opinion of the Minister a sales promotion device,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Since the Bill was framed and introduced my intention has been directed to a situation which could arise and which it is as well to deal with, that is, the practice of tobacco companies in launching new products to offer them at a discount price; in other words, at a price well below what they would normally charge. This is the same as any other mechanic of promotion.  It is the same as advertising. It is another device whereby a tobacco company promotes the sale of its products.  My amendment is intended to deal with that situation.  It would prevent the sale of a particular brand of cigarettes at a price which is clearly below its normal market value, a price which amounts to a sales promotion device.  At this stage I want to amend my amendment.  I am doing so to keep it in line with the adoption of amendments Nos. 12 and 14.  Deputies will notice that my amendment, as it is presently phrased, reads, &ldquo;the prohibition, control or regulation of the sale of tobacco products&rdquo;.  As in the other case, no circumstances would arise in which we would control or regulate this device.  All we would do is prohibit it.  I want to take out the words &ldquo;control or regulate&rdquo; plus the comma.  Therefore the amendment will read:</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 3, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;<Col N="472" />&ldquo;() the prohibition of entering into a contract to broadcast any kind of advertising of tobacco products by any person engaged in broadcasting by means of wireless telegraphy, television or similar broadcasting media, whether or otherwise such broadcasts are made in accordance with the Wireless Telegraphy Acts,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this is to endeavour to achieve two things.  The advertising of tobacco products is not prohibited by statute, contrary to what might be inferred by contributions this morning.  By agreement such advertising has been prohibited by the RTE Authority.  It seems strange to have in legislation the headings under which a number of regulations can be made but not to refer to the broadcasting medium simply because the RTE Authority by agreement had decided not to allow tobacco advertising.  It is something they themselves do not allow under the heading of unacceptable products or services in the same way as they will not allow advertising of smoking cures, an interesting feature in the light of the Minister's exhortation.</P>
    <P>There are two things that can happen. First, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility, with the technological advances taking place, that in a relatively short time an independent television authority may be licensed to broadcast in the future, but there is not any proposal in the Bill to suggest that such an authority would not be allowed to carry advertising for cigarettes, and the entire debate might have to be re-opened.  In addition, we all know there are many organisations, known as pirate radios, who are broadcasting and there does not appear to be anything to stop them advertising cigarettes because the State appears to be unable to move to prevent them broadcasting.  However, since I tabled this amendment the appropriate Minister has indicated that it is his intention to move against illegal broadcasters.  The effect of this amendment would be that in the event of any independent authority being licensed to run a television system the Minister would have power to make regulations to prohibit such a station from carrying tobacco advertising.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() Prior to the making of regulations under this section the Minister shall have consultations with such persons as appear to him to be substantially interested in the general subject matter of the regulations.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister was introducing the Bill he stated it was his intention to have <Col N="474" /> discussions with the different people who might be affected in various ways by the making of these regulations.  From listening to the debate I am inclined to think that only angels and those opposite to them appear to be involved in this. Although the measure is obviously worth while, it must be accepted that it has to be done in an orderly fashion, to use the Minister's expression.  The regulations to be made would be strengthened, I would have thought, by the Minister having discussions not only with the tobacco interests but also with the bodies who have been receiving sponsorships.  It does not appear from the Bill as if there is any obligation placed on the Minister to hold such consultations.</P>
    <P>In an earlier contribution I referred to the Merchandise Marts Act under which the Minister in question, when he intends to make an order in relation to advertising, must publish a note in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of his intention to make a regulation two months before making it.</P>
    <P>I thought that was excessive but in section 2 of the Merchandise Marks Act he provided that prior to the making of an order the Minister would have &ldquo;consultation with such persons as appeared to him to be substantially interested in the general subject matter of the order&rdquo;. I thought we might look at the suggestion that the Minister should have the same provision written into section 2 (2) of this Bill which would mean that he would have consultations with the interests who will be affected.</P>
    <P>I referred already to the possibility that if this Bill is not as watertight and effective as it might be, action could be taken by the interests involved in an effort to negate the Minister's intent.  I thought that if he were obliged to have consultations with those interests before he made the regulations, which would then be published and available to us all, there might be a better opportunity to have the regulations administered effectively without their being challenged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the kind of amendment I would like to accept but unfortunately the exigencies of the situation are such that I could not possibly do so.  I have given an undertaking to consult <Col N="475" /> and I am afraid the various interests concerned will have to be satisfied with that.  I could not attempt to bind a successor in office on a matter like this.  It just happens that my approach to this matter is that I believe consultation would be desirable and I propose to do that but that is a long way from making it statutory on the Minister to have consultations. The Deputy's amendment is very widely framed in that he suggests that consultations be mandatory with such persons as appear to him to be substantially interested in the general subject matter.  That would open up an enormous field.  Whatever about the desirability of consulting with the commercial interests and perhaps the trade union representing the workers involved and a few limited areas of that nature, I do not think we could possibly undertake to consult all those who might have an interest.  That could include the medical profession and a variety of bodies who would claim, with some legitimacy, to have an interest.</P>
      <P>While I have undertaken to consult as far as possible, and I will adhere to that undertaking, I ask the Deputy not to press this amendment and not to put what could turn out to be a very onerous obligation on a Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that the same reason why the Minister would find the provision inoperable should apply equally to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy operating the Merchandise Marks Act in relation to his making an order regarding the way goods are to be marked as to their contents and the weight of the contents.  In the same way as this Minister considers there might be a wide variety of people with whom he would have to consult in relation to the regulations, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy equally could say that he would have to consult with a wide variety of interests, including trade unions, packers, markers, retailers, wholesalers and so on.  Apparently he did not object because he put more strictures on himself than even I had suggested. He put on himself the obligation <Col N="476" /> of publishing a notice of his intention to make an order two months beforehand. From that point of view I do not think there would be an undue obligation on the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>I am intrigued to hear the Minister express concern for his successor.  Usually it is the other way around&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has tried about everything else.  I would not be surprised if the Minister tried to succeed or to exceed himself.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to an aspect which I omitted to mention when I moved the amendment in relation to sponsorship.  The Minister reminded me of it when he referred to his successor. The example always given to the House at a time like this is that the successor may not turn out to be as reasonable a man as the Minister of the day.  We can all decide then the degree of reasonableness of the successor in relation to the reasonableness of the occupant of the office.  The suggestion might be made that somebody would prohibit completely the sponsorship of a major event that was at an advanced stage of preparation and that he might do so two or three weeks before the event in question. Quite obviously this would cause extreme difficulties, if not the cancellation of the entire event.  For that reason I should have thought the Minister would see the validity in the suggestion that he or his successor would have consultations with those interests.  They would have the opportunity to point out to this unreasonable successor that it would not be feasible to cancel sponsorship at short notice where the event in question had been advertised and where much of the preparatory work had been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the time we are assuming that the entire approach will be realistic.  I have no reason to suspect otherwise but there is the distinct possibility that at a later stage someone may not be realistic. There is even the possibility that if the present Minister became irate and unreasonable if things were not going his way on a broad ministerial or political front, that because of pressure he might <Col N="477" /> decide to make regulations in relation to sponsorship under this section which would not allow those involved to seek an alternative sponsor or to make arrangements about the event in question. From that point of view I should have thought it reasonable to suggest that the Minister should have consultations with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If this hallowed office is ever inherited by such an unreasonable person who would indulge in such capricious behaviour, I do not think the fact of compelling him to have mandatory consultations would be to any avail.  The only thing we can rely on there is the normal democratic process.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that if the kind of situation described by Deputy Boland were to arise and the people concerned considered themselves hard done by, they would have the normal political avenues open to them to make their voices heard.  The mere provision here of mandatory consultations would not help their cause in any way because if the Minister acted arbitrarily or capriciously in regard to making the regulations he would not give any great heed to the consultative process.  There is always the fall back safeguard in this legislation, that is, that any regulation made in this House can be upset. Regulations must be laid on the table in the normal way and an opportunity is provided for the House to consider them and if it wishes to reject them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;() Regulations made under this section for the prohibition of or control and regulation of, or restriction of expenditure on, advertising of tobacco products (or of the name or names of a brand or brands of tobacco <Col N="478" /> products) shall apply equally to all advertisements appearing in printed newspapers, periodicals, journals or similar publications circulating within the State, whether or not such publications have been published within the State and, in any case in which advertising of a name of tobacco product (or name or names of a brand or brands of tobacco products) appears in publications published outside, but circulating within the State, similar to a name or names of tobacco products or brands of tobacco products on offer for sale within the State the regulations shall apply as if such advertisements were advertising the tobacco product (or brand of tobacco product) on offer for sale within the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is rather long and of necessity tortuous.  The reason is that I am making an effort to deal with this question of over-spill advertising.  There are three main firms in the tobacco industry in this country producing different brands of cigarettes.  One is a native Irish firm and the others are offshoots of multinational firms.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to introduce legislation to control, limit or set a percentage of this year's advertising budget which they will be allowed to spend advertising in publications.  That sounds reasonable and fair if the three firms are allowed to compete fairly and have their advertising budgets restricted in the same percentage.  Because two of these firms are offshoots of multinational organisations they have the very real benefit of what is known as over-spill advertising, that is, the same brand of cigarettes and tobacco products manufactured here are also manufactured in Britain and other countries.  There is a wide variety of publications, newspapers, periodicals and journals coming into this country either directly on sale here through retail outlets or being circulated to subscribers to those journals which are sent through the post. Consequently the two non-Irish firms have the benefit of enormous over-spill advertising which helps in the marketing of their products.  The Irish firm does not <Col N="479" /> advertise in the British printed media and consequently cannot benefit from that over-spill.</P>
    <P>If we were to tell the three firms that they must only advertise to 80 per cent or 100 per cent of last year's advertising budget that would be fair as regards company A trading against company B, and vice versa but if company C is not getting the benefit of the over-spill advertising in the British publications which circulate in this State they are at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I thought about this for quite some time, and I came to the conclusion that if the Minister intends to make regulations to limit the volume of advertising in the printed media for any particular tobacco product, these regulations should apply to the advertising of that product in publications circulated within this State but not printed here.  For instance, if tobacco product X is manufactured here and regulations are made to control its advertising and if a similar tobacco product X is manufactured in Britain and advertised widely in British publications which circulate here, the regulations should apply also to that advertising. The firm manufacturing here and availing of the advertising over-spill in Britain should be compelled to curtail its advertising in this country to an even greater degree in order to maintain an equitable balance between advertising the three products.  The question of fair trading is involved here.</P>
    <P>This is the first time legislation to control advertising has been introduced. Presumably these firms will accept it when it is passed, but it should not be our intention to introduce legislation which would discriminate unfairly against an Irish based firm or which would not allow it to trade on equal terms with its two main rivals operating here.  If an amendment along these lines is not incorporated in this legislation or if the Minister cannot deal with the over-spill advertising, the Irish firm will be affected and will be put at a disadvantage compared with the other firms.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he hoped the firms advertising their products in Britain would take notice of this legislation and <Col N="480" /> mend their hand accordingly because if they did not he would have to do something about it.  If advertising needs to be controlled, provision should be made in this legislation.  If it is not controlled now there is no way it can be controlled in one year's or two years' time when it is seen not to be working and we are not getting voluntary co-operation from these firms.  There is an onus on the Minister, not as Minister for Health but as a Minister in an Irish Government, to ensure that no action of his will unfairly militate against an Irish firm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my intention has been directed very specifically to this matter, which has caused a fair amount of concern and to which I have given some thought.  The first point I want to make is that this situation has always prevailed.  The firm which is mainly Irish has always had to compete so far as its two rivals are concerned with this over-spill situation.  The other two companies, without doing anything, could get the benefit of considerable advertising campaigns carried out by their parent organisations in Britain, and the locally based firm has always had to deal with that situation, and dealt with it successfully.  Nothing I am doing will change that.  The fact that these firms operating here are subsidiaries of multinational organisations is something I cannot change and is something which this legislation and these regulations will not affect.  The legislation will not make the situation any worse so far as the mainly Irish firm is concerned.  However, it is my intention very definitely to ensure that nothing we do under this legislation will in any way disadvantage either the one Irish firm in relation to its competitors in Ireland or the three Irish firms in relation to competitors outside.  I think the House will generally accept that principle to which I propose to adhere.  I propose to ensure that the enforcement of these regulations will be general and impartial and that there will be no question of anything being done by the enforcement of these regulations, whether with regard to advertising or sponsorship, which will favour one against the other.  There is certainly no question of favouring outside <Col N="481" /> multinationals against the three companies which operate here.  The regulations will be enforced in regard to all media circulating here.  The stipulations we will lay down in regard to content and so on will be equally applicable to advertising emanating inside or outside the country.</P>
      <P>There may be some problems in ensuring that this is the case, but we intend to solve those problems.  We intend to ensure that all media circulating here will obey and adhere to the regulations we lay down.  That is as far as we can go and as far as we need go.  In so far as any company operating here benefits from or is disadvantaged by a relationship with a company outside the country, the situation exists at the moment and has always prevailed and will not be affected by these regulations.</P>
      <P>It is possible that the impact and attractiveness of advertising emanating outside the country could give an unfair advantage to a particular product.  We intend to ensure that this cannot happen by a strict application of the regulations. As to any overspill by virtue of the size of the advertising budget in Britain, there is nothing I can do about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The overspill of advertising is comparatively miniscule compared to local advertising resources.  The amount of overspill here is of very minor dimensions in relation to the total advertising situation.  That fact is clearly established, and I have the facts and figures.  It is shown that the locally-based company have established a predominant position for themselves in the Irish market.  Let us not exaggerate the impact of overspill, because it is of minor dimensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite feasible for me and the Department to ensure that the regulations <Col N="484" /> we make in regard to the nature and content of advertising will be adhered to in any media circulating here. That is the extent of our obligation in the matter.  We have no obligation to enter into the machinations of multi-national companies, but we have an obligation to see that the regulations we make are adhered to.  As far as the budgets of the companies here are concerned, the amount spent on advertising will be controlled. Advertising here and in Great Britain will diverge, because our regulations will be much more strict and coercive than those in Britain and the British advertising campaigns will be disqualified here.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the objectives I have set can be reached.  There will be difficulties but they can be overcome. We will control the budgets and the quality, type, content and impact of advertising emanating inside or outside the country.  We will ensure in doing so that no unfair advantage is given to one organisation over another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very point I was making.  That is what prompted the amendment.  Speaking on Second Stage, referring to the disadvantage in which the Irish industry might be placed in relation to imported products, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I intend to ensure the Irish industry will not be placed at any disadvantage in this way.  I believe that those concerned in the UK will respect the statutory standards imposed here but, if some do not, measures will have to be taken to deal with such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed that the Minister would expect those engaged in tobacco advertising in the UK to respect statutory standards imposed here.  Is the Minister suggesting they will change their advertising or remove advertising from a variety of publications coming in here?  I do not accept that the volume of advertising is of a miniscule nature and I do not accept that allowing it to continue, whilst restricting domestic advertising, will not operate to the disadvantage of the Irish firm.  We all know that the Irish firm has a dominant place in the Irish market. <Col N="485" /> The Minister was at pains this morning to point out that it is his intention to remove all outdoor advertising completely before the end of 1979.  The Irish firm he speaks about as having a dominant place in the Irish market is also the dominant outdoor advertiser.  It is the dominant outdoor advertiser because it is trying to compensate for the effect of overspill advertising here.  Is it proposed that the Irish firm will lose its position as the dominant outdoor advertiser?  The Minister says the firm will not be disadvantaged but it will lose its dominant position and it will not have an opportunity of benefiting from overspill advertising, which is not of a miniscule nature. The Minister then tries to convince the House that if British interests do not respect statutory demands he will take steps to deal with the situtation.  What steps?  The only spin-off benefits I can see are perhaps job creation.  The Minister spoke this morning about the heavy cross he has to bear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might be able to help us on the matter of overspill advertising.  Is it not likely that the kind of legislation he says he is going to introduce, the limitation of advertising in the Press, various types of magazines and newspapers will be paralleled particularly in English speaking papers and journals?  That probably they are already very much more rigid than we are but that certainly they will come to the position in which we are now and which we hope to achieve and that in fact the problem will not arise because papers and magazines coming in will also have their advertisement restricted at the point of origin?  Has the Minister any information on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister.  He deserves sympathy.  It is very frustrating trying to bring in a Bill like this where there are limited powers. Certainly, the Minister has the best intentions in the world but his powers are very restricted.  He says: &ldquo;leave it to me; I will take care of it.&rdquo;  It is not possible to do that.  The Labour Court and Department of Social Welfare which we released yesterday as a result of transferring the stamps to the Department of Finance would, I think, now have to be absorbed into the task of checking all newspapers, magazines, periodicals, <Col N="489" /> booklets and so on that are imported. English publications have a total circulation here of almost £1,000,000 in a week.  That is a substantial sum.  Again, with the curtailment in Britain of advertising on radio and television more and more advertising is placed in newspapers and periodicals.  You have the problem that the vast bulk of advertising is being placed in newspapers, magazines and periodicals. I feel sorry for the Minister in his dilemma.  First, he says he will curtail the budgets of Irish manufacturers, and secondly he says he will protect the interests of Irish manufacturers and see that they will not be placed at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> English manufacturers. Knowing there is such a massive overspill from Britain, the only way he can do that is not to curtail the advertising budgets of the Irish manufacturers. So, we are back to square one.  I think the Minister is a little peeved that we highlight these defects in the Bill. Anyone would be; I should be twice as much frustrated if I were sitting there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Intentions cannot be incorporated by means of say-so in a Bill&mdash;&ldquo;I will take care of things.&rdquo;  There is no such clause in the Bill.  So, with the best intentions and with all the facilities and powers at his disposal, if the Minister died tonight another Minister would move in and he would not have the same good intentions.  This is not in the Bill and so the Bill is a farce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a farce unless we are able to say that our Minister should consult tomorrow with the British Minister for Health and Social Security and ask him to have a similar Bill introduced in Britain curtailing advertising.  Then we might get some semblance of rationality about the whole matter.  The Minister is trying to be <Col N="490" /> ahead of his counterparts in Britain and other countries in this matter.  His job is a very difficult one, but that does not mean he should not try.  The Minister's dilemma is that he is going to curtail Irish advertising and at the same time Irish manufacturers will be reading these debates and will see that they have a case iron case against curtailment in the light of the overspill from Britain.  I hate saying it but we are back to square one.  The Minister might consider, when he is introducing a Bill like this and where there is a situation in which our neighbours can have such an influence on our economy and advertising, that consultations should take place with the British counterpart specially in regard to English magazines and newspapers. They could undermine the whole plan in this regard.  I do not think the Minister could possibly undertake the task of curtailing them, nor would he have the power to restrict them at source.  I am honestly sorry for the Minister, and I am not saying this patronisingly.  I do not know what I should do.  I do not know how he will come up with the proper answer.  I know he is anxious to speak but it is very difficult for him and I shall now let him have his say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A fact.  A person representing an organisation vitally concerned in this matter set out in their own interest to quantify the impact of the advertising overspill in this country in relation to tobacco products.  They were unable to do so.  In my opinion this was because it is minor, miniscule, of no particular significance, and all the figures under all the different headings confirm that.  That is just one factor of the situation which we can leave aside for the moment.  I am not completely helpless in this situation.  It just struck me listening <Col N="491" /> to Deputy O'Connell that he in his personal capacity is in a position to know something about this area that I had forgotten about.  Perhaps I may be permitted to withdraw the implication that I know a great deal more about this than he does, because I realise now that in another capacity perhaps he knows all about circulation figures and so on.</P>

      <P>That was a great tragedy, but I do not think there is any point in advertising to it in this context. We have studied the situation.  We know the circulation figures and the impact they have.  I am satisfied that we will be able to deal with the situation in the way I have outlined, namely we will ensure that, in so far as our jurisdiction is concerned, our wishes in regard to content and so on will prevail and at the same time there will be no real disadvantage to any of the three tobacco companies manufacturing in this country.  It is possible to exaggerate the impact of overspill in advertising.  A lot of the magazines coming in here which to some people have a certain prominence in advertising terms do not count.  They are either weeklies or monthlies and their significance in advertising impact is negligible.  Undoubtedly it is possible for some people to be overawed and get a false impression of the influence and effect of advertising in these magazines and journals.  We are dealing here basically with a mass market, and complaints in this area to have any effect must be in the mass media.  I am reasonably satisfied that we can deal with the situation in so far as the mass media are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the mass media are concerned there are three different things.  There is the possible prohibition of advertising and the control <Col N="493" /> and regulation of the content of the advertising.  Is the Minister suggesting that he might try to control the content or copy of advertisements of tobacco products of the same name as are being marketed here in the British mass media circulating here?</P>
      <P>If he does that that will be still putting the Irish firms at a disadvantage.  The only Irish firm of the three engaged predominantly in the outdoor advertising market is going to lose the additional bonus of the spillover because outdoor advertising is to be scrapped in the next year.  The Minister has not explained why, even if he controls the content of advertising in the British mass media circulating here, there will still be a larger volume of advertising of brands of cigarettes marketed by the two other main groups to the detriment of the Irish group.  If that is the effect of what the Minister does it will be seen that he was making one firm operate at an unfair advantage over their competitors.  I do not believe that that is the Minister's intention or the intention of the House, but if that were to happen it might upset the implementation or the continuance of regulations made under this Bill in every way.  The Minister has endeavoured to indicate his belief in the way in which the people advertising in Britain might change their advertisements or that the effect of the overspill advertising is miniscule or that advertising in publications with a limited circulation here is of no consequence.  Surely we are talking about the cumulative effect of advertising such as that.  Surely all advertising has a consequence and some advertisements have more effect than others.  To suggest that advertising in certain journals with limited publication has no consequence appears to be striking at the root of the cause for introducing the Bill in the first place.  For a variety of reasons I do not accept the Minister's explanation in this matter.  I am not going to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Is it unreal for us to concern ourselves unduly about the possible survival of an industry on which we have served notice that we are going to deprive them of the right of advertising altogether and that therefore whether <Col N="494" /> they suffer from overspill is not really very important?  Eventually the Minister gives us to understand that he is going to curb all the advertising.  Can he give us the figure that he said he would give us of the money involved in advertising? What is involved in tobacco companies advertising?</P>

I gave a figure this morning of £1.25 million for outdoor advertising.  That was a bit high; it is about £1.1 million.  These are round figures.

      <P>That is the point that Deputy Browne raised.  We will be right to stop the advertising altogether.  As things are at the moment the companies could pack up, leave the country, set up in Britain and export to Ireland.  With their advertising in the English magazines they could do that.  I would hope that the Minister's persuasive powers could be used on his counterparts in Britain.  That is where the answer lies; to try to get them to do the same kind of thing, to be as progressive in legislative control and eventually phase out the entire advertising of tobacco products.  If we could establish closer liaison with them so that they could help in this matter, this is the only way to do it.  We could set a target of four years within which advertising would stop, and Britain could do the same.  They should equally be concerned about the health of the public and the detrimental effect of cigarettes and other tobacco products. All tobacco products are detrimental to health.</P>

I have been at great pains to explain that there is no question of leaving this form of advertising alone.  I propose to control, first of all, its extent and volume and, secondly, its content.  I propose to impose severe restrictions on the content, form and shape of newspaper advertising and eliminate the seductiveness, attractiveness and dramatic impact of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 39 to 45, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() Where it is proposed to make regulations under this section a draft of such regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill revolves around section 2 (3) which provides for regulations to be laid before the House.  I have always felt that draft regulations should be laid before the House, especially in cases where the Bill provides for the power to be given to <Col N="497" /> the Minister to make regulations. Recently some of my colleagues endeavoured to have a discussion on regulations.  The Government refused to make time available for a discussion or to give the House an opportunity to decide whether to annual those regulations. A draft of the proposed regulations should be laid before the House and the House would have to pass that draft.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not spell out what the Minister intends to do.  We all know that he intends to ban outdoor advertising by the end of 1979 but that is not contained in the Bill.  The first regulations to be made in this case are going to be wide-ranging and will have an effect not only on the tobacco industry but on organisations receiving sponsorship.  The regulations should be put in draft form and the House should be given an opportunity to adopt them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and I do not see any reason why the Minister should not accept it.  When a Bill gives power to make regulations I suggest they should come before the House in draft form.  Otherwise we will be losing more and more control because any Minister could keep inserting &ldquo;by regulation&rdquo; in legislation. The suggestion here would not take away from the Minister's powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this reasonable amendment.  The Minister made it clear that in giving him the Bill we will be giving him a blank cheque in regard to what he may do, and he said he can do anything.  Therefore, he should give the undertaking he has been asked for in this amendment and allow us to come back to discuss the regulations.  In the course of the debate he said he would use his good offices in this regard.  He said he will consult with numerous people, the manufacturers, the trade unions, the medical profession.  We are the people who have the right to consultation.  If he is to consult people outside the House he should consult us.  All our discussions on the Bill have been non-controversial, non-political.  They were made to help the Minister and we should have a right <Col N="498" /> to comment on the regulations, to say either they have gone too far or not far enough.  He could accept our advice or ignore it.  The Minister has brought in a Bill which he admits will give him considerable power and I do not see any reason why we should not be allowed to comment on the regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of enabling legislation followed by regulations is time honoured.  It is the way in which certain situations are dealt with by the House.  There are situations that cannot be dealt with in the legislation itself, situations which are complex and which are changing, and therefore Parliament gives the Minister the statutory power to make regulations to deal with details, and with changing circumstances in particular.</P>
      <P>This is the situation where this particularly arises.  I could have drafted a comprehensive piece of legislation which would have purported to give me specific power to ban or to control or to eliminate certain things, but we are dealing with a fluid and changing situation. We are dealing with clever people, as has been pointed out.  They are people who can summon up the best advertising brains in the country.  Surely Deputies realise that if we close some avenues to them they will discover others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies referred to certain codes and practices for advertising and how sponsorship was availed of.  We could have provided in the legislation for all the things that should be prevented, prohibited or controlled, but there is no guarantee that that would meet the situation and we would have to amend the legislation later to provide for some other eventually.  This is a situation which has presented itself to Ministers over the years and it has been dealt with satisfactorily by introducing enabling legislation during whose passage we have discussed the whole situation.  We have laid down in the legislation the constraints on the Minister and having done that the Minister has made regulations only in the context of the powers delineated in the legislation.  Even that is not the end of the matter.  It is provided further that when the regulations are made they must be brought to the House <Col N="499" /> and any Deputy who does not like them can put down a motion to resind them.</P>
    <P>I could not undertake in the context of this one piece of legislation this major departure from what has been the practice.  I have undertaken to bring in the regulations here and I want to ask the Labour Deputies in particular&mdash;this does not apply to Deputy Boland&mdash;who have criticised me all the time and who have described this legislation as being a charade, window dressing, ineffective&mdash;Deputy O'Connell called it a farce&mdash;if they want to put a further restriction on me?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that if the House were to ask me to bring draft regulations here and have them debated before they become effective, we might as well not have the legislation at all.  The purpose of bringing the legislation here is to have the debate, but if I had to bring in draft regulations and have them passed by the House it involves a whole new process of debate. The regulations can be debated, but in the meantime they will be in force.  The Deputies want quick action in this.  They will have to make up their minds, because if they want quick action they need not support Deputy Boland's amendment.  I have got time from my party and from the Whips to get this legislation through the Dáil but I do not know when I would get time to bring in regulations to the House.  I might have to wait until the next session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand Deputy Boland's point of view&mdash;he is concerned with parliamentary niceties&mdash;but the other Deputies want quick, effective action, they want implementation. If they want implementation they cannot support this amendment. There is another slight technical factor involved.  In the situation envisaged by Deputy Boland, if the House <Col N="500" /> were not sitting I could not make regulations. I could not make regulations during the summer months.  I would have to take my place in the queue and make my regulations.  It is an impossible request from the Opposition.  I should not be asked in this context to adopt something that is completely new and to depart from the well-recognised, well-established and reasonably satisfactory procedure of enabling legislation followed by regulations, which can be upset by the House if the House so wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand why the Minister should refer to the idea that regulations should appear in draft form before the House as a major parliamentary reform.  It is a device used in legislation, perhaps more so in years gone by than in recent years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was suggesting as a matter of parliamentary reform was the Opposition getting Government time to debate the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the aspect that upsets me.  If the Minister made regulations and if somebody in the House was upset because of their excessive strength I would feel happy if they had an opportunity of discussing them.  I have given the Minister the example that in the previous session one of his colleagues refused to have time made available for the discussion of regulations made by him and the House did not have the opportunity of carrying out the obligation that the statute appeared to have placed on it.  The statute appeared to presume that the House would get an opportunity to discuss the regulations and to vote on them.  However, if the Government of the day decide to use their majority and not to make time available the effect of subsection (3) and similar subsections is lost.</P>
      <P>In my amendment the draft for the regulations would be put before the House and one would assume that the Minister of the day, despite whatever exhaustion might be imposed on him because of the burden of carrying his reforming cross on his shoulders, would still have enough influence to see that they were taken at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> The Minister made a slight technical point about making regulations during the summer when the House was not in session and he said that this might present difficulty for him.  This would mean that a Minister would have to ensure that the draft regulations were made in good time in order to have them passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister made a regulation that turned out to be unfair, excessive or not effective, even if the regulation was annulled by the House subsequently the effect would be ratified by the wording of the last part of the sentence in subsection (3) in the Bill as presented by the Minister.</P>

I am not surprised that the Minister has not accepted the suggestion.  I think it is important and I do not see why he should resent it so much.  Incidentally, it was used liberally in the 1970 Health Act, and I take it that we will have an opportunity in the near future to debate draft regulations as a result of its use in one particular section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Tobacco companies shall be required to display the tar content of cigarettes prominently on each package in 16 point bold type.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past few years I considered that the Department of Health have been rather negligent in not insisting on tobacco <Col N="502" /> companies publicising the tar content of cigarettes.  The same companies in Britain are obliged by law to do this on the packets and in advertisements.  I wonder why we are so far behind?</P>
    <P>According to the &ldquo;best medical authorities&rdquo;, the tar content of cigarettes is believed to be identified with the carcinogenic or cancer-forming properties of cigarettes.  If cigarettes are of low tar content the possibility of a smoker developing bronchitis, emphysema, bronchial asthma and cancer can be reduced.  Woodbine cigarettes have a very high tar content and they account for a very high proportion of cancer of the lung in this country.  I have come across many cases of this disease and a high percentage have been associated with the so-called &ldquo;coffin nails&rdquo;.  That was a case of an enlightened public being ahead of the doctors when they christened the cigarettes with that name. They were aware of the fact that they were dangerous when doctors were not. There is a link between the tar content of cigarettes and the health hazard posed by these cigarettes.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to accept this amendment.  I did not include it when I was talking of advertisements because I hoped that we might get the advertisements banned.  I was concerned only with having the tar content displayed on the packets, but as the Minister has not seen the light with regard to advertising perhaps he would consider on Report Stage amending this to ensure that the tar content of cigarettes is displayed prominently in all advertisements.</P>
    <P>I referred to the 16 point bold type.  I am sure the Minister will accept my amendment because he is a reasonable man and is concerned about the health of the population and the enormous burden on the Department of Health because of cigarette smoking.  I am sure he will discourage people, particularly heavy smokers, from using cigarettes with a high tar content.  If we agree to a bland statement that the tar content be displayed, the tobacco manufacturers will use 6 point type that cannot be read.</P>
    <P>When we demanded that a statement be put on cigarette packets that smoking can be detrimental to one's health, the <Col N="503" /> tobacco manufacturers had a special team to decide on the type that produces maximum blurring.  A special type was chosen for the purpose.  There is nice bold type on the advertisements highlighting the great properties of the cigarettes, but when it comes to the health hazard it is done in a special type that produces a certain blurring.  If the Minister studies this he will see what I mean.  It was a very subtle move.  I do not think it unreasonable to ask for 16 point bold type and it would help to have this displayed on the cigarette packet. We are not saying we will turn everyone against cigarettes, but we can tell them that the tar content is the irritant in the cigarettes which causes both bronchitis and cancer.  Therefore, it is not unreasonable to ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have Deputy O'Connell's reluctance in putting down this amendment because what one appears to be doing is condoning the Minister's allowing advertisements of any kind to appear.  However, it is our responsibility to try to improve what appears to be a bad Bill if we can.</P>
      <P>Over the years Ministers have consulted tobacco companies.  I have no objection to this but I do not know why they should be given such consideration when one looks at their record over the years.  They have invariably refused to accept the wishes of the various Ministers.  I recall the first time we succeeded in getting something written on the packages and advertisements generally.  That became the Government health warning.  That was the last thing it was meant to be.</P>

      <P>She smokes them too.  It seems to me that the consideration we have been giving to these companies was wasted because they are very obviously able to look after themselves.  Even with all the distinguished assistance available in the Department I do not think the Minister can call on the limitless resources of these very wealthy corporations. To that extent he is going to find it very hard to outwit them on this occasion, as happened on other occasions.</P>
      <P>There is a case for saying that different amounts of tar affect people differently. There is no doubt that Deputy O'Connell is correct when he says that the high tar content is most dangerous, but even a cigarette with a low tar content could give lung cancer to a particular person.  To say that a cigarette with a low tar content is less likely to give people these dreadful diseases can create a false impression.  We must try to health educate people that this lethal tar is contained in cigarettes and when inhaled works on the lung tissue over a period and eventually one ends up with these horrible diseases.  Bearing this in mind I can see no reason why the Minister should not concede to this amendment.</P>
      <P>If we look at the size of the print of the warning on the packets we realise that this was another way the tobacco corporations circumvented the demands of different Ministers.  The other day I looked at a cigarette packet and could not find the health warning because it was not on the front or the back.  It was on the side in the most beautiful gold script which was buried in red and gold so that it was quite difficult to read.  It was obviously designed by a very clever psychologist or lay-out artist.  The tobacco companies had carried out the Minister's requirements to the letter but not to the spirit of the law.  A detailed lay-out must be designed by the Minister's advisers and made mandatory on the tobacco companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be very wary of the kind of difficulties that are ahead of him in consulting with these people.  It must <Col N="505" /> be remembered that he will be consulting with them to bring about their demise, in industrial terms.  It is very unrealistic of us to think that they will sit down with the Minister and suggest the best way to bring about a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked and the reduction in profits.  It is so unrealistic that it is remarkable we should continue to indulge in it.</P>
    <P>We put down this amendment for two reasons: first, it may help the person the Minister through his educational process will inform that the higher the tar content the more dangerous it is, and second, that he will make sure the tobacco companies do not evade their responsibilities and are compelled to carry on every cigarette packet this adverse comment. If these companies are to be allowed to continue to operate here they must do it on our terms.  The Minister spoke about being a sovereign State, but we cannot accept this situation because these people have outwitted us in the past and will continue to do it.  The power rests finally with the Minister.  He knows he has the goodwill and support of the House in attempting to curb the continuing waste of lives, human happiness and money which arises because of cigarette smoking.  He should feel he can deal with these corporations.  If he takes measures of this kind, naming the tar content and seeing that the Department of Health message on the literature is unequivocal, clear-cut, dogmatic and full of the real menace of cigarette smoking, then it does at least add something to the Minister's campaign to deal with this very serious problem.</P>

      <P>In portion of his reply Deputy Browne anticipated my objection to this amendment.  I agree with the argument which he partially made.  I do not like this approach.  I say this quite frankly to Deputy O'Connell.  I know this is the option the British have taken but it is the easy way out.  The implication is that if a cigarette is low tar it is not too bad.  We should set our face sternly against that and give the message out loudly and clearly that all cigarettes are bad.  They damage health and can ultimately kill.  That is the way we intend to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> I intend to rephrase the warning. There will be no argument about the prominence of it.  I was struck by the ludicrousness of the existing message on the pack and in advertisements.  Deputy O'Connell is right in the case of one particular product I have seen.  It is so cleverly done that one is not aware of the warning at all.  The message must be prominently displayed; it must be simple, straightforward and direct.  It must be to the effect that smoking damages health and can bring about an early demise or give rise to diseases which can be fatal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another element of cleverness in advertisements in the British press.  By putting in so many words one loses all sense of the warning. There is a statement to the effect that the cigarettes are of low or middle tar content as ascertained by some laboratory, followed by a rigmarole about the warning by Her Majesty's Department of Health and, finally, there is the actual wording.  In the middle of all this the warning itself is lost.  For that reason I would leave out altogether all references to tar.  There is the dangerous implication that if a cigarette has a low tar content it may not be all that bad, and people may change over to low tar content cigarettes.  Our attempts should be to persuade people to stop smoking altogether.  With all due respects to Deputy Dr. O'Connell and his commitment in this area and his medical knowledge, I stick to my own view that the introduction of any suggestion that low or middle tar is better or safer is a mistake.  Perhaps Deputies O'Connell and Browne will accept that what is needed is one specific and direct statement of the dangers.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Minister's thinking on this.  We cannot take away the liberty of people.  We are saying that cigarettes are a hazard to health and that if a person must smoke he or she should smoke a low tar content cigarette.  We are trying to educate people <Col N="507" /> and telling them that cigarettes are a hazard to health.  What is wrong with advising people who must smoke to stick to low tar cigarettes?  In Britain almost 70 per cent of smokers switched to low tar content cigarettes.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A National Sports Sponsorship Council shall be established to take over the sponsorship of sports events and activities.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Last year the Government received revenue to the tune of £88.3 million from the sale of tobacco products.  That is a great deal of money and I think, therefore, it is not unreasonable to ask that the Government should make some of that £88.3 million available for sport sponsorship through the medium of a National Sports Sponsorship Council.  If this amendment were accepted this council could take over from the tobacco companies.  That would be acting positively, and it would stop the reliance of sporting organisations on the tobacco companies.  Sponsorship could cover athletics, sports and cultural activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>One finds oneself in a somewhat invidious position in advocating that sports organisations, like the GAA, should give up the money which has helped to make it possible for them to develop in the way they have developed over the years in providing so much valuable outdoor activity for young people.  Where golf is concerned those in golfing circles should be able to sponsor their own activities.  The Minister in the course of his Second <Col N="509" /> Reading speech said that sponsorship does not help sport.  It only helps the tobacco companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They respond only to the big spectacular.  They sponsor entertainment, not sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The GAA is an organisation concerned with young people in rural areas and I suppose its activities do give young people in these areas an aspiration to appear in Croke Park.  But I see the Minister's point.  It is rather extraordinary that we have never had any conscience, any national ethos, to accept responsibility for cultural activities. There has been a curious indifference on the part of successive Government in regard to their responsibility in this important aspect of life. Take, for example, the Hospitals Sweep, from which I benefited in my day.  It always struck me as odd that the State did not seem to feel it had any responsibility for building hospitals and clinics. However, the Sweeps organisation did create enormous funds to do a worthwhile job.  These are the kinds of things for which the State should accept responsibility.  Certainly it should accept responsibility for hospitals.  It should also have responsibility for recreational community activities, for art and music and culture generally.  Why should these be left for sponsorship by tobacco companies or industrial firms?  When that is done we are in the hands of these people and these people influence attitudes in, as I said this morning, quite a dangerous way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite a number of people would consider Deputy O'Connell and myself as cranky misfits who do not see things the way a very high percentage of people see them, but we have no superior wisdom, and what we are discussing here is the influence of very subtle and clever advertising by the tobacco companies.  It should be our responsibility, and not that of the tobacco companies, to make provision from central funds for sporting and cultural activities for the young.  We should find the money for these things. The Minister talks about proceeding slowly and wisely.  My only quarrel is <Col N="510" /> that he will not give us some kind of prediction as to the time he will phase this kind of thing out.  It is too indefinite. If he is serious in getting rid of sponsorship he will create hardship amongst young people, football clubs and people who carry out this very important function, particularly in these days when everybody is talking about vandalism and young criminals&mdash;I hate the word&mdash; and the kind of thing that can only be met obviously by providing mass activity, community games, access not just to spectator but to participant sport. Unless we provide some alternative source of money, we might be making a useful contribution to the life of the community in one way but we could do quite a lot of damage in another way by leaving these people without access directly or indirectly to the funds, the incentives which they get from sponsorship at present.</P>
    <P>For that reason it seemed desirable to us that we turn our backs on acceptance of the dangerous kind of sponsorship of a tobacco company.  Accepting that it is difficult for a Government where money of this nature, £88 million or £90 million is involved&mdash;it is obviously an enormous source of wealth, an enormous industry&mdash;is it not possible that we could get the money by sponsorship, if you like, in another way by seeing that the money goes to some committee established by the Minister or the Government, a sponsorship council, which would be responsible for paying out the money in exactly the same way but without any advertising at all?  The money could be taken in some way by a levy or percentage on sales or taxation so as to get the value of the idea of sponsorship without validating the Minister's comment that sponsorship does not help sport but only the tobacco companies.  If mention of them is excluded from the sponsorship of a council set up specially to deal with the interim period when money are going to dry up from tobacco sources and if we continued to collect money from these people but redirect it to a sponsorship council this might obviate some of the real risks that I think will be involved in taking large sums of money out of circulation from the whole idea of sponsorship and its function in <Col N="511" /> society&mdash;an undesirable function in my view but it is a reality that we must deal with.</P>

      <P>It is quite extraordinary. However, I am glad that Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Browne agree with the point I made on Second Stage that in the short term the losers in the move to control or prohibit sponsorship are the sports organisations.  I do not accept the Minister's contention that the benefit derived from sponsorship was all one-sided. There is no doubt that there were sports organisations that derived a great deal of benefit and still derive benefit from the participation of sponsoring firms in their activities.  As I said on the Second Stage and before we discussed it on Second Stage, all the more shame to the State that those firms saw that there was a need for an input of money to enable sporting events to take place at a proper level.  Those firms provided the money that should have been provided over the years by the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>On Second Stage I suggested that if the Government were really as much committed to the principle of this Bill as the Minister in his rather unusual lauding of the Minister for Finance today gave us to understand, the Government themselves would have said that they agreed this sort of thing should be done; that they would prohibit sponsorship by tobacco firms immediately and that the State would step in and take up the difference.  But the Minister made it quite clear that the State has no intention of providing the funds that will be lost to sports organisations by the prohibition on sponsorship by tobacco firms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how distasteful this may sound to the Minister&mdash;I know it is distasteful&mdash;there is the real possibility that in the short-term the losers will be the sports and cultural organisations.  The latter seem to have been forgotten as most of us are inclined to associate sponsorship by tobacco firms only with sports events.  A wide variety of cultural and artistic events are at present sponsored by these firms.  These events are also likely to suffer. As an example of how even the media can be led astray as to what the intention of this Bill is, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the editorial in <i>The Irish Press</i> of Tuesday, 24 October, the day after Carrolls had announced that they were withdrawing from the sponsorship of the GAA All Stars Award Scheme and that that function had been taken over by the Bank of Ireland.  <i>The Irish Press</i> published an editorial, which the Minister may have read, about Carrolls' withdrawal, congratulating <Col N="514" /> them on their involvement in it and on their pragmatism in deciding to withdraw at this time.  I presume it was this withdrawal which the Minister referred to earlier today.  The penultimate paragraph of the editorial says:</P>
      <P>But while acknowledging the contribution which the company has made to sport over the years, one must also congratulate it on the good sense of getting out now rather than waiting until either legislation or the attitude of the members within the GAA forced such a decision.</P>
      <P>Here is the interesting piece:</P>
      <P>One hopes, however, that the money which was devoted to this sponsorship will not now be lost altogether&mdash;one can think of several projects which, without having any possible health conflict, would be well worthy of support.  A foundation plan to help with the education or resettlement of itinerants, for instance, or a scholarship plan for youngsters from some of our capital city's underprivileged areas are just two such ideas, and no doubt many others could be suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That sort of sponsorship is probably just as invidious to the Minister.  Certainly he is taking unto himself in this legislation powers to prohibit in just as definite a way the sponsorship of the resettlement of itinerants or the education of underprivileged children as he is to prohibit the sponsorship of sporting and cultural events.  The editorial team of one of the national newspapers seem to believe that all that will happen is that sponsorship of sport may be controlled, but sponsorship of other activities would be quite acceptable because it did not have any connection with sport which has a connection with health, in which there is a peripheral, vestigial sort of connection with the Minister through his publicity campaign about sport, health and so on over the last year.  This is the sort of difficulty that confuses the mind of the public and of the media, who have had specialist people following this debate. Obviously it is his intention to make that sort of sponsorship just as unavailable <Col N="515" /> as the sponsorship of golf or a GAA event.</P>
    <P>If the Government are really intent on trying to improve the health of the people, this sort of amendment setting up a sports council, which would continue to take over the sponsorship and to fund the organisations which lose their sponsorship through the withdrawal by the tobacco firms, would be the greatest indication that the Government mean what they say and are prepared to put money on foot of their good intention.  I am surprised but pleased that this amendment was allowed to be discussed and I am happy to give my support to it.</P>

It is the responsibility of <Col N="516" /> the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Tunney, to forward the activities of that body in every possible way.  They have a budget every year. They select what they regard as the most desirable and necessary forms of sporting activities and subsidise them. There is a Government apparatus there already to do this thing.  It is merely a matter of what funds can be made available to them in the annual budget.  I hope that increasing funds will be made available to that body to promote sport and athletics in the right way.  Nobody in this House will persuade me that the sponsorship of sport by tobacco companies is in any way advantageous or beneficial to sporting activities or bodies. As I pointed out to Deputy Browne, they do not support sport in the way it should be supported.  They spend money on a spectacular event, usually a big annual event to which the public have access and which is advertised on radio and television.  They are not interested in the sport, and let nobody in this House fool himself for one moment that they are.  If they were, Deputy Browne and I would come across them out in Coolock, for instance, providing jerseys, togs and football boots for the football clubs out there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, if it does nothing else, will make the governing bodies of a number of our sporting organisations face up to their responsibilities.  It will make them look this question of sponsorship in the face to see whether they are doing the right thing by their members and by the young people of this country in accepting these sponsorships and permitting their popular sporting activities to be used as a vehicle for the promotion of the sale of tobacco products.  That is what it is; it is advertising in another form.  I agree with Deputy Boland in that <Col N="517" /> we are not interested in curbing the sponsorship of sport as such or of any cultural activity as such.  We are interested in the tobacco companies using sponsorship or whatever it is as a means of promoting the sale of their products. The National Sports Council, Cuspoir, is there as a vehicle to put money into the sporting activities at the right level.</P>

      <P>It was £100,000 and it has been going up.  I cannot say what its budget is this year, but I would hope it is well over £200,000.  It is not the responsibility of the Department of Health. That is one way in which sport can be promoted and developed at the right level&mdash;the participator level, not the spectacle.  Spectator sports are not much good to anybody.  We want sports in which everybody throughout the community in the local areas participates and that is what the money should be put into and what should be sponsored. The Health Education Bureau is there and has £1 million allocated to it in the budget this year.  That was a considerable increase.  I think they had £200,000 per year before that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <P>At least it is doubled. Furthermore, more important than the budget, they have staff now.  The previous Minister for Finance refused to sanction any staff for that body.  He left them there as a skeleton for years.  This Minister for Finance has trebled their budget and given them all the staff they need to do their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Education Bureau are already in sponsorship.  I have told them that it is not their business to be spending money on sponsorship.  I have also told them that they should take up worth-while sponsorships to help them get their message across.  Having taken <Col N="518" /> up a sponsorship, their mission must be to try to get somebody else to substitute for them.  I also want them to be brokers in so far as sponsorship is concerned.  I want them to use their influence and good offices with commerce and industry to get companies who would be prepared to sponsor sport.  If the tobacco and drink companies withdraw their sponsorship of sport, I am convinced that there are other solid commercial companies who will take up sponsorships.</P>
    <P>There is no need for a national sports sponsorship council.  We have a National Sports Council and their job is broadly to do what is proposed in the amendment.  The Health Education Bureau are ready and willing to play a role in ensuring that a certain amount of sponsorship is provided where it is needed.  If the sporting bodies concerned look realistically at the situation and look at their real mission in life as sporting organisations, they will find other acceptable businesses to take up the bill for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that sponsorship takes place at lower levels.  It is a damning indictment that we have allowed small sporting organisations to go unfunded for so long.  It is an appalling situation when some football club cannot even get changing facilities.  It is an appalling situation that only £200,000 is given to the National Sports Council when £88.4 million is coming into the Exchequer from the sale of tobacco products.  Is it not all the more damning that we have allowed this situation to continue or that the Health Education Bureau got only £1 million? The Health Education Bureau were badly treated. They only had a £400,000 budget.  It was I who suggested that they should be given a budget of £1 million, but we <Col N="519" /> should be talking in terms of £2 million or £3 million.  He said that the tobacco companies are exploiting the public and these organisations.</P>

      <P>It is a charade.  The Minister is contradicting himself.  He said that these companies were exploiting the public and the organisations and now he says they are being allowed to continue at their present level.  At their present level they are at the height of exploitation and are advertising their sponsorships in the media.  When the Minister looked into his crystal ball did he see a massive expansion of sponsorship?  He says he wants to stop cigarette smoking but when we talk about the star content he says &ldquo;No, we will not do that&rdquo;.  There are no teeth in the Bill.  Those people are exploiting and manipulating the organisations being sponsored.  This is nothing but window dressing.</P>

      <P>I expect more from the Deputy than that kind of conduct.  I have a feeling that Deputy O'Connell has not read the Bill because it is clearly indicated in it that the intention is to allow sponsoring at the present level.  The Minister is being given power to stop advertising; he is to have control of advertising by the tobacco companies. The Bill is a major step forward in bringing an awareness to the people of the dangers of smoking and it will win people out of the habit by encouragement and by alerting them to the dangers.</P>
      <P>I would point out that there are many other people coming into sponsoring of sporting events, for example community games.  There is the Valley Ice Cream Company, and others are coming into take up sponsorship of bigger events. Certain events, for instance golf, have been sponsored by tobacco companies. There has been criticism that these prizes have gone to England and elsewhere, but we must consider the spin-off in the form of Ireland's prestige abroad.  There may be a day when some big companies which do not manufacture tobacco products, such as ice cream companies, will decide to take over sponsorship of sporting events, for instance, show jumping.  This is a trend which may become widespread.  It has been said we have been led up the garden path.</P>

      <P>It has not been provided for in the Bill that advertising by tobacco companies will be brought to a standstill. The Minister will have control of advertising, and the obvious intent is to encourage tobacco companies to get out of sponsoring sporting and other events. We must consider that there are many people employed by tobacco companies and this thing has to be phased out in an orderly manner in the next few years.</P>

      <P>In the next few years.  I have no doubt that the level of smoking will fall as a result of this Bill.  I disagreed with the previous amendment, which was concerned with tar content.

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the decrease in the degree of smoking at the end of next year will show the effectiveness of this Bill.  The control of tobacco product advertising will bring about a decrease.  Deputy O'Connell got testy and shirty when the Minister attempted to correct some of his statements. I would point out that this amendment in Deputy O'Connell's name has the direct opposite effect to the amendment of Deputy Boland earlier which sought to allocate money to replace cigarette advertising revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, many other companies are becoming interested in sponsorship of sporting and other community events. Many companies are ready to take up the slack left by the tobacco companies. The Minister is handling this capably and I am satisfied that the majority of Deputies and of people outside the House support him in his efforts.  The process of cutting down on cigarette smoking must be voluntary.  We are not lowering the boom on sporting organisations or suddenly pulling the rug from under them as Deputy O'Connell's amendment would do.  Some sporting organisations depend very much on sponsoring and it is time they looked elsewhere for sponsors.  I should like to see sponsorship at a much more local level.  Deputy O'Connell knows that there has been successful sponsorship at <Col N="522" /> local level by various firms, such as the buying of jerseys, football boots and so on.  Deputy O'Connell has been getting into a theatrical state.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe's contribution was enlightening from the point of view that he gave the impression that what he was saying was factual.  What was enlightening about it was that it was presumably the point of view he derived from listening to the Minister, particularly at the party meetings at which the Minister explained the implications of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The rather disturbing feature of Deputy Briscoe's understanding of the Bill is much the same as the conclusions that Deputy O'Connell and I have arrived at about the Bill, that it is a cosmetic, public relations operation which the Minister has decided to take because of the growing pressure during the years of various bodies, in order to appear to be doing something significant about the very serious question of cigarette smoking and its consequences in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Briscoe used the words &ldquo;over the next few years&rdquo; I thought he was going to say that advertising and sponsorship would be completely phased out and that we would come to the situation that Deputy O'Connell and I were advocating.  Instead, he went on to say that &ldquo;over the next few years the levels of smoking will have fallen&rdquo;&mdash;a lovely anodyne phrase&mdash;but he does not explain why they should fall because little or nothing will have been done.  The Minister in his statement, which was supported by Deputy Briscoe's understanding of what the Minister is going to do, said that the money allowed for advertising will be frozen at the present level.  Deputy O'Connell made the very important point that with the withdrawal of cinema and poster advertising if the money was frozen at its present level of £5 million&mdash;the figure given by the Minister&mdash;it would be in excess of the existing money spent in newspapers if advertising were restricted to the newspapers alone.  Therefore, it will not be a freezing operation unless the Minister wishes to clarify the position and tell us <Col N="523" /> that he will freeze the expenditure level to what it is at the present time when restricted to newspaper advertising.</P>
    <P>The Minister made another ominous comment when I asked if the money would be frozen at the present level.  He said that it would not be frozen because it would have to be related to the effects of inflation.  In fact, he is going to permit an increase&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister came in on the debate and told us that there was a national sports council.  He appears to believe that the council is comparable to the sponsorship council that we recommended. We are now attempting to persuade the Minister that the National Sports Sponsorship Council is not the equivalent, at present at any rate, of the National Sports Council to which he referred, which is a council operating under the Department of Education.  In his contribution the Minister appeared positively cavalier about the action that he must and should take and which we believe is imperative, that something be done to replace the loss of income to sports organisations as a result of the withdrawal of sponsorship.  Is sponsorship to continue at the present level? This is difficult to believe.  Deputy Briscoe may not have been present when the Minister told us, &ldquo;I have the power to do anything I want in this Bill&rdquo;.  Now it appears he is not going to alter the advertising budget or sponsorship relationships.  Is he admitting tacitly that the National Sports Council of which he knew very little&mdash;I do not think he even knew the contribution they made; £200,000 was mentioned by somebody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of the Minister was that this was a matter for another Department and was not his responsibility.  The figure he mentioned was £200,000.  He also spoke about his own information and education council which has £1 million.  That makes a total of £1,200,000.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us what is the real position? Is sponsorship going to continue?  In that case it does not really matter if there is a sponsorship council, whether he accepts our amendment, because the whole ugly process of sponsorship will be carried on by the tobacco companies at the same level.  That is what this Bill was intended to abolish.  That is what we have been talking about, apparently quite fruitlessly, for the past few days.  When the Minister shows little or no interest in the National Sports Council under the Department of Education, whether they have enough funds, and when he shows no enthusiasm for our proposals, perhaps unconsciously he is supporting Deputy Briscoe's reading of the situation, that there is no need for any of these things because the tobacco companies will continue on their merry way with sponsoring and advertising changed relatively little.  Deputy Briscoe's belief that this Bill is simply an enabling Bill that will not be used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He went on to say that it was idle, silly, useless and nonsensical to suggest otherwise.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Maybe we are wasting our time in putting forward a motion of this kind, that an alternative sports sponsorship council should be established and that it should be funded any way the Minister likes.  He told us this morning that the Minister for Finance is a most agreeable, generous, enlightened person and that he has given him <i>carte blanche</i> in this matter of cutting down on the intake of funds from the consumption of tobacco. If he has such a complaint Minister for Finance it should be possible for the <Col N="527" /> Minister for Health to completely redesign the question of sponsorship in an enlightened way and to do the things he seems to know need to be done.</P>
    <P>We do not see the Carroll's All Stars in Coolock because they are in Portmarnock. Carroll's are sponsoring these elaborate advertising jamborees which are designed primarily and exclusively to sell cigarettes and they have little or no interest in the down-the-line activity of ordinary youngsters.  That being so, if the Minister is sincere, genuine and intent in dealing with this question, why can he not say: &ldquo;Yes, it is obvious that what I am going to do is very serious and radical.  I am going to deprive sports organisations, cultural organisations and artistic functions of one kind or another of a great deal of money.  Because of that there must be some transitional arrangement in relation to financing these activities which are an alternative to the way they are being financed at the present time.  I have been in touch with the Minister for Education who is in charge of the National Sports Council and this is our programme.  First, we are going to have sponsorship which helps sport and not, as the commercial activities are doing, using it as an advertising device.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister and Deputy Briscoe said that we need have no great worry about this.  The Minister mentioned his educational council and the fact that it will provide funds for a number of worthy enterprises.  The Minister should examine this idea more carefully.  When referring to the educational council he said he did not favour their going into sponsorship.  That is consistent.  Now he moves away from this consistent level and says they should find somebody else to do this job and let the council get on with their own job which deals with education, information and so on.  Why should some other body such as the Bank of Ireland or Guinnesses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;be different from the tobacco companies?  Does the Minister believe that one of these days he will see the Allied Irish Banks or the <Col N="528" /> Bank of Ireland or some other organisation sponsoring the down-the-line community functions the Minister referred to in Coolock or Donnycarney?  I do not believe there is the slightest chance of that happening.  The weakness of sponsorship by commercial companies is that it is directed to do only one thing, sell a product and&mdash;we have this on the authority of the Minister&mdash;not to concern themselves with the welfare of the community they are allegedly anxious to help.</P>
      <P>Even at this late stage the Minister should make some attempt to tell us what he intends to do under this Bill and how long he will take in doing it.  He has received sympathy from everybody.  We have all agreed that he has a very difficult job and that it will not be easy to tell people they cannot depend on income, real or imaginary, from these organisations because for reasons of health he has decided it is not in the best interests to do so.  It is not a popular thing to do because of the wonderful success of the advertising of tobacco companies which most people think is a fairly harmless activity.  The Minister must undo the damage of years with nothing like the resources which the tobacco companies have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why the Minister should accept sponsorship by other companies instead of tobacco companies is not clear because he has said it does not help sport.  It only helps the companies such as Guinness or the banks.  Why is he continuing a practice which he correctly dismisses with contempt and at the same time making little or no contingency arrangements? Is it that he really sees things as Deputy Briscoe sees them and that this is an elaborate and time-wasting device to throw sand in the eyes of the people and give them the impression he is acting in a responsible way as Minister for Health? Is it that he has been told by the Minister for Finance that he cannot afford to lose the £90 million which comes into the Exchequer from tobacco revenue and that he should come into the House and produce a Bill to keep them quiet, depending on the wonderfully insidious widespread way in which public opinion has been caught into an intricate <Col N="529" /> network of deception, believing that this is harmless and we are causing a lot of trouble about little or nothing?</P>
    <P>If the Minister is genuine about getting rid of sponsorship and advertising he should be more clear-cut on the question of the National Sports Council.  The sum of £200,000 is a pittance and quite useless for dealing with the job.  I do not think he intended the £1 million given to the information body to be used to pay for sponsorship.  He does not believe in sponsorship because it simply attracts people to the big jamborees and funds are not made available down the line.  If he is serious about doing something he should be prepared to tell us the time he will take in getting rid of sponsorship and advertising.  He told us this morning about the compliance of the very generous Minister for Finance who said that this matter is too important to allow money to interfere and that he can have what he wants.  Is the Minister for Health the impediment to enlightened legislation?  Is it a fact that he finds the whole subject tedious and boring and, far from Deputy O'Connell putting on an act, it is the Minister for Health who is putting on a most elaborate masquerade?</P>

      <P>Last night I spoke about advertising as a source of revenue for RTE and some other methods whereby increased moneys could be made available rather than by increasing licence fees.  I was surprised to discover recently that only 77 per cent of advertising space was sold.  I should like to know the reason for this and the Minister of State might give some explanation. Possibly the rates are too high or people have not been canvassed.  If advertising space were filled to the extent of 100 per cent it should reduce licence fees.  I am conscious of the fact that there is a limited time allowed for advertising on RTE which is 7½ per cent.  I advocated that the Government should establish a community or local radio which would be another source of revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should look at the pattern of financing in RTE in recent years.  I have <Col N="531" /> extracted some figures from an RTE publication for the year ended 31 March 1973. Licence fees represented 41 per cent of revenue and this amounted to £3.4 million.  In the same year advertising on radio and television was £4.4 million or 53 per cent of income.  I submit there has been a fairly dramatic change in the ratio between the moneys paid to Telefís Éireann by way of licence fee and by way of advertising.  On 30 September 1978 the income from licence fees was £10.3 million.  It was 47 per cent of the total revenue whereas on 31 March 1973 the amount received from licence fees was 41 per cent of total revenue.  We have then the figures for advertising.  For the year ended 31 March 1973 advertising stood at £4.4 million and was 53 per cent of total income.  On 30 September 1978 advertising stood at £9.6 million and was only 43 per cent of income. That is why in my contribution last night and here now again I emphasise the fact that advertising has not been fully exploited. The rates have not been adjusted upwards to mitigate what is now a burden on the holder of a television licence.  Perhaps the Minister of State would comment on these figures and tell the House why the proportion of moneys received by RTE has dropped dramatically since 1973.</P>
    <P>As far as licensing fees are concerned, in 1977 the income from that source was £10.3 million.  In 1973 it was £3.4 million. That was an increase of 203 per cent in the amount received for licensing fees between 1973 and 1977.  Again we see that advertising was not making the same sort of contribution that it made in 1973 because in 1977 revenue from advertising was £9.6 million and in 1973 it was £4.4 million.  That means advertising revenue increased by 118 per cent from 1973 to 1977 whereas, as far as licence fees were concerned, they increased by 203 per cent in the same period.  I would like the Minister of State to comment on these figures because it appears to me that, if advertising were fully exploited, the increase now proposed in the licence fee would not be as big as it is.  Perhaps the Minister <Col N="532" /> might say at the same time why there has not been a steady ratio between licensing fees and advertising.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick, Dublin South-Central) Thomas J. (Dublin South-Central) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Dublin South-Central</i>): The important thing is to find out first of all what exactly we are talking about and what this increase is designed to cover and thereby get the matter into proper perspective.  Some Deputies seem to be under the impression that some of these moneys are required to finance the entire RTE budget.  Let me be explicit about this.  The increases are designed to finance a completely separate service, RTE 2.  RTE 2 is not an extension of the present television service.  It is a new additional service.  That is what we are talking about and it is within that context we should address our remarks.  It might be argued that the increases are too large for this particular new service, but that is a matter of opinion.</P>
      <P>Let us dwell briefly on why it was necessary to have this second channel.  It is impossible for any broadcasting company to give a proper service with only one channel.  Away back in 1971 the idea of a second channel was mooted to enable the RTE Authority to fulfill the purpose of a national broadcasting company. The question of the control of the second channel was discussed at length. Should it be under an Irish authority or should it be, as some Government Ministers sitting on these benches then argued, a re-transmission of BBC in its entirety?  That debate took place over a considerable period in 1974 and 1975. In 1975 a survey of a cross-section of the community was taken and it was decided by a substantial majority that the service should be under the control of the RTE Authority.  The Coalition Government of the day then decided to go ahead and establish a second channel. Had some of the Coalition Ministers had their way we would not be here speaking about RTE 2 tonight.  The fact that we are is something of which I am proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will it be worth the money?  Will it be worth the additional £4.50 and £7?  I believe it will justify this increase.  RTE 2 <Col N="533" /> gave an undertaking that they would pick the best available from the multi-channel areas, from BBC 1, BBC 2 and ITV.  I believe the Authority will live up to that undertaking.  I also believe that those living in the single channel area, such as Limerick, Mayo and elsewhere, are entitled to the best that can be got from the multi-channel viewing available.  But we must be practicable about this.  I am convinced that the majority of those in the areas affected would not hesitate for one moment to pay the additional charges required.</P>
    <P>It is expensive to run a high quality television service.  That is what we hope to have.  That is what I expect from the second channel.  In a recent statement RTE have undertaken that 20 per cent of the programmes will be of Irish production.  Hopefully at some time this may be more.  When I say that I do not mean we will have a cheap Irish production. I expect it to be of high quality, employing Irish artists of the highest standards, Irish producers and musicians. If we are to employ those people, instead of having them emigrate to England or America enticed by high salaries, it is important that we be in a position to be able to get the best for that 20 per cent that will be of Irish production. These are the things we are talking about when we speak of these increases. These are the opportunities RTE will now be in a position with the additional channel to offer Irish people using the resources we propose here for that type of production.  It is easy to put on a cheap canned programme of low quality. RTE could fill the hours with such programmes if they wanted to.  I do not believe people in the single channel areas or in the multi-channel areas who will also watch RTE 2 would wish that.  I hope we shall never see RTE revert to low standards due to the fact that this House deprives them of the necessary revenue to put on programmes of the standard people are entitled to.</P>
    <P>Within the Authority an additional 200 people will be employed.  If any factory were established in Mayo, Galway or Limerick employing 200 people, I should like to see what the grants per job created would be from the IDA.  That is <Col N="534" /> worth considering in relation to these increases. I have no doubt that the figure would be in the region of £4,000 to £6,000 per job created.  This is a rather exclusive type of job creation.  We are speaking of creative artists, writers and so on, of whom there are not a great many in the country.  I am confident that, if one canvassed opinion in any part of the country and explained exactly what is involved in these increases, people would have no hesitation in saying they agreed to the increases proposed.</P>
    <P>It is important to put the matter in its proper context when criticising the increases that have taken place.  We are talking of £4.50 per year for the black and white licence.  RTE give a service 365 days of the year, something which very few service industries offer.  In my calculation the increase represents about 1.53p per night for black and white.  We talk of a £7 increase for the colour licence but if that is divided by 365 it is less than 2p per night of an increase for a service that a person or a family can have in the sitting room for four, five or six hours' viewing especially during winter nights.  It is an amount one would not give to the paper boy as a tip; that is what we are talking about, a penny halfpenny motion.  If it were realistic, I would not say that.</P>
    <P>I can see the service and the benefits that will accrue for the increase of less than 2p per night for colour.  Not only that, but the structure of RTE will be strengthened.  We are now in the European Community and we must be sure of one thing.  While I favour economic, monetary and political co-operation, no member of the Community will ever demand that we lose our identity.  But the pressures are there and we shall be depending on our own teachers, newspapers and broadcasting authorities to ensure that we keep our culture to the fore and ensure that it will not be submerged in Europe among the strong cultures of Italy, France and others who will see to it that their own cultures will survive.  This is what we are talking about when considering this miserable 2p per night increase for the broadcasting of a second channel.  Even if it was one channel I would not consider <Col N="535" /> the increase excessive but the fact that we have a distinctly new programme on the air since last Thursday night will make it very difficult in my opinion for anybody to criticise except a few Deputies in this House.  I would have no hesitation in going to any part of the country and publicly debating that type of performance and explaining what we are offering the people for this nominal extra charge per night.</P>
    <P>There was reference in Deputy O'Toole's remarks last night to the RTE monopoly that I think what the Minister, Deputy Faulkner, said in reply to a parliamentary question should be clarified and put in proper context.  It would appear that Deputy O'Toole got the impression from the Minister's reply that it had been decided that the RTE monopoly would continue indefinitely. The Deputy must have misunderstood the Minister.  The relevant part of the Minister's reply to the parliamentary question by Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy O'Donnell on 1 November is as follows:</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation only RTE can be given a licence to operate a broadcasting station.  Whether there should be any changes in that position is one of a number of aspects of broadcasting to which I am giving consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): I do not know where the Deputy got that information.  The position is that RTE proposed increases in fees which would produce an extra £2.3 million in the financial year ending 30 September 1979.  It was estimated that this amount would be needed to bridge the gap between extra advertising income and the running costs of RTE in that period.  The increased costs of the licence that will come into effect from 1 December were designed to yield this amount in the ten months ending 30 September next.  It is ludicrous to think that any Minister or Government would grant more than was asked.  Deputy O'Toole left the impression that RTE were given more than they requested. Did the Deputy ever hear of an employer saying &ldquo;I will give you more than you ask&rdquo;?  That was a ludicrous statement containing no substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole criticised the increases as being excessive.  If we refer back to the increases which took place under the previous administration it will be obvious that Deputy O'Toole did not do any research into them.  Deputy O'Toole said that the increase in the cost of licences represented a 24 per cent for black and white televisions and 22 per cent for colour televisions.  I know the Minister dealt with this last night but there are a few points which I will go into before dealing with other aspects. As the Minister stated, the Coalition Government were well aware when they decided in November 1975 to entrust a second channel to RTE that this would involve a substantial increase in licence <Col N="537" /> fees.  The previous June RTE published a booklet containing estimates of the cost of the second channel, at 1975 prices. After deducting £750,000 for extra advertising revenue from 1979 onwards, the cost of RTE 2 was shown as £3,914,000.  The booklet also said that if the cost was to be met by increasing the cost of licences the additional requirement would be £7.10 per licence.  From the number of licences current at the time it appeared that the £7.10 was to apply to all licences.  The licence fees at that time were £12 for a black and white television and £20 for a colour television. It is clear that at that time RTE envisaged an increase in the licence fee of 60 per cent for a black and white television and 35 per cent for a colour television. It is possible that the Coalition Government intended that if the licence fees were to be increased to provide for RTE 2, a smaller increase would apply to black and white televisions and that a larger increase would apply to colour television, increasing the 35 per cent increase just mentioned.</P>
    <P>Although at least a 35 per cent increase was envisaged in 1975 the actual increase is a 24 per cent increase.  If Deputy O'Toole had researched these figures he could not be sincere when he says that these are astronomical increases for the service given and the second independent channel.  These are the kind of contradictory statements we get from the Opposition.  These figures were available to the Deputy.  They were contained in the booklet issued by RTE.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish in his speech wondered why RTE did not rely more upon advertising.  In several of RTE's annual reports RTE give it as their view that they have been relying on advertising for too high a proportion of income and that this is both undesirable and unsound. They point out that experience has shown that advertising revenue is acutely sensitive to external economic conditions and they consider it too volatile a basis for forming such a significant proportion of broadcasting finance.  RTE's latest report shows that advertising was responsible for 44 per cent of their total income.  Deputy Corish also asked if advertising rates <Col N="538" /> had been increased recently.  I understand that in the present decade advertising charges have been increased almost every year.  The National Prices Commission have been consulted on each of the last six occasions when rates were revised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): In relation to the cost of advertising, Deputy Corish mentioned that only 77 per cent of advertising was taken up over the past 12 months.  RTE determined, with the approval of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, that the total daily time for broadcasting advertisements and the maximum period to be given to advertising in any hour on television should be 10 per cent of the total daily programme subject to 7½ minutes in any one hour.  RTE says that the figure of 77 per cent which is quoted in their annual report for 1977 represents the average annual amount of advertising time sold in their financial year ended 30 September 1977.  In their financial year just ended advertising time sold represented 82 per cent of the total time available for advertising.  In practice, during the viewing period 6.00 p.m. to 11.30 p.m., outside the summer months of July and August, over 90 per cent of television advertising time has been sold.  In November it was as high as 98 per cent.  At other times of the day it is difficult to sell advertising except at much reduced rates.  Advertisers are interested in reaching the maximum number of viewers for the minimum cost per viewer.  This attitude is reflected in RTE's rate card structure.  For example, the cost of a 60-second advertisement on RTE 1 television between 6 p.m. and close of transmission at midnight is £693.  The same commercial would cost only £234 before 6 p.m.  It is obvious that afternoon programmes do not represent an attractive advertising medium in terms of audience size and RTE are satisfied that if charges were set at an even lower rate for this period the additional advertising which might be attracted would not result in an increase in total advertising revenue. <Col N="539" /> Under the Broadcasting Authority Acts the RTE Authority has the function of determining the amount of broadcasting time to be allocated to advertising, subject to the approval of the Minister.  Over the years an average of 40 per cent to 50 per cent of RTE's income has come from advertising.  RTE say there is a limit to the amount of advertising available and, indeed, a limit to the degree that RTE would wish to be dependent on advertising.  It has been the long-standing policy of the Authority to keep RTE's dependence on advertising income within reasonable limits.  Over the years the rates were increased substantially. There was an increase in advertising each year between January 1972 and January 1978 varying between 10 per cent and 30 per cent.  That could not be increased any further without diminishing the number of advertisers. For that reason there were very few places where the Authority could find revenue.  We now have a new channel and it is important to bear that in mind. For that reason the increase is not excessive. The new programmes will create employment for about 200 artists and others.  Many people would like to see the Chieftains, our musicians and our orchestras on television but it costs money to include them in such a programme.  It is important that a national broadcasting corporation can do that.  I am convinced that our people will willingly pay this amount for the additional service they will receive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be paying £23 for <Col N="540" /> a licence for a black and white set while in Britain they will be paying £12.  I do not believe the comparison between the population is the whole story.  The Minister should look a little deeper into the running of RTE and ask if it is top heavy with staff and if they are being extravagant. Do we have to send our commentators to report on the European Ice Skating Championships in Zagreb or to the gymnastic championships in Strasbourg?  In my view those expenses could and should be avoided.  On the other hand, do we have to bring the discomfort of advertisements into our homes every few minutes?  The better the programme on RTE the greater the frequency of advertisements.  The Minister should look at this problem.</P>
      <P>The main point in our Constitution is that all citizens be treated equally but when it comes to television reception we have a class society.  Almost two-thirds of our population can receive RTE 1 and 2 and a variety of BBC and ITV channels. Some people can obtain as many as six different channels but most can obtain four.  On the other hand, the remaining one-third of the population receive RTE 1 and 2.  There is a great lack of privilege there.  In my view there is an onus on the Government to see that everybody gets the same treatment in this regard.  It is in their power to see that all sections of the country get the same type of service as those living on the eastern seaboard and those in the northern counties.  I believe Fianna Fáil made a pledge to that effect before the last election but they reneged on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Half of County Waterford can only receive one channel and last week I was told in this House that the remaining half of the county cannot hope to get RTE 2 until 1980.  However, those people are expected to pay the increased licence fee in common with everybody else.  Is that justice?  I do not believe it is.  I understand that the technical problems involved in bringing the new channel to that part of the country are not great and are easily overcome.  Why has this not been done, particularly when the fees are being increased?  There are parts of County Waterford and County Kerry where it is not possible to receive any <Col N="541" /> channel on television.  If it is very frosty or stormy those people get no reception. This has been admitted by Ministers when replying to questions which I tabled.  In Ballymacarbery in the Nire Valley they are dependant on weather for television reception.  Surely that is a travesty of justice; we are asking those people to pay £38 for periodic television reception.  That is what I mean by having a class society among television viewers.</P>
    <P>Many years ago we were promised that this problem would be rectified but we are still waiting.  We have been told that 90 per cent of the country can receive RTE 1 and 2 but I should like to dispute those figures because many more people cannot get RTE 2.  The figure is a lot less than 90 per cent.  The Minister has referred to the cultural aspect of the home television service and I do not wish to dwell on that subject. We would all like to see more home-produced programmes but television is a very severe medium and unless one is very professional at one's job one will be shown up in a bad light on that medium. The fact is that we do not have the talent to substantially man our television services. We do not have the artists or the performers.  We would have a second-rate service if we were to rely on too many home-produced programmes.  The majority of programmes must be imported.</P>
    <P>We hear the expression being used &ldquo;imported thrash&rdquo; but generally speaking the best programmes on RTE are imported and are of a very high cultural and artistic value, be they crime, westerns or whatever.  Generally speaking they are very professional productions. Some of the home-produced programmes are extremely poor, very amateurish; one would not believe they were produced by professionals.  It would be erroneous to think that we could produce an enormous number of home-produced television programmes. We cannot.  The number and type are quite limited.  Of necessity we are limited in our range because we have not got the talent.  There is also the factor that we seem to produce these programmes at enormous cost.  Quite often it seems <Col N="542" /> much cheaper to produce a superior product from abroad.  I make my comparisons on the same type of subjects.</P>
    <P>Some of us listen to RTE radio, watch RTE television, we read the local newspapers and we see references to programmes and individuals of whom we have never heard.  We are the underprivileged group&mdash;the people who live in the one-third area who do not get multi-channel reception.  We hear of programmes such as those of Dave Allen, Starsky and Hutch and others but we have no knowledge of what they are all about.  We feel we are out in the cold. Now we learn we are likely to lose two of our best performers who are being attracted to Britain where obviously they will be paid a better fee.  The best of luck to them.  But it means that people in the one and two channel areas whom I represent will be deprived of outstanding artists, people like Mike Murphy and Gay Byrne if this week's newspaper reports are true.  Is it fair that we should have to watch limited talent, people with not a great deal of artistic ability while two-thirds of the country has at its disposal the choice of four or perhaps six different channels?  I do not think so, but the picture can be changed almost with the stroke of a pen.  In that connection I might refer to a letter written by the Minister of State, when shadow Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in May, 1977, when he gave this promise to a group representing that underprivileged section, the Cork multi-channel TV campaign committee:</P>
    <P>Further to my recent letter I wish to inform you that Fianna Fáil will make whatever legislative changes necessary to permit the re-transmission of multi-channel signals accepting of course your assurance on the question of copyright, financing and trade union agreement.</P>
    <P>We all know it is easy to make pre-election promises when it costs one nothing.  The election is over&mdash;you were successful&mdash;and I should like to know why he did not live up to that promise. He did qualify his promise by saying that the question of copyright, finance and the views of the trade union movement <Col N="543" /> would have to be taken into consideration. But the House would like to know did the Minister of State ever enquire whether those problems could be overcome&mdash;not to my knowledge or to that of the Cork multi-channel campaign committee.  Was the present Minister of State totally dishonest in order to gain votes?  I think he was.</P>
    <P>Last week I tabled a question to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs asking if he would consider amending existing legislation to allow for the replay of TV signals by microwave and other links. The bland answer to that question was &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I know it is not a popular thing with the other side of the House but I am quoting from a letter written by the present Minister of State, when shadow Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I am referring also to an answer to a similar question I posed in the House last week.  The two are quite contradictory.  We did not even have an explanation of the contradiction.  We are entitled to one, as are the Cork multi-channel committee.  Indeed, the public in general are entitled to an explanation of why the Taoiseach, in a letter to that same multi-channel campaign committee in Cork two weeks ago, stated that people who were relaying television signals <Col N="544" /> from Britain were leaving themselves open to prosecution.  That is quite a change&mdash;from a pre-election promise of saying they would allow such to happen after consultation with the unions and in regard to copyright.  Now they threaten with prosecution. the same people, the same system and people who operate that system.</P>

      <P>The increase in the colour television licence is from £31 to £38.  If one lives in Dublin one does not get such a bad deal with four or perhaps six channels, I reckon that is value for money.  I would not complain too much if I lived in Dublin city and had a choice of six channels for £38 a year.  I would say that was fair dues.  Let us examine the position of somebody living in Waterford city.  One pays £38 for receiving RTE 1 and RTE 2.  They are getting it there but we are not receiving it in the western part of the country.  However, if one wants to get the channels the people in Dublin are receiving one has to connect up to the local cable vision company's receiving apparatus.  The annual fee for that is £21.  Therefore, that person's television licence for the year, for all practical purposes, is £59 in Waterford city.</P>

      <P>They are being relayed by the Minister's Department, not by the cable vision company as in Waterford&mdash;that is a private company&mdash;but the method is the very same.  It is ironic that the Department are stopping people from relaying them in other parts of the country&mdash;such as from one part of Waterford to another and from Waterford to Cork&mdash;while they do it themselves in Dublin.  It is downright dishonesty. The man with a television in Waterford city pays £59 for much the same service as his counterpart in Dublin who pays £38, whereas a man in Cork, Kerry or Limerick pays £38 for a substantially lower quantity and quality of television service.</P>
      <P>Those points are very relevant.  The Minister is being dreadfully dishonest, as is the Taoiseach, by threatening to prosecute the people to whom they promised the same thing before the election. I am not issuing threats.  However, I am telling the Minister that if the threat which was issued two weeks ago that those people would be prosecuted for relaying this message is carried out the Government will have a revolution on their hands in Waterford.</P>

      <P>I thought the time was shorter.  I will not emulate the last speaker who wandered all over the place.  His speech was not so much in support of the motion as a type of Bord Fáilte Discover Ireland speech.  He took us all over the country without even referring to the matter before the House. This motion breeds cynicism among the people towards the Oireachtas.  It is an insult to their intelligence to suggest that the Opposition are sincere about this matter.  Their policy in relation to RTE licence fee increases is on the record. They hope that the people will forget that record and believe they never increased the fees. <Col N="547" /> We all know that they increased television fees.  While nobody wants to pay extra money for any service, at least on this occasion when the increase has been sanctioned people will get extra service for what they will pay.  Before this they got nothing extra.  They simply had to pay the increased fees sanctioned on many occasions by the previous Government.  If the Opposition had any sense of justice or responsibility they would not have put down this motion. They gave very little thought to it but they hoped they would get a bubble reputation for opposing price increases. This motion will not do anything like that.  It will make the Opposition look very foolish in the people's eyes.  The motion reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the decision of the Government to authorise RTE to increase licence fees.</P>
      <P>It reflects on them because they permitted increased fees.  The speakers I have heard so far have not added anything to the critical statement in the motion.  We all know that RTE, like any other service all over the world, have their problems with prices and everything else.  When the Minister's Estimate comes along we will have more to say about the failings or merits of RTE. Tonight we are discussing a motion by the main Opposition party deploring the Government's decision to increase the licence fees.  If they had a clean record one could say they were doing their job properly but if we go back over the record we find that their hands are not clean in this respect.  They not alone gave increases but they ignored the National Prices Commission on one occasion and gave a greater increase than the RTE Authority had asked for.  How can they justify themselves tonight when they think of that record?  Is there any sincerity left in public life when we have this kind of motion?  The people are not fooled by it.  They are well able to judge on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the people will deal harshly with the Fine Gael Party who put down this motion not because they <Col N="548" /> want to pay more fees but because they have insulted the people's intelligence by suggesting that they are sincere in opposing the Government's decision to allow price increases.  We should, for the sake of democracy, be very jealous of what goes on in the House because democracy all over the world is taking a hammering.  It is this type of thing which makes people become unconcerned about what happens to democracy and which tarnishes this House with the smear of being hypocritical.</P>

Deputy O'Toole did not bother to read his own motion or give it much thought.  If he had he would never have dared to come into this House tonight with this motion in his name and that of Deputy O'Donnell. Deputy O'Donnell is by far the more experienced Deputy of the two and I do not know if he led Deputy O'Toole astray.  I do not think Deputy O'Donnell is the type of person to do that.  They did not give much thought to the motion. They said that an increase was coming, and what would they do?  They would put down a motion deploring the increase. They did not stop to ask what they had done.  The Coalition Government increased fees four times.  Surely they are hypocritical in deploring the action <Col N="552" /> of this Government in authorising increased licence fees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the brief time at my disposal I want to reiterate the right of any Member of the House to raise an issue of public importance.  My party and I offer no apology for regarding the recent substantial increase in television licence fees as a matter of public importance and worthy of discussion in this House.  I would remind the Minister, the Minister of State and Deputy Moore of the principle of public accountability of State-sponsored bodies.  RTE are a State-sponsored body, accountable to the public and Dáil Éireann through the Minister.  We are justified in questioning the decisions of State-sponsored bodies, particularly decisions which affect the public.  When we talk about the recent increase in licence fees we are not talking about X pence per day in the simplistic way in which the Minister of State tried to interpret it.  We are talking about a substantial increase of 22 per cent to 24 per cent in television licence fees.  As RTE are a State-sponsored body, their decision should be questioned and efforts made to ascertain the reasons for it. What we are more concerned with is why the Government merely blueprinted the application by RTE for the <Col N="555" /> increase.  We brought the Minister into the House to find out if an assessment and examination was carried out by the Minister and the Government into the reasons for these substantial increases.</P>
      <P>There is another good reason for questioning this increase.  When the Minister's party were in Opposition they gave priority to emphasising inflation and price control.  They assured the people that prices would be stablished if they were elected.  We will continue to bring the Minister into the House in relation to any substantial increases.  We will remind the Minister and his party of their undertakings prior to, and during, the last general election.</P>
      <P>In the Ministers' speeches I detected a certain element of annoyance at the audacity of the Opposition in bringing in a motion of this kind.  I can assure the Minister and the Fianna Fáil party that there will be many motions of this kind. The Minister, the Minister of State and Deputy Moore conveyed the extraordinary impression, in the typical fashion for which Fianna Fáil are noted, that this matter related to the selling out of a television channel to a foreign power. Before the election the Minister of State was not slow to sell out for the sake of votes, particularly in the undertakings which he gave to the Cork multi-channel group.  Deputy Molloy, the Minister for Defence, gave similar undertakings to the people of Galway.  They told them that multi-channel reception would be available in those areas.  Preserving our control of the second channel is irrelevant to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Opposition Deputies are faced with a serious problem&mdash;this does not apply only to RTE&mdash;in trying to obtain information on the affairs of semi-State bodies.  I had hoped the Minister and the Minister of State would have availed themselves of the opportunity given by this motion to spell out objectively and analytically the problems which had led to the decision to increase the licence fee by 24 per cent.  It is information the public at large are seeking.  However, the Minister took the simplistic attitude of telling us that the increase was necessary <Col N="556" /> because of the advent of RTE 2.  The Minister should have had more respect for the intelligence of Deputies and the public than to expect us to swallow an excuse of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister's effort last night was feeble after Deputy Corish had asked about the relevance of advertising to total revenue of RTE in assessing the reason for the increase in the licence fee. In assessing revenue and expenditure in RTE one must, of course, take into account increased costs of the overall administration, but one must also consider the efficiency of the station, its productivity and the question of advertising revenue.  Our motion was prompted by a desire and a hope that we could encourage a discussion on these matters.  It is the type of information the public at large require.</P>
    <P>In a recent RTE annual report we were told that the total amount of revenue loss by licence fee evasions was more than £1.5 million.  We are entitled to some explanation as to the reason for this and the bearing it has on the recent decision to increase the licence fee.  One does not have to be a mathematician or an economic animal to reckon that if evasions involving such a high amount of money could be remedied there would not be a need for this increase in the licence fee.  We are entitled to an explanation as to why this £1.5 million loss in revenue occurs.</P>
    <P>Another point of the utmost importance in relation to RTE financing was referred to by Deputy Corish last night and again this evening.  It is that only 77 per cent of RTE's advertising capacity is taken up, leaving a gap of 23 per cent which is not taken up.  It is hard to understand why it should happen in a monopolistic situation that almost a quarter of the advertising capacity of RTE is not taken up.  My point is that if RTE were to fill that quarter of their advertising capacity and if they were to get rid of licence fee evasion there would not have been any necessity to increase licence fees.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of this issue of the licence fee increase which I had intended to go into in more depth, but I do <Col N="557" /> not think it is necessary.  Our main aim in tabling the motion was to obtain information. There is very strong adverse reaction to this increase and we have not been able to extract from the Minister or the Minister of State anything like a credible explanation for the increase. They left too many questions unanswered. It is understandable and natural that the public would react adversely to any increase in prices, and it is understandable that people in certain regions of the country whose reception of television programmes is intermittent and in some cases non-existent should show resentment at the increase in the licence fee.  There is an enormous <Col N="558" /> regional imbalance in TV reception. Deputy Begley spoke of the whole south-western area which is not receiving RTE 2 at all.  There are other areas where set owners are not even getting RTE 1.</P>
    <P>All these factors have to be taken into account.  It is not only the level of the licence fee that causes resentment but the value one gets for money.  I suggest that this regional imbalance in regard to reception should have been taken into account and that people in certain regions should not have had the increase in the licence fee imposed on them.</P>

      <P>Factory lime is a by-product of sugar manufacture and is produced by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta during the sugar manufacturing campaign in the period October-January of each year.  Sales of factory lime represent only 0.07 per cent of the company's turnover.  The increase approved in the price of factory lime was recommended by the National Prices Commission following their detailed examination of a price increase application from Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta.</P>
      <P>Factory lime is sold to the farming community at the cost of piling, loading and delivery and there is no provision in the price structure for the cost of the manufacturing process in its production or for any profit on the product.  The latest available trading accounts in relation to factory lime have revealed that the company are continuing to make a substantial loss on sales of this product and it was on this basis that the National Prices Commission recommended, and I approved, the price increase.  The company were informed of my decision on 27 July 1978.</P>
      <P>Details of the price increase were included in the Appendix to the July 1978 Report of the National Prices Commission, which was published on 13 October 1978.  As is the normal practice, no other public announcement of the increase was made by my Department.  I understand from Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta that, to date, the price increase has been implemented in full only at their Tuam factory and in part at their Mallow factory.</P>
      <P>The last increase in the price of factory lime&mdash;56 per cent&mdash;was approved by my predecessor in July 1976 and took effect from the following October.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Bruton</b> asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy why, between May 1977 and May 1978, the categories in the consumer price index on clothing and footwear services and related expenditure rose by twice the average rate of increases.</P>

      <P>During the period in question, imported items, principally of UK origin, accounted for a major percentage of the consumption of clothing and footwear.  The increase in the consumer price index in respect of these categories is to a great extent a reflection of the increased cost of these imported items.</P>
      <P>With regard to the services and related expenditure category of the CPI I would refer the Deputies to a relevant section in the Monthly Report of the National Prices Commission for March 1978 where the matter of the rate of inflation in this sector is considered.  The commission pointed out that the index for services would appear to have inflated at more or less the same rate as the overall CPI since 1969, with divergences in some years that were subsequently evened out.  The commission indicated that, while the services sector of the CPI had been out of line with the overall rate of inflation since May 1977, this is due in part to the steep decline in overall inflation and they suggested that the slowness of the services sector to react might only be a time-lag effect, as apparently happened in previous years. The Commission intend to continue their monitoring of this sector to see how the pattern continues.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 443 together.</P>
      <P>Since I assumed office the Consumer Information Act, 1978, has been enacted.  This is the first of two major measures arising from recommendations made by the National Consumer Advisory Council.</P>
      <P>The second major measure deriving from these recommendations is the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill for which, as Deputies are aware, the House today ordered a Second Reading.</P>
      <P>A new Weights and Measures Bill is in preparation and a Bill on consumer credit is also in hands, but for it the timing will be influenced by an EEC directive on that subject which is at present being prepared.</P>
      <P>Though not primarily introduced from a consumer protection point of view, the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Bill at present before the Oireachtas has in it substantial elements of consumer protection.</P>

      <P>In its industrial Plan 1977-1980, published in April 1978, the Industrial Development Authority set a total job creation target of 1,250 over this four-year period in grant-aided industry for three town groupings, which embrace all the towns in east Mayo.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the IDA that manufacturing employment in Ballina and the east Mayo region as a whole has increased considerably over the last five years.  Additional employment is expected to arise in Ballina, Ballyhaunis, Killala and Swinford from the expansion of existing enterprises.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced that the IDA intend to build a 24,000 square foot advance factory at Kiltimagh.  In addition, the authority are at present considering the construction of an advance factory at Charlestown.  The authority are also negotiating for the purchase of a suitable site for further industrial development at Foxford.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Bord na Móna that the total area acquired or in process of acquisition by the board under the First, Second and Third Development Programmes in Counties Galway and Roscommon to date is 31,000 acres. This would include a small proportion of agricultural land which cannot be readily separted from acquisitions of bog.</P>

    <P>The board state they are at present planning to purchase a further 9,000 acres of bog in the Derryfadda group of <Col N="455" /> bogs, between Ballinasloe and Glenamaddy and in the Mountdillon group between Lanesboro and Rooskey. Further areas throughout Counties Galway and Roscommon are being surveyed and assessed for possible future development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the possible discontinuation of the use of the pint as an authorised unit under the EEC Directives 71/354 and 76/770, on Units of Measurement, has been in abeyance for some years past.  In these circumstances there have been no recent consultations with representatives of the licensed trade and none have been requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the EEC directives referred to have set deadlines for the phasing out of certain, but not for all, imperial units of measurement. <Col N="457" /> One of the units for which no such deadline has been set is the pint.  The directive, however, requires that the future of all those imperial units for which no deadline has been set should be reviewed by the end of 1979.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this review discussions with the member states have lately been initiated by the European Commission.  If arising from these discussions consultations with the interested groups, including the licensed trade, appear desirable such consultations will be arranged.</P>
    <P>I should say, however, that at this stage it seems unlikely that there will for many years be any change in the status of the pint as a unit of measurement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in the changeover. Indeed, it could be said that the metric system now operates in most spheres of activity in the country, exclusively in some sectors and in others on the basis that it is a freely available alternative to the imperial system.  In industry, a survey in 1976 showed that 52 per cent of manufacturing firms were then mainly metric, and overall I am satisfied that progress has been maintained since then.</P>
      <P>The rate of progress, however, varies among different sectors of industry. Those in which it is most marked include building and construction, pharmaceuticals, fertilisers, milling and animal feedstuffs, textiles, flour confectionery and chemicals and paints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One important sector in which much greater progress is necessary is that of prepacked goods.  In some sectors&mdash;for example, engineering&mdash;the need to operate on the imperial system side by side with the metric system for repairs and replacement purposes will remain for many years.  For these reasons it is difficult to be specific as to the areas of <Col N="458" /> manufacturing and service industries which have yet to be converted.</P>
    <P>The pace of completion of the changeover is largely conditioned by external developments in regard to metrication including the progress being achieved in the United Kingdom and the requirements of the EEC Units of Measurement Directive.  For these reasons it would not be realistic to set a timetable for completion of the change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information regarding the cost to Irish industry of the various stages of the phased metrication programme.  It is quite clear, however, that the advantages to Irish industry and commerce of changing over to the metric system are considerable and far outweigh the difficulties involved.</P>
      <P>From the outset the Government's approach to this matter has been that responsibility for changing to the metric system rests with industry itself, bearing in mind that if a programme of change were imposed it might create otherwise avoidable pressures for individual industries or firms.</P>
      <P>Apart from its responsibilities in relation to the EEC Directive on Units of Measurements, the role of my Department has been to help in promoting the change to metric by</P>
      <P>&mdash;co-ordinating the metric proposals of the different sectors of industry, of distributors and consumers and of Government Departments, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;by engaging in promotional and educational programmes aimed at the distributor and the consumer.</P>
      <P>It has not been envisaged at any stage that assistance from public funds would be necessary or desirable to enable industry to effect the change over to the metric system.</P>

      <P>EEC regulations and directives having a bearing on consumer protection cover a very wide range of subjects which are the concern of a number of different Departments.  It would, therefore, be a matter of considerable difficulty to compile accurate and comprehensive information on the basis envisaged by the question and it is doubtful that the results achieved would be commensurate with the amount of work involved.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the Fifth Report on Developments in the European Communities (Prl. 4663) presented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Dáil in August 1975, the EEC programme for consumer protection and information was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 14 April 1975.  It sets out objectives of Community policy towards consumers and the principles to apply and priorities to be followed in:</P>
      <P>(a) protection of consumer health and safety;</P>
      <P>(b) protection of the economic interests of consumers;</P>
      <P>(c) advice, help and redress;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> (d) consumer information and education; and</P>
    <P>(e) consumer consultation and representation.</P>
    <P>The First Annual Report by the EEC Commission in the programme indicates that at the end of 1976 some 160 directives and regulations had been adopted. These, which are set out in Appendix II of the First Report, cover a diverse range of subjects under the broad heads of:</P>
    <P>Foodstuffs, Veterinary Directives, Feedingstuffs, Animal Nutrition, Health Protection, Textiles, Industrial Products, Motor Vehicles and their use, Material measures of length.</P>
    <P>Given this diversity of subjects, the implementation of the necessary national actions in pursuance of the Community instruments, and also the servicing of the many meetings which take place in Brussels before Community drafts are finalised, is the responsibility of a number of Departments in addition to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.</P>

    <P>(e) whether there should be a scheme to supplement the standard recruitment arrangements for the force by the recruitment through special competitions of a limited number of persons with higher qualifications and, if so, the conditions on which such persons should be recruited, the rate of pay which should apply to them, and the arrangements which should be made for their subsequent assimilation to the rank structure of the force.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the terms of reference, which were agreed with representatives of the four Garda bodies concerned, are adequate.</P>
    <P>I have intimated to the committee that I recognise that theirs is a task that must be carried out with great care and thoroughness and because that is so, although there is a fair degree of <Col N="465" /> urgency, there is no wish on anybody's part to put pressure on them to produce a report in so short a time that they could not do their job as it should be done.  There is of course no question of a time limit.  The committee will be the best judges as to how they should proceed about their business taking the time that is necessary, while at the same time being conscious of the need to do it as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 453, 454 and 455 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to primary schools, it would not be possible in the time available to prepare the data requested by the Deputy.  It will be forwarded to him as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Information relating to the number and names of second-level schools is published annually by my Department. A copy of the latest report will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The number of teachers in comprehensive and community schools is set out in the attached tabular statement.  In the case of the vocational schools, the number of teachers, by committee area only, is given in the statement as teachers are assigned to the area as a whole and not specifically by school.</P>
