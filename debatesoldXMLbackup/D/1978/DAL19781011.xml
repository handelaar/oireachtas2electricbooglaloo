    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach where the transitory provisions of the Constitution (Articles 51 to 63) are most conveniently to be found; and if he will direct the publication of those Articles in the form of a separate appendix or supplement to future editions of the Constitution's text.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Articles 51.4 and 52.1 of the Constitution, the transitory provisions must be omitted from all official texts of the Constitution published after times specified in the Constitution.  Those transitory provisions are, therefore, to be found only in copies of the Constitution published earlier than three years after the inauguration of the first President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will appreciate that these Articles, although required, <Col N="2" /> as he said, to be omitted from the text of the Constitution printed after their validity had expired, are still part of the law and still occasionally require to be referred to.  It is strange that, Articles of the Constitution, even though they are transitory Articles, should not be available, if I understand the Taoiseach, in any printed form later than 1941.  The reason I asked the Taoiseach whether he would require a separate printing as an appendix or supplement of these Articles is that I appreciate that they cannot be printed as part of the Constitution; but surely it would not kill the Stationery Office to produce, as a convenience to the legal profession, if nobody else, a slim appendix containing those transitory Articles which are still part of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true, as the Deputy stated, that under the original Constitution these transitory Articles are <Col N="3" /> still part of the law and they have no legal significance.  I suppose one can say that it is an academic question in both senses of the word in which it is ordinarily understood.  I agree with the Deputy that if there was a reasonable public demand for them they might be published separately.  Perhaps the Deputy would give me an indication along the lines he has suggested, and I would be happy to give due consideration to any reasonable suggestions he makes along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Offhand I would be able to give the Taoiseach a list of five or six cases in which one or other of those Articles has been litigated in the last ten or 15 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will furnish broad details of the Government's legislative programme for the period to June 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will inform the Dáil twice a year, or at such regular intervals as he may consider more convenient, the legislation that the Government propose to introduce during the period up to the next such announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>Notification of the Government's legislative programme will be given on the Order of Business each day and the usual advance indication will be given by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach to the Opposition Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that it is unsatisfactory that the Government should proceed in regard to legislation on an <i>ad hoc</i> week to week basis?  Does the Taoiseach further accept that the preparation of a planned programme would have the additional advantage of encouraging informed discussion on the proposals in that programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="4" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy like me to make a Queen's Speech?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not regard the Taoiseach as having any resemblance to the Queen.  Does the Taoiseach accept my view, that this would be of benefit to the Dáil and the country?  Would he consider that the preparation and publication of a planned programme of this nature would be of benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a point but from time to time on reasonable notice indications are given in advance of what legislation the Government have in mind up to the end of a particular term, for example.  That practice will certainly be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that the legislative programme which I remember preparing once or twice a year when I was Chief Whip and which is marked &ldquo;strictly confidential&rdquo; and contains the material which our questions are aimed at&mdash;I could never understand why that information was strictly confidential, and I cannot see why the Taoiseach would not consider publishing the legislative programme pretty well in the form in which it reaches the Government twice a year, although I agree this is a new idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the fact that that circulation is usually marked &ldquo;strictly confidential&rdquo; and it is usually confined to Government Ministers.  I am sure the Deputy realises the need for confidentiality because there is always a reason why certain Bills are not proceeding as they might. Sometimes there are difficulties with the Attorney General, sometimes with the Department concerned and sometimes because of objections raised by another Department.  It is only reasonable that these matters should be regarded as confidential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but an abstract from that programme could, without prejudice to the public interest, be submitted to the House twice a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the proposals, if any, for the amendment of the Constitution or its total replacement by a new Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is yet in a position to make proposals for the amendment of the Constitution permitting the legal dissolution of marriage in the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.  I would refer the Deputy to my reply on 12 October last to questions regarding Constitution legislation.  The matters referred to then as under consideration are still being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the need for divorce legislation or the introduction of legislation which would bring it more into line with the annulment process of the Catholic Church is in greater demand&mdash;there has been a 15 per cent increase in the number of people looking for these annulments and the number seeking deserted wife allowance has gone from 2,000 to 5,000 in the most recent year&mdash;is it not a matter of urgency that the divorce laws be brought more into line with western usage?  I should like to bring the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that next year the divorce laws in the North of Ireland will be brought into line with British laws in this regard.  In those circumstances we are moving further away from the northern part of the country because of the conservative nature of our laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as this affects the Constitution the Deputy is aware that I indicated to him in another respect that the question of nullity, in so far as it differed from certain church laws, had been referred to the Law Reform Commission. The question of a change in divorce would be a matter for legislation in the first instance by this House and referring it as a question to the electorate by way of referendum and that is not being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, when he <Col N="6" /> replied in October last, made it clear that he did not see any great reason for major changes in the Constitution at that time and I should like to ask him if he has changed his mind at all in that regard and if he believes that the average Northern Protestant Unionist should equally be as satisfied as he is with the existing Constitution which, as the Taoiseach knows, under Articles 2 and 3, applies in a united Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a practice here to answer questions by asking another one but I would like the Deputy to indicate in what respects he finds the Constitution inadequate if he ignores the matters he has already raised, Articles 2 and 3, and the prohibition on legislation for divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Many years ago an allparty committee of the Dáil in consideration of the Constitution made a number of recommendations for its amendment and the Taoiseach, to use his own phrase, has made no attempt whatever to grasp the nettles he talked about grasping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Taoiseach expect that considerations will be completed in regard to the questions of adoption and bail, which were the items referred to by him this time last year as being under consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say at the moment.  There are some difficulties and there are different opinions as to the need for and the scope of amendments on the question of adoption.  As far as bail is concerned, I understand also that an amendment may not cure the defect that the method of granting bail has now shown up in ordinary criminal prosecutions.  These matters are, by reference to what I have just said, under continuing consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that this is a matter of considerable urgency and a cause of great concern?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach has said, there is great concern about the question of adoption.  Even if there is a legal doubt as to whether there is a need to change the Constitution, it is a doubt which is causing much concern to adoptive parents.  Will the Taoiseach not accept that there is an urgency to settle this doubt one way or the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that urgency completely and I am very anxious that whatever amendment is required will be introduced.  I have a personal interest in it, though not from my own personal point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not consider that the needs regarding the adoption issue could be met by the Bill in the name of Deputy Eileen Desmond submitted immediately before the recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7 and 8 together. I would refer the Deputies to the First Programme of Law Reform and to the First Report of the Law Reform Commission which were laid before the Houses on 4 January 1977 and 13 March 1978, respectively.  At the moment, it is not proposed to refer additional matters to the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact on the issues referred to in Question No. 7 that the laws of our country in relation to these subjects compared to those of western Europe are both illiberal and unjust? In these circumstances, if we are to become full partners in Europe, should we not now make some attempt as a matter of urgency to bring our laws into line with western usage in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach seriously consider extending the brief of the Law Reform Commission, an eminently capable and rather competent body, to permit them to include not only the question of nullity but also the question of divorce?  Surely the Taoiseach will not lose a night's sleep on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that it will be extremely difficult for the Law Reform Commission to produce any coherent constitutional legislation pertaining to this urgent matter if they are merely confined to the question, or non-question in my opinion, of nullity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that one of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission was in respect of wandering horses?  In the circumstances of so many of our laws, would the Taoiseach not recommend that the Law Reform Commission should establish a list of priorities in relation to the urgency of laws which should be considered by them?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on requests for financial assistance from theatre enterprises other than the main theatres funded by An Chomhairle Ealaion, a small inter-departmental study group has been set up to consider the criteria and priorities that might be adopted if State assistance were to be given in such cases.  An Chomhairle Ealaíon have not, as yet, been involved in this process but I have informed the chairman that this will be arranged in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say because I announced this for the first time only last week.  I made up my mind immediately before the summer recess to establish that committee.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from that answer that having established the Arts Council on the present footing there will now be some process of review which will shift the primary interest back to the Taoiseach's Department and away from the Arts Council?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a study for my own information.  The Deputy is probably as aware as any other Deputy and probably better than most, that the Arts Council have certain criteria beyond which they will not go in making assistance available.  I have had numerous requests from sources that the Arts Council would not normally assist and I have recognised the need for some <Col N="11" /> form of assistance for these areas.  It is to that subject I have asked the committee to address themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that Estimates for all Departments are arranged annually and the practice in almost every case has been not to reduce the amount given to a particular Department or a particular section or agency of a Department in any succeeding year. Within that understanding, if it is an understanding, the Arts Council have made certain commitments to certain projects in advance.  If that was the purpose of the Deputy's question, I think that has been achieved.</P>

      <P>The Government in 1975 appointed four men and one woman to the Law Reform Commission. The woman was appointed on a parttime basis for a two-year term.  By the end of that term, she had secured an appointment as a whole-time statutory lecturer in UCD.  The former director of <Col N="12" /> research in the office of the Law Reform Commission was then promoted to fill the vacancy on the commission.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the progress, if any, that has been made, arising from recent meetings between members of the Irish and British Governments, towards securing a declaration of intent by the British to withdraw from Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My views on the desirability of the British Government's declaring their interest in the unity of Ireland by agreement, in independence and in a harmonious relationship between the two islands, are well known and established.  I believe that a British declaration on those lines would remove a major obstacle on the road to peace and help to bring about reconciliation between all the people living on this island.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have availed of the occasions of our meetings with members of the British Government to emphasise this point of view and the difference between our respective Governments on the issue has been clearly and frankly acknowledged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without taking from the rights of the majority in Northern Ireland we would hope to persuade the British Government of the merits of the policy which we have put forward.  We will, I can assure the House, continue to pursue our objective of encouraging the evolution, in the long term, of political structures which will embrace the whole of Ireland. In the short term we will continue to impress <Col N="13" /> upon the British Government the need to seek a way out of the political stalemate which currently exists in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate that what the Taoiseach has said is a desirable proposition but I am asking him specifically whether he regards the term &ldquo;declaration of intention to withdraw&rdquo;, which we have heard many times in the last 12 months from most unlikely quarters, as being the Government's attitude and whether he has indicated to the British Government the Government's desire that they would make such a declaration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach whether his formulation of his position as being one of seeking from the British Government a declaration of support for Irish unity does not have the effect of devaluing the very declaration of support for Irish unity on the basis of agreement which was in the Sunningdale document?  Does the Taoiseach not agree that there is a danger that in not pressing the British Government to live up to the Sunningdale commitment, by ignoring that declaration and seeking a basis which is not visibly different from that commitment, he is letting the British Government off the hook, if one can use such an expression in this context?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.  The only reliable estimates of migration flows are those for net migration compiled for intercensal periods by relating successive population figures to data for births and deaths in the same periods.</P>
      <P>A crude indicator of the annual trend of net migration is provided by the figures for net passenger movement by sea and air.  While these figures have shown the correct direction of the net migration flow and provided a reasonable estimate of its general order of magnitude, it should be borne in mind that they have yielded significantly different aggregates when compared with the more accurate estimates for some past intercensal periods based on population counts.</P>
      <P>In the 12-month period ending in February 1978 there was a net outward balance for seat and air passengers of 11,000.  The 12-month period ending February is considered to reflect best the trend in net migration as seasonal and tourist passenger traffic is lowest at that time of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from that reply that the figure we can take as a reasonable figure for emigration is 11,000?  Further can we take it that the majority of this figure of 11,000 can reasonably be added to the existing unemployment figure?  Further can we take it that this figure brings the unemployment figure to something in the region of <Col N="19" /> 100,000, or over, probably the highest in the history of the State?

      <P>A comparison between the figures for net emigration derived from the census returns of 1966 and 1971 and the natural increase in population in that period show that the estimated net emigration figure for the period was 54,000, while the figure for net outward air and sea passenger movement was 88,200 in the same period.

I ask him what is the trend, and is it not the case that these figures show a rising trend of emigration over the past 12 months?  Could we have a straight answer to a straight question?</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister of State whether the large surplus of various types of timber available here is not being processed here is, in fact, an indictment of the lack of effort on the part of this House and its various agencies to get Irish industry to take up the timber available and process it within the country instead of sending it out of the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The question of the denationalisation of any enterprise under public control has not been considered by the Government.</P>
      <P>However, the pursuit and attainment of full employment within a framework of fiscal responsibility is the Government's most important social and economic objective and its stated policy is that every possibility which can contribute to that aim must be explored.  It would, therefore, be inappropriate to rule out consideration of possible transfers from the public to the private sector of particular enterprises or their assignment to joint State and private undertakings where this would lead to more efficient working and less cost to the community.</P>
      <P>I am aware that certain trade union representatives have expressed their reservations about some of the suggestions made during the course of a recent address to the chief executives of State-sponsored bodies.  However, I am convinced that, in deciding whether an activity should be assigned to the public or private sector, the approach adopted should be a pragmatic one.  We must opt for the system that will give the best results for all sections of the community.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that the Minister's speech has caused grave unease among trade unions and people in the semi-State sector?  Will he make representations to the Minister to ensure that before making such speeches in future he would clear the bridges, so to speak, with the employees in these companies because his speech caused a great deal of unease in CIE and other companies?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service (a) if he will give a summary of the reforms in the public service which have been carried out since 5 July 1977 and (b) what reforms he envisages being carried out in the public service in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the change of Government major reforms have been carried out in the public service through the establishment of the Department of Economic Planning and Development, the institution of Ministers of State and the transfer of functions relating to energy from the Department of Transport and Power to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  These changes have been effected through legislation or statutory order and have, therefore, been apparent to Deputies.  At the same time the Department of the Public Service have been working on a general programme of reform, the fruits of which will begin to appear in the coming year.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have been made for the establishment of specialist planning units in all Departments as a first step in the provision of staff support systems in the functions of planning, finance, organisation and personnel.  It is hoped that such planning units will be operational in the near future and that the specialist units in the other functions will be established in the medium term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have also given detailed consideration to the lack of progress made in recent years in the application of the concept of separation of responsibility for policy and execution in the organisation of Departments of State.  They concluded that this lack of progress had been, in a large measure, due to the absence of political commitment <Col N="34" /> and they, accordingly, directed that steps should be taken to apply the concept to all Departments of State as soon as possible.  To this end, Departments were asked to prepare draft plans for their reorganisation early in the current year.  Analysis of these plans and of the steps required to rationalise the functions of all Departments and to separate as far as practicable responsibility for policy and execution is proceeding.  The objective is to apply the basic essentials of the necessary restructuring of Departments within the coming year.</P>
    <P>In addition, special steps are being taken to promote public service mobility with civil service mobility as a short term target; staff development and training programmes are being extended; the promotion of cost effective administration is being furthered through the expansion of the resources being directed to automatic data processing and the continuous review of structures and systems to eliminate waste and provide the most effective and efficient administrative machinery.</P>
    <P>All the foregoing reforms should lead to an integrated and rationalised administrative machine at the service of Government and of the community.  In fostering the maximum discretion for individual agencies, co-ordination will be ensured through the staff support functions linking in to Government through the central Departments of Finance, Public Service and Economic Planning and Development.  In all aspects of the reform the full co-operation of the public service staff interests is vital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask two questions. The first deals with the reorganisation of Departments.

      <P>That was admitted by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in his own case.  So far as the office holders are concerned, would it not be true to say, and a fair comment, that progress has been backwards instead of forwards?  I look at the other side of the House and find that two years ago for less money and with a far less grand title I was doing the work which Deputy P. Lalor and Deputy D.

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fitting that we pay tribute to the memory of His Holiness, Pope Paul VI, and His Holiness, Pope John Paul I.  Although the ministry of each differed greatly in duration each had a significant impact on the world.</P>
      <P>Pope Paul VI will be remembered as a reconciler and peacemaker.  During his ministry the Christian Churches of East and West drew appreciably closer.  Their leaders, in meeting publicly and in establishing close bonds of friendship after centuries of division have given example to a strife-torn world.  Pope Paul VI concerned himself not only with ecclesiastical matters but also with world problems.  In his first year as Pope he called for a nuclear test-ban treaty. From Jerusalem in 1964 he appealed to world leaders for peace.  In 1965 he travelled to the United Nations and called on mankind to turn its back on war. It was also his heartfelt wish to see an end to strife on this island.  He committed the Catholic Church to achieving just and equitable social and economic conditions for all men.  His encyclical <i>Populorum Progressio</i> urged that resources be shared between the richer and poorer nations and that human rights and social justice be promoted on a world-wide scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pope John Paul I, from his first appearance, endeared himself to all with his good humour and informality.  His <Col N="86" /> sudden death has brought a premature end to a pontificate which promised so much and has saddened the world.</P>
    <P>Ba chailliúnt mhór iad&mdash;don Eaglais agus don domhan uile&mdash;básanna an Phápa Póil agus a chomharba, Eoin Pól, nár mhair ach seal gairid i mbun a dhualgais throm.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamnacha dilse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to echo and endorse what the Taoiseach has said about the two Pontiffs who died so tragically in such close succession.</P>
      <P>The work of Pope Paul VI in the areas the Taoiseach has mentioned has had quite profound effects.  Indeed outside the ranks of the Roman Catholic Church and christians much of what he sought to achieve in regard to awakening the consciousnes of people to the disparities in living standards throughout the world and the need for action in that respect has borne fruit in new attitudes in countries which are not normally directly affected by the influence of the Leader of the Roman Catholic Church.</P>
      <P>The death of Pope John Paul I, coming so quickly afterwards, has been certainly a great blow to the Church and to the world, I believe, in view of the way in which the church and the people of the world responded even in that short space to his personality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I would like to be associated with the Taoiseach's remarks regarding the demise of the two Pontiffs.  It is unusual that the Dáil would meet after the summer recess with one of its first duties being to record its condolence on the death of two Popes.</P>
      <P>Pope Paul VI, apart from his work which the Taoiseach mentioned, in going outside the Vatican&mdash;which was a departure from the precedent there for many years&mdash;going out into the world, attending the United Nations, visiting the countries of the Third World brought the true message of christianity regarding equality and social justice for all to the peoples of the world.  He also brought to a conclusion the work initiated by his predecessor Pope John XXIII on the work of Vatican II.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sudden death of Pope John Paul I <Col N="87" /> such a short time after he had attained that very high office was a tremendous shock to the whole world, not alone the christian world, a man who in such a short period of time had created such a favourable impression amongst the ordinary people of the world for his warmth, humanity and his lack of formality. There was also his record before becoming Pope, throughout his priestly life, of his genuine concern for the poor and underprivileged of the world and his deep concern for those of the Third World.  His passing before what could reasonably be said to be a period of great promise for the Roman Catholic Church was indeed a very sad one.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity also, and it is appropriate, to thank the Taoiseach not only for including me in his official party at the funeral of Pope Paul VI but for his personal courtesy during that period.</P>

      <P>It is on the Order Paper, Sir. No. 11.  The Government have indicated <Col N="88" /> that they are prepared to offer time for discussion on this matter in the near future.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that in order that there should be a proper and informal discussion on such an important issue it would be desirable that the Government publish a discussion paper setting out their assessment of the various implications involved in such a measure being taken?  This paper should set out the Government's assessment of the effects on this country of Britain staying out or going into such a system, for example, the effect it would have on our employment prospects, our rate of inflation, foreign trade, rates of interest and so on.  A discussion of such an important matter should only be undertaken by the Dáil after the Dáil and the public in general have been given the utmost detailed information regarding the assessment of the Government of the effects if such a move were made.  All three political leaders recently attended a function in relation to the EEC and one of the aspects of the EEC that people find most disquieting is the secrecy and the undemocratic nature with which many decisions are taken by that institution. In a parliamentary democracy it is essential that the public be fully informed as to what assessment the Government have made under the various headings I have indicated and that no debate will take place in the Dáil until such a discussion paper has been published by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also ask that the Government publish some document in connection with this matter.  This is something that should not turn into a Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil confrontation.  It is something on which we must get as broad a national consensus as possible. The only way that can be done is by fully informing every Member of the consequences and the issues involved.  Besides the discussion document proposed by Deputy Cluskey and a White Paper as I suggested a fortnight ago, studies were also undertaken by the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the Department of Economic Planning and Development and I ask that these should be made available.  I understand the Minister for Finance submitted to the <Col N="89" /> Commission three documents in relation to this which I do not think are secret documents.  One of them was certainly published in the papers in the past year. I would ask the Taoiseach to issue those documents also.  The Taoiseach must accept that this is probably the most important economic issue that has come before this House in almost 16 years and there must be the widest possible understanding, not just in this House but amongst the public in general, of the implications of joining the European Monetary System or, if Britain does not join, of breaking the link with sterling and joining on our own.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the hope.  I will try to be as brief as possible but on the other hand I want to say a few things in relation to the questions raised about Motion No. 11.  It has been the practice that the Taoiseach, at the end of the meeting of the European Council or the European Summit, reports to the Dáil as soon after as is possible on the conclusions as announced by the President for the time being of the European Council. The last European Council at which the prospect of the European Monetary System was discussed took place on the 6 and 7 of July in Bremen.  At that time the Dáil had already adjourned so it was not possible for me to present orally to the Dáil the presidential conclusions.  I did, however, have them placed in the Library on 18 July.  I felt that, having regard to the special importance of the discussions at the Bremen Summit, I should put a motion down on the Dáil agenda that note be taken of the conclusions and in particulars of the European Monetary System proposals.  It was my intention to initiate the session with that debate but I understand since that the Ministers for Finance of the member countries are meeting even next Monday to continue their studies of the new system.  These studies are being undertaken also by Central Banks and financial <Col N="90" /> experts of the various Governments so it would be utterly impossible at this stage to publish any kind of White Paper because conclusions would certainly not have been arrived at.  It is the intention that I will open the debate on the general issues of the Bremen Summit but also referring in particular to the EMS proposals.  It would be the intention that the Minister for Finance, having attended the Finance Minister's Council meeting next Monday, would follow on either immediately or very soon after to give the Dáil the up to date position as far as he will know it then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear from what the Taoiseach said whether the Minister for Finance will be intervening in that debate or whether Motion No. 11 is down in the Taoiseach's name and will only deal with the Bremen Summit and there will be a further discussion on the EMS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I could not have been more clear.  I said that I would deal broadly with the Bremen Summit conclusions and refer specifically to the EMS proposals and that I would be followed very soon after in the course of the debate by the Minister for Finance. If the Deputy will read the remarks I think he need not have made that intervention. I would invite the Deputy here and now to go immediately to the Dáil Office and read exactly what I said on the first occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Having clarified the Taoiseach's intentions I wonder could we probe this a little further.  Is this debate on Bremen and the Finance Ministers' Council intended to be the substantive debate on the European Monetary System issue, which is the most fundamental decision we shall have taken since joining the Community, or is it the intention that there will be a debate at a later stage but before the Summit in December preceded by the White Paper?  I ask this because given the extraordinary complexity of the subject and the difficulty which even experts have in grappling with it, it would be quite impracticable to have an adequate debate on the basis of a verbal statement <Col N="91" /> by the Taoiseach and then expect that the Opposition would respond there and then without having time to consider the facts.</P>
      <P>It would be almost impracticable for even the Taoiseach, without speaking at inordinate length, to deal with the complexities and details which are of fundamental importance, to the mechanism referred to, so I would urge the Taoiseach either to reconsider his decision to have this debate next week or to agree that if such a debate takes place, it will be regarded as a preliminary only, to be followed by a White Paper and a full debate a a later stage.  A White Paper stating the issues involved could be published now, even in advance of the discussions taking place in Brussels.  I had expected that that would have been the Taoiseach's reply.  Either that should happen or we should have a substantive debate based on a thoroughly informative White Paper containing all the data referred to by Deputy Barry, before the summit in December.</P>

      <P>I did not hear the Taoiseach use the words &ldquo;in the debate&rdquo; otherwise I would not have asked the question, and I apologise.  The papers to which I referred, to which the Taoiseach did not react in his reply, the studies conducted by the three Departments, the Central Bank and the two Departments concerned, and also the submissions by the Minister for Finance, would certainly help to form a background to the debate, if it takes place.</P>

I propose to have a more substantive debate as soon as we know what the issues are and what <Col N="92" /> problems accepting the EMS would pose for us.  As of now, even if the Brussels Summit on 4 and 5 December come to conclusions about it&mdash;I do not know if that is likely, but if it is&mdash;I hope that the Dáil will have an opportunity of discussing it in advance.  It may be that final decisions will not be taken then and that there might be a discussion in the Dáil after 5 December.  Either way I hope we will have the substantive discussion at a later date.</P>

      <P>No.  This Bill was circulated on the 4th of this month.  So far as I can assume it reached most members on the 5th which was Thursday last but it reached me on the 6th because I was away until Friday afternoon. I was not given notice by the Department that this Bill was being brought forward at this stage.  Since it had appeared only a few days before the Dáil went into recess I assumed that there would not be any special hurry in relation to it but to my surprise I find it ordered as the first item for the first day of the new session.  When I called the office of the Government Whip on Monday to inquire whether the Bill might be postponed so that I might have a little <Col N="97" /> longer than two days&mdash;effectively, Monday and Tuesday&mdash;in order to consult people about it and to test reaction to it, I was told that it could not be postponed under any circumstances, that the Minister had just arrived back from abroad and had directed personally that, in spite of all convention to the contrary, the Bill was to proceed on Wednesday as the first item of substance on the Dáil agenda.</P>
      <P>I was Government Whip for more than four years and while it is true that on a few occasions the then Government were obliged in times that were difficult to press ahead with business against the wishes of Opposition spokesmen&mdash;and those wishes were related usually to the absence abroad of the Opposition spokesmen, not on official business because they did not have an office to exercise then, but in those days&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to protest against the forcing of this House to debate this Bill.  I admit that there may be valid reasons for keeping as short as possible the interval between the publication of the Bill and its being debated but when there was a decent Government on the other side of the House the Opposition spokesmen would have been consulted and a draft of the Bill made available to him in advance of the Bill's full publication. As far as I can see, although I have not had an opportunity to consult adequately <Col N="98" /> in regard to it with my party or with other people, it is a non-contentious piece of legislation.  It would be my instinct to support it.  I have no wish to represent it as a contentious Bill but it is not a one- or two-section Bill.  It contains 36 sections most of which are tricky.</P>

I am sure that I speak for Deputy Desmond also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not referred to anything in the Bill.  I have referred merely to its outside shape, to its 36 tricky sections.  It is outrageous in default of a public emergency that the House should be forced to debate this Bill today.  I might add that up to Monday morning of this week nobody in the Dáil Library had seen the Bill.  They were not aware that it had been published.  Up to yesterday the League of Credit Unions had not got the Bill and were finding it impossible to obtain it from the Government Publications Office.</P>
      <P>What is the reason for the urgency?  I have no intention of delaying the Bill but why can it not be left until next week? Alternatively I would like some explanation from the Minister, even if only by way of an apology, that is, if he can force himself to that degree of graciousness, as to why the convention I understood existed here whereby in cases like this an Opposition spokesman was given an advance copy of a Bill, has not been adhered to on this occasion.

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  On Thursday of last week the Government Whip arranged in the normal way with the Opposition Whips that the Bill be taken today.  They agreed readily but if Deputy Kelly is not in <Col N="100" /> communication with his Whips or if he is not in agreement with them, the blame can hardly be laid at my door.  It is the Deputy's affair.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly will realise that the nature of the Bill is such that it is desirable that there be the minimum delay between its publication and its ultimate passage.  It has been pointed out to me in communications from the Central Bank that this should be so.  So far as I am aware the Bill is not controversial in any way and there is no opposition to it on the part of any substantial or significant group of people.  It is extremely desirable legislation.  Several times during the past 12 months I indicated my intention to bring in such a measure.  I see from the record that in April last I was supported in that view by Deputy Desmond who urged that the legislation be brought in and passed as soon as possible because of the obvious desirability of it.  More than seven days' notice has been given of this noncontroversial Bill.  Without straining my memory too much I recall Bills that one could scarcely describe as noncontroversial but which I while in Opposition was forced to take after two or three days' notice.  The same happened so far as many of my colleagues were concerned.  One piece of legislation that had to be taken at very short notice&mdash;a matter of days&mdash;was the Bill which became subsequently the Bula Act. However, I found that I was able to speak adequately on the Second Reading of that Bill although I had considerably less notice than Deputy Kelly has had on what is a totally noncontroversial Bill.</P>

When I contacted the Whip's office on Wednesday last I was informed by his secretary that the Government had instructed that the Bill be taken to-day.

      <P>The point the Chief Opposition Whip has made is that he was not in direct personal contact with the Government Whip.  I want to get this thing cleared up.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy said that the Opposition accepted on Wednesday of last week the business for this week.  I do not think it makes that much difference whether that was done through my private secretary or myself.  The situation is that my private secretary arranged the business with Deputy Creed.  The indication was that we were taking this Bill.  He expressed his reservations but in view of the fact that our advice was that this was a Bill where the minimum of time needed to elapse between its publication and discussion it was generally agreed that it be taken.  In fact, Deputy Kelly accepts that particular point.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is a lot at issue in-this. I do not want to get involved in a dispute as to who tells the story best between Deputy Creed and myself.  The message was clear that we were taking this Bill this week.  I do not want to be involved in any disagreement with Deputy Creed because we get on quite well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is threefold:</P>
      <P>First, it will preclude industrial and provident societies, in the main, from accepting deposits and will introduce supplemental controls to be operated by the Registrar of Friendly Societies; second, it will create and formalise a system for the inspection and supervision of credit unions; and third, it will make some fundamental and badly needed amendments to industrial and provident society law generally and will extend the power already vested in me to exempt bodies corporate from the scope of the Moneylenders Acts, 1900 and 1933.</P>
      <P>Industrial and provident societies are bodies corporate which may be formed for carrying on any industry, trade or business, including &ldquo;the business of banking&rdquo;.  The governing Act is the Industrial and Provident Socities Act, 1893 and its section 19 lays down the conditions which must be met by societies which carry on &ldquo;the business of banking&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A quick glance at section 19, however reveals how inadequate these conditions are, in terms of acceptable banking controls in modern circumstances.  There are, for example, no regulatory controls involved.  Instead, the conditions laid down could be said to amount only to minor administrative inconvenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Central Bank Act was enacted in 1971, industrial and provident societies as a general class were exempted <Col N="105" /> from its scope.  Behind the exemption was the very meritorious consideration that the tradition of limited deposit-taking undertaken, from time to time, by some co-operatives, mostly in the agricultural and fisheries sectors, should not be interfered with.  This way of raising funds often served to ease the acute problem of capital shortage experienced by those co-operatives.</P>
    <P>Since then, however, the exemption has been shown to have been too generous in its scope.  Its generality opened a door through which has emerged a new type of financial institution, namely, the &ldquo;banking&rdquo; industrial and provident society.  The type of society I refer to is easily identified by its almost exclusive concentration on the business of accepting deposits from the public.  Of such societies registered since 1971, 14 are still on the register.  At the moment, there are before the Office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies applications for the registration of 19 new societies, the proposed rules of which would also permit a banking activity exclusively.</P>
    <P>These statistics put the problem being dealt with in Part II of this Bill in very meaningful perspective.  Through use of the exemption for societies which was written into the 1971 Act for an entirely different purpose, a fringe banking sector has evolved, the basis for which was never intended to be facilitated and the existence of which runs counter to the very philosophy which underlined the 1971 Act itself.  And though they operate in direct daily competition with the conventional banking sector, the deposit-taking societies concerned enjoy complete freedom from the extensive framework of controls which are applied under the Act by the Central Bank.  This means that investors in them are bereft of the safeguards which characterise a licensed banking institution.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that I have on a number of occasions issued warnings to members of the investing public about the need for caution in placing their money in the care of deposit-taking societies of this kind. There was, and there still is, no suggestion that, in the main, those persons who manage the affairs of &ldquo;banking&rdquo;<Col N="106" /> societies are not both conscientious and prudent.  But because a &ldquo;control vacuum&rdquo; exists, I saw it as my clear responsibility to advise the public that attractively high interest rates alone should not determine investment decisions. More importantly, I promised urgent legislation to fill the &ldquo;control vacuum&rdquo;.  Part II of this Bill represents my proposals in this regard.</P>
    <P>Before discussing these proposals I should like to deal with a general point which I anticipate Deputies may make. That is whether it would not have been simpler in dealing with this problem to amend appropriately the Central Bank Act, 1971&mdash;that is to say, to bring deposit-taking societies within its ambit&mdash;instead of formulating the elaborate provisions now contained in Part II.  I wish that such a simple solution would do but it will not.  As the societies concerned have developed outside the Central Bank's control, they could not, if brought immediately within the bank's domain, live up to its technical licensing requirements.  One consequence, in that event, would be that the societies concerned would have to be stopped from taking in new deposits immediately. Such a final development could clearly lead to early difficulties, of a very serious nature, in some cases.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, with a view to avoiding the danger of exacerbating, straight away, an already difficult problem, that Part II of the Bill has been prepared in its present form.  It will give some breathing space to the larger societies concerned, within which they can formulate a definite plan as to their future, in the light of the firm prohibitions now being placed on the future acceptance and holding by them of deposits.</P>
    <P>Section 5 contains my specific proposals in this regard.  It prevents the acceptance of deposits by any future societies and by existing ones which have not yet accepted deposits or have accepted some on a limited basis.  At the same time it stamps a definite time limit of five years on both the acceptance and holding of deposits by the larger existing ones.  Excluded from this embargo, of course, are those classes of society listed in section 4.</P>
    <P>Underlying this approach is my belief <Col N="107" /> that all banking activity&mdash;which means, in effect, the acceptance of deposits&mdash;should be subject to the Central Bank Act, 1971 unless there exists a special social emphasis to, or economic purpose behind, the acceptance of deposits in particular circumstances. Building societies already enjoy a special recognition in this regard.  It is my opinion that only those classes of industrial and provident societies which are now proposed for exemption from Part II under section 4&mdash;namely, agricultural and fishery co-operatives, credit unions and a very limited number of societies which are analogous to the latter&mdash;have special characteristics as societies which justify the continued right to accept deposits as part of their normal activities.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 of the Bill reflect this opening proposition.  The supervisory controls vested subsequently in the Registrar of Friendly Societies, hinge around it.  They are there to enable the registrar to monitor the structural changes in the businesses of existing deposit-taking societies which must follow upon the proposed cessation of the deposit-taking activity.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, each society so affected will face the following three options on enactment of the Bill:</P>
    <P>(a) First, it can gear itself towards applying for a banking licence from the Central Bank;</P>
    <P>(b) Secondly, it can arrange alternative sources of finance, for example bank loans, to enable it to continue with its lending business, or</P>
    <P>(c) Thirdly, it can arrange for an orderly running down of its business.</P>
    <P>Whatever the course chosen by a society, however, the registrar is being given sufficient powers to enable him to maintain a watchful eye to see that the interests of investors are, as far as possible, taken full cognisance of by a society.</P>
    <P>As regards the specific details of the controls, they are equivalent, in several instances, to the controls which the registrar already enjoys in relation to his <Col N="108" /> supervision of the building society sector. There are a few exceptions, however.</P>
    <P>Section 6 enables the registrar to regulate, in the main, the raising of funds by societies to which Part II applies.  In framing this provision, I have been continuously conscious&mdash;in the light of the unforeseen consequence of the exemption of societies generally from the Central Bank Act, 1971&mdash;of the need to ensure now that whatever correction is made at this stage, is watertight.  Section 6 must be seen in this light.  It will assign to the registrar the function of determining whether or not a proposed method of raising funds by a society is contrary to either the interests of members or of the public.  Notwithstanding the prohibition now being imposed on deposit taking, it would not be difficult for a society to switch to some other form of fund raising. It could, for example, invite lump investments on promises of attractive interest or dividends.  Indeed, it is the very variety of ways in which funds could be raised that makes it so difficult to design legal controls to regulate each possible form.  Section 6, therefore, both closes off any possible abuses in this area and, at the same time, constitutes a flexible mechanism of control which, we can be sure, will be operated by the registrar, particularly in so far as <i>bona fide</i> operations are concerned, according to the dictates of common sense and the common good.</P>
    <P>Excluded from the scope of section 6 is the acceptance of deposits by existing societies, within the five years period that is, permitted by section 5 (2).  This activity has been isolated for separate attention under section 10 which vests especially extensive regulatory powers in this area in the registrar.  These powers are intended to ensure that within the time limit of five years, societies will proceed to operate in a fashion most consistent with the best interests of depositors.</P>
    <P>I would draw particular attention also to section 15 which enables the registrar to appoint a person to the management committee of a society.  There is no parallel with this in either banking or building society law.  Behind it, too, is my paramount concern for investors.  It <Col N="109" /> could transpire, notwithstanding how detailed are the provisions contained in Part II of the Bill, that a society might decide on a future course of action which may not seem to serve the best interests of investors.  Rather than invoking the formal and prolonged procedures of investigation or suspension, the registrar might see more merit in decisively intervening on behalf of the collective body of investors by appointing a person to a society's committee of management.  Such a person would, on one hand, be privy to the society's plans in full and, on the other hand, be in a position to steer the society back on a course most consistent with the cause of investors.  Should the society prove recalcitrant in this respect, however, the registrar could then employ the more direct powers available to him.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains a scheme for the inspection and supervision of credit unions.  I had considered the introduction of such a scheme by way of regulations under section 35 of the Credit Union Act, 1966, but, on balance, I have thought it best to give it direct statutory implementation in this Bill.  While the provisions of the scheme are similar to many of the controls contained in Part II, they have the entirely progressive objective of ensuring, as best as possible, that future growth in the movement is matched with stability.</P>
    <P>Too few people nowadays seem to realise how important is the contribution which credit unions makes as a source of national savings.  In 1969 the total amount due to shareholders and depositors by credit unions was just over £6½million.  By the end of 1976, which is the last year for which complete figures are available, the amounts so due had reached almost £40 million.  Indications are that this pattern of growth will have been maintained in the last two years. This record of performance bears ample testimony to the application and commitment of the many people who have given generously of both their time and idealism to the practical application of the credit union system.  It is a fact, however, that growth brings its own problems.  The bigger the volume of money being handled by part-time people, the greater is the element of risk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> It is my desire now to try to minimise these risks.  I hope Part III will be seen in this context.  It vests the registrar with sufficient powers not only to monitor trends in the businesses of credit unions but to foresee any problem situations developing and to take any early corrective action that may be necessary.  I am confident that the movement itself will, by and large, welcome this development.</P>
    <P>Part IV is designed to introduce some few, but basic, general amendments to existing industrial and provident society law.  For example, present accounting requirements for co-operatives generally are very inadequate.  Sections 29 and 30 will update these to coincide with basic company requirements.  The greatest beneficiaries from this change will be the members of the co-operatives who can now expect an acceptable level of disclosure and accountability.  As the House knows, the agricultural co-operatives in particular are now major powers in the economy and the turnover of the larger societies now is in many instances greater than that of most of our larger manufacturing companies.  It is, to say the least, anomalous that the requirements on these societies under the law in the matter of disclosure and accountability are much less demanding than what is required of even the most insignificant of limited companies.</P>
    <P>I recognise, of course, that there is a need to up-date the general body of law dealing with industrial and provident societies and it is my intention to introduce such legislation as soon as circumstances permit.  Meantime sections 29 and 30 will improve the situation where the need for such improvement is most urgently required, and this amendment, I am confident, will be welcomed by all concerned with the co-operative movement.  Another change of substance in this Part is in section 33 which will permit me to prescribe different financial limits for different classes of societies. Because of the inherent differences in the nature of their business the capital requirements of agricultural co-operatives can be much more demanding than for, say, a credit union.  Up to now, however, I could never reflect this in legal form because the present law only enables me to prescribe the same financial limits for <Col N="111" /> all classes of societies.  On presenting draft regulations some time ago to increase the previous limits, I indicated my intention, therefore, to amend the existing law to enable me to prescribe different limits for different classes of societies.  This power is now being achieved by section 33.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 36 of this Part will extend the power already vested in my office under the Moneylenders Act, 1900, to exempt bodies corporate from the scope of the Moneylenders Act 1900 and 1933.  I have been advised that societies which, as part of their business activity, lend money, could be in breach of those Acts.  While a society can apply individually in the form prescribed in the Moneylenders (Exemption of Bodies Corporate) Regulations, 1934, some have not done so, notwithstanding that the legal dangers inherent in their present position were brought to their attention. It is clearly necessary to remedy this undesirable situation.  Section 36 will, accordingly, enable me to declare, by order, that a specified class or classes of industrial and provident societies are exempt from the Acts concerned.  It will be my intention to give retrospective effect to any such orders in so far as is necessary to cover, in full, the period during which societies affected operated a lending business.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.  If its prime motive can be summarised, it is to protect, so far as possible, the savings of ordinary people.  It does not, perhaps, amend enough of the many outdated provisions of existing industrial and provident society law.  Such an extension, however, would be a substantial one which would take some considerable time to complete.  I assure the House that it will be done as soon as priorities permit.  But, for the present, the pressing need is to legislate to safeguard people's savings which is why I am proceeding with the separate and urgent consideration of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely accept on my own reading of the Bill that it tends to the object which the Minister has summarised at the end of his speech as being the protection of the savings of ordinary <Col N="112" /> people.  Naturally we will support anything of that sort.  In the short time I have had, I have not been able to discover any objection by the co-operative movement generally to Part II of this Bill, the part which bears largely on them.  As far as I can gather, it is generally supported.</P>
      <P>The same is true of the part of the Bill which deals with the credit unions.  I understand that in its main outline that part of the Bill was suggested by the credit unions themselves and that the Bill in both or all its parts has been cooking in the Department for some years before the Minister's arrival and at the time of his predecessor.  Despite having had a short time to think about the Bill and to talk about it, I welcome it and in general support it.  I understand that the credit unions wished the part of the Bill dealing with them to go a little further than it does and that they wished the power to accept deposits which credit unions now have to be entirely removed.  When I have had a chance to explore that matter a bit further, I will probably ask the Minister to explain how it was that his Department decided against taking this additional step which the credit unions recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have only two brief comments; they could be regarded as comments of detail but they are fairly important, at least if there is any meat in them.  I wish to mention them in the Minister's hearing so that his Department may look at them before Committee Stage.  One of them relates to a word which occurs twice in the definition subsection of section 4 which has the effect of explaining what is meant by an agricultural co-operative society or a fishing co-operative society, both of which are excluded from the operation of the Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is not to catch <i>bona fide</i> agricultural or fishery co-operatives but co-operatives which are such only in name as the word is ordinarily understood and which concentrate exclusively on business which could be described as banking.  The word which catches my eye is &ldquo;insubstantial&rdquo; in the definition of an agricultural co-operative society and fishing co-operative society.  The conditions which this subsection contains in order to exempt such co-operatives from <Col N="113" /> the application of the Bill are cumulative, in other words an agricultural co-op means a society most of which is concerned with farming and so on and in which the acceptance of deposits and the making of loans constitute an insubstantial part of the business.  These are cumulative conditions and that cumulation is repeated in the definition of a fishing co-operative. They are not alternatives.  Both of these conditions have to be met if an agricultural or fishing co-operative is to be exempted.  I wonder if the word &ldquo;insubstantial&rdquo; is felicitous or the best way of dealing with this attempt, which is a correct effort, to exclude genuine agricultural and fishing co-operatives.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with something which can be quantified.  It is not an operation which exists in abstraction or which does not relate to money.  It relates purely to money and I would have thought that it would have been possible for the Minister to decide what portion of a business would render it subject to the applications of this Bill or exempt from the application, not merely leaving this decision to a registrar or a court.  What do the Minister and his Department regard as &ldquo;insubstantial&rdquo;?  If they have no clear idea about it, how can they expect a registrar or court to have a clear idea about it?  The Minister and his Department ought to give some thought to the idea of quantifying in terms of money or proportion of turnover or proportion of assets what exactly they mean by &ldquo;insubstantial&rdquo;.  The effect of it will be the means of deciding whether an agricultural or fishing co-operative is to be caught by the Bill or not.</P>
    <P>I remember being in a case when I was at the Bar which turned entirely on the meaning of the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; in a quite different setting in regard to workmen's compensation.  I think it was the first case decided on an amending Act in which the question of substantial ground was at issue.  A great deal of legal ingenuity was expended, though I think to a wrong result in the end, on what exactly was meant by the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo;.  It looks like a solid, easily understood word but it can cause a good deal of difficulty and I should like the Minister and his Department to see <Col N="114" /> whether that way of measuring exemptability could be improved.</P>
    <P>I make my other point with diffidence because I have not had enough time to examine this and to be sure I am right about it.  Perhaps one never can be sure that one is right but I am less sure than I normally am.  The procedure in section 14 in regard to the investigation of the affairs of a society includes a provision in subsection 2 to the following effect:</P>
    <P>If any officer, member, agent or servant of the society refuses to answer any question put to him by the inspector with respect to the affairs of the society, the inspector may certify the refusal under his hand to the Court and the Court may thereupon inquire into the case and, after hearing any witnesses who may be produced against or on behalf of the alleged offender and after hearing any statement which may be offered in defence, punish the offender in like manner as if he had been guilty of contempt of court.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the Bill &ldquo;the Court&rdquo; is defined as the High Court.  At first blush that subsection is very like a sub-section in the Dáil Éireann Committee of Public Accounts Act of 1970 which was subsequently held to be invalid by the Supreme Court on a couple of grounds, one of which was that this formulation implied that the High Court could try the issue of contempt or of contempt-like behaviour without a jury, but that since the offence of contempt was not a minor offence and since the only kind of court which could punish a minor offence was one of summary jurisdiction which the High Court was not, the section was constitutionally invalid.  I am not positively asserting that this subsection will fall into the same trap: I will have to look at it a bit more closely.</P>
    <P>However, I should like to signal that possibility to the Minister's advisers and ask them to look at the Haughey case, reported in 1971 Irish Reports, to see whether they can be quite sure about this subsection, which refers to whether this would be an indictable offence which can be tried only by a jury or whether it identifies the High Court as the only court which can deal with such an offence, <Col N="115" /> in other words, the High Court sitting without a jury.  I should like the Minister's advisers to look at that to determine whether it is all right by the standards which the Supreme Court have laid down.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say on the Bill at this Stage.  I hope the Minister will not want the Committee Stage to be taken before this day week at the earliest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is overdue.  It has been quite evident in the past five years that there has been an urgent need to enact such legislation. Quite properly, the Bill attempts, and it seems quite effective in its attempt, to close a questionable loophole in our deposit-holding controls.  I regret it has taken such a long time to do this, but better now than never.</P>
      <P>I am sure everyone in the House will agree that we do not want any questions raised about the possibility of a so-called fringe commercial banking operation emerging which would be unamenable to Central Bank control, and from that point of view this Bill will close a gap. That is very welcome.  There are a number of points I should like to put briefly to the Minister in relation to his speech.  Perhaps it is in the public interest that we should know the dimensions of the problem.  The Minister had indicated there are some 14 of these so-called banking industrial and provident societies on the register.  How many investors are involved in such societies, if the information is available to the Department and the registrar, of course, in so far as such bodies maintain records and disclose them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question that should be put is in regard to the total general investment in the holdings of such societies.  This may not be known to the Department or the Central Bank.  Though the Minister indicated that there are 14 such bodies on the register and that there are applications in from 19 new societies, I do not entirely accept that such information gives us any meaningful perspective. Perhaps there may be more information available in regard to the dimensions of these transactions and I suggest we should be told about the financial <Col N="116" /> magnitude of the control system we are trying to introduce.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect I should like to comment on.  The Minister proposes that existing societies which held deposits of more than £25,000 on October 24 last cannot accept or hold deposits after five years from the passing of the Bill.  However, the Minister had indicated that he wishes to retain power whereby he by ministerial regulation can extend that period.  I suggest to him that it is perhaps a power which he should be loath to devolve on himself.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to an operation which occurred in relation to a defunct bank which caused a lot of political furore at the time.  I recall the enormous pressures which were brought to bear on members of the Cabinet at the time when the Irish Trust Bank went into liquidation. There were enormous pressures on politicians within their constituencies, and on individual Ministers, to underwrite repayment of deposits.  At that time the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, stood firm and said he would not yield to what in effect at the time was political blackmail.  I personally was approached by a number of people and one of the few definite things I have done in my time was to refuse to accept that we should bend and give such a promise.</P>
    <P>At this stage I can foresee a situation emerging, because the Minister will have power to extend the period of five years, running up to the next general election when a few societies who should be winding themselves up, or down, legitimately, will come along to the Minister and say: &ldquo;Give us another few years of operation, extend the period, we are a fairly large society and there is no way in which we can conclude our operations in five years&rdquo;.  Approaching the general election three years hence, some of these societies might find themselves in trouble, and if I were in the Minister's shoes I would perhaps devolve the responsibility on the Central Bank because they could accept the responsibility with absolute objectivity and without appearing to be open to any pressures.  I agree they are the kind of pressures which Deputy O'Malley would never yield to, but they are pressures <Col N="117" /> which we should not allow for in legislation. It is not a major point but it is an aspect of the Bill which the Minister might reconsider.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of agricultural and fishery co-operatives is reasonable and fair, but I am more pleased with the Minister's efforts to ensure that the societies on the agricultural side, provided for in Part IV of the Bill, will have to keep their houses in order.  That is a valuable provision.  It is fair to say that the manner in which some agricultural co-operatives have maintained their accounts over the years &mdash;and many of them are multi-million operations, massively large operations&mdash;would raise the hair on the top of the head of any self-respecting accountant. Some of these societies have got themselves into the height of trouble over the years.  Therefore I am glad Part IV of the Bill will introduce some elementary general provisions which are essential.  As the Minister has rightly pointed out, our agricultural co-operatives are now major powers in the land.  They have enormous turnovers and it is desirable that there should be effective controls on them in the public interest, in the interest of their shareholders, and in the interests of the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>With these comments I welcome the Bill.  It is overdue.  Some individuals availed of loopholes but, in fairness it should be said, not all in any deliberately evasive manner.  When there is a vacuum there is always a good accountant who will see an opportunity to set up his own operations.  There are always people with sufficient easy money to avail of loopholes and other legal methods of avoidance which are open to them and, quite properly under the law, they will avail of the loopholes the 1971, Act unwittingly left open to them.</P>
    <P>I was in the House for the debate in 1971 and at that time I was ignorant of the possibilities for evasion which evolved in later years.  I commend the Minister on his efforts in this regard.  I know he and his staff in the Department feel strongly about his situation.  I know the Central Bank have been very concerned about it.  The quicker this legislation is enacted the better.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> Apart from my unhappiness about the regulatory power in section 5 I did not consider putting down any amendment to the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will have a look at that so that he can be assured the Committee Stage will have a speedy passage through the House and the Bill can be sent to the Seanad as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the two Deputies who spoke their views on the Bill and their support for it. If I can, I will deal with all the points raised.  Deputy Kelly raised a point in regard to the use of the words &ldquo;insubstantial&rdquo; and &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; in the definition of agricultural and fishery co-operatives in section 4.  He suggested we should seek to quantify by way of amount or percentage the section of the business which related to deposit taking.</P>
      <P>One of the advantages of having the section the way it is, is that it gives discretion to the registrar who will be dealing with this primarily.  I suppose it would only go to court in the event of somebody trying to get a more definitive ruling on it.  By giving discretion to the registrar to exclude <i>bona fide</i> agricultural and fishery co-operatives and to include those he feels are not <i>bona fide</i>, he is in a position to serve the public interest better.  There could be a situation in which perhaps only 5 per cent of the business at a given time was deposit taking, 5 per cent of a very small business, and suddenly the deposit taking side of the business is expanded in a very big way and the agricultural or fishery side is run down.  The letter of the law might be observed but certainly the spirit would not in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point Deputy Kelly made about the question of the wording of section 14 (2) has greater validity.  In fact, some days after the Bill was circulated the draftsman got in touch with my Department to draw their attention to the fact that the section as it stood was too close to the wording used in the Dáil Éireann Committee Act of 1970 and in his view it would be desirable to amend it somewhat to make it clear that it did not come under the ruling of the Supreme Court in the case where that <Col N="119" /> Act was examined.  The same applies to section 23 (2) where the wording used is the same as in section 14 (2).  I will propose two amendments to make some modifications to the wording to get over these difficulties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly inquired also about the submission of the Irish League of Credit Unions on credit union law.  That is being studied by the Credit Union Advisory Committee, a statutory committee who must advise me on matters of this kind before any action can be taken one way or the other.  I am awaiting their recommendations on the submission. They have not arrived yet.</P>
    <P>The question of the possibility or otherwise of banning deposit taking by credit unions could be considered after those recommendations have been received.  Perhaps it would have been somewhat misleading to the public to have introduced such a ban here and now in this Bill because, in the public mind at least, it would have classified credit unions who are wholly commendable in their activities with certain quasi-banking institutions which are less commendable.  It is better that the distinction should be kept clear.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond inquired how many investors are involved in the societies and by that I presume he means depositors.  Unfortunately I cannot give him the figure.  We will seek to get it.  As of the end of 1976 there were 1,071 members of these deposit taking societies.  One could safely say the number of depositors would be substantially higher than the number of members and would therefore be several thousand at least.  So far as the amounts of deposits involved are concerned, the latest figures available are in the registrar's report for the year ending 31 December 1976.  The amount of deposits and interest outstanding as liabilities to depositors by the 14 societies taking deposits at that time was £11,443,619.  I would assume that in the 21 months since then there has been a fairly significant increase in that amount, perhaps as much as 50 per cent, so that we may now be talking about a current figure in the region of £15 million, particularly in <Col N="120" /> view of the fairly extensive advertising the societies insisted on carrying out over the past 12 months although they were advised not to do so.  The amount involved is probably pretty considerable by any standards and, if there were default, it would obviously be a serious matter for a great many people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond raised a point also about the five-year period in section 9 and the question of extending it.  I would imagine that power would be exercised only on the advice of both the Central Bank and the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  Indeed, subsection (3) requires consultation with the Central Bank before a decision to extend the period is made.  In a matter such as this I certainly would be inclined to act only in accordance with their advice or recommendation.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Bill be enacted as soon as reasonably and conveniently possible.  I would hope it would be possible to have the Committee Stage next week.  I would like to thank Deputies for agreeing to the Second Stage.  I think I have answered all the queries but should there be any further queries I shall be only too glad to answer them on the Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i>: This Bill was introduced on 14 December 1977 and is therefore entitled the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1977.  The alleged object of the Bill is to implement part of the manifesto on which the Fianna Fáil Party fought the last general election. That was that part of the manifesto which promised to make it cheaper to keep a house by abolishing rates on private houses, by removing the rate element from houses rented by local authorities and by ensuring there would be no rate content in the rents paid by tenants of privately rented accommodation. The Bill was introduced on 14 December 1977. It was officially circulated to Members on 30 May 1978, nearly six months afterwards. As we know, the Bill and the paraphernalia connected with it escaped or was unofficially distributed about May 1978. I dealt with that episode at some length when I opened my speech on Second Stage and I do not propose to go further into it now beyond inquiring from the Minister what progress, if any, the Garda Síochána have made in tracing the source of the leak or the person who unofficially circulated the Bill with its explanatory memorandum, the confidential Government memorandum. The Minister has had a few months to consider the matter and I would ask him now what steps have been taken to ensure there will be no repetition of this type of unofficial disclosure of Government Bills and memoranda. I would like the Minister to deal with these two questions when he comes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Bill, in my opinion <Col N="122" /> it spells the end of local democracy as we know it and converts local representatives into meaningless rubber stamps with no functions and no authority good, bad or indifferent. Furthermore, it does nothing to implement the promise in the Fianna Fail manifesto to remove the rate content in the rent of privately rented dwellings. The machinery in the Bill is completely ineffective and I believe it will not be possible to amend the Bill to ensure that tenants of privately rented houses will be free from rates. I would like the Minister to deal with that and tell us whether he proposes, now that he has had time to think about it and study and consider representations which must have been made to him, to bring in any amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to my assertion that this Bill spells the end of local democracy and renders the role of the local representative meaningless and powerless, I would like to refer the House to section 10.  Heretofore local authorities acted in a partnership&mdash;the partnership existing between the elected representatives and the manager. They were authorised by law to govern the local authority in so far as local government matters were concerned, with a supervisory role by the Department of the Environment in certain respects.</P>
    <P>For example, the local county council prepared their estimate for the ensuing year in consultation with the county manager but it was not necessary to consult the manager at that stage because there was provision for an estimates committee. The council could either elect or appoint an estimates committee or the whole council could act as an estimates committee and bring in a rates estimate.  If the county manager was satisfied that the estimate was adequate and sufficient to discharge the statutory duties of the council for the ensuing 12 months, he would not object to it. It was only in case a local authority brought in an estimate that was insufficient and inadequate to pay the outgoings of the ensuing year that the Department stepped in. Then the council were required to bring in an adequate estimate. If they failed to do that the Minister held an inquiry. If the inquiry confirmed that they failed in their duty <Col N="123" /> and that the local services would break down as a result of the estimate brought in, they were removed from office.</P>
    <P>That was a fairly reasonable approach and left local authorities with discretion as to how much money they would spend and what services they would provide. The record shows they acted in a reasonable manner and the number of occasions on which it was necessary for the Custom House to step in were few and far between. That whole system has now been changed by virtue of this measure.</P>
    <P>Section 10 authorises the Minister for the Environment, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to issue a direction to the local authority telling them how much they are to estimate for the coming year.  It is very significant, particularly for those who have been in Government, to see that the Minister for the Environment will issue a direction with the consent of the Minister for Finance. That is the Parliamentary Draftsman's jargon used to oblige the Minister for the Environment to consult with the Minister for Finance and gives the Minister for Finance an overriding authority to give directions to his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, as to the amount of the estimate which a local authority is permitted to bring in.</P>
    <P>Under section 10 the Minister for the Environment, at the behest of the Minister for Finance, is to have the authority to say to the local council, urban authority or city council, &ldquo;Your estimate for this year shall be limited to £X&rdquo;.  That is an innovation. It is completely unheard of. We all know the Minister for Finance and his advisers are only interested in one thing&mdash;keeping down the overall Government budget. They will decide that this must be cut and that must be cut. The advisers of the Minister for Finance do not believe that spending money under the local improvements scheme to improve lanes leading to houses is a worthwhile operation. They think that scheme should be abolished. That is the kind of direction that will be coming to the Department of the Environment from the Department <Col N="124" /> of Finance. It will not stop there because the section goes on to say&mdash;I need not spell it out&mdash;that the local authority shall be obliged to abide by and obey this direction. If they do not there will not be consultation or an inquiry as to whether they have carried out their duty properly. Their estimate will be thrown in the wastepaper basket and the estimate which coincides with the Minister's limit will replace it. The council will be brushed aside and ignored. There will not be an inquiry. They will not be consulted. They will be treated as imbeciles, fool or nonentities or people who do not matter.  There will be no consultation, no public inquiry: ignore that estimate and we will place it with the Minister. Indeed, the task, very well done by some local authorities over the years, of preparing the estimate is virtually taken away from them entirely and is handed over to the county managers.</P>
    <P>I want to assert that the role of the county manager in local administration is being changed completely. Up to now he was the official of the local authority, fighting their case, advising them, preparing their schemes and doing his best for the county generally. Under this Bill all that is gone. He becomes now the watchdog&mdash;and I am not being offensive when I say the bully boy of the Minister for Finance at the direction of the Minister for the Environment&mdash;because section 10 (3) (e) specifies that it shall be the duty of the manager to give a direction to the authorities, to make them aware of the direction from Dublin and to explain its effect to them. In case the direction is not complied with, as soon as maybe the county manager then must certify to the Minister for the Environment the extent by which it is exceeded. Finally he is obliged to correct the erroneous estimate prepared by these local people, who know local circumstances, to revise that estimate and bring it into line with an estimate which will accord with the direction given by the Minister for the Environment at the behest of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the House in all sincerity is it any wonder that county managers are quitting the service?  Is it any wonder that they are recognising <Col N="125" /> that the role they took on some years ago has been utterly changed?  Is it any wonder that county managers are seeing now that they have no worthwhile powers left to them, that there is nothing they can do, no way in which they can bring their expertise, knowledge or ability to bear on the locality they serve? We know that county managers are leaving the service at not much more than half the retirement age and going into private enterprise.  I believe that is evidence that the only people now who will continue to serve in the role of county managers are those who will be prepared to obey the dictation emanating from Government Buildings and the Custom House, accepting the straitjacket role.</P>
    <P>I cannot see what particular role is left to county councils, to their members or managers. We hear a lot about decentralisation, about the spreading out of authority from Government Buildings and the Custom House to say, Castlebar, Athlone and other places. Here we have a contraction of authority, a complete centralisation of local authority from every local authority in the 26 counties back up to the Custom House. I wonder how Deputies like Deputy Seán Moore&mdash;Deputies who started their careers in public life on local authorities, who did a good job, who spoke fearlessly letting their views be known in the interests of their localities&mdash;will accept this insult. It is beyond me.</P>
    <P>It does not end there because the estimate for the year is to be in accordance with the direction from Dublin. Heretofore, as we know, if something was overlooked or some emergency occurred during the year the manager and his councillors, in their wisdom, brought in a supplementary estimate, did the additional work or provided the additional service that was to be provided whether caused by storm, some other hardship, or in some other way that might not have been anticipated. All that is changed because section 11 says that no supplementary estimate shall be made unless it is sanctioned by the Minister for the Environment.  Although not specifically stated in the section he will <Col N="126" /> have to have a chat with his friend, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Already this year we have had an example of how that can affect local services and administration. The estimates passed last year, for the year ending 31 December 1978, were made without any regard to the increase in wages and salaries brought about by the national wage agreement. That was done on the direction of the Minister because it was said that the result of the national wage agreement for 1978 was not known when the Minister gave his direction at the end of last year. Each local authority proceeded to estimate its salaries and wages on the basis of those prevailing on 1 January 1978 without any regard to the increase everybody knew would be coming as a result of the national wage agreement. We know those estimates were cut very fine. The 11 per cent may have been adequate in some places&mdash;perhaps marginally too much, I concede&mdash;but in other places was not nearly enough. One cannot have a flat 11 per cent all over the country and be certain that everybody has enough.</P>
    <P>When the national wage agreement increase was announced the local authorities were told: you must pay it out of savings, out of the estimate introduced on the basis that there was no national wage agreement. I do not know what were the figures involved in that. But in the case of, say, Dublin Corporation, Cork Corporation, or indeed any county council it must have amounted to a very substantial sum of money having regard to the number of people employed by local authorities and their salaries. The local authorities are told they will have to pay it out of savings. That is a polite way of saying they will have to cut back on something. There are two things only on which one can cut back: one is service and the other wages and salaries. If we are to have a repetition of that, we are certainly reaching a stage where local authorities will not be in a position to provide services which are necessary. Up to now, it was always left to the councils to bring in a rate.  Provided it was adequate, it was all right.</P>
    <P>Section 13 says that the striking of a rate shall no longer be a reserved function <Col N="127" /> but the explanatory memorandum that comes out with it gives an explanation in regard to that particular section which I find very hard to accept. It says it is designed merely to simplify the procedure for making a rate and to do away with the second meeting for signing the book. I do not accept that but it is there in black and white and in my opinion it was necessary to put it in if there was not to be conflict between some other section and section 10 of this Bill. Section 10 effectively ensures that the striking of a rate is no longer a reserved function and section 13 is simply calling a spade a spade. I would be anxious to hear from the Minister for the Environment who has as much knowledge of rural Ireland and local authorities as I have. I would like him to spell out what functions of any reality or any consequence local authorities are to perform from now on. I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that this Bill simply spells the end of local democracy.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for directions which may be given to local authorities telling them how this Bill is to be implemented. This legislation is retrospective legislation at its worst, going back to 1 November 1977 as from the 1 January 1978.  On the last occasion I dealt at some length with the machinery for implementing section 15. We had a circular from the Custom House to local authorities monitoring the day-to-day, week-to-week and month-to-month workings of the county concils. They were to report&mdash;I do not know how often but very frequently&mdash;to the Custom House telling them how they were getting on, whether there was any danger of them going outside their estimates, what bills have been paid and what bills have not been paid.  It was a most insulting circular to send out to a responsible local authority. It was treating them like spendthrift children who could not be trusted even to live within the estimates imposed on them by the Minister for the Environment without the overlording and overlooking of the Custom House. Most of us in this House commenced public life in local authorities, whether they were urban <Col N="128" /> authorities or city councils or city corporations. Looking back on it, I believe we thought we were doing something worthwhile, that we were making a worthwhile contribution to the administration of our localities. It was because we gave a reasonable account of ourselves there that we found our way into the national Parliament.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how councillors will continue to serve in the straitjacket which this Bill puts them into.  There will not be the same competition for the position of county manager as there was before this Bill came into Parliament.  Up to now, county managers took pride in their job. county.  They took pride in their job. They developed a good relationship and an excellent partnership between themselves and their councillors and, between them, they exercised their collective wisdom in the best interests of the areas they served.</P>
    <P>I do not care how long a person's memory is here. It will be found that the number of authorities that had to be removed from office for failing to discharge their statutory duties as they should since the State was founded could be counted on the fingers of one hand. I am not very far wrong in that estimate. That is all I want to say about local democracies. I believe this is a bad day's work.  Any measure that is prompted not by the welfare of the area but by the welfare of a political party, as this was, is bound to have the sort of consequences that we are seeing here. This Bill was introduced on 14 December 1977 to implement the promise in the Fianna Fáil manifesto which was inserted to get votes and got plenty of votes. There was no preelection thought given to whether the proposal to abolish rates would have any ill effects or how it would be worked or whether there was any other way of doing it. It is only now, nearly 12 months after, that we are discussing this Bill. It was introduced before the Christmas vacation to give the impression that it was ready and that they had the machinery to implement the manifesto promise but back we come after Christmas and there is not a sound. It is still being hatched up and worked on in the Department of Local <Col N="129" /> Government&mdash;the Department of the Environment as it now is&mdash;the Department of Finance and the Offices of the Parliamentary Draftsmen, and it did not see the light of day officially until 30 May. We know that the unofficial Government documentation was leaked and we know from that&mdash;because we could not be expected not to read it&mdash;that there were differences of opinion in the Cabinet and in the Departments as to how it should be implemented.</P>
    <P>So here we have it now and we have the results&mdash;the end of parliamentary democracy.  The second charge I make against this Bill is that it does not implement the Fianna Fáil manifesto under the heading of local government, page 20, which says that there will be no rate content in the rent paid by tenants of privately rented accommodation. Ask the thousands of people living in rented flats and rented private houses throughout the country whether they have had any rates content in their rent since 1 January last, and the answer from 95 or 96 per cent of them will be that they have had no change and are still paying rates.  The only difference is that the landlord is enjoying a fatter rent.</P>
    <P>The Minister presumably takes the view that when this Bill becomes an Act it will implement the part of the manifesto which said that there would be no rates content in the rent paid by tenants of privately rented accommodation. Presumably the Minister believes that and has been advised to that effect. If that is so, the Minister owes restitution to thousands of tenants of rented private houses who have been paying rates in their rent since 1 January last. Many of these people were students who occupied flats in this city from 1 January until June of this year and who went home when the universities closed. They will never get their money back. Will the Minister make restitution to them?  Did the Minister take this manifesto promise seriously? Practically no tenant of a private house has received the benefit of this derating since 1 January. It was a shabby trick to play on the tenants of private accommodation for the purpose of getting a vote.</P>
    <P>The document says that rates will be <Col N="130" /> abolished from January 1978. A more accurate way of putting that would have been to say that from 1978 private landlords will enjoy greater net rents, because that is what has happened. If the Minister had written into the manifesto that for the year 1978 there would be no reduction in the rent of private houses or flats but that the landlords would enjoy bigger net rents, would he have got the number of votes he got in Dublin?  I challenge the Minister to tell me of any way by which these people will have their rates repaid to them. The only people who can be sure of benefiting from the provisions of this Bill in regard to relief of rates in rented premises are those living in controlled premises where the rent is broken down, where the rent is shown under a number of headings&mdash;the basic rent, the addition for repairs, the addition for inflation and the addition for rates.  These items are isolated in controlled houses and people living in such houses will get the benefit. Gradually over the years since the Second World War, and drastically in the 1960s, houses became controlled; but the number of controlled houses now is about 4 or 5 per cent of the dwellings and flats let. These are the only people to which this document is worth a damn.</P>
    <P>Even when this measure becomes law it will not and cannot ensure that the rate content of these rents will be abolished, because there is nothing to prevent the landlord of an uncontrolled dwelling from negotiating a new rent on the change of tenant. If a tenant decides to stand his ground and stay, there is nothing to prevent the landlord from serving him a notice to quit on the tenant and then either ejecting him or negotiating a new rent with him. This Bill is not worth anything to the tenant who seeks relief of rates. Tenants were promised this relief in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, but they were tricked.</P>
    <P>The Flatdwellers Association have thrown up their hands in despair. They know that the Bill is valueless. They know they have been tricked over the last 12 months.  They know that even when the Bill is law it will not work and they are looking for some other way of getting the promised relief. I have experience, <Col N="131" /> in my professional capacity over the years, in dealing with Rent Act cases and I invite the Minister to tell me how he can ensure that a tenant of an uncontrolled dwelling will get the benefit of the manifesto in respect of rates. The Minister appreciates the difficulty and I would not be surprised to see him come in with some amendment on Committee Stage. However, an amendment will not do; he will simply have to have a completely different approach, an approach which will have nothing to do with rates.</P>
    <P>Those are the major points I wish to make on this measure. It is a Committee Stage measure and on Committee Stage we shall be introducing amendments to give effect to the manifesto although I cannot think of any amendments that can really give effect to that manifesto. I trust that the Minister has at his command full-time advisers to deal with this whole area of landlords, tenants and rents and that these advisers will be framing an amendment to this measure. It is essential that tenants of private houses reap the benefit of this legislation. In the various policy documents issued by the Government there is expressed the desire that as many people as possible would be taken off local authority housing lists by providing houses for themselves. That aspiration is contained both in the White Paper and the Green Paper but not so long ago a circular was issued from the Custom House to every local authority quoting the White Paper in regard to people building houses for themselves in the hope that eventually there would be less demand on local authorities to provide houses. However, local authorities were advised to scrutinise closely the incomes of people who were seeking rented accommodation and to ensure that those people who could be regarded as being in a position to provide their own accommodation be removed from the housing list.  Indeed, this circular was a shocking document because it went further and advised that loans being sanctioned by local authorities should be fine-combed and that no longer should the certificate of the employer be accepted as evidence of the income of the applicant but that income <Col N="132" /> should be checked against the PAYE certificate issued by the inspector of taxes. This is the way in which these people are to be squeezed out of the public housing sector and into the private housing sector. This is to be done on the assumption that they will be able to get cheaper houses and that rents will be less. But I have been pointing out that this will not be the case.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i>: I have no intention of doing that. I am making the case that this measure does not provide in the private sector the rates relief that was promised and that it is absolutely important that this relief be given because those who are being catered for in the public sector are being squeezed out and thrown into the private sector although houses are not available in the sector. We know that some of these people will have to rely on renting houses in the private sector because housing finance has dried up completely and there is no way in which people can buy houses. Consequently, they will be at the mercy of people who may charge what rents they wish. In this situation demand will be growing in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To illustrate my point I met a married man recently who has an account with a building society to the extent of £2,500. He is not yet 30 and with his wife has been saving that money since February 1977. He bought a house in Kildare for £15,000. His income is almost £5,000 per year. He sought a building society loan of £11,000 but would have managed with a loan of £9,000. He was not able to get a loan. This was before the public knew about the squeeze. Although that man is in a secure State job and had saved so much money he failed to get a building society loan of £9,000. He was not successful in negotiating a bank loan either. Yet, the <Col N="133" /> circular from the Custom House to local authorities was to the effect that every effort should be made to have people removed from the housing list.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i>: Mercedes are not good for bone. The case I am making is that this measure does not give rates relief but that on the basis of its giving rates relief people are being removed from the local authority housing list either in respect of houses or of loans and are being forced into private rented accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be my wish that on Committee Stage we could produce amendments that would make for a good measure but I cannot visualise any experience I have <Col N="134" /> producing amendments that will make something worthwhile of this useless legislation in so far as the rented sector is concerned. The Bill derates privately-owned houses and implements the relevant paragraph of the manifesto to that extent but it falls down in regard to the rented sector and destroys local democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Fizpatrick that we cannot really deal with this Bill until we get to the Committee Stage. It is only right at this stage to give an indication, as far as this side of the House is concerned, that we will be spending a lot of time on the Committee Stage. If the Government have any ideas about there being a short Committee Stage debate I can assure them that as far as the Chair allows us there will be a very full and comprehensive Committee Stage debate and that there will be a lot of amendments, including one which will have the effect of giving real benefit to the flatdwellers in relation to getting the benefit of the abolition of rates.</P>
      <P>There are three elements of this Bill which are objectionable to this side of the House. The first is that it severely undermines the stature of local democracy and strengthens the tendency, which has existed in this State since 1922, to convert our system of local democracy into a system of local administration.</P>
      <P>The second objection we have is that one of the provisions of the Bill will severely penalise some local authorities who have seen expansion in recent years in regard to new houses. I refer to the section where local authorities who have had a lot of housing which benefited from the nine year remission of rates provision, and where the value of that housing will be frozen at mid valuation, will be deprived of substantial amount of revenue which they would have otherwise been entitled to at a time when they are most in need of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A local authority who have seen a considerable increase in the number of new houses within a period of nine years, and certainly within a period of four or five years, will be confronted with a lot of demands for services which <Col N="135" /> can only be provided by local authorities, services such as library services, playground facilities and so forth. Such facilities are not provided when those houses are built. The proposal in the Bill in that area is totally unacceptable to us.</P>
    <P>The third area which is totally unacceptable to us is the &ldquo;con job&rdquo; which has been done on flatdwellers in private rented accommodation. As well as that, we are putting on to the Statute Book legal nonsense in the form devised by the Minister and his professional advisers. We are doing no service to democracy, we are doing absolutely no service to the flatdwellers and we are simply confounding the legal processes with more gobbledegook legislation.  This may be meat and drink to some solicitors but, if my knowledge of the legal profession is up to date, that kind of legislation will deter solicitors from taking on cases of genuine hardship where flatdwellers should be entitled to get some benefit from the abolition of rates.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of flat accommodation in the constitutency which Deputy Moore and I represent. The effect of trying to work out the benefit that a flatdweller in a multi-let unit of accommodation in our constituency, where there may be as many as 12 bedsitters in a house in Pembroke Road, should receive by way of relief of rates will really cause legal chaos at worst and at best will clutter up the Statute Book with laws which cannot be effectively implemented. The Minister would be better advised if he said that the rates promise the Government made in the manifesto, along with a lot of the other promises, was really for election purposes and that they can only deliver part of their promise with regard to the abolition of rates to private owners of residential buildings and certain other sections contained in this Bill but that with regard to relief for flatdwellers in private rented accommodation their interests can only be served by a proper reform of the Landlord and Tenant legislation. That would be a much more effective proposal. It would end all the confusion in this House between the Minister for <Col N="136" /> Justice and the Minister for the Environment about who has responsibility for the position of flatdwellers.</P>
    <P>I thought the previous Government had finally sorted out the division of responsibility between the Department of Justice and the Department of Local Government, as it was then, in this area but it now appears that we are back to the old confusion where the Minister for Justice on more than one occasion shuffled the ball to the Minister for the Environment. The Minister should withdraw all the sections which relate to giving relief to flatdwellers in private rented accommodation. Many members of his party are landlords and if he talks to them he will know how impractical his proposals are. The proposals in the Bill do not give any benefit to flatdwellers.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was rather short when one bears in mind the size of this Bill.  There has been considerable delay in introducing it to the House.  This can be interpreted in a number of ways. The harshest way to interpret it is that the Minister has been grossly incompetent. This party have had the benefit of many years in Government. They announced in the middle of the 1973 General Election campaign that rates would be abolished. It has been frequently mentioned since that they had the benefit, while in Opposition, of a democratically enforced retreat with the assistance of a think tank headed by all sorts of whizz kids throughout the country. If it has taken the Government this length of time to get this Bill drafted it is a reflection on their incompetence or a reflection on the Parliamentary Draftsman. A great disservice has been done to democracy and indeed to local authorities who are still in the position of not knowing where they stand with regard to finance.  The Minister and his Department should seriously consider whether or not a service is being done to local authorities throughout the country by the Custom House when in the middle of October they do not know what the position is and the law still has not been passed in relation to the abolition of rates. This shows very imcompetent Government by the Fianna Fail Party who are now in office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> The Minister said that the need to modify the rating system and its impact on domestic property had been frequently admitted in the past, that several investigations and studies of the rating system had been undertaken in recent years and that they had been prompted more than anything else by the basic dissatisfaction at the way in which the rates bore on householders.  He went on to say that no fundamental solution to this problem had emerged until the Fianna Fail proposal to give total relief on domestic rates. That is not true. That is a simplistic interpretation of the volume of work that has been done in the Customs House, work that was published by a Fianna Fail predecessor of the Minister, Deputy Molloy, in the White Paper of 1972. There was a substantial review of the whole question of local government finance.  Proposals were made for the reform of the rating system, not only in that White Paper but by other people involved in local finance. To claim that no fundamental solution to the problem emerged until Fianna Fail came up with the election votecatcher is not a statement of fact.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the position of registered guest houses under the Tourist Traffic Act. He said they would only qualify for relief where they were mixed hereditaments. I am surprised that the Minister who, indirectly, has responsibility for tourism has seen fit to exclude local guest houses. I am surprised that the obvious representations that must have come from the Department of Tourism and Bord Fáilte have not been met by the Department.  I would be interested in an estimate of the possible loss of revenue that would result if all the registered guest houses were included in this provision.  I can readily accept that the Minister will come under considerable pressure from Deputies on both sides of the House to broaden the scope of the relief and I can see the dead hand of the Department of Finance steeling their resolve not to widen the scope of it. In this instance I thought there was a valid reason for including guest houses and I am surprised that the Minister saw fit to deal with it as he did in his speech.</P>
    <P>The question of clubs was dealt with <Col N="138" /> as well but I think we can leave that until Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that section 5 of the Bill deals with rented accommodation other than small dwellings. He goes on to say that the section is long and complex but that its object is simple. For a tenant who was not previously directly liable for rates, the section provides the right to an allowance from the landlord equal to the rates element obtaining in his rent before removal of domestic rates. The objective may be simple but it is totally obscured by the proposed legislative framework contained in the Bill. With all the skill and resources of the Department behind them, it is a pity that they were not capable of introducing a simpler method of obtaining such relief or adopting the more honest course, in the event of being unable to do so, which would be to say &ldquo;We have looked at this in detail and we cannot provide it. Relief for flatdwellers will have to be found in some other way.&rdquo;  Since the Custom House is going to be effectively run by the Department of Finance when this Bill becomes law, recourse could have been had to the Department of Finance to see if some kind of direct relief could be given to flatdwellers by way of PAYE rather than through the gobbledegook in section 5.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech there is a very curious sentence which underlines the Fianna Fail attitude to local democracy. The Minister said there was a need to ensure the continued harmony of local and other programmes of expenditure. He also said there was a need to take reasonable measures to protect the interests of non-domestic ratepayers, including farmers, small shopkeepers, people with businesses of one kind or another who remained liable for rates. There is certainly that need, but who is it to be provided by?  I would have thought that that need should be provided by the elected democratic councils within which these farms and small businesses are located, as many representatives of such groups are frequently elected to councils. In many local authorities, particularly urban district councils, it is not unusual to have people who are, in effect, independent councillors but who are clearly <Col N="139" /> identified with certain business interests in a general sense.  Can one detect from that sentence that the Minister does not really trust local councils to protect the interests of non-domestic rate-payers? Does this not reinforce the first basic fear that I outlined that local councils are a bit of a joke; that if the interest of non-domestic ratepayers are to be seriously protected they cannot be protected by local councillors directly elected by such business interests but must be protected by Big Brother government in the Custom House.</P>
    <P>I may be reading too much into that sentence but it is an inference that can be reasonably taken.  Indeed, the Minister does not go on to specify how that need is to be dealt with other than by the general provisions of the Bill, or how the position of such non-domestic ratepayers is to be specifically protected. In so far as one can take anything from the sentence, which is not elaborated, it underlines the basic contempt for the autonomy of local democracy which pervades this legislation.</P>
    <P>In this speech the Minister referred to the way in which the allowance will be made by the Department.  One sentence, on which I should like to compliment the Minister or the person responsible for it, refers to the Minister proposing effectively to remove one of the last remaining powers of the local council, which is the reserve function with regard to striking of the rates. The following beautifully phrased piece of English, which obscures the importance of what is behind the action, reads: &ldquo;Elected members are at present required by law to become involved at the &lsquo;rates&rsquo; meeting in endorsing the applotment of the rates. The applotment must be carried out in strict accordance with the effective decision taken by the council at their estimates meeting. It is therefore a function proper to the ordinary routine administration and clerical procedures of a local authority and section 13 relieves the council of the duty of treating it as a policy matter proper to the elected council&rdquo;.  It is very nicely and casually inserted that local councillors are being relieved of a rather tedious duty. Since when has the striking of the rate been routine administration? <Col N="140" /> All I can say is that, again, it is a conscious effort by the Ministers and the movers of this Bill to play down the long-term implications built into the provisions of this section. To dismiss it in this casual way underlines the valid suspicion which the Labour Party and I have of that section.</P>
    <P>Finally, the last section of the Minister's speech, which should be flushed out, refers to the whole question of valuations, and valuation of new property since effectively 1 November last, or certainly last autumn, must be examined in detail and also the role of the Valuation Office and whether that office will remain the responsibility of the Minister for Finance or be transferred, as was proposed at some stage, to the Department of the Environment. The Minister should give some clear indication on this at the end of this debate because I understand the Valuation Office does not know what it is supposed to be doing at present; there is no clear policy in regard to future valuation of domestic, residential property.  That is a totally unsatisfactory situation. The Valuation Office is wondering what the Government decisions are likely to be, when will it have a firm directive and what it is supposed to be doing. That area should be clarified.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there was no real fundamental solution to the whole question of local government taxation. Yet Fianna Fail came up with the popular election gimmick of abolishing rates altogether. I remind the Minister and other Fianna Fail Deputies who will praise the popular prospect of the abolition of rates&mdash;with which nobody on this side of the House fundamentally disagrees&mdash;that we do not propose nor will we be put in the position of appearing to propose that rates should be reintroduced. Both sides of the House agree that rates should be phased out and abolished. We are not talking about the validity of the abolition of rates but how local democracy is to be financed and the relationship of a local council to central government and to a lesser extent, although it is an important issue, the rights of tenants in private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fail administration who <Col N="141" /> went out of office in 1973 and who perhaps were not noted for their verbal skill in the Department of Local Government&mdash;there being other things on their minds&mdash;published a White Paper in which the main proposals in regard to local taxation and finance&mdash;I am reading from the summary on page 2 of the White Paper&mdash;stated that it was essential that local authorities should have power to levy local taxes.  Have the members of that Government which published this White Paper, who are now senior members of the present Government, changed their views in regard to the power of local authorities to levy local taxes?  They said that if local government were to survive as such these local taxes should be capable of meeting a significant proportion of local expenditure.  Would the Minister indicate what he, his Department and the Government regard as a significant proportion of local expenditure?  Does he anticipate that the trend in reducing the balance between local taxes which is moving very rapidly in favour of central government, will increase and if so would he indicate what would be considered by him to be a significant proportion of local expenditure?</P>
    <P>The last point in the summary is now history where it says the Government have decided that only the local rates satisfy the criteria required of a major local tax and that the real issue is not the abolition of the rating system with all the consequences involved for local financial independence and taxpayers but the reform of the system so as to eliminate its undoubted defects.  We are probably too far down the line to talk about the Government's attitude in regard to that proposal.</P>
    <P>Proposals were summarised in Chapter 5 and I should like the Minister to give his views on these.  The first one which relates to the comment at the end of the Minister's speech, states that the existing valuation system must be reformed urgently, that arrangements would be made for the transfer of responsibility from the Valuation Office to the Minister for Local Government&mdash;now obviously the Minister for the Environment&mdash;and that the Minister should prepare a series of measures for a <Col N="142" /> practical reform of the valuation system with provision for bringing valuations ultimately to full current value.  There are many other proposals in the White Paper and many are very good.  They should have been enacted long ago.  I do not know why there is delay in doing many of these things.  Do we have some extraordinary shortage of parliamentary draftsmen so that there is a limit to the number of legislative provisions we can get through the House in any year?</P>
    <P>The whole question of the autonomy of a local authority is raised in this Bill and the Minister has not properly or adequately dealt with the status of the local authority when the Bill becomes law.  In a very interesting book published by the Institute of Public Administration called <i>Problems of Irish Local Finance</i> by Donal de Buitleir, he comments at the end of the book on the future development of local government and observes that most of the services and facilities that local authorities currently operate are services and facilities that were attached to local councils towards the end of the last century.  Quoting from T.J. Barrington's article on administration on page 73 of this book, he states that if local government is to maintain its place in the overall development of the country it will have to concern itself with new as well as old functions.  Barrington is perhaps our most noted authority on local government and certainly outside detailed description of every boreen in Kerry it is probably his one true passion and no other person probably has as much commitment to the re-enforcement and extension of a proper local democratic system.  If the Minister shares that view of T.J. Barrington could he indicate how a local authority could set about the acquisition of new functions if this Bill becomes law?  What procedures will there be for the sanctioning of new functions?  What kind of financial autonomy will a local authority have for the funding of such functions?  I share Barrington's concern about the vitality of local democracy only surviving if it has the power and initiative to take unto itself new functions.</P>
    <P>My most recent experience, an experience shared between Deputy Moore and myself, was the substantial involvement <Col N="143" /> of Dublin Corporation in areas of recreation and cultural support of various kinds from musical societies up to the Dublin Theatre Festival.  That was made possible and we were able to raise money under the old system by simply putting a charge on the rates to do something which the council by a majority considered a good idea.  I should like the Minister to clarify how a local authority can set about doing this since it is not clarified in this legislation and state what their autonomy will be, not simply in ordering priorities&mdash;that is not the answer I want&mdash;but how they can add to their existing range of services something they democratically decide is of benefit to the community.  I am open to correction and would be happy to be corrected but it is not clear from my reading of the Bill that there are no restrictions of this kind.</P>
    <P>The major weakness in this area is that the method for financing local authorities, for calculating the replacement of the rate by the Department of the Environment, is not made law.  The formula whereby the Department will come up with a certain percentage indicated in this legislation.  There is no access to it and there is no way in which local authorities can have legal and statutory access to a particular guaranteed formula.  That is the fundamental weakness here.  That is why this side of the House can criticise validly this Bill as being a fundamental danger and threat to the future of local government.  The system whereby the Department of the Environment can calculate the increase for any given year is a system that is totally clouded behind the doors of that Department and, in the final analysis, it will not even be determined by the Minister or his officials but probably by a principal officer somewhere in the Department of Finance.  That is the tragedy of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister would have got considerable support from many sections of the community for a Bill that set out to do what was the popular thing and something that was agreed by all sides of this House, namely, the abolition of rates on domestic property.  They have <Col N="144" /> been neglected for so long probably they were beyond reform.  However, in that populist approach the Minister is throwing out everything.  He is throwing out the autonomy of local authorities also. As a former member of a local council, I know there is not much public respect for local authorities.  Any person who is or was a member of a local authority knows the general disregard, unfortunately, in which local authorities are held by the public.  The &ldquo;Ballymagash Urban District Council&rdquo; have not exactly helped the image, although they have provided a lot of entertaining television. The reality is that the same local councillors are voluntary, part-time public representatives and they provide an extraordinary range of services.  The public will be ill-served if their powers are reduced because they have a much better understanding of the needs of an area than any well-intentioned principal officer buried somewhere in the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Previously it was understandable and reasonable to expect that local authority members would object to any whittling away of their powers but now a new force has entered into the debate and that is the voice of the country and city managers throughout the country.  I know the Minister is aware of their feelings. Obviously they cannot take to the hustings like other people but the Department of the Environment know very well the fears and concerns now expressed by city and county managers. Nowhere in the Bill is there a clear indication of how their financial position will be calculated.  There is no indication regarding the provisions for calculating the rate in any one year.  In the main these professional managers have served the country very well but, for the first time, they are considerably worried at the long-term implications of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Let us have no illusions about the matter.  I believe the Minister has sincere intentions in this area but undoubtedly the day will come when there will be a recession in the economy.  Undoubtedly the day will come when a certain school of economic thought will be in control in the Department of Finance and public expenditure will have to be seriously curtailed. The area where it can most readily <Col N="145" /> be curtailed is in an area such as this where there are no legal safeguards for local authorities, other than that &ldquo;the Minister may direct, in consultation with the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  There is no indication as to what the formula should be, how it should be calculated or that it should be not less than the rate for the previous year.  There has been no attempt to come up with any formula but yet the Minister has gone to incredible lengths to produce a gobbledgook formula&mdash;if I might use such unparliamentary language&mdash;for flatdwellers in private rented accommodation.  His energy could have been far more creatively channelled into coming up with a formula that every local authority could regard as giving them some reasonable protection and guarantee of revenue from the State for the area where they are now losing revenue as a result of the abolition of rates on domestic property.</P>
    <P>That is the major weakness of this legislation.  It has taken the Government one and a half years to produce the Bill, or at least to get it to its present stage. Fianna Fail were in opposition for four years and they reiterated frequently that it was not an election gimmick in 1973. They told us they had worked out all the implications and that it was serious policy.  I recall vividly my colleague on the Dublin City Council, Deputy Moore, stating that Fianna Fail had worked out a policy as to how it was to be carried out.  There is no evidence of how it is to be done other than in the secret files&mdash;those that are not leaked&mdash;in the Department of the Environment.  Until we get some indication as to what will be that formula we cannot be expected to accept the sweet and honeyed language of the Minister's speech and say that the striking of the rate is a routine, clerical and administrative function and so on and why bother the councillors by taking them in for another special meeting to strike the rate.</P>
    <P>In my view a local authority member has only two real effective powers.  The striking of the rate is one and the other is the revision or the drafting of a development plan.  Half of the effective democratic powers of a local councillor are being taken away without any <Col N="146" /> replacement.  After the noises made by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, and if I am right by the Minister for the Environment, with regard to a factory in County Clare, the whole question of the planning laws may be subject to some kind of tightening from central government.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if I have gone on at length on this section.  I did so in order to give reasonable notice to the Minister and to his advisers that on the section we will be expecting from him some clear indication as to how this magic formula functions, what its components are, what guarantees the local authorities have and the basis of the calculations.</P>
    <P>The other area that is particularly savage and one that has been swept away&mdash;perhaps because it is not readily understood by most people&mdash;is the impact the Bill will have on those local authorities who have had a massive expansion in house building in the past seven years.</P>
    <P>The Bill in effect proposes to freeze valuations at whatever stage they would be in the nine-year phased reduction. For example, if an estate was built in north County Dublin, south County Dublin or any local authority area around this country and if the valuation of each house was £27 or thereabouts and the house is three years old now, my understanding of this provision&mdash;and again I am subject to correction from the Minister&mdash;is that the current valuation of those houses would be £9 and not £27.  Therefore, the revenue that the local authority can expect from the Department of the Environment would be the rate as decided by that Department multiplied by the factor of nine and not the factor of 27.  This would occur in an area which by definition is a raw development area and there would be endless requests for, first of all, probably finishing the estate because if it is a private estate the local developer will not have completed it or handed it over. There would be demands once it is in charge to have certain facilities provided.  There would be demands in an area like north County Dublin for a host of other essential neighbourhood facilities, and those demands would fall properly and rightly on the local <Col N="147" /> representatives.  Yet the revenue that the local authority would have for these houses would be far less than they would have for houses in built-up areas where the nine-year remission would not exist and where presumably a lot of local facilities had already been met.  If ever an injustice was built into the system, surely that is it.  The people who need most are getting least and the people who need very little, relatively speaking, are getting the full whack.  That is based on our own calculations of how this provision will work, and the Minister's Second Stage speech was not a model of illumination in indicating how all the sections are anticipated to function.</P>
    <P>The only other information of elaboration that we have from the Government side of the House on this section is from the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  i am speaking from memory because I have not got my note of his reply.  He justified this proposal on the grounds that areas where there are new housing estates are areas where there are likely to be more housing estates and in time the general increase in the full valuation which will come from those areas will more or less balance out; local authorities are already losing a certain amount of revenue anyway by virtue of the fact that remission of rates is operating in these areas.  When this Bill becomes law all the new houses in the new housing estates in such a local authority area will come in at the full valuation and that will therefore cancel out any loss of revenue implied in the freezing of current valuations.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development frequently makes nonsense sound extremely plausible, but to my untutored economic ears the case as he presented it was not convincing The Ceann Comhairle was correct in not allowing a debate at Question Time and so the matter could not be pursued, but I would like with regard to that section to get a very clear indication of the precise financial impact that this is likely to have on local authorities where a large number of their houses have been built within the last five years.  That would indicate that they were getting less than 50 <Col N="148" /> per cent of the revenue that they could otherwise have got because of the full valuation.  That section is a sleight of hand brought in at the behest of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Implicit in the abolition of rates was an explosion of public expenditure in certain local authorities.  It would be very welcome public expenditure because those local authorities, by virtue of the fact that so many new houses have been built in the last few years, are crying out for local authority finance. The Minister has drawers and drawers full of applications for sanction for various proposals from such local authorities.  This would have been an equitable and just way of providing such local authorities with an additional amount of money that they could usefully put to use on projects that are already identified and that are badly needed by the people moving into those estates. Unfortunately, that was not to be the case because the Fianna Fáil Party had already given away too much money as it was, although in most cases to people who did not need it.</P>
    <P>So we have another indication in this little section buried in this financial provision Bill of the order of priorities that now rest on the conservative side of this House which unfortunately has over the years sought increasingly to favour the few at the expense of the many and not the other way round.  It is done discreetly and apparently for administrative purposes or for routine clerical administration which was the phrase used to describe one of the major powers now remaining to a local councillor.  The questions asked so far have not elicited the full adequate information required.  If my memory serves me rightly from written reply today, information on the impact on such local authorities of this mixture of houses at different states of rates remission is still not available to the Department.  We will be looking for some indication from the Minister as to how exactly he anticipates this will have an impact on the local authorities and what projection for increased finance they are going to have in years to come from planning permissions that are currently in or from indications of the houses to be built in such local <Col N="149" /> authorities.  It is only fair that a local authority should be able to anticipate what their revenue will be over the next couple of years.  Very few local authority projects have a gestation period of 12 months.  Most of them, even small amenity schemes, start and end in a period greater than 12 months and therefore they are hamstrung by the financial year of 12 months and the tight reining in of the local authority by the discipline of the 12 months.</P>
    <P>I move now to the question of administration by the present Minister and his Department of the <i>de facto</i> situation of the abolition of rates since January 1978 and the preliminary <i>de jure</i> situation that we are in now.  On behalf of every local authority in the country I protest vehemently at the cavalier way in which local authorities have been treated in that we are standing here today, the second week in October, and local authorities, as I have checked with a number of officials, still have no indication from the Custom House what the percentage increase is to be in this year's rates.  Either the Minister does not know&mdash;which is one indication of how incompetent this Administration have become&mdash;or the Minister for Finance is not yet in a position to tell how much he is going to get.  Alternatively, he knows and he is playing some game of nerves with county managers up and down the country.  One way or the other, whatever interpretation the Minister cares to put on the present factual situation, he is either incompetent or he is deliberately trying to undermine the local government structure.  If he knows what the percentage increase is going to be, by whatever magic formula he has buried in the Custom House to produce it, why have not local managers been given some indication sooner than now?  If the Minister knows, he must have known for some time because the overall financial constraints within which the Government have been operating have been clearly indicated&mdash;at least we have been told they were clearly indicated&mdash;in green papers and white papers, by economic gurus and professional advisers since the budget of January.</P>
    <P>In the area of public expenditure the <Col N="150" /> only solid promise that Fianna Fail are now prepared to deliver on out of their total economic package is the commitment, reiterated by the Taoiseach at the annual luncheon of the CII, to reduce the level of foreign borrowings as a percentage of GNP.  There are enough macro-economic indicators to my untutored mind to give some idea of what the percentage is likely to be.  If the Minister knows what that percentage is and if he can sit here comfortably and say that local authorities have not been officially told what that percentage is how can he reasonably expect local authority members to prepare their estimates properly or responsibly?  How can he reasonably expect county and city managers to get on with the job of running an administration?  In my view the Government know what the percentage is but there is a deliberate campaign to withhold this information for two reasons.  First, because the percentage is fairly small and, secondly, there is an attempt which is implied in all the clauses and throw away remarks in the Minister's speech to undermine the credibility of local councils and show them as being not capable of doing the job.  The Minister is withholding basic information so that the estimates cannot be dealt with in a proper manner.  More to the point, they cannot be adequately debated by local authority members.</P>
    <P>The Minister is undermining the capacity of local authorities to administer their affairs responsibly.  I may be accused of making a political point out of such a matter or being unfair but what alternative can one put on the present factual situation?  I qualified my remark by saying that to the best of my knowledge the Department have not formally or informally indicated to some of the major local authorities what the percentage increase will be this year.  For that reason my charges must be seen as valid and must stick.  We are approaching a year when local elections will be held, a time when local councillors on top of the normal reasons for wanting to improve and increase facilities will have an additional reason. Because the percentage is being withheld from public knowledge managers and local councillors have been put in the <Col N="151" /> position of having to say that they cannot consider anything until they know how much money they will get.  If the Minister delays on this long enough, as appears to be the tactic, local councillors will not be able to put up serious proposals for funding because the manager will be able to say that because the estimates must be completed before the end of the year the matter would be considered later.</P>
    <P>In my view that is a correct assessment of the situation.  I would be happy to get a denial from the Minister but I would be surprised if he made reference to it.  The net effect on local democracy, whatever about the short term effect on the electoral support for Fianna Fail, will be to drive a further nail into their now substantial and leadened coffin.  The Minister should seriously review the action of his Department in this area.  I can see that there would be some political reason for a party who desperately need to control as many local authorities as possible, in order to give effect to the cuts in public expenditure that will emanate from central Government, not telling local councillors; but surely the Minister and his officials could have given some discreet guidelines to managers in August or September to enable them revise estimates.</P>
    <P>If one couples the actions of the Minister for the Environment since he was appointed with the actions of Fianna Fail in opposition in regard to their proposal for the abolition of rates and the text of this Bill one can only come to one overall conclusion: that Fianna Fáil want to destroy local democracy.  They will use all their experience and all their undoubted skills at undermining it and taking away its credibility.  In various ways they will pressure it in such a fashion that local authorities will become discredited either from a career point of view because the salary levels of the higher officials are below what the market now carries&mdash;the evidence is there in the much publicised resignation of the county manager in Cork&mdash;or, alternatively, people who do not wish to become involved in national politics will not become involved in local politics for the reason that there will be <Col N="152" /> no effective powers or functions left with local councils.  Increasingly we will unfortunately get people of less ability and calibre than would otherwise be attracted to local councils if the powers and structures of those councils had not been whittled away.</P>
    <P>In the context of that analysis, the Minister's admission that some means will have to be found to protect the interests of non-domestic ratepayers begins to take on some new meaning and make new sense.  Perhaps the Minister realises what the implications of his own action are and the fact that non-domestic ratepayers&mdash;certainly the business community&mdash;will have to be protected from what might be considered by the Minister, or his supporters, to be irresponsible action by local councils.  There is a pattern woven in the speeches, announcements and circulars emanating from the Department of the Environment which adds up to a reasonable conclusion, destroy local democracy because it takes too much electoral effort to try to control every local council.  It is not to be destroyed in the crude way that Kevin Boland did when he had a go at the Dublin City Council and at Bray Urban District Council because that leaves blood on the hands which can be seen but efforts are being made to whittle away totally local responsibility and set up a system where the Minister will be plagued into doing something positive because somehow or other local democracy has failed the nation. The Minister and his party will then come in and appear to save the community.</P>
    <P>If that is the case the Minister and his party are moving away from their own repeated assurances to develop and support local democratic structures. They are moving away from the aspirations of people like Mr. T.J. Barrington, one of the foremost experts on local government here.  He was clear about the need for the extension of local government. I will make reference to the provision of local authority finance in other EEC countries on Committee Stage but there is a clear consensus emerging from the local authority structures we have examined and that is the belief by central Government, whether in Denmark, <Col N="153" /> Sweden or Britain that the autonomy of local democracy must be preserved, that the autonomy of local councils should be validated and enhanced.  While there is undoubtedly a need to bring public expenditure at national and local level into some form of harmony, that can be done and is being done in other countries, but not at the expense of effectively abolishing democratic power in such local councils.  That is the kernel issue in regard to this legislation.  It is not about the abolition of domestic rates; they are effectively abolished.  This legislation is about the financing of local authority structures in this State and about the removal of certain fundamental democratic safeguards which they currently have and which this Bill proposes to take away.</P>
    <P>There is a section that relates to flat-dwellers. I said earlier that it was legislative gobbledygook and I would respectively suggest to the Minister and the Minister of State that the Government would be far better advised simply to delete section 5 altogether and to reactivate the files in the Custom House and to take on in the Department of the Environment full and clear responsibility for landlord and tenant law and to come up with an effective system of legislation covering the whole area of private rented accommodation, including guarantees for <i>bona fide</i> landlords and also proper guarantees for flat-dwellers who at present are completely victimised by our housing system.</P>
    <P>There are numerous proposals for such provisions in the records of this House.  The Government saw fit during the last session to reject a motion from the Labour Party calling for the establishment of a rents tribunal for flat dwellers.  The opponents of a rents tribunal have frequently argued that it is complex and difficult to operate and not really all that effective.  That kind of argument came from Government benches during that debate in one form or another.  A rents tribunal would not be as complicated or represent such gobbledygook as the provisions in section 5 and related sections.  Any rents tribunal would be a million light years more effective in serving the interests of flat-dwellers <Col N="154" /> than the proposals in section 5. The Government are honest with themselves when they have indicated that there is very little that can be done in the context of this legislation for flat-dwellers in private rented accommodation where the rates are included as part payment in rent and people are without any kind of fixed tenure.  Dublin south-east is probably the constituency with the largest number of flat-dwellers.  The vast majority of them&mdash;and I am sure Deputy Moore would validate this&mdash;are people who rent flats, mostly furnished flats, on a weekly or monthly basis, though there is an increasing number of one-year leases.  Most of the people who should get the benefit from the abolition of domestic rates have weekly tenancies in private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick said earlier, the reality is that these people move house so frequently that there is no way they will be able, when this Bill becomes law, to go back to a place in which they were previously tenants on 1 November and claim some kind of payment from the landlord.  There is no way they will be able to pursue this effectively in the courts.  In many cases the cost of collection of the relief would be far higher than the relief itself.  Who are the Government trying to con with this section?  They have taken a long time to draft this legislation.  For some inexplicable reason the most scarce biological species in this island appears to be a parliamentary draftsman and ours have been wasted in drafting this legal nonsense.  It is a fallacy to place the onus for collecting this benefit on a student or a young girl who has recently started work in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The political realities of promises made during an election campaign, which they did not expect to win, frequently veer away from what can be delivered.  In this instance I would seriously urge the Government to abandon this section altogether and to give a clear indication that legislation will be brought in this year establishing a rents tribunal to protect the interests of tenants, flat-dwellers in particular.  That would be the honest and correct thing to do.  That would be proper housing policy, for which the Minister has overall responsibility.  The benefit of a rents <Col N="155" /> tribunal to which many flat-dwellers do not advert is that it would secure the rights of landlords, some of which are frequently abused, and have a positive effect on the housing stock over all and would be a far more effective way of giving real substance to the manifesto promise than the proposals in this section.</P>
    <P>I have covered all the areas I wanted to cover at this stage.  As I indicated at the outset, this is a long and complex Bill which will require much detailed debate on Committee Stage.  I should be glad if the Minister would give some response to the requests for factual information contained in my remarks.  The Labour Party will be putting down a series of amendments and we will be looking for considerable time because there are so many complex and detailed provisions in this Bill which will require a lot of clarification and elaboration by the Minister before any serious comment can be made by me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that such a partisan stand has been taken on this Bill by Deputies Fitzpatrick and Quinn.  This Bill is related to the red-letter day in our history when rates were abolished.  I would ask both these Deputies whether they would restore rates on private dwellings if, by some mischance, they were back in power.  This is a question they must answer.  If in some election campaign one party were so cruel as to quote the speeches made here this evening it would be pointed out to people that the Government had to fight this Bill through the House in order that people would be given relief from rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick quoted the Fianna Fáil manifesto in regard to the abolition of rates.  For many years people from all parties have called for the abolition of rates and some years ago a body was set up which commented that the rating system was inequitable and should be replaced.  Fianna Fáil have done that but we have Deputy Quinn alleging that we have destroyed local democracy.  The rating system had been in existence for hundreds of years and it is stupid to suggest that it interferes with local democracy to abolish such a heavy <Col N="156" /> burden on young people endeavouring to own their own homes and on old people living alone on fixed incomes.  We have this hypocritical cry tonight linking the abolition of rates with a negation of local democracy.  People laughed their way to the polling booths to vote for Fianna Fáil who had promised to abolish rates on private dwellings.  I challenge Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Quinn to get up on a public platform and defend their attitude in this respect.</P>
    <P>We all know cases of young couples who when they had to pay rates were unable to keep on their houses which were repossessed by the local authorities; those people would be given inferior accommodation.  The only negation of democracy that I see is when Deputies come in here to our national parliament to try to mislead the people with their cries about negation of local democracy.  They barely merit comment because their case is absurd.</P>
    <P>Local authorities still have an important role to play.  In this context we must remember that rates on industrial and commercial undertakings are still in existence. Local democracy must carry with it social justice and that is what Fianna Fáil had been applying in this Bill.  I suppose it is as well that Labour and Fine Gael Deputies have been saying these things because it will show the people where they stand.</P>
    <P>Not alone have the Government abolished rates on private houses but they have also taken the burden from secondary schools.  In the past those schools had rates levied on them.  In those days they catered for the wealthier sections of the community and they could afford to pay the rates.  That day has gone and it is only right that those schools should get this relief.  I feel quite sure that in their hearts the Opposition agree with the abolition of rates but they do not like to see the Government get the kudos.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is still plenty of work for the local authorities to do.  The Government have issued a White Paper on the subject and I should like to see more young people entering local politics where they can get expert knowledge on housing, planning and other such important matters.  I deplore <Col N="157" /> the fact that Fine Gael and Labour have tried to downgrade the importance of local politics.  It has been said that the Government have been starving the local authorities of finance.  In my local authority there has been an 11 per cent increase in the Government's allocation. Whether the taxation is local or national, it is the people who pay it anyway and it is more equitable to spread the taxation load more widely.</P>
    <P>There are still organisations who are outside the scope of this legislation, for instance, the boy scouts.  They are still forced to pay rates on their dens.  We will have more to say on this on Committee Stage but I should like to see such centres relieved of rates.</P>
    <P>An important section of people who are suffering despite the merits of this Bill are the flatdwellers.  I know of many good, honest landlords, who have remitted the rates on the amount of rent being paid by flatholders, but there are other people who would be described in England as &ldquo;Rachmanites&rdquo; who are refusing to give any relief to the unfortunate people who are forced to live in their flats.  It should go out from here that the Government are determined to ensure that flatdwellers will be given the relief which has been given to those of us who are fortunate enough to own our own houses.  We should warn these landlords that we will not hesitate to introduce legislation which will bring them to their senses and give justice to all, to young people, boys and girls from the country who come to the city to work and are being penalised by some unscrupulous landlords who refuse to give them any of the relief they themselves will enjoy under this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We must ensure that this lesson is brought home to the landlords. I want to emphasise that the majority of landlords are acting quite decently. Those who are not acting decently and those who are inflicting suffering on many people both young and old in this city must learn that lesson.  Each week people come to public representatives to complain about the conditions of their <Col N="158" /> flats.  That is bad enough, but then the landlords try to squeeze the last penny out of them.  A large proportion of the area I represent could be called flatland. Therefore I know what I am talking about.  When one visits these flats one can see that, because of the high rents charged, many young people have to sit in dingy rooms at night and the landlord refuses to give any relief to them.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to appeal to decent landlords and perhaps appealing to the other type of landlord will not bear much fruit.  We must let them know that, in the interests of social justice, we are prepared to take such steps as are necessary to give relief to their tenants.  This might be a tough job, but it would be well worth doing and the thanks we would receive from the flatdwellers would be an adequate reward for our efforts.</P>
      <P>I appeal to Fine Gael and Labour speakers to back the Government on this Bill.  They are saying to the landlords: &ldquo;This Bill is not for real.  It is not effective.&rdquo;  We know it is.  Fine Gael and Labour speakers should say: &ldquo;We are for this Bill.  We are against unscrupulous landlords who are exploiting their tenants and we will do everything to ensure that the provisions of this Bill are implemented in the interests of social justice.&rdquo;  That is what abolishing the rates is all about.  For years some of us believed the rates should go, and at last it happened.  When I was a city councillor ratepayers' parties agitated for relief of rates but they never dreamed they would see the abolition of the system. Bernard Shaw spoke of people who saw things and asked why.  The Government saw things and asked why not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested that we are trying to undermine local government.  The man in the street does not believe that.  I cannot see what the great change is.  The council will still strike a rate, admittedly a much smaller rate, on commercial and industrial property.  That is still a reserved function.  I would ask Members of this House who are members of a local authority: have their powers been <Col N="159" /> curbed since rates were taken off houses?</P>

Many city councillors wanted to show off what great people they were by getting grants for various organisations, and whether they were cultural or not did not matter.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In the final analysis central Government always had the final decision on local taxation.  A few years ago the council were abolished for not striking a rate.  I also read that a previous Government of a different hue abolished the city council because they were employing too many men.  By its very nature local government has always <Col N="160" /> been subject to the central Government. There is no difference now that the rates have been abolished.  The powers of the local authorities have not been diminished.</P>
      <P>I hope that, when the Government present a White Paper on local government, councillors will have a new role to play.  They will be initiating bodies and this benevolent Government will ensure that the money is available to carry out their plans.  When the local authorities pass a resolution to spend more money and when the Government give them that money, they can be happy in the knowledge that the poor pensioner or the young married couple trying to buy a house will not have to provide it.  The money will come from the Central Fund through taxation and the heavier burden will fall on the shoulders of those best able to bear it.  The rates system was inequitable. If a house owner could not pay, the sheriff went in and took some of the furniture and that furniture was ultimately sold to pay the rates.  Some local representatives seemed quite happy about that kind of democracy.  The rates were being collected even at the price of breaking up homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This enlightened Government have abolished rates and householders no longer have to meet this growing burden. Remember, it was a growing burden because the rates increased every year. Where a householder was providing himself with a house with the aid of an SDA loan and failed to pay his rates the local authority repossessed the house and transferred the householder and his family, or possibly an elderly couple, to an inferior dwelling somewhere else.  Of course, these people would still have to pay rates.  We actually penalised people who tried to help themselves by providing themselves with houses.  That system has gone and even though people still have their problems they do not have to meet the burden of everincreasing rates.  One can imagine how useful that money is from the point of <Col N="161" /> view of helping to clothe the family, buy school books, and so on.</P>
    <P>In contrast to rates, taxation is an equitable system because the burden is equitably placed.  The millionaire living in a large house valued many years ago might pay the same rates as the young couple buying a house with the help of an SDA loan.  How could anyone lament the abolition of the rates on private dwellings? This is one of the most enlightened Bills ever to come before this House.  I do not claim we have a monopoly of concern for social justice, but we were concerned about the rates burden and we were determined to do something about it.  If anyone campaigns to bring back the rates we will certainly oppose him and Opposition Deputies would be very foolish to pursue that kind of campaign&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell was not here to hear Deputy Quinn&mdash;indeed, his not being here showed his wisdom&mdash;and another speaker who deplored the abolition of the rates because, they argued, it meant less power for local administrators. I am convinced the two Members who argued in that fashion have not done their homework.  I compliment the Minister and the Government on this Bill.  It is only part of the total programme directed towards improving the financing of local authorities.  There was a somewhat specious argument advanced that because rates will not be administered by local authorities we will somehow lose out.  The members of the Government are in public life.  They know what the people want and, if we can afford them, the people's demands will be met.  We have started with the abolition of the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently in another country I was asked how it was we had managed to abolish rates.  My questioner was very intrigued and I am convinced that across the channel they will examine our system here with a view to doing exactly the same thing in their country. Everybody can see how enlightened this Bill is.  I cannot understand why there should be any adverse criticism.  We <Col N="162" /> have not taken power away from local representatives.  We have abolished rates on private dwellings.  Everybody must appreciate the wisdom of that.  Indeed, it is a pity it was not done years ago. While most parties paid lip service to this, it was this Government which actually brought in legislation to get rid of the rates burden.</P>
    <P>When rates were introduced we had a different society.  At that time owners who paid direct rates were members of the wealthier classes who could afford to pay.  Society changed.  At one time the word &ldquo;ratepayer&rdquo; was synonymous with a wealthy person but that has changed in the last 20 years.  When rates were first introduced they probably served a purpose but as society changed they became a penal form of taxation and had to go.</P>
    <P>It has been said that before the general election we promised to abolish rates in order to get votes.  We put a programme before the people and this is but a part of it.  By their votes the people endorsed many other points in our manifesto and I know they would endorse them again tomorrow morning if they were given the opportunity.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition want to criticise the Bill that is their privilege and obligation, but they should not try to spoil a good Bill by implying that this is the death knell of local democracy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to welcome the abolition of domestic rates.  At the start of his speech Deputy Moore posed the question: in the event of the return of a Coalition Government, would we reimpose rates? Not alone have we made up our minds about that, but we were the first Government to abolish 25 per cent of the existing rates.  Deputy Moore spoke as if Fianna Fáil had come into power for the first time.  He said rates should have been abolished long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three days before the 1973 General Election an article appeared in the <i>Limerick Leader</i> from a then Minister saying it was not possible to abolish rates.  The same night the then Taoiseach made a statement that rates would be abolished.  I realise that that happened because Fianna Fáil were feeling jittery because after 16 years in office they had not done anything about rates.  We are <Col N="164" /> being asked to give our views on rates. We have made them very clear.  In four and a half years&mdash;and there was a recession for three and a half years of that time&mdash;we removed health charges from the rates and took away housing subsidies. It may be said that in spite of that rates increased.  Taking into consideration the years of recession, in my view that was a big achievement.</P>
    <P>The crucial question in all local authorities is finance.  In a paper published prior to the general election it was made very clear that the independence of local authorities would not be interefered with in any way.  I must comment on those words &ldquo;any way&rdquo;.  It is quite clear that that promise has been abandoned and the replacement of rates by a grant has put a new set of controls on local authorities. We all remember the 11 per cent which tied down local authorities.  Never in our history did local authority personnel and members feel more embarrassment and frustration than they did when trying to reach an estimate in a straitjacket.  One of the virtues of local government was the rates variation from area to area. Different authorities had different problems and to solve these problems they had to strike different rates.  They often increased rates to provide services which would be spread over a number of years.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister for the Environment saying that he who pays the piper calls the tune&mdash;and the Department are paying in excess of 60 per cent&mdash;but I do not think he should call the tune for the full 100 per cent. The Government are the agents for distributing taxpayers' money.  It is only fair that local authorities should be protected.</P>
    <P>Section 11 worries me more than any other section.  It compels local authority managers to get permission from the Minister for any increased expenditure.  I do not think that should be necessary because while waiting for sanction legal problems could arise.  We all know from experience that it could take a very long time to get the Department's sanction. That is wrong.  Over the years local authorities have been consistent.  I am sure no manager would spend cash unless <Col N="165" /> it was absolutely necessary.  That is a section that should be examined in the interests of local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is said in the Minister's introductory remarks that the abolition of the domestic rate neither directly nor indirectly will interfere with or transfer any of the rates to local authorities or other ratepayers.  That is not correct.  By virtue of the reduction of the ceiling for agricultural grants the agricultural community are at present making a very high contribution.  It may be argued that we are speaking about the domestic rate but I am speaking about rates in general. The money that is supposed to be involved in the abolition of domestic rates is not realistic when one bears in mind the subsidy from the agricultural community. That is something on which the Government have misled the people.  In no small way it helped to return them to power.</P>
    <P>Local authorities should not be in the straitjacket in which they now find themselves.  They should have more freedom.  There was nothing unusual about any public representative approaching, say, a county engineer or county manager pointing out some small service needed in an area caused by storm damage, heavy rain and so on.  At present there is no use in any public representative approaching such people because there is no money in the kitty for such services.  Deputy Moore argued the point that their powers were not being eroded.  If public representatives meet to strike a rate and are told &ldquo;You cannot exceed a certain figure&rdquo;, is that not placing them, the manager and staff in a straitjacket?</P>
    <P>When we abolished 25 per cent of the rates there were no ties attached, good, bad or indifferent; it was a clear-cut abolition.  Local authorities had the same powers and democracy they had always enjoyed.  There is a different approach in this Bill.  In my opinion it was not necessary to curtail local government.  It is not without some significance that many county managers throughout the country are about to leave.  It would be a very bad day for the country if the managerial system were eroded.  Were I the Minister I would be inclined to ask <Col N="166" /> myself what is wrong, because there are many things wrong.</P>
    <P>At present in any local authority of which I have knowledge&mdash;here I speak of my own more than any other&mdash;the Department have not notified the manager exactly where they will stand for 1979.  The estimates for that year should be about to be discussed. Nevertheless, they do not know where they stand&mdash;whether it will be £9 million, £11 million, £12 million, £13 million or £15 million.  I should be grateful if the Minister, when replying, would tell us whether local authorities will be notified in the near future as to how much they may expect for 1979.  I would suggest further that the situation can be redeemed before it is too late.  The Minister should establish some kind of commission to inquire into the future financing of local authorities, one not composed of civil servants or of local officials. Rather I would suggest one composed of a number of people from outside that arena altogether.  I hope this Government will not kill local government as we knew it and replace it with a Department controlled from the centre.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that I welcome the abolition of the domestic rate.  I always believed it to be an unjustifiable form of taxation.  Indeed it was a pity it took so long for a Government so long in power to discover how unjust it was. However, at any stage its abolition can be regarded as a step in the right direction. I hope local authorities will be no longer held in their straitjackets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended speaking on this Bill but, having listened to so many inconsistencies, I thought I should intervene as somebody who might have reservations about the complete abolition of domestic rates on all houses.  Therefore, perhaps I can speak more independently than others.  I cannot understand the attitude of speakers from the other side of the House who say we must have local democracy as strong as it was before but we must not have any money coming from local authorities.  One cannot have it both ways.  Those have been my reservations over the years.  We said we would abolish domestic rates gradually but the <Col N="167" /> cry of everybody in the country is to have them abolished.  There was a small minority who wanted them taken off perhaps in a different way.  But we know from the reception given the Fianna Fáil Manifesto that everybody wanted local rates abolished.  I have often said that everybody cannot be out of step except old Johnny.</P>
      <P>I remember years ago when everybody spoke about the burden of rates.  I was not a Member of this House at the time but I made the suggestion that rates should be levied on houses on the ability of the business man or farmer to pay.  At that time the average valuation of a small house built was £6.  I suggested that on a small £20 valuation farm, or on a very small business, £2 only should be valued for rates purposes and, as one went up the scale, the full rate should go on the house.  That was not accepted at that time.  Apparently the general consensus since has been to abolish rates completely.  I will row in with my party but I have reservations about abolishing rates on mansions and that type of property.  It should be remembered that when the health services were taken from the local authorities the authority was taken from them at that time also.  They were not able to bear it, but they accepted it.  We should remember the old saying that the man who pays the piper is entitled to call the tune.  No matter what we do, how we change the system, the fact is that money talks all kinds of languages.  If the general taxpayer is providing the money for a county council and I am not contributing the majority of the money myself I am not entitled to as much say in how much I expend.  We were very hard hit in my area by the Minister imposing the 11 per cent last year.  We would have had enough but for certain changes that were made in the housing system by the previous Government which left us with a deficit and we found it difficult to live within the 11 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are not as may ratepayers on the county council now as there were. Every other member of the council is not a ratepayer and if one is not paying the money there might be a tendency for one <Col N="168" /> county council to be reasonable and to ensure that they would not overdo the expenditure and, on the other hand, there might be another county council that will say &ldquo;We are not paying it anyway&rdquo; and spend a lot of money.  This is the logic of the whole thing.  One cannot have it both ways.  If one had a county council that spent too much and got away with it this year there would be a rat race the following year as to who would strike the highest rate if there were not some direction or control from the Minister when he is providing the cash.  Also, the amount of rates which has to be collected at local level is relatively small.  Another thing I am worried about is relief of rates.  I know this can be appealed and some appeals have been successful.  In regard to the apportioning of rates as between business premises and domestic dwellings, where the business is very small this is sometimes a hardship and if this continued to appear to rise indiscriminately, the small business person could be paying more rates now than he was before rates were abolished at all.  These are the problems which we have.</P>
    <P>The Minister has implemented the manifesto exactly as it is.  I am only giving the reservations I have about the whole question of having as much authority as before but at the same time getting no money.  We are just codding ourselves if we think this is feasible. There is no good in getting up here and making speeches and giving us full authority to do what we like but at the same time telling us &ldquo;Do not ask us to pay anything&rdquo;.  This will not work no matter what the system of government, I have reservations about this whole question but I accept the decision of my party who put forward the manifesto. The Minister lived up to the manifesto and that is that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of channelling the relief to the right people I would appeal to the Minister to devise some system whereby the benefits of the abolition of rates would be passed on to the flatdwellers.  I do not agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that it cannot be done.  This is the only snag now, to make sure that the relief which the Minister has granted on rates on housing is passed on to the <Col N="169" /> people who are in occupation of the houses.  These are the important things at the moment.</P>
    <P>The question of rates on social centres and halls was mentioned.  Something should be done about that.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter.  I come from a county where these halls are not able to pay rates.  The trend is to the towns and to the big commercial ballrooms.  These halls, which are a great place for meeting and as social centres, were not able to pay the rates. In many counties&mdash;and there are several cases in my own county&mdash;the rates were £150 or £160.  There have been cases in my county and in many other counties where these halls could not meet the rates and the county manager did not want to sell the hall and he accepted a sum on account and the rest was carried forward as arrears.  As a result some of these halls are as much as £500 or £600 in arrears even after the rates have been abolished.  I would ask the Minister to strike out the arrears and leave these halls to survive, because that is all they are able to do, and to provide an amenity which is very important in rural Ireland today.  This is a Committee Stage Bill and some of the speakers from the far side dealt with the building of houses and you allowed them to do so.</P>

I cannot understand the attitude of people who say we must do away with rates, we must do away with paying local authorities but we must leave them the full authority they had when they were paid it all.  That is not on.  That is why I spoke on this Bill this evening.  If I stop paying in my own business and I get some other fellow up the road to lend me the money to pay it, is that fellow not going to have a say in the way I spend it?  Unless the whole system is changed that is the way things go and we have to accept that these are the facts of life and discuss the Bill to get the amendments into it to try to get this Bill perfected so that the people for whom it was intended will get the benefit of it.</P>

      <P>From this side of the House I welcome many aspects of this Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1977.  In my opinion if it is not amended to some extent it will mean the destruction of the local authorities and the powers of urban and county councils as we have known them for years.  I had the privilege and honour last month of representing my town at the Municipal Authorities' Conference in Sligo when approximately 250 delegates attended a three-day discussion on matters pertaining to local authorities.  I can say without fear of contradiction that the most prolonged and lively discussion at the conference was on this Bill.  In all we dealt with 13 motions from many parts of the country.  Right across the political divide there was dissatisfaction and disagreement with many sections of the Bill.  For the first time since the establishment of the municipal authorities the Minister did not think it worth his while to attend or to send his Minister of State to attend the conference.  We were blandly told that the Minister was on holidays.</P>

      <P>Because of the Minister's absence, we got written replies to these 13 motions on this Bill.  The document forwarded to us by the Department of the Environment dated 18 July, stated that:</P>
      <P>The stated aim of the Government in relation to reorganisation generally, is to afford everyone a greater opportunity of participating in decisions affecting their own community.  The aim of any reorganisation would be to achieve a local government structure giving the greatest possible degree of satisfaction to the public generally. The question of reorganisation is at present under examination in the Department.</P>
      <P>That is the crunch of the statement. Perhaps this Bill is the first step in this direction.  The document went on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In bearing the cost of relief of domestic and certain other rates from 1978, the Exchequer is now providing almost two-thirds of the current income of local authorities.  The placing of an upper limit on the rate in the £ is an effective way of co-ordinating both <Col N="172" /> local and national expenditure in that it protects the interests of both the Exchequer and the remaining ratepayers while preserving a strong local government system.  The imposition of the limit does not reduce in any way the existing discretion of local authorities to determine their own priorities for expenditure within the rate in the £ they strike.</P>
    <P>Approximately ten years ago Deputy Molloy, the then Minister for Local Government, made strenous efforts to eliminate town councils, small urban district councils and to regionalise adjacent county councils, despite all the lip-service over the years to giving democratic responsibility and power to the people in the election of their representatives at local level.  Fortunately, that Minister had not got sufficient time to implement his ideas.  Deputy James Tully, the man who replaced him, being a man of the people involved in the local authority over the years, dropped the idea completely, leaving the power with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The change of the name of the Department of Local Government to the Department of the Environment is significant and ominous.  If this Bill is fully implemented it will mean the centralisation of power in Dublin, and the Custom House will have a stranglehold on all local authority activities. As it stands this Bill is restrictive and dictatorial and there is little respect in it for the tremendous work done over the years by members of local authorities.  If rural Ireland is to survive the challenge of the eighties it is essential that we continue to have strong democratic power at local level.  This can only be achieved by the continued independence of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I support the abolition of rates for those who cannot afford to pay them. The rating system was unfair and it made no allowance for people who were not in a position to pay.  But in abolishing the rates hundreds and possibly thousands of people have benefitted by sums of four figures.  People with luxury homes valued at about £60,000 have gained by those amounts.  I was at a meeting recently where it was pointed out that the VEC scholarships had been <Col N="173" /> cut by half.  Surely this is a scandal and a waste of money for political expediency. It is disappointing that scholarships, the mainstay of education, have been cut while at the same time luxury homes are free of rates.</P>
    <P>It was made clear by several speakers in Sligo that a vicious revaluation programme is being implemented at the moment by the Valuation Office on small businesses, which will more than offset the loss in revenue brought about by the abolition of rates.  This has been denied by the Department, but I take the word of two eminent members of the Municipal Conference who gave details of houses and business premises in their towns for which £400 or £500 more will have to be paid next year.</P>
    <P>The most iniquitous part of this Bill is the intended abolition of section 11 of the County Management Act of 1955, which in mid-term allowed the county manager, in conjunction with either the urban district council or the county council the power to exceed the estimate for that year for emergency schemes, which could be carried forward to the following year.  The terms outlined now mean that scheme is no longer an emergency scheme because it must be submitted to the Minister and to the Custom House before it can be implemented. As far as local authorities and local democracy is concerned this is the centre point of this debate.  If the Government are concerned for local democracy this part must be deleted without further dissent or discussion.</P>
    <P>I am proud to be and to have been a member of a local authority for the past 22 years.  From my experience in both urban and county councils I have nothing but the highest respect and admiration for all who served on these councils throughout that period.  Our common concern is the betterment of the people.  We spent several days each year at our estimates meeting ensuring in a responsible manner the proper use of the money available from rates.  In conjunction with the Department of Local Government housing was provided for the needy and the necessary infrastructure was laid on to ensure that our people were contented in the accommodation provided for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> We always co-operated with the county managers and the senior executives who at all times worked towards improving the lot of our people. What will happen if section 11 is abolished?  Local authorities will be hamstrung by the senior officials in the Custom House.  I cannot accept the ministerial promises of preserving a strong local government system.  No one who has been involved in local authorities will accept this situation as being true.  This Bill will sound the deathknell of local democratic power and the eventual destruction of all local authorities.  County councils will become just like the health advisory committees, just talking shops.</P>
    <P>The up-to-date situation at local level in my situation is that our programme for 1978 is a very provisional programme because unless a section 11 is allowed and sanctioned by the Minister for a sum of money for a wage productivity agreement accepted during the past couple of months, many schemes will have to be shelved until 1980.  Where can one see, in this type of thinking, the Government's so-called employment concern? This serious situation is causing grave concern and unease among the senior executives of our county council.  They are anxious to ensure continuity of roads and ancilliary programmes and consequential employment but they cannot budget their programme properly without the needed revenue or without the continuing power of section 11.</P>
    <P>We speak as one on our council when we say that any interference with this important section will be to the detriment of our people and to the continued good working of our local authorities.  Ireland cannot be governed or dictated to by the Custom House.  As local representatives, we appreciate the needs of our people.  It is the duty of the Government and of the Minister concerned&mdash;a man who comes from rural Ireland&mdash;to ensure that section 11 is allowed to stand.  The Government say that they represent the plain people of Ireland.  Let them prove their genuineness by ensuring that democracy at local level continues.  They can do this by amending this Bill and allowing section 11 to stand.</P>

      <P>The obvious outrage of the Opposition that has been manifested in this debate so far stems from jealousy. They are jealous because we implemented our promise to remove rates from private dwellings despite the Opposition's claim that we would not and could not be successful in regard to this promise.  So outraged are the people opposite that the last speaker referred to the Minister having had the cheek to take two week's holidays which prevented him from attending a conference. This is typical of the Opposition's attitude.</P>
      <P>The bill before us is one of the finest pieces of legislation ever to come before the House.  As Deputy Moore said, the curse of rates on private house owners where incomes were not taken into consideration and where a waiver was granted only in real hardship cases, resulted in people having to sell their houses when their families had grown up and left home.  People will not forget that it was Fianna Fáil who abolished rates on private dwellings.  It is said that eaten bread is soon forgotten, but I am convinced that at the time of the next local elections the people will indicate their appreciation of what we have done in this area.</P>

      <P>This is typical of the kind of inaccurate statement one hears from the Opposition.  On Dublin Corporation, where Fianna Fáil have only 15 members, we have listened to Opposition councillors state time and again that local democracy has gone.  I should like to tell those Deputies who are very sensitive to hearing facts that, in lieu of rates collected heretofore from private dwellings, the Minister gives a lump sum from the Exchequer and that the spending of that money is a matter for the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Last year we gave £290,000, or an increase of £30,000 on the previous year, to the community and environment department by way of a grant towards community buildings.  We give grants to community associations for people who organise community weeks and in respect of the building of community halls the corporation give £15,000.</P>

      <P>If a community hall is costing, say, £40,000 the corporation give a maximum of £15,000.  Last year we allocated £50,000 to the cultural committee.  This was for grants for cultural activity and this year we shall be able to increase this amount from our budget.</P>
      <P>When he removed rates from private dwellings the Minister made it clear that the money that would be provided in lieu by the Exchequer would be in line with the rate of inflation plus a little extra.  This year Dublin Corporation got an increase of 11 per cent.  When all the money for grants in respect of cultural activities had been expended the relevant committee sought extra money from the Minister but their request was not met and they were told that they must keep within budgetary limits.  When we removed rates we did not tell local authorities that they could spend as much as they wished.  There must be a limit to the amount of money that a local authority can spend.  When we have a situation in Dublin Corporation, where out of a total of 45 members, 30 are of political persuasions other than Fianna Fáil, it is in the interest of those other members to embarrass the Government by spending money as if there were no limit to the amount available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Waterford city has a population of 35,000.  Today's unemployment register indicated that there are 2,300 people there in receipt of benefit.  That must be one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, if not the highest.  I appeal to the Minister to do everything he can to help the city retain its existing industries which are working on short time or which are in financial difficulties and to revive some of those industries which have gone to the wall recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1973 there have been 18 industrial closures in Waterford city resulting in over 3,000 redundancies. Those figures have been provided to me by the local council of trade unions and I have no reason to doubt them.  I believe <Col N="178" /> the total is nearer 3,500 redundancies.  In the meantime the new jobs created have only amounted to 1,100.  This is an alarming state of affairs and it is little wonder that Waterford has become known as the industrial graveyard of Ireland.  Since 2 October 500 people have been added to the unemployment register.  This is due entirely to the closure of the National Board and Paper Mills at Grannagh where 281 jobs have been lost together with a strike which resulted directly from that closure in the sister box factory, where 220 people are employed.  No doubt those 220 jobs will be retained.  I appeal to the Minister to ask the Minister for Labour to intercede as soon as possible because this strike seems to be an inter-union dispute.  I believe there is a &ldquo;fire brigade&rdquo; action effort in the Department which deals with this type of dispute within a matter of days.  No action has been taken so far in relation to this strike by the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>Waterford has had a history in recent years of industries coming but actually never arriving.  People are beginning to think that Waterford has been forgotten as an industrial centre.  Earlier this year an industry to be known as Modern Plastics, which was to employ 120 people, was to come to the industrial estate. People were actually notified that they would have to go to an AnCO centre for training, but the industry never started. The excuse given was that they got better terms from the UK Government to set up in the UK.  I appreciate that that is a common complaint.  We seem to be outbid again and again by the British when it comes to giving incentive grants. We saw recently that the De Lorean Motor Sports Car Company, which was supposed to come to Limerick, was moved to Belfast because the incentives were far better there.  Mr. Killeen of the IDA said that it might not have been such a good proposition but we will see if that venture is successful.  We have not got any replacement industries for those 18 closures and the people in Waterford are looking for a number of replacement industries.  No new industry which has come along in the meantime has succeeded in absorbing the large labour pool which is available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> Three months before the present closure an IDA officer told public representatives and trade union officials in Waterford that there were so many industries in the pipeline that soon Waterford would not have a sufficient work force to supply all the potential jobs that would be available.  It is sad to relate that the position far from improving has worsened considerably.</P>
    <P>I would like to express my appreciation to the Minister for having received a deputation on this matter about six weeks ago.  It was not an easy deputation to handle because it was probably too large.  The Minister gave them very good treatment and was very sympathetic to the views put forward.  I understand that the Minister had a similar problem in Limerick, although possibly it is not as great as the one in Waterford. However, we feel that his ministerial status will solve that problem fairly quickly.  We hope we will not be left in the lurch in view of troubles elsewhere.</P>
    <P>A major part of our problem in Waterford is a lack of proper infrastructure in and around the city.  Industry is quite often attracted by facilities, amenities and a very good infrastructure. At the moment Waterford is so bad in this regard that it puts industrialists off.  That is why it is so important to retain existing industries.  We badly need a new bridge.  There has been a call in Limerick recently for a third bridge. There is one bridge in Waterford which needs to be closed down periodically it is in such a bad condition.  We are ten years looking for a new bridge but have not yet been successful.  The roads leading out of the city, especially those leading to Dublin and New Ross, are very bad.  All those things are important when an industrialist comes to look at the facilities available.</P>
    <P>We have no airport, which is another great handicap.  The Minister should bear those infrastructural deficiencies in mind when thinking of providing new industries in Waterford and in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment attempt to rectify the position.  We are lagging behind the rest of the country in these matters and the people of Waterford feel they are not getting their share <Col N="180" /> of the national cake.  They want those infrastructural deficiencies rectified as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I see in today's paper that it has been advocated that a second oil refinery is needed.  There is no place more suitable than Waterford harbour for such an industry. We have a power station at Great Island which depends on oil to generate power.  An oil refinery would be an obvious complementary industry in a case like that as it would eliminate a great deal of shipping and expense in bringing the oil from elsewhere.  We would appreciate the setting up of a Government Department in Waterford city as has been done recently in Castlebar and Athlone.  I do not believe that those two areas are as depressed as Waterford city at the moment.  This would obviously give considerable employment not alone in the Department but in associated services.</P>
    <P>A march in which 20,000 people took part took place in the city last month to demonstrate the frustration of the people at the closures to which I have referred. The people are demanding that something be done to stop the growth in unemployment.  I know that the Government have forecast a major increase in the number of jobs to be provided over the next five years.  I know their target for 1978 will not be reached.  I am not here to criticise them in relation to that, because if they do their best they cannot be blamed.  We might blame them for making promises they cannot fulfil but we appreciate their difficulty.  However, if there are new jobs to be given out and if there are new industries to be promoted, Waterford should be given priority because of the dreadful unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>Eighteen industries in all have gone to the wall since 1973.  Goodbodys employed 490 and they have gone out of production.  Dennys, the bacon curers, employed 300 people and they have stopped production.  Crokers printing works employed 80 people and they also have gone out of production.  There is a litany of similar industries gone out of production, not all as large as the ones I have mentioned but all fairly substantial employers.  Some of the existing industries are on short time.  For instance, <Col N="181" /> Munster Chipboard are presently surviving on aid given to them by Fóir Teoranta.  When Wellworthy came to Waterford we were told they were supposed to employ 1,000 people, but due to local and other problems they are only employing 80 people.  This sort of setback has been depressing.  Milton Bradley, which is a new industry, have recently had to stop working one shift, which has resulted in a reduction in employment.  There is a series of short time, cutbacks in shift work and closures which is very depressing.</P>
    <P>The reason I have asked for this debate is that the recent closure has shaken the city to its foundations.  The paper mills were regarded as a stable industry and were expected to last for a considerable time.  It was a money-making proposition but it seems that the parent company, St. Jo Paper Company of Florida, decided to close all their ventures in western Europe, which meant that the Waterford industry went to the wall.  We believe that the box plant and the mill have been purchased by Ulster Paper Products of Craigavon, Northern Ireland, but we are not sure of their intentions. We do know that they do not propose to continue with the paper mill, which is the manufacturing end of the business.  We are told that they are going to keep the box plant open, which should retain 220 jobs, but we are not sure.  We would like the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure that this plant is not closed.  It is bad enough to lose 280 jobs without losing a further 220.  It is a well-known gambit in industry for a company to buy a number of such plants and then to close various sections of them for financial reasons.  Ulster Paper Products have also bought the Killeen Paper Mills in Dublin.  There is a fear in Waterford that they will close down the Waterford section and concentrate their efforts in Dublin or transfer the operation to Craigavon.</P>
    <P>We should also like to know what prospects the Minister has of getting a new owner to take over the existing board mill at Grannagh and if he has hopes of this industry reopening soon.  It is a viable concern, we are told.  We have also been told that interested companies <Col N="182" /> are negotiating to purchase it.  I know there has to be a delay because the deal between the St. Jo Company of Florida and Ulster Paper Products may not be complete.  Once Ulster Paper Products take over the complex, we would appreciate it if the Minister would use his good offices to ensure that the mill section is sold to some company that will operate it as heretofore.</P>
    <P>We believe that the mill should not have been allowed to close.  When our deputation visited Dublin we asked that the IDA, in conjunction with Fóir Teoranta, move in and keep it going until new operators were found and we are disappointed that continuity was not maintained.  We hope that it will be reopened as soon as possible after it has been purchased.  It was stated by a member of the deputation that the equipment in the mill was obsolete and would have to be replaced before it could be operated on a profitable basis.  That opinion has been contradicted on a number of occasions by people working in the firm.  They tell me that the existing mill and equipment could operate and that it could be replaced in phases without closure, and I would ask the Minister to bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>Waterford is in a depressed state at present.  We have a few stable industries which are giving good employment. Waterford Glass, Clover Meats and ACEC are major industries providing stable employment in the city.  We need at least one more major industry.  We do not want to see any further closures and we want to see the National Board and Paper Mills continue to operate. Between the deputation and advice from his officials, I am sure the Minister is aware of the position.  We are thankful for the reception given to the deputation and we hope he will continue to work on our behalf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The offical figures, whose accuracy one cannot doubt, appear to paint a different picture. Waterford is a city in which there is a large amount of first-class industry and I am surprised to hear it described as an industrial graveyard, because it certainly is not.  I wish that other comparable places were as well served in so far as industry is concerned as Waterford.  The figures show that in the past year or so there have been closures of two industrial plants in Waterford, one is the National Board and Paper Mills board mill, which closed at the end of September 1978 with a loss of 280 jobs, and the other is Industrial Packaging Machinery Ltd, which closed in May 1978 with a loss of ten jobs, making a total loss in a period of over 12 months of 290 jobs.  The IDA's annual employment survey, which is carried out on 1 January each year in each city and county, shows that there were 480 more people employed in Waterford city in manufacturing industry on 1 January 1978 than there were on 1 January 1977.  The figures for the last four years show a small improvement in the first three years and a major improvement in the past year because they have gone from 6,360 to 6,453 to 6,603 to 7,082, and there has been a corresponding drop in the number of people registered as unemployed. The last date for which official figures are available is 22 September 1978 when the figure was 1,759.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not be that because today's figure would not be available.  In any event, if people are on strike the normal practice is for them to be registered as unemployed.  The figures for the corresponding dates in 1976 and 1977 show a drop from 2,019 to 1,941, now down in this September to 1,759.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Waterford is in the fortunate position that the IDA own a good deal of land <Col N="184" /> there unlike the position in many other areas.  This has been a tremendous help and is one of the reasons why so many new industries have come to Waterford in recent times and why so many major ones are projected for Waterford in the immediate future.  Among those just about to start are the National Can Corporation which will shortly come into production and will employ 110 people. Tech Industries recently commenced production and expects to employ 100 people in full production.  Hi-G Corporation recently concluded negotiations for a project which will employ 160 people. The construction of their factory is nearly completed.  Fismar and Co. Limited are undertaking an expansion of their operation and the construction of an additional 20,000 square feet has started and this will increase the employment to 140.  The Garrett Corporation recently commenced construction of a new factory in Waterford and expect to be in production at the beginning of 1979 and to employ 138 people.  A German company recently concluded negotiations with the IDA, as will be announced within the next week or two, providing employment for 100 people.</P>
    <P>In addition, I think it is fairly well known in Waterford, as it is in other parts of the country although I cannot officially refer to it here, that there is a major new industrial development which I believe has actually started already but which cannot be officially announced for some weeks because it has to be technically passed by the Government because of the very high grant level involved. I do not mean the grant rate but the total amount.  That will employ over 1,000 people and it is an extremely reliable industry.</P>

      <P>When one sets out these facts, speaking if I may for a moment as a Limerick man&mdash;indeed the Deputy raised that matter and made comparisons&mdash;I would willingly swop with him any day as regards industrial development because, unhappily, the situation in Limerick is worse and the outlook not nearly as good.  In Waterford the position is one of constantly rising employment and some major new firms, not mickey mouse firms in any sense but firms with high technology and high quality employment are involved which certainly will continue to boost Waterford.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy's figures about closures since 1973 are correct because the figures supplied to me do not go back that far but there have been only two in the past year; so, if there were 16 others they were all in the years 1973 to early 1977, which I suppose speaks for itself to some extent.  I am not aware that there are serious infrastructural deficiencies in Waterford and if there were I suppose it would be a matter beyond my personal control, but in so far as deficiences exist I do not think they are any worse than in other comparable places.  In fact, the availability of suitable sites and the general infrastructural attraction of Waterford is one of the reasons it has done so remarkably well in attracting new industries.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred particularly to the recent closure of the board mill section of the National Board and Paper Mills at Waterford.  I am of course, as he knows and says, fully familiar with all the problems and difficulties in relation to that.  I should like to make a general observation on the circumstances under which the owners of that factory decided to close the board mill.  I regard it as an unacceptable action on their part.  It was not justified by any commercial consideration and where commercial considerations did not force an action of that kind to be taken it is socially very undesirable that any firm should act as they did.  In my opinion they acted without any sense of the responsibility which they owe to the place in which they operate and to people who have worked in many cases for perhaps 20 or 30 years in the factory.</P>

      <P>Happily, actions of that kind in this country by manufacturing industry, whether domestic or foreign-owned, are rare, but when we encounter a particularly objectionable action such as that of the St. Jo Paper Mills of Florida in this case we are entitled to comment on it and to say how strongly we deplore such irresponsible action.  The mill has closed since 30 September.  Unfortunately, the other part of the operation, the corrugated containers part of it, which was not affected by the decision in regard to the mill, is closed because of a strike.  My information is the same as the Deputy's, that it is an inter-union dispute.  I know enough about inter-union disputes and their consequences to deplore this particular one. I do not know the merits or otherwise of the case and I am not interested but it appears that it is of such a nature and I earnestly hope the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the only people who can effectively do anything to police this kind of situation of internal disputes, will try to bring that dispute between two unions to an end so that the corrugated container section of this plant can reopen.</P>

      <P>While it is not possible to say precisely how many Irish citizens are living in Rhodesia it is estimated that the number is about 8,000.  Ireland does not, of course, have diplomatic or consular representation in Rhodesia.</P>
      <P>The question of passport facilities for Irish citizens who do not wish to leave Rhodesia must, of course, be considered in the context of the United Nations mandatory sanctions which are in operation against Rhodesia and which Ireland is committed to uphold.  In this connection it has been the policy of successive Irish Governments not to grant passport facilities to persons whose activities further or encourage the unlawful actions of the illegal regime in Rhodesia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless, ever Irish citizen living abroad has a right of entry to this country and I have always made it clear that any Irish person living in Rhodesia <Col N="38" /> who wishes to settle in Ireland or otherwise leave Rhodesia permanently will be issued with an Irish passport in the usual way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs what countries were visited by him during his recent trip to Africa; the number of persons in his official encourage and the number of official meetings held in each country; and if he will indicate the purpose of his visits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I paid an official visit to five countries in Africa from 27 August to 13 September, namely Swaziland, Lesotho, Zambia, Tanzania and Sudan. I had also intended to include Kenya on my official itinerary but, because of the death of President Kenyatta, this had to be cancelled.  However, I represented the Government at President Kenyatta's funeral and also paid a brief one-day visit to Kenya on the 26 August, in the course of which I took the opportunity of meeting members of the Irish community, heads of religious orders and so on.</P>
      <P>As will be seen from the selection of countries which I made, the primary purpose of the visit was to review our programme of development co-operation with these countries, and to inspect our aid projects.  I thought it essential that at this stage I should see at first hand how the Government's bilateral assistance programme was being implemented, and how we could build upon it.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I have seen the need for some time to have direct political contacts in East Africa.  We have no diplomatic mission in that whole area, and so our visit had a substantial political significance and utility.  I had opportunities of getting from the leaders in these countries their assessments on some major world problems, in particular the various aspects of the situation in Southern Africa, the state of the so-called north-south dialogue, the renegotiation of the Lomé Convention and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, there has never been an official <Col N="39" /> Irish presence of this kind in East Africa before.  Some of these countries have considerable traditional and historic links with Ireland, and there are many Irish working there, and have been for decades.  No Irish Foreign Minister had previously visited them since the establishment of our State, or indeed since these countries themselves attained independence. It was a great satisfaction to see how our visit was welcomed by the Irish.</P>
    <P>I was accompanied on the visit by my wife and five officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The number of my delegation's official engagements, which consisted of both formal and informal meetings with Heads of State and Government Ministers, visits to projects, and discussions with project managers and official receptions was as follows in each of the countries visited: Swaziland, 12; Lesotho, 13; Zambia, ten; Tanzania, ten; and Sudan, seven.</P>
    <P>I was agreeably encouraged by the deep fund of goodwill which existed in all of these countries towards Ireland.  I am satisfied that this forms the basis of what can be a very mutually beneficial development of economic and political associations between our countries.  The development of closer ties can also only be to the advantage of greater understanding between the democratic countries of the European Community and these African countries.</P>

      <P>The Government of the USSR owns three properties and rents or leases five others in Dublin.  I am not in a position to estimate the value of the three purchased properties.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number of Soviet citizens now living in Ireland, I assume the Deputy is referring to staff numbers at the Soviet Embassy here.  The position is that there are five diplomatic officers and 12 support staff made up of Administrative/Technical and Service staff and domestic servants.  These figures do not vary from the numbers agreed at the outset.</P>

      <P>A decision was taken in 1971 that a new central school should be built in Moycullen and that Newtown national school would be amalgamated with the new school when built.  This decision was taken after parents of the Newtown area had agreed to the proposals at public meetings in the area.  It was on the basis of this agreement that arrangements for the erection of the new central school proceeded.  The decision was taken in order to provide better educational facilities for the children of Moycullen parish.</P>
      <P>I met a deputation of parents from the Newtown area in June, 1978 who put before me their views on the retention of their school. I gave careful consideration to the views expressed before confirming that amalgamation should proceed.  Officials of my Department met a deputation of parents in September, 1978 and it was obvious from that meeting that the parents had, prior to meeting me, been misinformed about local meetings which took place in 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In part (d) of his question, I take it that the Deputy is referring to Tullykyne and not to Moycullen.  The essential difference between the two cases is that the <Col N="44" /> Moycullen central school was never intended to cater for all the children attending Tullykyne, only those who are resident in the Moycullen parish.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the Government agrees with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe that the present structure of co-operation designed to fight international tax avoidance and evasion is not sufficiently complete and coherent within Europe and whether the Government envisages supporting the initiative for the elaboration of a draft European Convention on the lines of paragraph 10 of the Assembly Recommendation 833 to which all Council of Europe Member States, and possibly others, could become parties thus supplementing existing co-operation in the framework of the European Community; if the Government agree with the Assembly that appropriate international action should be taken with a view to making it more difficult for firms and private individuals to use tax haven countries inside or outside Europe for tax avoidance purposes; and, if so, if it is willing to support an initiative to this effect in the Council of Europe or another appropriate international framework; and the Government's attitude to the various proposals put forward in paragraph 11 of Recommendation 833.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the effects of tax avoidance and evasion on the international plane are impossible to quantify, the extent to which this country's interest would be served by participating in international action as envisaged in Recommendation 833 to counteract such activities must in large measure be a matter of conjecture. On the question of principle involved in such participation, there is, in the 1963 and 1977 versions of the OECD model convention for the avoidance of double taxation on income and capital, an article which provides for the exchange of information between partner countries for the purpose of countering fiscal evasion and avoidance.  This country accepted that article without reservation.</P>
      <P>Irish representatives have actively participated in the work of the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs which has been concerning itself for some time with tax avoidance and evasion.  This country has been, and will continue to be, involved as a member state of the EEC in activities at Community level designed to counter avoidance and evasion.  A recent example of the outcome of such activities is the directive on mutual assistance in the field of direct taxation.</P>
      <P>As regards paragraphs 10 and 11 of Recommendation 833, the Deputy will be aware that at the meeting of Ministers' deputies of the Council of Europe on 6&mdash;8 June, 1978, concern was expressed that the Council should not become involved in what was then described as the risk of duplication with the work of OECD.  The Government see no reason to dissent from that view. They also share the doubts expressed at the meeting as to the practicability, in the light of the findings of an OECD working party, of concluding a multilateral agreement in preference to bilateral agreements.</P>
      <P>In considering the proposals in Recommendation 833, the overriding concern of the Government will be to avoid entering voluntarily into any specific commitment to the adoption of measures which could have adverse effects on the economy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state, in relation to the Grange Wood estate in Rathfarnham, County Dublin, (a) the date first given as the one by which telephones would be provided in the estate, in response to an application for service; (b) the reason or reasons for the delay in providing the service; (c) if underground cabling for telephones exists in the estate; (d) if temporary overhead cabling will be provided, if necessary, at applicants' expense, to meet the demand for service; and (e) the estimated cost, in (i) capital and (ii) current terms, of providing all applicants with a telephone service by January 1979.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) On the basis of a tentative cabling programme the local residents' association was informed in June 1976 that it was expected that service would be provided for applicants in developed parts of the estate later that year.  When a firm programme was prepared later for cabling needs generally it was found that the demand for cabling works generally was such that the provisional forecast made could not be met.  The association was informed in April 1977 that the necessary plant would not be available before the latter part of that year.</P>
      <P>(b) and (c) Cables for the estate were laid in November/December 1977 but the necessary jointing work could not be done because the staff who would normally attend to it had to be diverted to other work, primarily to maintenance of existing subscribers' lines.  Cabling work in the Dublin area virtually ceased during the industrial action early this year. On the resumption of work the jointing staff had to be assigned to clear the large backlog of faults on subscribers' lines that had built up and to the provision of cabling for urgent industrial and commercial applications.</P>
      <P>(d) and (e) Regrettably, because of continuing pressure of business applications which accumulated in the course of this year it will not be possible to provide service for applicants in Grange Wood by January 1979 from either underground or overhead cable; service by underground cable can be provided as quickly as by overhead cable.  The estimated cost of completing the work necessary to provide service is £3,000 capital charges; no part of the cost of provision will be chargeable to current account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fertilisers, Feeding Stuffs and Mineral Mixtures (Methods of Analysis) Regulations, 1978, (S.I. No. 249 of 1978), which were made by me on 1 September 1978, amended the analytical methods in respect of feeding stuffs laid down in the Fertilisers, Feeding Stuffs and Mineral Mixtures Regulations, 1957, so as to bring them into conformity with agreed Community methods of analysis.  There is no direct or indirect effect on the cost of feeding stuffs to farmers.</P>
      <P>Three sets of regulations which made some changes in the provisions of the Fertilisers, Feeding Stuffs and Mineral Mixtures Regulations, 1957, relating to the marketing of fertilisers, were also made this year, namely:</P>
      <P>1.  European Communities (Marketing of Fertilisers) Regulations, 1978 of 19 January 1978 (S.I. No. 13 of 1978).</P>
      <P>2.  European Communities (Sampling and Analysis of Fertilisers) Regulations, 1978 of 19 January 1978 (S.I. No. 12 of 1978).</P>
      <P>3.  Marketing of Non-EEC Fertilisers Regulations, 1978 of 1 September, 1978 (S.I. No. 248 of 1978).</P>
      <P>The first two sets of these regulations implemented the provisions of Council Directive No. 76/116/EEC of 18 December 1975 and Commission Directive No. 77/535/EEC of 22 June 1977 which lay down quality, packaging and labelling standards for straight and compound NPK solid fertilisers designated as EEC fertilisers.  The third set similarly provide for such standards for all fertilisers which are not designated as EEC fertilisers.</P>
      <P>The implications of these regulations were discussed with farming organisations before implementation.</P>
      <P>The main changes in the new regulations are:</P>
      <P>(a)  quality standards are laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> (b)  labelling standards are laid down for all fertilisers so as to provide a more extensive set of declarations as to the nutrient content of the fertilisers. This information, together with the name or trade name or trade mark and address of the manufacturer must be shown on the bag or, in the case of bulk fertilisers, on documents accompanying the fertilisers.</P>
    <P>(c)  the licensing provisions relating to fertiliser manufacture have been abolished.</P>
    <P>(d)  regarding ground limestone, provision has been made for metrication of standards.</P>
    <P>(e)  the methods of sampling and analysis have been brought into line with Community methods which include tolerances which are in many respects more exacting than previous tolerances.</P>
    <P>These regulations should not have any direct or indirect effect on the cost of fertilisers to farmers.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy the annual average number of applications for certification of trade marks rejected by the Controller; and, having regard to the number of trade and service organisations which in the public interest use logos and other devices for the identification of their standards and services, if he will introduce legislation to provide for a system of service mark registration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to applications for registration of trade marks rejected by the controller.  The information is not available in the form requested because applications are determined by either registration or abandonment.  The annual average number of trade mark applications abandoned in the five year period ended 31 December 1977 was 606.  New applications for registration in the same period averaged 3,426 per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> I do not propose at the present time to introduce legislation for a system of service mark registration.  Discussions are taking place between representatives of the EEC Commission and the member states with a view to the formulation of a system of trade mark law providing for the registration of a Community Trade Mark in respect of both goods and services. The introduction of this law will also involve the harmonisation of the national trade marks law of the member states.  Because of the technical nature of the discussions and the complexities involved it is unlikely that the Community Trade Mark will become a reality for some years to come.  It would be undesirable to consider amending the Trade Marks Act, 1963, to extend registration to service marks until more concrete proposals emerge as a result of the continuing EEC negotiations.</P>

      <P>Under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, it is a matter for local authorities to investigate instances of pollution and to take any necessary remedial action.  I understand that Kildare County Council took prompt action in this case which included sampling and analysis of waters and that certain lines of action are being pursued by them.  I understand that the Dublin Board of Conservators are also taking certain action in the matter.  In these circumstances it would not be appropriate for me to comment further in regard to this case.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation, as sanitary authority and burial board for the area, informed me in June 1978 that the unsatisfactory condition of Glasnevin cemetery had again been brought to the attention of the Dublin Cemeteries Committee, which is the body having immediate responsibility in law for keeping the cemetery in a suitable state of repair and condition, as far as practicable, and that the committee had been requested to attend to the maintenance of the cemetery without any further delay.  I now understand that recent maintenance work has been concentrated mainly on St. Paul's section of the cemetery about which there were considerable complaints.  I also understand that the provision of fencing on the boundary between the cemetery and Coras Iompair Éireann property has been undertaken and that this is expected to reduce the problems of trespass and vandalism.</P>
      <P>I am arranging that the question of measures for further improvements will be pursued by the corporation with the committee.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Corporation Sherrard Street-Portland Place Area Compulsory Purchase Order, 1972, was confirmed on 10 December 1975, and Dublin Corporation were notified accordingly on 16 December 1975.</P>
      <P>On the 7 June last, I approved in principle the corporation's proposals for building 82 new houses and restoring or rebuilding 12 existing houses on the site. I understand from the corporation that working drawings for this scheme are being prepared and that it is their intention to invite tenders when the contract documents have been completed.  House plans, which were submitted to me last week, were approved within the week, subject to reconsideration of certain features of the plans which had already been discussed by my technical advisers with the corporation's chief housing architect.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the reduction of the repayment period for housing which came into effect in respect of loans issued after 26 June 1975 has caused severe hardship.  The extension of the repayment period on a loan of £9,000 at 11½ per cent from 30 to 35 years would reduce the monthly repayments by only £1.37, from £89.37 to £88.00, but would increase the total repayments over the period by £4,789.  I do not feel, therefore, that an extension of the repayment period would be in the best interest of the borrower.</P>

      <P>The free books scheme is specifically intended for necessitous pupils.  An allocation of £8,200 was made to County Donegal Vocational Education Committee to be applied for that purpose in vocational schools in its administrative area in the current financial year.  I am satisfied that the allocation compares favourably with the amounts granted to other VECs.  In regard to the amount of assistance given to each neccessitous pupil, it will be understood that where a committee utilise the money available to make a standard part-cost grant for the largest possible number of pupils considered to be in need, the amount of that grant will naturally form a smaller portion of the total cost in each case than if full-cost grants were made to some pupils or if a higher criterion of need were applied.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> In regard to the matter of text books I would like to say that in the case of second level school only a small percentage of text books are prescribed by my Department and most of these are repeated in rotation from year to year, generally in a three-to-four-year cycle. The school authorities are well aware of my Department's view that unprescribed text books should be changed as infrequently as possible.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 518 and 520 together.</P>
      <P>My Department obtained agreement in 1974 to the amalgamation of Rathduane and Cloghoola national schools with the two schools in Millstreet in converted and improved former post-primary school buildings.</P>
      <P>The scheme for the conversion of the former secondary school for use as a girls' school is now being carried out and it is hoped to start work on the boys' school in the former vocational school building as soon as it is vested in local trustees.</P>
      <P>The question of the interim amalgamation of Cloghoola with the Millstreet schools in the existing accommodation is under consideration.  It is proposed to hold a local meeting shortly at which the views of local interests may be conveyed to an inspector of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>

The planning of the new central school is now at a very advanced stage and the project should, therefore, proceed.  The two schools involved need to be replaced.</P>

A statement granting the owner's permission to enter on the site for the purpose of erecting the school has been received in the Department; (ii) that the chairman's architect has applied for planning permission for the new school; (iii) that plans prepared by the architect have been approved by <Col N="83" /> my Department; (iv) that a grant was sanctioned towards the cost of the project on 5 October 1978.  It is not possible at this stage to say when the school will come into operation; (v) the question of temporary accommodation for children of school age pending the erection of the permanent school is one, in the first instance, for the managerial authority.</P>

I have asked them to have another look at the matter in consultation with local interests.</P>
