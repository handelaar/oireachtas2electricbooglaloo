      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;10.&mdash;Every order made under this Act by the Minister shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly but without <Col N="1436" /> prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When we discussed this Bill on Committee Stage the Minister indicated that between then and this Stage he would consider favourably an amendment along the lines which I am now presenting to the House.  I feel he should accept the amendment, which is a perfectly drafted amendment because it is modelled on amendments which appear in other Bills.  The particular wording in this amendment is taken directly from the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill which is to be amended by the Minister for the Environment.  There is no question of the wording here being other than the wording used by the parliamentary draftsman if he sought to achieve the purpose the amendment seeks to achieve.</P>
      <P>I hope that when the Minister replies to my proposal he will not claim that because this amendment is drafted by the Opposition it must be insufficiently drafted and could not be accepted.  I hope he will not produce that argument at least, whatever others he may seek to bring forward.  Under the Bill as it presently stands the Minister has power to make orders in relation to exempting people from the terms of international agreements entered into in relation to road transport. These could be orders exempting individuals or classes of persons.  They could exempt quite a substantial number of people or quite a small number of people.  They could be matters of very minor importance or of major importance.  One cannot envisage at any particular point what might be the contents of an international agreement in relation to road transport. The orders which the Minister seeks to make under this section may be of wide-ranging importance or, conversely, may not be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister proposes in the Bill&mdash; I fear he proposes to insist on this is <Col N="1437" /> defiance of the amendment&mdash;that he should be able to make these orders without any obligation either to inform the House of what he is doing under the Bill or to allow the House by motion, as is the normal procedure, and as is provided in this amendment, to annul the Minister's decision in the matter.  The motion to annul as we all know in a situation where the Government have a preponderance of the representation in the House, as they invariably have under our system, does not really mean that the House will come along and annul those orders.  It does not really mean that the Minister, as he sought to claim on a previous occasion, could not negotiate internationally for fear that he might find that his agreement was to be annulled by the House because a majority were not in favour of what he had agreed. If the Minister has agreed to something, and as is invariably the case he has a majority in the House, he can insist, in defiance of any motion to annul under the procedure contained in this amendment, on having the order incorporating the agreement he has made put through the House by majority vote.  In practice his hands are not tied to any appreciable extent in making international agreements.</P>
    <P>The point of having the facility to allow motions to annul to be introduced within 21 days is that if a particular order is controversial&mdash;one would not expect this to be the case in 90 per cent of the orders but in 10 per cent perhaps this could be the case&mdash;it can be aired in this House. This amendment would allow a Member of the Oireachtas to put down a motion to annul within 21 days of the order be laid before the House, which This amendment also requires that the order be laid before the House, which is not required by the Act as it presently stands unamended.  Within 21 days the Government must provide time to allow the motion to annul it to be discussed.  The Minister and the Opposition will be heard and there will be a proper airing of the issues involved and presumably, unless the Government see some defect in the agreement or the order they made originally, they will get their way but <Col N="1438" /> it will be achieved after proper public discussion of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister, if he does not accept the amendment, will achieve a situation where under this Bill there is no obligation on him to inform the House that he has made the order.  Secondly, there will be no opportunity, short of Question Time in the Dáil, which we all know is a very unsatisfactory instrument for the discussion of policy, for the order to come before the House.  Question Time allows only for question and answer.  It does not allow for any discussion or explanation of a point of view from the Opposition side, from those opposed to a particular course of action.  It merely allows the Minister to be tripped up by questions or his lack of explanation to be exposed in a particular respect. It does not allow for serious discussion of the issues involved in the order which the procedure which is contained in my amendment would allow.</P>
    <P>I believe that the tendency in the House to legislate to an ever greater extent by means of delegated legislation which does not come before the House, and which is contained in its most undemocratic form in the position as contained in the Bill as amended, is highly undesirable.  In 1923, the first year for which I have figures, there were 50 Acts of this House which made changes in our law but only 24 statutory rules and orders were made.  The bulk of legislation in that year at the outset of this House was achieved by Bills which were properly and fully discussed here under normal procedures.  However, by 1935 the situation had been reversed.  I have no reason to believe that it has improved since; in fact, I am sure it has worsened.  In that year 47 Acts were put through the House making legislative changes but 684 statutory rules and orders were made.  The tendency had gone around full circle with the majority of enactments theoretically made by this House being made by delegated legislation by the Minister in a form which in most cases was not discussed here.  Originally, the bulk of legislation was discussed in the proper form provided in the original constitution, <Col N="1439" /> and in the way the House should properly function.</P>
    <P>This tendency to delegate more lawmaking powers to Ministers is not desirable.  If it is to be done it should be subject to the maximum checks on its exercise by the House so that if the Minister does something that is undesirable at least there will be an opportunity to bring him before the House to explain it.  There are two ways this can be done.  The first and most satisfactory procedure from the point of view of the Opposition requires the Minister to lay the order in draft form before the House.  The draft order must be voted upon affirmatively by the House before it takes effect. That is not as full a discussion as a Bill because there is just one discussion on the merits of the order.  However the advantage is that it must be discussed.  I do not think anybody would object to delegated legislation, except on a very controversial matter, if it took that form.</P>
    <P>The second form is the one which I proposed in my original amendment, but which I did not put to the House on Committee Stage because I understood from the Minister that he intended to consider introducing an amendment along the lines I have suggested.  He has not done so although he may introduce such an amendment in the Seanad or accept my amendment. My amendment was efficiently drafted by the parliamentary draftsman for another Bill.  That second procedure contained in my amendment I regard as a compromise in view of the fact that the Minister was not prepared to accept my original proposal.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes that every order made under this Bill be laid before the House.  In that case it is contained in the Order Paper&mdash;like the order relating to the British and Irish Steam Packet Company Limited on today's Order Paper&mdash;and it is open to any Member of the House to annul that order within 21 sitting days of the House.  Unfortunately, a Member does not have the right to move to amend that order; it can only be annulled. That is a defect in the procedure in that one might not wish to throw out the order entirely.  However, one can <Col N="1440" /> at least ensure that it is discussed and if one does not wish to have it annulled one can withdraw one's motion to annual after the debate and before the matter is put to a vote.</P>
    <P>The latter procedure is not as satisfactory as the first one I dealt with, but it is infinitely more satisfactory from the point of view of the House and the Minister who may wish to ensure that what he does is seen to be done in a manner that is publicly accountable.  If he is going to force the order on other people he will be able to say: &ldquo;This just was not my idea.  In introducing this matter I went through certain procedures and any Member who objected had the opportunity to raise the matter in the House, and anybody who has an objection to the order had an opportunity within 21 days of the order being promulgated to approach any Member or me and object to it.  In that event that Member could put down a motion to annul that order.&rdquo;  If that was the case the Minister in enforcing such an order, would be in a much stronger position because he would be able to tell objectors that they had their chance of having the order annulled.  If the Minister could say that the remedy existed but the person who complained against the terms of the order did not avail of the opportunity to use that remedy he would be in a stronger position.  He will not be able to say that now.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not accept my amendment there is no procedure whereby the House, short of introducing the matter in Private Members' Business on the part of the Opposition, can in any substantive way discuss this other than by means of parliamentary question and that is not a satisfactory procedure.  It may happen that Private Members' Time is needed for other more controversial matters not as specialised as an order made under this Bill.  We must be honest that this Bill will not set the majority of the House on fire but a genuine grievance may be created by the misuse of this order-making power by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is a genuine and serious issue of constitutional principle involved in this.  The House must be vigilant as to its rights in a matter of this sort.  If <Col N="1441" /> we do not show that the House, democratically elected by the people, has a right to annul acts of Ministers we will arrive at a situation where gradually the Government to a greater extent will not be carried on in this House but will be carried on between Ministers and outside interest groups, with this House not being involved in the process of government.  That would be a serious development and one which no Member could support.  Already that is happening to too great an extent because of the fact that the resources available to pressure groups of one sort or another to put forward their point of view are infinitely stronger than the resources available to Members who are preoccupied with constituency work and so on and do not have, the research back-up which major interests in the community have.</P>
    <P>To a greater extent policy is being made not between the Minister and the elected representatives here but in the Minister's office when he receives delegations.  If he tells those delegations that he will do something he must do it irrespective of what Members of this House think.  He must do so because he has given a pledge to an outside group.  That is where the real power lies.  It is power not exercised in the open as governmental power necessarily is when it is exercised within this House.  Anything the Minister does in this House is subject to the utmost scrutiny from the Opposition and any member of a Government welcomes such scrutiny and realises that it is important in achieving the right result.</P>
    <P>A Minister finding himself in a position where he can make a substantial and major decision without recourse to this House could be subjected to unfair pressure to do something, whereas if the Minister could say to people putting pressure on him that he would have to come before the Dáil to justify any agreement, the Minister would be in a stronger position.  By accepting this amendment the Minister would be putting himself in a stronger position.  I am not claiming that under this Bill the Minister is likely to do shady deals, but in principle it is right <Col N="1442" /> that the Minister and his successors should have to come before this House or at least be open to be required to come before this House to justify any order made under this Bill.  This is an important constitutional principle and an important issue of parliamentary privilege, and I hope that the Minister as a longstanding member of this House will see the merit of the proposal I am putting forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have in accordance with the undertaking I gave to Deputy Bruton on Committee Stage given careful consideration both to the amendment originally proposed by the Deputy and to the revised amendment which he suggested during his contribution on the Bill as well as to the amendment which is down here in the names of Deputy Bruton and Deputy Fitzpatrick, had I felt that the amendment would strengthen the Bill I would have accepted it or I would have put down an amendment in similar terms. Deputy Bruton may feel strongly about this matter but I feel I should not accept the amendment.  I carefully studied the case made by the Deputy on the last occasion and I was not convinced by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In attempting to defend his proposals Deputy Bruton advanced a precedent which would not stand up to detailed examination.  Deputy Bruton made the case that the Minister for Agriculture was not inhibited in his negotiations in Brussels in relation to farm prices by the fact that consequential orders under prices legislation affecting consumer prices must be laid before the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution of either House. The defect in that argument was that the Deputy appeared to be running two stages of governmental action into one. If an increased farm price is agreed in Brussels the farmers must get it and the Minister for Agriculture in the <Col N="1443" /> course of his negotiations is not hampered by uncertainty as to whether the Oireachtas will subsequently place him in a position where he cannot honour a commitment because of the annulment of the order.  The prices order comes at a further stage where the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy deals with the question of adjusting the consumer price in consequence of the change in farm prices, and anything that may happen at that stage whether by annulment of the order if an order has to be made or otherwise, will not be prejudicial to what has already been agreed as to the farm price in Brussels.  The case made by the Deputy in that respect does not stand up.</P>
    <P>On the other hand what is proposed in the amendment put forward orally by Deputy Bruton last week which is now before us here in an extended form would have an altogether different effect in the sense that if I entered into an international agreement and subsequently made an order to implement it, I could be in a position where I would fail to honour that agreement if the order was subsequently annulled by the Oireachtas.  For Deputy Bruton to say that the Oireachtas would not annul the order because the Government of the day would defeat the annulment by resolution is virtually an argument against accepting the amendment. The argument put forward by the Deputy today and the arguments made by him last week appear to be a variation of the same theme, and they are not convincing.  There are instances where the type of amendment proposed may be necessary.  There are circumstances in which some such safeguard is called for in matters which would affect the daily lives of large numbers of citizens, but to suggest, as in the present instance, that I should not be free to negotiate or to commit myself on matters in relation to international transport specifically cited in section 5 of the Bill is taking the other extreme.</P>
    <P>If we are to take into account the precise circumstances of the case it is quite an intrusion into the functions already entrusted to me by the Oireachtas under transport legislation. <Col N="1444" /> I have discretion by the exercise of licensing powers already at my disposal, to implement, in effect, although indirectly, by the free grant of licences any exemption I might confer by an order under the provisions of section 5 of the Bill to which the Deputy referred the previous day.  I am seeking power to confer such exemptions, by direct action, under the appropriate statutory provisions so as to save administrative difficulties and unnecessary correspondence in implementing transport arrangements intended to further develop international road transport.  It can be argued&mdash;and I considered this when I was giving general consideration to the Deputy's proposals&mdash;that the making of orders under the proposed provisions would be an advance in terms of public information on the use of the licensing powers in the sense that the relevant decisions would be promulgated in the form of orders.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the possibility of secret deals.  It is regrettable that such a suggestion should be made, although I accept that the Deputy excused me from the possibility that this might happen under my administration. International transport arrangements involve Governments and hauliers of different states and unilateral deals could not arise.  Even if in some rather peculiar manner a questionable deal could be made, it would be impossible to keep it secret because the content of the deal would have to be published in the order and publication would be essential since there would be no point in having an exemption if nobody knew about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is it required to be published?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the Statutory Instruments Act the order would be gazetted in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and distributed to the National Library, to the Law Library, to the Law Association and chambers of commerce.  In addition, standing practice in my Department would call for publicity in the media and presentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all those circumstances I do not think there is any need for further <Col N="1445" /> safeguards or for the proposals in the amendment and I have made a case as to the reasons why I do not feel I should accept the amendment. As I said on the previous day, I have already got these powers under EEC legislation in relation to EEC countries and what I am asking for now is similar type power in relation to ECMT countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Deputy Bruton seeks in his amendment to make it obligatory on the Minister to lay before this House any regulations which he makes under section 5 of this Bill so that this House may have an opportunity of considering these regulations on notice of motion, if necessary, and annulment if the House in its wisdom thinks there should be annulment.</P>
      <P>There has been a trend in this State over the years, and it seems to be progressive, to legislate more and more by ministerial order.  As Deputy Bruton has pointed out, in the early years of the State such legislation by ministerial order was rare but in the thirties it increased dramatically and has been commented on in text books as being an invasion of the right of this Parliament and a taking over by bureaucracy. Putting legislation through this House is a troublesome business because it has to be brought in here in a form that will stand up to scrutiny, debate and publicity.  I believe that bureaucrats can and do get impatient with parliamentary procedure.  They regard it as a waste of time, a lot of trouble and as quite unnecessary. That is because they regard the Establishment as being infallible.  That is a dangerous trend.  Deputy Bruton is quite right to highlight this trend.  It is a progressive trend.  If one were to go through every Act of Parliament one would see more and more provision in section after section for making regulations and for doing things by regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House should be jealous of its rights and this Parliament should see to it that its constitutional rights are not eroded by Bill after Bill, section after section.  Deputy Bruton was quite <Col N="1446" /> right to put down the amendment.  I believe the Minister on mature consideration may accept it.</P>
    <P>In effect, the Minister is given authority under section 5 to suspend whole sections of the Road Transport code from 1932 up to date and to exempt from that code certain specified vehicles and certain specified types of transport.  That, in effect, is what this section purports to do.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House I should like to say, first of all&mdash;I know the Minister did not pretend otherwise&mdash; that these regulations have nothing to do with the EEC, have nothing to do with our obligations under the Treaty of Rome.  It is a fact that we surrendered some of our parliamentary rights and, indeed, some of our national rights, in favour of the Treaty of Rome but we did that with our eyes wide open and such a serious business was that that we had to have a referendum before we could deprive the people and their Parliament of their constitutional rights and hand these rights over to the EEC to be operated through and under the Treaty of Rome.  The people did that.  They were right to do it.  But, let us have a look at this section.  This deals with international agreements outside the EEC agreements.  The section reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  Where an international agreement relating to international transport by road to which the State is a party, or an agreement, arrangement or resolution relating to such transport to which the Minister is a party so requires, the Minister may by order exempt from the provisions of section 7 of the Road Transport Act, 1932, sections 9 and 34 of the Principal Act (as amended or extended) and sections 6 and 7 of the Road Transport Act, 1935 (as amended or extended) or from any of those provisions any specified class of vehicle or any specified class of such transport.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister may by order amend or revoke an order under this section.</P>
    <P>That is gloriously vague.  It is as vague as anything could possibly be.  If an international agreement requires it, the Minister may exempt from the Acts any specified class of vehicle or any <Col N="1447" /> specified class of transport.</P>
    <P>You could have long and learned debates on what constitutes an international agreement and what is international law.  There is a very thorny question in regard to the Constitution and international law is invoked from time to time to say that we are not bound by our own Constitution because it is arguable that international law prevails but there is no agreement on what international law is.  It is a question that is debated at great length and with great learning but we do not seem to be clear about it.  Is there a definition of &ldquo;international agreement&rdquo;? The section says that if an international agreement requires, &ldquo;or an agreement, arrangement or resolution relating to such transport to which the Minister is a party so requires&rdquo;. I want to know what is &ldquo;an agreement, arrangement or resolution&rdquo;?  If any of these vague things requires, the Minister may make an order exempting any specified class of vehicle or any specified class of transport.  Let us not forget that &ldquo;any specified class of vehicle&rdquo; will involve persons and citizens and will confer rights on those persons and citizens that other citizens will not have and &ldquo;any specified class of transport&rdquo; will also involve persons who can be identified.  That is the authority the Minister is seeking under this section.  He is seeking to do those things by order.</P>
    <P>As we all know, there are two ways by which this House can retain control over legislation which it passes while at the same time giving the Minister authority to extend or restrict that legislation by order.  One of those ways is by laying it down that an order made by the Minister shall not have any effect until it is passed by this House.  That is a very formal procedure and it is not really legislation by order properly speaking because the order does not take effect until passed by this House.  Deputy Bruton is not suggesting here that the Minister should go that far but the second way in which the House can retain control of legislation which it passes, while at the same time giving the Minister authority to amend it, is by saying <Col N="1448" /> that any order made by the Minister amending the legislation shall be laid before the House and if an order is made annulling it within 21 sitting days afterwards then it shall cease to have effect without prejudice&mdash;usually&mdash;to anything already done under it.  That is not a very serious obligation on the Minister; it does not obstruct him in any way from getting on with his business. He can make the order if he thinks it necessary but he must make this House formally aware of it and give the House an opportunity of discussing it if the House thinks fit, and of annulling it if the House thinks it should be annulled.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Bruton the Minister said his Department publicise the orders, that the National Library, the press and several other people get copies but the one institution that will not get a copy is the sovereign Parliament, Dáil Éireann, the body that should get it.  It is not going too far to ask the Minister to agree to place the order he will make under some international agreement or resolution or arrangement&mdash;it is as vague as that&mdash; before this House which should have an opportunity of discussing it and annulling it if a majority consider that it should be annulled.  That is only right and proper.</P>
    <P>It is hard to understand the Minister's attitude.  He is taking the right to suspend the road transport code or at least several sections of it in favour of a specified type of vehicle to be determined in the future or a specified type of transport to be determined in the future and he is not giving this House an opportunity of considering it by formal debate and vote.  This House is not unreasonable.  We know it has not acted unreasonably in regard to ministerial orders in the past.  I should like to have time to do research in the matter and find out the number of these ministerial orders that have been laid before the House and the number that have been debated on notice of motion.  The Minister may say that shows that there is no necessity for the procedure but it shows the direct opposite: it shows that Dáil Éireann behaves reasonably and that when these orders should be annulled they are annulled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> There is a famous case of which we are all aware, and for that reason I shall not go into it in detail, where an order was made some years ago affecting thousands of people all over the country.  It was challenged and debated in this House.  I think the Government of the day carried the vote and the regulation was upheld but within a very short time I think another order was made restoring the <i>status quo ante.</i>  That was an outstanding example of an order being challenged and the House has only challenged orders when it was clear that they should be challenged.</P>
    <P>The trend I do not like, whether or not it arose under the previous Government and is continuing under this Government, is that not only is the procedure of legislating by ministerial order progressively increasing but we have now reached a further stage when these orders will not come before the House.  That seems to be another step towards a take-over from this House. I suggest that in the past it was the exception for the section providing for the making of ministerial orders not to include provision for laying them before the House.  We are now moving towards a situation where not only are these orders increasing in number but there is a tendency to give the Minister absolute power to make orders changing the legislation, to suspend the Act in favour of specified transport or specified people, while this House has no say.</P>
    <P>That is wrong and Deputy Bruton who has taken up the matter and is highlighting it not only under this legislation but under other Acts is doing a good public service.  He is protecting Parliament and is doing his part to ensure that the powers of Parliament are not further eroded&mdash;and they will be completely eroded if this sort of thing continues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments in favour of the amendment have been very well put by my colleagues, Deputy Bruton and Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I view the matter in a non-legal light, as a person very concerned about the basic principle of parliamentary accountability and public accountability.  This <Col N="1450" /> principle of accountability of Ministers, Government Departments and State and semi-State bodies comes to the forefront from time to time.  We have had suggestions here in the past that semi-State boards should be made accountable to the people through Parliament.  The principle here is to what degree and to what extent the Minister should be given the absolute power to which Deputy Fitzpatrick has just referred.  I would regard this as a very dangerous trend.  Listening to my two colleagues I have become alarmed at the way in which this trend towards granting absolute reserved powers to a Minister has been growing through the years.</P>
      <P>This trend is diminishing the role and powers of Parliament and parliamentarians, and in a democratic system any such attempt must be vigorously resisted.  This is a matter of the degree and nature of the functions that have been reserved, the implications of these functions and how they relate to the public interest.  I would suggest that the Minister should carefully consider the points put forward.  The points raised in relation to this basic principle can be applied to many other Bills going through the House.</P>
      <P>In this legislation the Minister is reserving unto himself quite considerable powers to make orders and regulations which can have major implications for the national transport industry. While copies of such an order or regulation will be furnished to a wide variety of people, the details will not appear on the Order Paper and will not be laid before the House.  This seems ludicrous.  I respectfully ask the Minister to consider seriously accepting this well-argued amendment put forward by Deputy Bruton and Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>

      <P>In replying to the debate I could best commence by quoting from something that was written over 40 years ago by a gentleman called Sir Lynden Macassey, K.C. in the Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law regarding the situation which was then developing at Westminster, whose procedures are similar <Col N="1451" /> to ours.  Although the words were written 40 years ago they apply with equal force to the situation which not only exists but is developing further in this House with every passing year. These words are quoted in <i>The Irish Free State and its Senate</i> by Donal O'Sullivan at page 527 and they read as follows:</P>
      <P>Government Bills are forced through Parliament under the pressure of the Government Whips; there is little time for discussion of their provisions either in the House or in Committee; legislation is passed in the most general terms and left to some Government department to apply as it thinks fit under machinery or rules to be made by it; the Cabinet is therefore in a position, through its member at the head of a Government department, to embark on a particular policy which has never in any detail been discussed in Parliament or communicated to the public.  If the action of the department is challenged in the House, the Government can say, as has been done, that the action of the department is fully within the powers conferred upon it by the Legislature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not very difficult to answer the arguments put forward by the Minister on this occasion.  He suggested, first of all, that the documents in question were published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in the National Library.  They are not, of course, mailed to each Member of this House and the Members are the first people to whom they should be sent. They are not sent to us as a matter of course.  Deputies may get copies of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> if they so request, and very few Deputies actually receive copies.  I happen to get it myself.  I have a number of editions here today which arrived in this morning's post. There are 32 pages in one of them and there are five or six other editions.  I would have to read through these to find an order which may have been enacted by the Minister.  Even then, all I could do would be to put down a parliamentary question about it. This is asking more of the Members <Col N="1452" /> of this House than time allows them to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he felt that this proposal would be an intrusion into his functions as given to him by the Oireachtas.  I feel that any Minister who fears an intrusion by this House should not be a Minister at all.  After all, he is a Minister only because he was appointed such by this House. While it is legitimate for a Minister to object to intrusions into his functions from outside this House, no Minister who is worthy of the name could or should object to an intrusion by this House.  This House must be allowed to intrude into the exercise of each and every ministerial function, otherwise we are not a parliamentary democracy. The Minister's argument is not valid. It is an argument which may give him some satisfaction, but certainly it would not give me any satisfaction if I were in his position.</P>
    <P>The Minister's second argument is, in many ways, the most alarming argument of all.  He said that because these are international agreements they are in a different category, and it is less justified to have orders made in consequence of international agreements subject to parliamentary scrutiny here than it would be to make subject to parliamentary scrutiny agreements incorporated in orders made with people within the jurisdiction&mdash;that there is a greater argument for exempting international agreements than for exempting domestic agreements.  That argument is completely wrong.  If the Minister is entering into an agreement with people within this jurisdiction it is open to him if he finds that it is not a good agreement to change it because it is made with people subject to the laws of this State and it is therefore easier for the Minister to change it. Conversely, if he makes an agreement with people outside the jurisdiction, he cannot with the same ease change the terms of the agreement.  I believe there is a far stronger argument for parliamentary scrutiny of international agreements and the consequences of them than there is for scrutiny of domestic agreements made with people within the jurisdiction.  This situation is tantamount to saying that one can ask anything <Col N="1453" /> one likes about agreements made with people within the jurisdiction, and annul them if one wishes, but if the Minister makes an agreement with people in Germany, France or elsewhere one may not inquire into that even though the agreement and its consequences might be far more serious.</P>
    <P>To me, that sounds like one law for the Irish and another for the foreigner. If the Minister is to be trusted in making agreements then he should be trusted more by the members of our own community where the consequences of domestic agreements can be followed up more readily, as against the consequences of agreements made with people who do not even speak our language and who live in faraway countries.  But, because they are international agreements, the Minister argues that they should not be subject to the same scrutiny as presumably they would be in the case of domestic agreements.</P>
    <P>The other point he made was that it would be very undesirable for a Minister to make an international agreement and then find it had to be annulled because a majority of this House wished to annul it.  He found that in some way unsatisfactory.  If a Minister on a particular issue forfeited the confidence of this House or, more particularly, the Government of which he is a member forfeited the confidence of this House, as would be the case if the Minister were defeated, that is all the more reason why he should not make agreements while he no longer has the confidence of this House.  The argument to prevent any Minister who has not the confidence of this House from entering into international agreements is, I believe, far stronger.  The Minister and his party were very critical of things that were done by the previous Government during the period in which that Government were still in office before the date on which the new Dáil met.  I shall not go into the merits of the issue.</P>

      <P>No, indeed, but it would be possible under this procedure for the Government after being <Col N="1454" /> defeated in the next general election to enter into international agreements between the date of their defeat at the polls and the date of the meeting of this House, a period in which they had clearly forfeited the confidence of this House, a period during which any orders they made could not be annulled.  That would be a most unsatisfactory position to create, and that will be the position if the Minister rejects his amendment.  It makes a nonsense of the criticisms made by the Minister and his party in the days following the last general election.</P>
      <P>My amendment will not stop an agreement being entered into.  All it seeks to do is to provide that any agreement entered into in that period can be annulled within 21 days if the incoming Government wish to annul it.  If the Minister's proposal is upheld any such agreement will take effect <i>simpliciter</i> and the incoming Government and a majority of this House will be able to do nothing.  If the Minister thinks I am wrong in that he can tell me where I am wrong.  The point occurred to me as I was speaking. In view of the expressed anxiety of the Minister's party on the occasion to which I referred in relation to transitional matters of this sort the Minister may wish now to change his position. If he is not prepared to listen to the arguments the whole exercise here becomes a little ridiculous.  If he accepts the amendment he will lose nothing.  In fact, he will gain in stature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring one major point to the attention of the Minister.  It concerns the necessity for a person applying to the Land Registry <Col N="1455" /> to do so with the consent of every person who is a necessary party to the conveyance.  A person cannot take advantage of this section unless he is able to do so with the consent of every necessary party.  This may be a most difficult procedure for a householder wishing to take advantage of this provision and get title on a very simple inexpensive basis because the question immediately arises as to who is a necessary party.  It does not merely mean giving notice and getting the consent of the person to whom he pays his rent.  It involves the consent of every superior interest plus the consent of the mortgagee of every such superior interest.  The alternative procedure is arbitration under section 21 where it is provided that the registrar shall determine the application by arbitration.  The householder wishing to avail of this provision will have to get the consent of all superior interests and he will have to bear the cost of such consent.  Furthermore he has to bear the cost of locating such people for the purpose of, first of all, contacting them and, secondly, of obtaining their consent.  This was the difficulty under the 1967 Bill.  Apart from the arbitration section, which I will come to later, this difficulty has not been removed in so far as the householder is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister accepts that this is the situation&mdash;and I think he must&mdash;will there be any assistance given to the householder in dealing with this problem?  As the Bill stands, the householder cannot even go to the registrar until such time as he has served all the notices on all these people and has obtained their consent.  I will qualify that by saying that he cannot first go to the registrar for arbitration but he can go to the registrar under section 20 for a simple transfer at the fee mentioned in the Bill.  It is my experience that in the majority of cases he will have difficulty in locating the various people and in obtaining their consent.  I appreciate what the Minister has in mind but I am worried that the householder, owing to his lack of information and technical knowledge as to how to investigate this type of situation, will not be able to take <Col N="1456" /> advantage of this Bill other than by arbitration because of the need to have the consent of all the parties before going to the registrar to get the freehold.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider some procedure whereby the registrar will in advance of or in default of the obtaining of such consent be there to advise the householder of the best procedures and how to serve the various notices. Better again, if we are putting the onus on the registrar, why not have the registrar serve the notices as he does the technical work involved?  That is the suggestion I am putting to the Minister in the light of the practical difficulty of any householder who is not holding under an immediate landlord who has the freehold and who is agreeable and co-operates with the householder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned section 21 merely in the context that this is the only alternative open to him if he is not able to avail of section 20.  I am making a suggestion to the Minister as to how section 20 could be tightened up to make it more effective so that householders would be able to take advantage of section 20.  The simple procedure under the Bill is embodied in section 20.  If he is not able to take advantage of section 20 he has to go to arbitration under section 21, and that is the only reason I mentioned section 21.</P>
      <P>I am looking for an assurance from the Minister that the registrar will assist the householder in trying to purchase under section 20 of the Bill and that he might consider a procedure whereby the registrar would issue the necessary notices to the various superior interests&mdash;the mortagees, the superior landlord and so on&mdash;on behalf of the householder.  Otherwise there is a great danger that few householders will be able to take advantage of section 20 and they will therefore be forced into section 21.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very long debate on amendment No. 12 and the consequential <Col N="1457" /> amendments.  If that amendment had been tabled the new purchase scheme in part 3 of the Bill would have been operated by county registrars rather than by the Registrar of Title or his authorised officers.</P>
      <P>One of the arguments that was repeated by Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick (<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>) was that the land registry cannot cope with their present workload and would be unable to cope with the extra work.  During the course of the debate I dealt with this argument and pointed out that additional staff are being recruited to do the work arising on this Bill and that separate accommodation is being arranged for them.  I assure Deputy O'Keeffe that I have now checked on the arrears position in the registry and there has been an encouraging improvement in the position over the last few months, particularly in regard to first registrations or examiners' cases, which constitute the work area most closely related to the proposed ground rents work.  This trend is expected to continue.  As a result, arrears should be down to managable proportions by the end of the year. Indeed, the average delay should be down to an all-time low of between two to three months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not be responsible for the Deputy's experience over the last four or five years. In fairness, the Deputy will have to admit that, because of the extra people being taken on and in view of present trends, delays will be reduced by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Another argument advanced was that to assign the arbitration function to the Registrar of Titles would be of doubtful constitutionality as the Registrar of Titles, unlike the county registrar, is not a judicial officer.  My advice on this important point is that the Constitution is not being contravened in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third argument advanced by Deputies T.J. Fitzpatrick (<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>) and O'Keeffe was that centralising arbitration in Dublin <Col N="1458" /> would involve persons from outside Dublin in unnecessary and comparatively large expenses for travel to Dublin and for meals; that if the new Act were to be operated without the employment of a solicitor, it should be operated on a person-to-person basis.  During the course of the debate on the amendment I answered this point by saying that it would not be necessary for anyone to travel to the Land Registry in Dublin, that the business can be transacted by post. Indeed, if necessary, other measures could be taken to provide for arbitration at centres in Limerick, Cork and Sligo.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy O'Keeffe's comments on section 20, this section does require the consent of every interest involved but this will not be a problem.  Where the tenant has problems he will have to use section 21.  It is for this reason that recourse to arbitration will be inexpensive.  If there are problems&mdash;and there will be problems as there are in every other Department&mdash;those who have them will be more than welcome to seek the help of the people who will be dealing with this work in the Land Registry as they seek help in other Departments. They ring them on the phone, or come in and talk to them, or write to them.  I assure the House that we will do our very best to see to it that the application form will be most informative to people.  If anybody has problems we will try to solve them.  I am quite satisfied that, because of the way the scheme will operate, there will be no difficulty whatsoever for the very large number of people who will be using it.</P>

      <P>I would be delighted with any improvement in the Land Registry.  Over quite a number of years' experience, I have found the staff very co-operative.  There are not <Col N="1459" /> enough staff.  They are working in very poor accommodation.  I would welcome any improvement in that area from the point of view of the facilities available to the staff and from the point of view of clearing the work load.  On section 25 I will come back to the constitutionality aspect about which I have serious concern.</P>
      <P>I should like to pick the Minister up on the question of dealing with the matter on a person-to-person basis. Under the 1967 Act the county registrar dealt with arbitrations.  I cannot see the Registrar of Titles going all over the country dealing with thousands of arbitrations.  However, we will come back to that as well.</P>
      <P>The basic point I was making on section 20 is that there must be assistance for householders who want advice and help.  I accept the Minister's undertaking that this will be forthcoming to householders applying under section 20.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (1), line 35, after &ldquo;lessor.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Service of a notice may be effected in any manner provided for by section 63 of the Act of 1931 or section 23 of the Act of 1967.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is being moved to remove a doubt.  The collective citation of the Bill together with the other Landlord and Tenant Acts would, in the normal way, result in the application to the notice provision in section 21 of the provisions relating to the service of notice in the 1931 and 1967 Acts.  The notice in question is one which the tenant must serve on his immediate lessor when he applies for <Col N="1460" /> arbitration.  The 1931 and 1967 Acts provisions cater for the situation where a landlord cannot be found by enabling the tenant to serve the notice by sending it by registered post to the person to whom the tenant pays the rent, at the place where he pays the rent, or to which he sends it.</P>
    <P>However, a doubt has arisen as to whether the collective citation does in fact bring the 1931 Act provision in particular into operation for the purpose of a notice under section 21. The amendment removes that doubt. In any event, it will be helpful to draw attention specifically to the notice provision in the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>Opposition amendment No. 8a was withdrawn and amendments Nos. 15 and 16 seemed to be aimed at resolving the difficulties arising where the landlord cannot be found.  Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 are regarded as defective and therefore they are not acceptable. They propose that, as an alternative to serving the notice on the landlord, the tenant may serve it on the landlord's agent and, where neither of them is known, and in the case of Deputy Desmond's amendment where the rent has not been demanded for a period of some years, the Registrar of Titles may be advised accordingly.</P>
    <P>Finding the landlord's agent could, in turn, give rise to difficulties and uncertainties.  Service to the place where the rent has been paid as provided in the official amendment is far more certain.  The expression &ldquo;a period of some years&rdquo; is too vague and the expression &ldquo;the Registrar of Titles may be advised accordingly&rdquo; raises the question of what the registrar is supposed to do on receipt of this advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, in response to our amendments, the Minister has made a gallant effort to close this gap.  We are at one on this.  We want to ensure that there is an accepted procedure for service of notice by the householder.  I am still concerned about one point.  I accept that the Minister by incorporating the provisions from the 1931 and 1967 Acts covers virtually all angles except one, which could be a serious one, where <Col N="1461" /> the rent has not been collected for many years and where nobody is available on whom notice can be served.</P>
      <P>It may seem at first sight not to have a lot of substance, but I can assure the Minister, from my personal experience, particularly where ground rents are of a very minor nature, that there are old landlords who have disappeared from the scene and agents who are not available.  In those circumstances, what concerns me is: on whom does the householder serve notice? It is very easy to say he can serve notice on the person to whom the rent was last paid. Rent might not have been paid for 50, 60 or 70 years.  In some circumstances, the rent may be of a nominal nature, perhaps £1, or something of that order.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that, in many cases, persons who collected rents before troid na saoirse were not from Ireland and had very little connection with Ireland.  Many of them may not have bothered with the collection of rents since the twenties and are not available.  We go back to the basic point which, perhaps, was highlighted some years ago when Lord Lucan disappeared.  I do not know whether he had an agent in the area, but say he had not, and say he collected his rents himself.  He has now disappeared.  On whom would his householders serve notice?</P>
      <P>There must be some procedure&mdash;and it is lacking in the Bill as it stands&mdash; whereby, in those circumstances, the householder can set the wheels in motion and go direct to the registrar without the necessity to serve notice. Possibly the best such procedure would be some amendment under which if he could prove to the registrar that he had made efforts to find his immediate landlord, or his agent, or the person to whom the rent was last paid, the registrar could get the wheels in motion.  I do not know whether the Minister has an answer to that point and, if he has not, I would ask him to look at it and try to close that loophole and clear up that problem.</P>

I am advised that when a receipt of a registered letter is available this will suffice. This is a problem which, the Deputy as a practising lawyer knows better than I, has been in existence from am troid na saoirse and it certainly was there before the 1931 Act.  There is a provision in the 1967 Act which I do not want to read because it is quite long, but if all fails with regard to finding a person or sending out the registered letter, that provision will help.</P>

      <P>I think this is basically what the Deputy means&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>or refuses or fails to execute such conveyance, the county registrar for the area in which the land is situate may, on the application of any person concerned, appoint an officer of the Court to execute such conveyance for and in the name of the person so required and thereupon the execution of such conveyance by such officer for and in the name of such person shall for all purposes be as effectual as the execution thereof by such person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Where any person who is required by this Act to convey or join in conveying the fee simple in land is unknown or unascertained, the county registrar for the area in which the land is situate may, on the application of the person entitled under this Act to acquire the fee simple, appoint any person who is receiving the rent in respect of the interest in the land of the person so entitled, or such other person as the county registrar may think fit to appoint, to represent such unknown or unascertained person in all proceedings in connection <Col N="1463" /> with the conveyance of the fee simple in the land, and may, at the same time or subsequently, appoint an officer of the Court to execute such conveyance for and on behalf of the person so required and unknown or unascertained and thereupon the execution of such conveyance by such officer for and on behalf of such person shall for all purposes be as effectual as the execution thereof by such unknown or unascertained person.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will accept that there is provision in that Act to help out in the type of case he mentioned.  Having further regard to what he said, I am prepared to have another close examination of it to see that there is no difference between us on what we hope to achieve here.

      <P>I accept what the Minister has to say.  I would, however, point out to him that section 8 of the 1967 Act does not cover this point.  It is a provision which is effective in connection with the execution of the final document of transfer.  It does not cover the question of the service of notice. If a tenant wants to take advantage of this Bill he has to apply to the registrar under section 20 with the consent of the landlord and all superior interests, or he must apply for arbitration under section 21 where it is stated:</P>
      <P>.... and he shall serve notice of his application upon the immediate lessor.</P>
      <P>Therefore the problem still remains as to the service of notice under section 21, even if he cannot get the consent to proceed under section 20, which he could not if the person were unavailable. There is a lacuna here.</P>

      <P>Under the subsection as it still stands there is no time limit for an appeal.

      <P>I believe that the amendment is not necessary.  In the ordinary way it falls to the Circuit Court Rules to determine the time in which appeals to the Circuit Court <Col N="1465" /> must be taken.  At present under the 1967 Act appeals from a county registrar's decision must be brought within 10 days pursuant to order 15 rule 7 of the Circuit Court Rules of 1950. This rule will not be adequate to provide for appeals against awards by the Registrar of Titles, and in the ordinary way the Circuit Court Rules Committee will be requested to draw up suitable rules.  It is proposed that the time for appeal will be 10 days but the rules of the rules committee naturally will be taken on this issue.</P>

      <P>We have untangled the matter fairly well.  I have referred to the question of notice which is under subsection (1).  There is one further point that I wish to draw to the Minister's attention.  Subsection (4) refers to an appeal to the courts under section 22 of the Act of 1967.  By inference all the provisions of the Act of 1967 will apply to this part.  I assume that it is on that basis that there is no reference to an appeal to the court under section 21.  The Minister presumably can take advice on it. Will it be necessary to say specifically that an appeal to the court under section 22 of the 1967 Act or under section 21 of this Bill can go to the Circuit Court?  It is really a matter of draftsmanship.  Because of the way the section is drafted I do not know whether it could be construed that there is not an appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

      <P>I referred to that, and it is a point which I anticipated the Minister would respond with. There is a specific reference to an appeal under section 22 of the 1967 <Col N="1466" /> Act.  We have no specific reference to an appeal under section 21 of this Bill. I accept it as a general proviso applying the provisions of the 1967 Act to this part.  I am not making any great point about it, but I wonder whether from the draftsmanship point of view there should be a specific reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (1) (b), line 3, after &ldquo;fee simple,&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The situation under section 22 is that the registrar can issue a vesting certificate either when an application is made to him, with the consent of section 20, or he completes an arbitration under section 21 if the consent is not forthcoming. In those circumstances, and the purchase money being paid, he can issue a vesting certificate to the householder.  The important point here is that the Bill provides that the purchase money must be paid by way of a lump sum.  Another point and one that I shall come to later is that all the arrears of rent must be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although this provision is a considerable improvement on the 1967 procedure I have always claimed that it cannot in any way be considered to be leading to the abolition of ground <Col N="1467" /> rents.  I have searched as to how one might find a system that would lead to abolition and in the course of my efforts I have found that some other people had given thought to the problem previously and this is what gave rise to the amendment which proposes that where a householder gives notice of wishing to acquire a freehold and then delays the procedure for acquisition, the rent paid by him in the meantime be credited against the purchase. In effect this would give rise to a situation, taking a period of approximately eight years as being the multiplier that would be relevant in many cases, in which a householder could serve notice on his landlord and then delay taking further action for the next eight years.  Thereafter he could apply to the registrar and would get his freehold title without any further payment. In effect the rent paid between the date of the serving of the original notice and the application for registration would be credited against the purchase.</P>
    <P>I do not claim the inspiration for the suggestion in the amendment.  Rather the credit must go to the Ministers for Justice and Health and Social Welfare who, when in opposition tabled an amendment of a similar nature&mdash;it was No. 79&mdash;to the Bill introduced by the Coalition.  This appears to be the proposal the two Deputies had at the time for the provision of a procedure leading to the abolition of ground rents. Now that the matter has been drawn to the Minister's attention, I presume he will accept the amendment without demur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat early in the day for the Deputy to be as mischievous politically as he is endeavouring to be.  He knows well&mdash; he would know this even from his short time in the House&mdash;that amendments are tabled for the purpose of discussion. A number of amendments have been tabled to this Bill both by Fine Gael and Labour.  Some of these were withdrawn but they all provided the opportunity for discussion.  Either the Deputy or one of his party is on record as having said that amendments provide very useful vehicles for discussion on Committee Stage of any Bill when <Col N="1468" /> matters are teased out as they should be teased out.</P>
      <P>Regarding the amendment to which Deputy O'Keeffe refers, that was, the former amendment No. 79 to the other Bill which was tabled by Deputy Haughey and I, that Bill was not put through because of a lack of political will on the part of the Coalition. They did not bother presenting it for Committee Stage.  The Deputy will know that the amendment we tabled was put down for the purpose of discussion. He knows, too, that the matter in question having been discussed, common sense and reasonableness must be maintained but if he pushes the amendment we will realise how far he is prepared to go with it.  He must not forget that the purpose of the amendment is to enable a tenant who has served notice to continue to pay his ground rent for so long as it takes such payments to equal the amount of the purchase money, following which it would appear that he would be entitled to get his vesting certificate without making further payment to the landlord.  The Deputy knows that this would be confiscatory.  I would not hold the Deputy responsible on behalf of his party for pushing for a vote on the amendment, since the facts have been spelled out for him and since, presumably, those who approached him to ask that he table such an amendment will realise that the point has been discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out in replying to the Second Stage debate, a termination of the liability to pay rent at a future date without compensation is, in justice and in law, no different from a termination without compensation at a current date.  The fact that the rent is paid in the interval is irrelevant because this is the landlord's legal right in any event.  The Deputy knows well that it would be clearly unconstitutional to impose by statute a termination of the landlord's right to receive his rent either now or in the future without adequate compensation being paid.  In adition the Deputy knows that if landlords and tenants consent there is nothing in the Bill to prevent them from arranging a scheme <Col N="1469" /> of payment of the purchase price by way of instalment.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Deputy had the same motives in view as I had in relation to the amendment he referred to, that is, to have the matter brought forward for discussion in an effort to spell out again the obligations and responsibilities that this Parliament must have regarding the protection of people's rights and properties.  I do not say to the Deputy, as he said to me, that he and his party are committed firmly to the amendment by reason of their having tabled it.  It would be as wrong for me to say that as it was wrong for the Deputy to suggest that I and my colleague were as firmly committed when we put down our amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little surprised at the Minister's reaction to what I have to say on this amendment. It seems to amount to an admission that that amendment and other amendments put down by him and his party were for political purposes.  In my research seeking to find the best way of getting a scheme leading to the abolition of ground rents&mdash;and this Bill clearly does not do that despite the many advantages and improvements in it which I accept&mdash;I found this amendment.  I assumed it would not have been put down by the then Deputies G. Collins and Haughey without the constitutional and other aspects of it having been fully investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this point was raised by the Minister I expect that his reaction would be to accept this amendment and nobody has taken the view that it should not be accepted. The Minister raised the question of constitutionality.  Let us see how we can get over that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if, in addition to the entitlement of the householder to go to the registrar, there was similarly an entitlement after service of notice on the part of the landlord to go to the registrar, this would cover the constitutional <Col N="1470" /> problem.  I would not like the Minister to feel that a discussion on this amendment can merely be chopped up by raising the question of constitutionality.</P>
    <P>Obviously my party would always wish to see the terms of the Constitution observed.  I would not like to be political by saying we are a semi-constitutional party; we are totally a constitutional party.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has worries about the Constitution in relation to this provision which could lead to the abolition of ground rents, could a provision not be put into the Bill giving the entitlement to the landlord at the service of notice of going to the registrar? This would mean that he would end up with his purchase money quicker.  The practical situation would be that many landlords, and in particular many landlords who are abroad, would not bother exercising their rights to do so.  This would permit many householders to take advantage of this provision and they would be able to buy their ground rents not exactly on an instalment plan but obtain credit for the rent paid after service of notice.</P>

I cannot and will not accept a reaction to an amendment which I put down in <Col N="1471" /> all seriousness that this is or could be unconstitutional.  I would want to see more solid grounds put forward as to why it is unconstitutional.  If I were convinced of that, I would look at the problem as being: how do we frame the Bill to make sure it is not unconstitutional. I do not want to see a confiscatory section in the Bill which would be unconstitutional because that would be no good to the householder. I have made a solid and constructive suggestion to the Minister as to how he could overcome the constitutional problem if he has the will to accept this as being a procedure which would lead to abolition.</P>

      <P>This is purely a drafting amendment. The noun &ldquo;conveyance&rdquo; has acquired a somewhat technical character amounting almost to a deed of conveyance. That is not what is intended here because the vesting certificate will not, in fact, be a deed of conveyance although it is to have the same effect.  The use of the verb &ldquo;to convey&rdquo; avoids this little problem.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (2), lines 11 and 12, to delete &ldquo;and that rent for the dwellinghouse has been paid up to date&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the requirement in the Bill that the householder cannot get his freehold title without having paid all arrears of rent.  There is considerable ground for suggesting that the Register of Titles should not be turned into a rent collector.  I do not think that it is any business of the registrar to ensure that arrears of rent are paid.  The position would be that if the freehold had been conveyed the landlord would still be entitled to proceed by way of court process for any arrears.  It seems wrong that the registrar should be turned into such a rent collector.</P>
      <P>Another point which I wish to make in connection with this is that rent might not have been paid for years.  I quoted to the Minister cases where rent might not have been paid for 50 or 60 years.  In such circumstances a large amount of the rent would be statute barred because, as the Minister is aware, if a person does not go to the bother of collecting a debt or rent it becomes statute barred after a certain period of time.  It appears that under this provision the registrar, cum-rentcollector, would be put in the situation not alone of having to collect the arrears of rent but also of having to collect the rent for anything up to 50 years.  The Minister should look at this from two points of view.  Firstly, he should see if he could accept the amendment <i>in toto</i> and discharge the registrar from having the function of being a rent collector.  If he is not pre-pared to accept that principle he must ensure that there is no obligation on the registrar to collect arrears of rent which, were it not for this subsection, would have been statute barred.  It would be unjust if the householder in circumstances I have outlined could not obtain his freehold title without having to pay 50 years arrears of rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that there is a legal and moral obligation on such a person to pay such rent but there is no legal obligation on him to pay it other than within the terms of the statute which, in relation to moneys due under a charge on real property, would be 12 years.  From the moral point of view, while I agree that every man should pay his debts, if a landlord had not bothered to collect rent for 50 years or if he is not available I do not see that there is any moral <Col N="1475" /> obligation on a householder to go back beyond the terms of the statute.  The Minister should accept the principle that the registrar should not be turned into a rent collector, and if he is not prepared to accept that principle he should limit the amount of rent that would have to be paid to the amount which is not statute barred.  As this provision is framed it would have the effect of putting an onus on the registrar to collect all arrears dating back to the date when rent was last paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe.  There is a situation in the Irish legal system, and in our own approach to property, whereby a person who has been in continuous occupation of land and has not paid rent for 12 years or acknowledged the right or title of any person to the property then the person after 12 years acquires a right which gives him full fee simple ownership in the property. There are a couple of exceptions, one being insanity on the part of the person who fails to collect the moneys, and the second is in the case of an infant. Other than in such cases a person after continuous occupation for 12 years can have himself registered in the Land Registry with a possessory title.  The danger I see is that if the Minister gives a power to the Registrar of Titles to enforce the collection of rents over the 12 year period he is interfering with the long held title in the Irish countryside of a squatter's title.  Such a title arises after 12 years' continuous occupation of land without any objection from anybody or without any admission on the part of the person to the right of anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section could have the effect of changing the present position.  If this occurs the example being given may not be confined to landlord and tenant but may extend further into a lot of additional pieces of legislation coming before us in the future.  It may also lead to questions being asked about the ownership of many farms.  When a farmer who is 12 years in possession of his land applies to the land registry to have his title brought up to date and the registrar registers him with a <Col N="1476" /> good marketable title.  This is what has occurred since the foundation of the Land Registry.  In agricultural terms the squatter's title applies, the person who has 12 years' occupation goes to the Land Registry and he is registered. Under the Statute of Limitations 1957 the debt is completely wiped out after 12 years but this will now be changed and the registrar of titles will be able to collect arrears going back over the 12 years.  The Minister should consider this.</P>
    <P>This could inflict great hardship on many people who feel that the title to their property has expired, that the debt has expired or the rents on property has expired and they now find if they want to get a fee simple title that they have to pay back over this period of 12 years.  I believe it is agreed by everybody that if you do not collect the rents which are due for 12 years the law should not protect you because you have been so negligent as to allow the collection of your rents to lapse for 12 years.  It is wrong for the law to come in and protect you after a 12 year period when you were completely negligent during that time.</P>

      <P>One of the matters which the Registrar of Titles must be satisfied about before he gives a vesting certificate is that the ground rent has been paid up to date.  It would be clearly confiscatory to have it otherwise. It would be grossly irresponsible to suggest that tenants who are in arrears of rent should escape liability for the arrears by purchasing a fee simple.  Even if the Deputy were to argue that the landlord may still have his right to sue for arrears as a civil debt it would be clearly wrong for the State, by way of an official scheme, one assisted from public funds, to encourage non-payment of rent as I believe the amendment would do if accepted.  I believe it would be clearly wrong to distinguish unfairly between the tenant who has paid his rent to date and the tenant in arrears.  If rent is still due under the lease I believe there is a legal entitlement that it must be paid and that it should be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the recovery of rent being statute barred.  It is correct that the statute of limitations <Col N="1477" /> would apply, but that does not have the effect of giving the tenant the fee simple title.  If he is to get the fee simple title he must pay his rent as legally due.  As I understand it he can pay up his rent for six years and then he is entitled to carry on.  Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Enright raised questions about the impact of section 22, particularly the need to have the rent paid up to date on (a) the Statute of Limitation Act, 1957 and (b) the Registration of Title Act and its provisions for possession of title. Those issues can be examined, and I am quite prepared to examine them, but the principle of no confiscation is involved if arrears of rent are not catered for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There cannot be any question of confiscation where a landlord is left with his civil remedy.  My basic objection to this Bill is that it is the Registrar of Titles who is being put in the position of being the rent collector.  If the Minister does not accept this principle I want to press him very strongly on the amount of arrears which should be paid.  I am concerned that because of the manner in which this subsection is drafted the element of confiscation in effect swings against the householder.  Under existing legislation, the Statute of Limitations, he would not be liable to pay more than 12 years' arrears of rent if action in that regard were taken against him by the landlord.</P>
      <P>The effect of this particular subsection is that if the householder wishes to avail of his rights to acquire his freehold not alone does he have to pay up the purchase money, the fees and any other lawyer expenses he is involved in, but he will have to pay in addition the arrears of rent, which are lawfully due, plus the arrears of rent going back beyond the terms of the statute, which are not lawfully due.  I want to put it strongly to the Minister that if he does not accept the overall principle of turning the registrar into a rent collector, which is a very doubtful proposition, there should be no question of permitting confiscation against the householder.  This subsection, as it is drafted, will provide for confiscation against the householder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> Under the present law the householder is liable only to pay 12 years' arrears.  Anything else is statute barred.  If he goes in to the registrar to obtain his freehold title under the Bill as it stands the registrar cannot, even on payment of the purchase money, give him his title unless the rent for the dwelling-house has been paid up to date.  There are many cases all over the country where rent may not have been paid for 50 years.  I am aware of a number of them.  As this subsection stands the householder would not alone have to pay the amount which he is lawfully liable to pay, less the 12 years' arrears, but he would have to pay all the arrears of rent back over the last 50 years.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to the fee.  A fee of £5 is a little excessive and the Minister should reduce it to £2.  The issuing of a vesting certificate involves only a minimal amount of work and, while I accept that a service is being provided, £5 is excessive.  Similarly the £12 should be changed to £7.  Deputies Mrs. Desmond and O'Keeffe have put down similar amendments.  There have been quite a lot of increases in fees in the Land Registry lately and these will be dealt with later.  I know that the people in the Land Registry are providing a service for the whole country and that they are working in very overcrowded conditions but nevertheless in this instance £5 is excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an amendment in my name in relation to the procedure under section 20 reducing the land registry fees from £5 to £2, but my other amendment relating to the reduction in fees payable in relation to arbitration is more important.  The majority of householders will have to resort to arbitration because to take advantage of section 20 householders must get the consent of all parties joining in the conveyance.  Tracing back <Col N="1482" /> superior interests and mortgages has always been the problem under the 1967 Act.  The result is that householders will probably have to use the arbitration provisions most.  Unless the immediate landlord owns the freehold, has no mortgage interest on it and is amenable to selling, every such case will have to go to arbitration under section 21.  In relation to the cost of arbitration the figure assessed in relation to a householder in occupation applying under this part of the Act is £12 in addition to the £5 fee which I would call the application fee.  We have a situation where the householder must pay a total of £17 in fees if everything goes according to plan and there are no complications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another provision which we will come to later allowing for further fees, but dealing solely with arbitration, as of now the fees payable on an arbitration to the county registrar under the 1967 Act amount to £2, that is £1.50 on the application and 50p on the order.  The Minister may well say that the procedure will be simpler and that the registrar in effect will look after the tenant's interests and that he will be saved the expense of a solicitor and that this is where the advantage will be.  That will not be the case, because the registrar will be the arbitrator and if he is the arbitrator how can he represent the householder?  The householder will be faced with the situation under this Bill of having to pay, in relation to the arbitration, a fee which is six times greater than he has to pay under the 1967 Act.  At the same time, unless the arbitration is of a very simple nature, he would have to pay in addition a fee for legal representation especially when the arbitration will probably have to be held in Dublin. On that basis, I strongly suggest that the Minister should take a much more modest view of the land registry fees, which are totally unrelated to legal fees.  They are fees payable to a Government Department.  These fees should be of a nominal nature, and imposing, in an arbitration situation which will apply in the majority of cases, fees amounting to £17 payable to land registry plus the other expenses <Col N="1483" /> which are payable is too much.  If the Minister feels that every encouragement should be given to tenants to avail of their rights under the terms of this Act he must think seriously about this and consider a substantial reduction.</P>

      <P>On the second reading of the Bill we had quite a bit of toing and froing on the question of the fee and we had a certain amount of point scoring from the two sides.  The fee of £5 for the vesting certificate and the additional fee of £12 for arbitration, despite what may be said, is only nominal in terms of present-day legal costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that the £5 fee for the vesting certificate and the £12 for arbitration are nominal charges in comparison to present day legal costs.  It cannot be claimed by anybody, especially members of the legal profession, that a maximum total expenditure of £17 would create hardship for any tenant who wishes to avail of his rights under this Bill.  It is to be assumed that a very high proportion of those applying under this Bill will be able to have their work done for £5.  To make arbitration available for a net extra cost of £5 as one of the amendments proposes would have an undesirable result.  Reducing the differential in cost between the consent procedure and arbitration could encourage applicants <Col N="1484" /> to by-pass the cheaper consent procedure, and this could create delay problems at arbitration level.  The ideal thing is for groups of tenants to approach the landlord and to use the consent procedure to get their vesting certificates for £5 each.  This is by far the most practical and sensible thing to do, and I should like to say that arbitration should not be resorted to except in a case in which there is genuine difficulty, for instance, in relation to entitlement or price.  This general approach is also reflected in section 23 (5) which provides that the £12 fee as well as any other costs of the arbitration can be ordered to be paid by a party who has behaved unreasonably.</P>
      <P>In any event, the fees of £5 and £12 represent the limits of the Government's contribution which, I might add, is considerable.  It must be remembered that these fees can be compared in many cases with figures going into hundreds of pounds which would be payable by way of legal costs, including the cost of arbitration, under the 1967 Act.  I do not want to go back&mdash; it would be out of order&mdash;to some of the things said in the Second Reading speech on the question of fees but I believe, and it is accepted by all, that £5 is a very reasonable fee having due regard to what the legal fee would be if this scheme were not in operation.</P>

      <P>It would appear to me that there is genuine confusion in the mind of the Minister as between fees that are payable to the Land Registry, which I call Land Registry fees, and legal fees.  The position is that in a very simple case only nominal fees would be payable to the Land Registry and it is very probable that the householder will be able to take advantage of this scheme without engaging a solicitor.  This would apply in a large estate where a group of householders came together and made an agreement with the landlord.  The confusion arises in the Minister's mind, if I may respectfully suggest, between Land Registry fees and legal fees because in cases of a complicated nature in relation to Land Registry fees it is almost certain that the householder <Col N="1485" /> will have to engage a solicitor and pay his fees also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that there may be some genuine confusion also on the Deputy's part.  We will tease it out until such time as none of us is confused.  The arbitration will not be a formal hearing and there is no need whatsoever for any member of the legal profession to be there.  The arbitrator will be able to decide on the papers in front of him and the correspondence he has.  If a person wants to make his case to the arbitrator he can go there himself. There is no way that this is a big ready up, that every person who goes to arbitration should go only in the company of a member of the legal profession.  This would defeat the purpose. I am quite sincere in saying that anybody who has a case for arbitration is entitled to go himself and put his case to the arbitrator.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1492" /> However, it is recognised that all parts of the region have not benefited equally from recent and current industrial development and the Industrial Development Authority are giving particular attention to the needs of those areas within the region which might be regarded as disadvantaged. These would include, in particular, the eastern part of Mayo, south-east Galway and some coastal areas.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that the present IDA programme as outlined recently in a document would indicate a preponderance of activity on the eastern side of the country as against the west, and that the reason for that is that problems have arisen in the east because of migration from the west due to neglect in the past?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts do not bear that out.  For example, the west region achieved 98 per cent of its net total job creation target in the period 1973-1976, and that was the second best regional performance.  The net increase in manufacturing employment in the region was 3,300.  The figures for 1977 are not available as yet.  However, in other areas in the east and north-east there were net job losses. Therefore the IDA recognised the overall situation and they geared their programme accordingly.</P>

      <P>I must first of all reject the implication in the Deputy's question that the changes which are envisaged in the role of SFADCo represent a diminution in the status of that company.  As I stated in the House on 31 January last, what is intended is that the development company would concentrate in a special and intensive way not hitherto attempted in this country on the development within the mid-west region of small industry, especially indigenous industry, existing and new.  I see this as a pilot exercise the results of which will be evaluated at the end of 18 months or two years, when decisions will be taken about the extension of such an intensive drive to other regions.  The taking on by the development company of this new role represents a shift of emphasis in the company's industrial promotion role.  It does not diminish the importance of this aspect of the company's role but, on the contrary, will give it a new dimension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to engage in any argument because it is not appropriate at Question Time to do so, but I put it to the Minister that an additional agency would have a presence, a responsibility and a function in the mid-western region where there will be four agencies involved, namely, the IDA, SFADCo, a county development team and the RDO, reporting to different Ministers, and where there is no co-ordinating agency. Would the Minister reconsider the situation and ensure that there is some co-ordinating agency or authority to co-ordinate the work of the different agencies?  Otherwise there will be chaos.

There are a number of bodies with different functions and there is no one Minister or Department responsible for co-ordination of their functions.

      <P>The IDA have responsibility for the provision of houses and/or mortgage finance for key workers and executives of industrial projects who have to be brought in from outside the areas where the projects are located and who are unable to get their requirements from the traditional sources.  The allocation for this purpose for 1978 is considered adequate on the basis of the demand in 1977 and in the light of projected requirements.  This allocation in fact represents a small increase on the outturn for expenditure in 1977.  Most of the 1978 allocation will be spent on the provision of mortgages for a number of companies, the details of which are confidential, and the completion of a housing scheme at Ballybane, County Galway.</P>

      <P>For the facility, yes, but one must remember exactly what the facility is.  The authority's mandate is limited to the provision of houses and/or mortgages for key workers and executives of a project who have to be brought in from outside the area in which the project is located and&mdash;the important thing&mdash;who had failed to get the requirement from the traditional sources, for example local authorities, banks, building societies and so forth. The Deputy will be aware that the building societies are well placed at present to finance new houses.  The Small Dwellings Acts loan has increased considerably from £4,500 to £7,000 and the bank loans scheme is being continued for this year.  Therefore the IDA scheme is only a last resort, and the last resort situation will not be arising to a great extent this year.  Adequate money is there.</P>

As Deputy Bruton was informed in reply to his previous question on 25 October 1977, Ceimicí Teoranta had indicated to the relevant farmers' organisations that they were prepared to process potatoes at their Labbadish factory subject to specified price and supply terms being met.  Though the factory was made ready to receive potatoes for processing none have been received.  Ceimicí Teoranta are still prepared to process potatoes at this factory.  However, because of developments in the starch market the price which could be paid for the potatoes now would have to be lower than in October last.  Otherwise, the terms would be the same.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that within the Commission in recent months there has been considerable confusion as to the precise wishes of the Irish Government in relation to the operation of the proposed subsidy and why the Irish Government have failed, apart from lodging a formal complaint against the British subsidy, to take any other action open to them by way of lodging a formal application for the abolition of the British subsidy and therefore removing the discrimination against Irish industrial products?

A sum of £5 million is being provided in the current year to enable payments of £5 per week to be made in respect of each worker on the payroll to firms in the labour intensive sectors of industry most affected by the UK temporary employment subsidy scheme.  It is intended that payments under the new scheme, which at present is being examined by the EEC Commission, will commence in July 1978 to operate retrospectively from 3 April 1978.  The scheme will be reviewed when the fully pay-related social insurance contribution scheme <Col N="1507" /> comes into operation and will end, in any case, as soon as the special measures adopted by the British Government to maintain employment in competing sectors of UK industry are terminated.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are no doubt aware the then Government, in November 1973, approved in principle a proposal that the ESB should proceed with a nuclear project on the basis that it would be reassessed before final contractual commitments were entered into.</P>
      <P>The project was deferred temporarily in October, 1975 because of a reduction in demand for electricity at the time but has recently been reactivated by the ESB whose proposals are at present under consideration.  Until the Government have made a decision on the ESB proposals I am not in a position to give the information requested by the Deputies and even then, I should point out, endorsement by the Government of the nuclear project at this stage would not involve a commitment of any kind as to a particular type of nuclear reactor or where it should be bought.</P>

The Deputy will remember that in reply to a similar question some time ago it was stated that when all the necessary information has been compiled a decision will be <Col N="1516" /> taken.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB site report on Carnsore Point was submitted by the ESB to the Wexford Planning Authority, that is the Wexford County Council, in August 1974 with the application of the board for outline planning permission for a nuclear power station at Carnsore Point and is available for inspection by the public at the offices of the Wexford County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A copy of this report was submitted by the ESB to the Department of Transport and Power in October 1974 with a request for the Minister's approval of the site as being suitable for a nuclear power station of the types described in the report.  The then Minister for Transport and Power, under the provisions of the Nuclear Energy Act, 1971 requested the advice of the Nuclear Energy Board on the ESB proposals.  The Nuclear Energy Board furnished their report in October 1976.  The report was a preliminary assessment of the suitability of the site, and the Nuclear Energy Board indicated that before giving formal approval for the site the <Col N="1518" /> board would require a much more detailed assessment of a specific reactor design to be located at Carnsore.</P>
    <P>I understand from the ESB that until such time as tenders are received it would not be possible for them to furnish the further detailed assessments required by the Nuclear Energy Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the House rose for lunch we were dealing with the actual fees payable in connection with applications under this Bill.  The Minister said that he felt that once this Bill had gone through very little work would be involved other than for parties to call in to the Registrar of Titles.  He was under the impression that once a person called in to the Registrar of Titles he would take it from there.  He felt that it would hardly <Col N="1546" /> be necessary to get legal advice on it and that the staff in the Land Registry would be able to look after this matter. I pointed out that some previous good intentions of this nature failed.  I gave the example of the granting of a letter of administration, which is a very stereotype job.  This is a much more complex matter.  I pointed out that while the Minister's intentions in this matter were admirable in my view they were impracticable.  There was a large increase recently in Land Registry fees. Some of those fees have increased from £60 to £100.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, by the stroke of a pen, was able to increase the fees from £60 to £100.  Section 23 (2) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may by order fix the fees to be taken in the Land Registry for the purposes of this Part, other than the fees mentioned in subsection (1) and may revoke or amend any such order.</P>
      <P>He may amend it upwards or downwards. The fees we are discussing to-day are not very great but the Minister, with the stroke of a pen, may decide that there are too many people calling in to do this job&mdash;and a lot of work has to be done by the staff in the Land Registry&mdash;and he may increase the fees upwards.  I feel that the fees are too high.  I believe that a small fee is desirable.  I ask the Minister that in the ordinary issuing of the vesting certificate the £5 fee be reduced to £2.  Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Desmond want the other ones in relation to the arbitration reduced from £12 to £10.  I believe this fee should be reduced from £12 to £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if the applications are properly prepared and processed when they are sent to the Land Registry the <Col N="1547" /> amount of work the staff there need to do will be very little.  A lot of the major work should be done before the applications come to the Land Registry and the fees should be reduced from £5 to £2.  I am not very happy about the Minister reserving the right to amend the fees upwards. The Minister does not have to come to the House to increase those fees.  I believe he should reduce the fees here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one final appeal to the Minister particularly in relation to the arbitration fee.  I said earlier that I felt there was confusion here, and it is very important that there should not.  At the moment the fees payable under the 1967 Act to the county registrar amount to £2.  In addition, the person appearing before the county registrar has to pay his legal costs.  What is the position under this Bill?  There is an increase from £2 to £12 in the fees payable to the registrar, that is a 500 per cent increase.  The main justification I get from the Minister is that there will be no need to engage a solicitor.  He is really saying that for the privilege of not being legally represented the householder will pay an increased fee of 500 per cent to the registrar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that, apart from the right of anybody to be legally represented, if the matter was very simple there would be no need to be legally represented. I do not know if the Minister is aware of the complex issues which can arise on such an arbitration, which may involve evidence from architects, valuers and all sorts of people.  If for example, there is less than 25 years to run in the lease an item that has to be taken into account is the reversionary rent that will be fixed after the term left in the lease has expired.  In order to fix such a figure evidence is normally brought by valuers and so on.  There is a conflict between the landlord and tenant, the landlord obviously looking for the highest figure and the tenant obviously looking for the lowest figure. In such a situation the registrar will not be there to help the tenant.  He is <Col N="1548" /> there as arbitrator, to judge, to decide. While I accept that the hearing will be informal who will present the householder's point of view?  Who will present his case to the best possible advantage?  I suggest to the Minister that in the instance I have quoted, in the thousands of others that will arise, because of the complexities of any particular case or because of the problems of distance or of not understanding the provisions of the Bill, the tenant or householder will inevitably engage the services of a legal adviser to help him.  It is all very well for the Minister to point to a big estate and say that they will come together, agree on a specific plan and get the consent of the landlord who may have the freehold interest.  It would be fine if that could be done but that would be the exception rather than the rule.</P>
    <P>In the majority of cases going to arbitration I suggest that the probability will be that the householder will have to engage and pay for legal help and at the same time, instead of paying £2, the fee presently payable to the county registrar on an arbitration, he will have to pay £12 to the registry. I am not making any political capital out of this but I believe it is in the interests of us all that we should reduce as much as possible the costs involved and simplify the procedures. I do not see a justification for such a substantial increase.  The Minister might consider leaving the figure at £2 as an arbitration fee payable to the registry bearing in mind that in most cases the householder will have to engage the help of a solicitor and pay a solicitor.  If the Minister accepts the situation as presented by me I do not think there is any justification for an increase from £2 to £12 in the arbitration fee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputies Enright and O'Keeffe.  The Minister may get the impression that we are talking about a very small sum of money but we are making our case in accordance with the spirit of the Bill, to make it as simple and as cheap as possible for lessees to buy out their ground rent.  The Minister should take into account the suggestion by Deputy O'Keeffe that people will get <Col N="1549" /> together to buy out their ground rent. As far as arbitration is concerned that would reduce the cost to the State. Because many of these cases will consist of multiple applications the Minister should settle for a round figure of £10, where there is arbitration, or £5 where it is not necessary.  The purpose of the amendments is to honour the spirit of the Bill.  The Minister should accept either of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a number of points have been raised again on this amendment.  I thought we had disposed of a lot of them before the lunch break but we are back on them again. Deputy O'Keeffe's example of the determination of a gross rent or the fixing of the notional rent on renewal is a good one but this view as to how it will operate is incorrect.  The registrar can determine this notional rent easily without a valuer.  I should like to assure the Deputy that there is an important difference between court procedure where opposing evidence of values would be appropriate and, of course, arbitration.</P>
      <P>I believe that Deputy Enright is genuinely mistaken with regard to the £5 fee, that this is going to be raised by order by me, or whoever follows me, whenever we decide.  That is not so.  I spelt out clearly that the fee of £5 for the vesting certificate is a fixed fee for the time this scheme is in operation.  Deputy Enright could be mistaken in his reading of subsection 2 of section 23 which states, &ldquo;other than the fees mentioned&rdquo;.  I want the Deputy to be fully satisfied that the fee is fixed for vesting certificates purposes at £5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I could say to those who are looking for a reduction in the fee from £5 to £2 that there is a certain degree of contradiction involved.  I am told that £5 is too much for the simple job that has to be done and yet I am told that to get that job done it will be necessary to get the assistance of the legal profession.  I do not believe that that is necessary.  It is a very <Col N="1550" /> simple operation for anybody who wants to get the vesting certificate. They can do it without the valued, though expensive help of the legal profession. I have gone out of my way to ensure that the operation of this scheme will be so simple that the legal profession will not be bothered unduly with regard to seeing whether or not it operates successfully.</P>
      <P>Somewhere along the line we have heard that much wants more.  I nailed my colours to the mast on behalf of the Government with regard to a £5 fee.  During the course of the Second Stage debate I gave details of the cost of this to the Exchequer and I stated that we were prepared to subsidise it to that extent.  I referred to the fact that the National Coalition in the Bill which they had the opportunity of processing, if they wished, had not nailed their colours to the mast with regard to the fixing of a fee.  I pointed out that my predecessor, Senator Cooney, said that he could not see the fee being less than £25.  That is on record but I do not wish to make any meat out of it.  I am trying to put the demand for the reduction of what I regard to be a nominal charge, £5, in its proper perspective.  It is five times cheaper than what my predecessor proposed.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe, with respect, is genuinely confused because during the course of the Second Stage debate he mentioned the £2 fee payable under the 1967 Act.  On 22 February 1978, in reply to him, I said he was mistaken with regard to the nature of the £2 payable under the 1967 Act.  I told him that every tenant who had looked into the question of purchasing his fee simple under the 1967 Act and every legal practitioner in the State knew that under that Act the £2 arbitration fee was only a minute proportion of the total legal cost that a tenant must bear.  Under that Act the tenant is also liable for his own as well as the landlord's legal costs and it would be more reasonable to compare the £5 fee which is the maximum fee in this case with a figure of not less than £100.  That still holds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied that the great majority of those who will be availing themselves of this scheme will <Col N="1551" /> be glad to do so particularly if they know, as many of them who have been involved in this ground rent issue for many years know, that what they are now getting for £5 they probably would not get for £100 or £200 if this £5 scheme which I am introducing was not there.  I am perfectly satisfied that it is a nominal fee.  I have given my reasons for it before lunch, and the Deputies representing the two Opposition parties will agree that £5 is a nominal fee, and no more for the amount of work being done and, of course, having due regard to the cost that would be incurred if the scheme were not there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one last point.  If £5 was the amount to be paid by the majority of householders it is something that I would be happy with, but I do not think I am getting through to the Minister&mdash;and I am not making a political point.  The only person who can get away with the £5 fee is a person who can get in under section 20.  In order to get in under section 20 he would have to get the consent of every superior interest, every mortgagee of such superior interests.  Otherwise he cannot avail of that section.  This is why, in pressing the Minister on the fees, I was stressing most strongly the arbitration fee as opposed to the section 20 fee, which is the £5 fee.  It was on that basis that I was pushing the Minister about the cost of arbitration.  I accept that it is fixed at £12.  I suggest, however, that most people who would have to go to arbitration would have to get help in so doing.  A county registrar has confirmed for me that the figure for arbitration at the moment is £2.  I cannot push it any further.  The Minister, in talking about the £5 fee, is not clear as to the limitations on the people who can benefit from that particular section.  I cannot put it any farther.</P>

      <P>In page 13, lines 1 to 7, to delete subsections (2) and (3).</P>
      <P>I should like some information from the Minister on subsections (2) and (3).  My view, and I am sure it is the view of Deputy Mrs. Desmond, is that certain fees are fixed under the Act and these subsections refer to the fixing of further fees.  Before we can argue it properly, I must say that we were under the impression that if you pay the fees as specified in the first subsection no further fees will be payable to the Land Registry.  So that we take the view that there is no need for an enabling subsection to permit of any further fees.  So, before going further, I, and I am sure Deputy Mrs. Desmond, would want to know what fees the Minister has in mind which he could charge under these two subsections.</P>

      <P>Two points arise here.  May we take it that no further fees other than those in subsection (1) will be chargeable to owner occupiers? Before the Minister gives too ready an assurance on that, I will raise a practical point.  When one deals with the Land Registry one deals on the basis of a folio number which relates to a map.  Question: who produces the map; who pays for the map?  Does the Land Registry itself arrange for it? Has the householder to produce it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy not agree that maps are for the purpose of registration of title?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I know of no title registered in the Land Registry which is not related to a map because the whole Land Registry system is on the basis of a person being the registered owner of a certain folio and he gets a number on his folio and that <Col N="1553" /> folio is related to a map.  The easiest way to look at it is to look at an application for first registration.  The Land Registry under the present system cannot consider the application until such time as they have a map.  Nowadays they insist on having an original ordnance survey map showing the boundaries of the property, the cost of which has increased by 100 per cent in the last month.  One can get an ordnance survey map from the Ordnance Survey Office at the new price of £4 but it has to be marked by an engineer, and the marking can cost £25 to get it properly surveyed and measured, and that portion of the survey map is then submitted to the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>I pose the question: does the Minister intend that the Land Registry will deal with this system on the basis that there will not be a map registered there?  If it is not the intention to depart from the existing situation who is going to pay the approximately £30 involved in producing the ordnance survey map plus the marking by the engineer?  That is a basic practical point, and perhaps the Minister might deal with that first.  I raise that practical point on the question of other fees and other costs.  I do not want to go back into the confusion that was there between fees paid to the Land Registry and costs.  I would point out that this is an expense and I want to know who will bear it.</P>
      <P>There are other aspects.  Normally, the Land Registry would seek documents provided by way of sworn affidavit.  It is a question of drawing these up and fees being paid to Commissioners for Oaths.  I am sure I could think of others.  I would be interested in relation to the owner occupier in knowing what the Minister proposes in relation to the map problem I have raised and, in relation to non-owner occupiers, what other scale of fees he has in mind in respect of people purchasing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Keeffe has said, this is purely a drafting amendment.  The subsection is intended to regulate the provisions of the 1967 Act in relation to costs of arbitration and in effect to ensure that these provisions would not apply where the alternative provisions of section 23 of the Bill applied.  It does this by saying that the 1967 Act provision would have effect, subject to the section.  This wording may have led to some confusion and it would be better to frame the provision in a more direct way. The redraft does this, providing that the 1967 Act cost provisions will not apply to cases of owner-occupied dwellings, that is, cases which would attract the £5 and £12 fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 40 and 41, subsection (2) enables the Minister to make a fee order fixing the fees to be taken, other than the £5 and £12 fees.  This provision is necessary because the fees fixed in the Bill itself apply only in the case of owner-occupied dwellings.  If the <Col N="1555" /> property consists of dwellings but the properties are for example, a company engaged in the business of giving occupational tenancies and are not themselves in occupation, the fixed fees will not apply.  The State will not come to the tenant's financial assistance where he is in reality a landlord. However, he will have the right to acquire the fee simple and to use the procedure.  Of course he may opt to use ordinary conveyancing procedures instead, but there could be cases in which the Part III procedures would offer considerable advantages to such a tenant.  The fees to be charged in these cases will be fixed by way of a fees order and will as far as possible, because of the provisions of subsection (3), meet the costs of the service.</P>
    <P>A new fees order would also be necessary to provide for fees to be charged for inspection of the register of vesting certificates which it is proposed should be kept.  The 1967 Act register regulations provide for such fees to be charged in relation to the registers of arbitration awards.  This is adequate for arbitration awards under the Bill, but a new order will be necessary to cater for the fees for inspecting registers of vesting certificates and for copies of entries.  Again it must be emphasised that there is no question of the fixed fees of £5 and £12 being affected by the fees order.  The provisions of section 23 have been drafted to make this absolutely clear, and subsection (1) excludes these fees from the scope of any fees order.</P>
    <P>If subsection (6) were to be deleted Part III of the scheme would then be incomplete.  In accordance with section 21 (3) of the Bill, the provisions of the 1967 Act apply specifically to an arbitration under Part III, and the proposals in Part III simply vary or supplement those provisions so far as necessary for the purposes of the new Part III scheme.  What subsection (6) proposes as a clarifying provision is that section 9 of the 1967 Act, dealing with the purchaser's liability for vendor's costs including a vendor's arbitration cost, and section 19 of the <Col N="1556" /> same Act, dealing with arbitration costs themselves, will apply to a purchaser under Part III of the Bill save to the extent that Part III proposes otherwise.  The liability of a purchaser under section 9 of the 1967 Act is effectively removed in the case of a Part III purchaser by removal of the requirement to serve notice under section 4 of that Act with which section 9 liability is linked.  However, section 19 of the same Act is not affected by the proposals in Part III. Section 19 of the 1967 Act puts a party to an arbitration who behaves unreasonably at risk of being ordered to pay costs of the arbitration, including the costs of the other parties.</P>
    <P>Section 23 (5) of the Bill deals specifically with the cost of arbitration in the case of owner-occupied dwellings. Its effect is to ensure that where the tenant has behaved reasonably he will be liable for only the £12 arbitration fee.  Subsection (6), which imports the provisions of section 19 of the 1967 Act, is needed for cases outside this section, that is, where the dwelling is not owner-occupied.  It has substantially the same effect as subsection (5) in that it puts a party who has been unreasonable at risk of the costs of arbitration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy O'Keeffe in relation to the provision of maps and the making of them, if the arbitrator wants a map and has to have a map marked he will have to bear the cost of that himself; the applicant will not have to bear that cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that there is no need for a map.  The application is for a vesting certificate and the vesting certificate can be given without a map as described by the Deputy, which is necessary for Land Registry purposes for the registration of title.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister given any thought to what will be on the vesting certificate?  Normally one gets a land certificate from the Land Registry, and a folio number on that certificate refers to a map which is registered in the master map in the Land Registry.  The boundaries of the property in question can be ascertained by obtaining a copy of that map.  I understood, when the matter was being transferred, as it were, from the jurisdiction of the county registrar to the Land Registry, that the title which the householder would get would be a registered title which anybody having property registered in the Land Registry would be entitled to get, but to do so a map would be necessary.  If a map is not necessary the tenant will not be getting a registered title but will be getting a vesting certificate which will <Col N="1558" /> give no indication of the boundaries of the property.  I can see considerable practical difficulties if this is what the Minister has in mind.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, but the register of vesting certificates will be kept.  Has the Minister examined closely the mapping situation in the Land Registry?  Very skilled people in the Land Registry are coming in under the Registration of Title Acts, and considerable difficulties are arising.  Up to now it was possible to have one's title registered on a six-inch scale map. The Land Registry recently had reason to bring in a change in the regulations whereby one can get oneself registered now in the Land Registry only on a 25-inch scale Ordnance Survey map.  The Land Registry found that it was not satisfactory to work on the six-inch scale map and they now have a 25-inch scale.  Boundaries were completely incorrect on the six-inch scale.  This meant that, for instance with big properties in Dublin, on the six-inch scale map great problems arose regarding boundary walls.  There were problems also regarding people building on other people's properties.  Let us take the matter a stage further.  The 25-inch map must be marked, certified and signed either by a fully qualified engineer or architect if it is to be accepted by the Land Registry.  It is important to point out those pitfalls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely pointing out the difficulties that can arise, even with the best will in the world, in relation to the Land Registry.  As a result of this Bill the register of vesting certificates will state that the <Col N="1559" /> persons concerned have fee simple, that they have obtained vesting certificates but what means will the Registrar of Titles have of ascertaining where are the boundaries of the properties concerned and of ensuring that the maps are kept in a proper manner?  So far as I can see the situation will be that there will be no way of verifying whether vesting certificates are correct.  The Minister may be trying to keep the process as reasonable as possible in terms of cost but it is important to ensure that the scheme works properly.  What will happen is that if a tenant has not a proper map of his property there may be serious and grave difficulties later when his property is being sold. Therefore, it is important that there be proper maps identifying property of sale.  The Registrar of Titles, being a man of experience in this area, will surely request that properly certified maps be produced.  Otherwise he would be issuing vesting certificates that would be useless.</P>
      <P>In regard to the vesting of a county council house the tenant receives first a vesting certificate which resembles closely the type of document we are speaking of here.  But that vesting certificate has already been part of a scheme that was mapped out properly, the original key map having been placed in the Land Registry.  The certificate that the tenant receives is only the forerunner to the land certificate. In regard to this legislation there are grave dangers involved.  Let us take an area of many houses in this city.  The tenants involved would not have proper maps of their property although they might have tenancies going back for many years.  Such people would find on going to the Land Registry that their leases were not proper.  There may have been subleases involved, for instance.  If the registrar were to issue a vesting certificate in such circumstances the consequences could be serious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): There is a substantial point involved in respect of the cost that an applicant may be asked to bear.  Paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section <Col N="1560" /> (1) of section 23, is clear. Paragraph (a) provides for the issuing of a vesting certificate under section 22 on payment of £5.  There may or may not be arbitration but if there is paragraph (b) provides that the fee in arbitration shall be £12.  Regarding paragraph (a), if I understand the matter correctly, a vesting certificate is the same as a deed of transfer signed by the vendor to the purchaser and is not a valid document of title until it is registered.  There are only two places in which it could be registered, either in the Land Registry where it would be registered on a folio for anybody to see, or in the Registry of Deeds.  However, from the language used here I do not think it is visualised that it would be registered in the Registry of Deeds and if it is not registered in either place it does not confer an absolute title on the applicant because if the man who owned the property were dishonest enough to sell it again to a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without notice, the purchaser would take a good title unless the vesting certificate were registered.  The Minister has said that the fees provided for in both paragraphs (a) and (b) are the fees only for the vesting certificate and for arbitration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Yes, but I have to make that case before coming to subsections (2) and (3).  Subsection (2) provides that the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, shall make a fee order providing for fees in respect of other parts of the Act with the exception of subsection (1) of section 23.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) of this section which is proposed to be deleted provides that these fees shall pay their way.  It <Col N="1561" /> means that they will be as near as possible to being economic.  It is obvious that there are other steps to be taken after the steps envisaged in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) of section 23.  If that is so, and I hope it is, they will be taken at full cost to the applicant.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to go back in order to make the argument that must be made against subsection (2) and (3). We have to go back only as far as section 22.  Section 22 (1) (a) provides that an application may be made to the Registrar of Titles under section 20 and that the registrar as arbitrator shall do certain things.  Under subsection (2) before issuing a vesting certificate he shall do other things, and under subsection (3) the vesting certificate shall be deemed to be a conveyance on sale for the purposes of sections 24 and 25 of the Registration of Titles Act, 1964, and shall be deemed to be an instrument in the prescribed form for the purposes of section 51 of that Act.  That, I admit, is a conveyance of one description or another.  Subsection 22 (4) says</P>
    <P>In a case to which subsection (3) relates, the Registrar shall, on being supplied with any further documents which he may require, provide for registration of the title under the Registration of Title Act, 1964</P>
    <P>That is the kernel of the matter.  The vesting certificate is the equivalent of a transfer.  Subsection (4) provides that if he is required to do so and given the necessary documents, the registrar can register it and it will then be a valid document of title of which the world and his wife will be able to get notice in the Land Registry and by which he will be bound whether he avails of the opportunity to get notice or not.  That brings us back to subsections (2) and (3) because he may not want to copy folios and he will have to pay for that.  As Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Enright have argued, in many cases he will want a map because the registration of unidentified property in the Land Registry is worthless.  The only way you can identify property which you want to register and put people on notice about <Col N="1562" /> is by providing a map.  We will not talk about the delays in getting maps in the Land Registry because we could write a book about that and lawyers get blamed for all those delays.</P>
    <P>One can come across a case where a property is part of a folio and one wants to apply for first registration. If it is part of a folio one will have to get a map and have it marked by an engineer.  When I was practising law five years ago the normal fee for marking such a map was seven guineas.  I understand that that has now rocketed to 25 or 30 guineas.  Somebody will have to pay for the registration of that document.  If land has never been registered and is held under a queer Act, such as the Church Temporalities Acts, and a man wants to register it for the first time, the Registrar of Titles will not talk to him unless he has a map.  He can only get land registered if he says: &ldquo;Here is the area of land in County Monaghan I want to register.  I want you to map it and I want to put it there, so that everybody will be on notice of it.&rdquo;  Section 22 (4) says that there is an obligation on the Registrar of Titles to do that only if he gets the documents he requires.  The subsections we are seeking to delete in this amnedment say that a man can get those documents at his own expense. I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>

      <P>Firstly, tenants need not produce maps when making application for their vesting certificates; they need only produce title documents.  There is no need for a map, marked or unmarked, for the application for a vesting certificate or for admission to the register of vesting certificates.  That position existed under the 1967 Act and it is the position under this Bill.  I want to refer briefly to what Deputy Enright said earlier when he advised that there was a definite likelihood of confusion.  We have discussed this with the Law Society and the Land Registry and they do not share his views.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said that the vesting certificate would not be a valid document of title&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have learned something in the last half hour.  I assumed that when the matter was being dealt with in the Land Registry the title the householder would get would be an absolute registered title guaranteed by the State.  I now find that it is proposed to give the householder not such an absolute title.  In some ways it could be called a cheap title, because from what I can gather from the Minister, the householder will get what amounts to an unregistered conveyance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody involved with the transfer of property knows that an unregistered conveyance is totally unacceptable if a person wants to dispose of his property.  There is also the question of the priority of interests, the <Col N="1564" /> protection of that title.  I am appalled to find that this is the situation, that in effect what the householder is getting for the fees mentioned in this section is not an absolute registered title.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider seriously what we are giving the householders under such a Bill. I thought that at the very least he was getting an absolute registered title.  He is not.  It was in that context that I raised the cost of the mapping. I am seriously disturbed by the Minister's explanations.  I feel he should, and I urge him to rethink his position here to ensure that the title the householder will get will be an absolute registered title.  If this does not happen the document he gets will not be of any use in the event of a sale unless further steps are taken to register it in the Land Registry or in the Registry of Deeds.</P>
    <P>I assumed that the householder would get an absolute registered title and that on selling his house, he would be able to take advantage of the reduced costs applicable in having a registered absolute title.  We have now a situation that not alone does he not have an absolute registered title but on selling his property his costs will be much greater because the purchaser will have to plough through deeds as opposed to merely taking a registered title.  I am taken by surprise with what the Minister is proposing.  I would urge him to revise his thinking on this aspect to ensure that the title the householder gets from the Land Registry for the fee stated here is an absolute registered title.  In the past I urged that people should take advantage of this measure, but I am afraid they will not get such a great bargain after all.  The householder will get something that is not a saleable title.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My clear understanding was that the householder was getting an absolute registered title and I note that Deputy O'Keeffe with his expertise in this area was of a similar opinion.  The many tenants waiting to purchase their ground rents were certain that this was what they were getting, and they will be very disappointed when they find out the facts. In their interests I would ask the <Col N="1565" /> Minister to reconsider the matter.  The Minister has said that the tenants will be advised in their interests to register, but this is a very poor substitute for what they thought they were getting. The fees set out in subsection (1) (a) and (b) are meaningless if there will be additional expenses on the tenants. The debate on this matter has been worthwhile because it has revealed the true situation.  The Minister may say it was set out in black and white all the time, but it was our understanding that the tenants were getting a registered title.  They will be very disappointed.</P>

      <P>There are several points that need to be raised.  If it is not compulsory to have the vesting certificates registered in the Land Registry or in the Registry of Deeds, it means that the person who buys the property later will have the additional cost of making further searches.  I presume there will be a register of vesting certificates.  When a person is buying a dwelling house a number of searches are made.  There is a search made in the bankruptcy office to see if the vendor was ever declared a bankrupt. There is also a search made in the office of the county registrar to see if there are any orders with the sheriff against the person, and there are also judgment searches.  In addition, a further search must now be made in the register of vesting certificates, and this will impose an additional burden on all those who have not absolute title.  It will affect not only people involved with ground rents but also those who have not the fee simple or absolute title.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on the Minister to ensure that when a person obtains a vesting certificate he should be obliged to register with an absolute title.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with Land Registry fees.  A person obtains a vesting certificate from the registrar of titles without maps or documents, and that is not satisfactory.  We are all concerned with keeping down the costs to the parties concerned, but if the people concerned do not get title documents with maps identifying the property involved this will not be of benefit to them.  It is incumbent on us to ensure that the person concerned obtains full and absolute title.  To have absolute title one must have the property properly registered either in the Land Registry or in the Registry of Deeds.  If it is registered in the Register of Deeds the person must have a map on his conveyance.  If it is registered in the Land Registry the person must obtain an absolute title. You can have a possessory title or an absolute title, but in this instance if a person has a lease on a Land Registry title, he obtains a vesting certificate on which there is no map of the property. It is a highly unsatisfactory situation which will need to be looked at seriously before Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): We are dealing with the buying out of ground rents, the purchase of small pieces of land, usually subject to small ground rents, with valuable buildings on that bit of land of which £20,000 might be a common valuation.  We are leading those lessees to believe that they will get this done usually for £5 and that if they get into trouble and go to arbitration it can be done for £17.  What we are giving them for that is an unregistered conveyance. Even if the title has been found by the Registrar of Titles, that <Col N="1567" /> householder will get a vesting certificate that is not a protection to him unless he registers it.  It will not protect him, to use technical language, from a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without consideration, and he will be put to the cost of registering that at a price economical to the Registrar of Titles.</P>
      <P>I became perturbed at the superficial approach to this question of arbitration which emerged from the Minister's last reply.  I do not blame the Minister because he is not a lawyer and he is dealing with technical terms. It is a dwelling that is being bought out, in effect, and there is a definition of dwelling in Part II: &ldquo;A dwelling is a dwelling on land where the land is ancillary to the dwelling&rdquo;.  The Minister told me a map would not be necessary even in arbitration.  If there is to be arbitration on the purchase of a group rent it means that there has been a dispute, very often as to whether the entire garden goes with the house, or how much land there is with the house, if the original title is not clear.  I should like the Minister to tell me, if there is a dispute about the area of land held with the house, how any arbitrator could make a meaningful award without a map defining the land which goes with the house.  I am speaking about a situation in which there is a dispute between the vendor and the purchaser of the land.</P>

      <P>This brings us to a serious and important point.  This Bill provides that the vesting certificate in the conveyance is deemed to be a conveyance within the provisions of sections 24 and 25 of the Registration of Title Act, 1964 and to be an instrument in the prescribed form for the purpose of that Act.  We discover the <Col N="1568" /> type of title the householder is to get when we investigate what the vesting certificate is deemed to be.</P>
      <P>The relevant section of the 1964 Act states that in any case in which registration becomes compulsory a person shall not under any conveyance on sale acquire the estate or interest purported to be conveyed unless within six months after such conveyance he is registered as owner of such freehold land.  The effect of that is that the vesting certificate the Minister is offering is worthless without registration.  Section 51 of the 1964 Act provides that there shall be executed on the transfer an instrument in the prescribed form, but until the transferee is registered as owner of the land transferred, that instrument shall not operate to transfer the land.  I am coming to the conclusion that what the householder is getting under this Bill, if I interpret the Minister properly, is virtually a useless title.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe is inclined to run away with himself. He has now discovered something for the first time.  That is his privilege, but if any person had read the Bill properly he would have seen its purpose. I should like to tell him and his colleagues in Fine Gael and Labour to go back to the Second Stage debate on the Bill which he and his colleagues have gone to great trouble to remind me of and about which they said there is no difference whatsoever from this Bill.  If they had looked at section 73 (4) of the lapsed Bill they would clearly understand why I say there is a certain amount of political blood rushing to their political <Col N="1569" /> heads.  The indignation now being expressed I am taking with a grain of salt.  If those Deputies have not got copies of the lapsed Bill I will be glad to let them have it and they will find what I am talking about in black and white in section 73 (4).  It was brought in by the Deputies opposite when they were in Government.  What is the purpose of the Bill before us now?  It is to allow tenants to buy out their ground rents for a total legal cost of £5.  If this Bill were not there it could happen that what they are now getting for £5 would cost them up to £200 in legal fees.</P>

      <P>I am not.  I am more on the point than perhaps the Deputy and some of his colleagues were for the last half hour.  That is the purpose of my Bill.  I never said at any stage that there would be compulsory registration of title.  I said that the purpose of the Bill was to bring about a situation leading to the abolition of ground rents and that is what I am doing.  I do not accept what Deputy Enright says about there being compulsory registration.  I do not go along with the compulsory aspect of it but I would welcome people going along and doing it.  If people want to register their titles afterwards they are quite welcome to do so.  I will do everything I can to encourage them to do that but I will not compel them to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that in getting the vesting certificates prepared a certain amount of the work of registration of title will be undertaken.  There is room for help and at a later stage I hope to financially help people to register their titles.  I would like to point out to the Deputy that what is in this Bill should come as no surprise to him, particularly as it was in the previous Bill, and also that the purpose of my Bill is to provide a scheme leading to the abolition of ground rents and people can for £5 buy their vesting certificates. <Col N="1570" /> I do not want to keep repeating myself but it would be desirable that they would go the final step but that was never promised by me.

This is a most important point.  The Minister referred to section 73 (4) of the Coalition Bill.  I refer him to subsection (5) which states:</P>
      <P>In a case to which subsection (4) relates the arbitrator shall send the vesting certificate and other necessary documents to the registering authority under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, for the purposes of compliance with the provisions of that Act.</P>

      <P>The vesting certificate is a worthless document unless it is registered.  I am not making any political point about it.  It is worthless in the context of stopping the operation. It is of value if it is registered.  In the case of parts of the country where compulsory registration applies unless the document is registered within six months, it has no effect at all.  The tenant in those areas thought he was going to get a proper title for his £5. Where he got the consent of all the superior interests and was able to take advantage of section 20, he assumed he would get a proper title, but it is now quite clear he will not because the vesting certificate is worthless unless he registers it in the Land Registry and there will be considerable expense involved in doing this.  In other areas it is of considerably reduced value unless he registers it in the Registry of Deeds.</P>
      <P>I will be coming back to this point on Report Stage because I find it is very alarming.  I was misled on this.  I am not saying I was misled by the Minister.  When I saw this matter was being dealt with in the Land Registry I assumed that the householder would get a Land Registry absolute title.  It is now clear that this is not so.  I am quite certain that virtually every ground rent householder in the country has been misled by this particular provision. We will be coming back to this on Report Stage.</P>

We are talking about the fees which will be fixed in the Land Registry by order of the Minister for Justice with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  We are following this through.  It specifies section 24 and 25, which deal with compulsory registration.  Subsection (3) of section 22 states:</P>

      <P>That 1964 Act states that it must be registered within six months or else it lapses.  If it lapses after six months where will a person find himself after paying over the money?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the Minister follows this through the people who must pay £17 will not get value for their money.  The certificate must be registered in the Land Registry.  The Minister spoke of compulsory registration <Col N="1573" /> for the tenant.  However, it is not compulsory registration for the tenant, it is necessary registration.  It is necessary that one registers in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds to become the full registered owner with an absolute fee simple title.  That is not being done.  That is why I say it appears to be a fraud on the people who must pay over their money.  The situation is unsatisfactory and will lead to a lot of trouble.</P>
      <P>The Minister would be wise to avoid trouble with organisations who have been pressing for legislation in connection with the abolition of ground rents.  Unless he alters this Bill the scheme will be worthless and will only add to the existing difficulties.  I want to ensure that when a person pays over money he or she obtains a vesting certificate which is followed through in the Land Registry so that the person becomes the full registered owner.  If that does not happen those people will be getting an unsatisfactory title.  The Minister should insert a section whereby necessary registration occurs.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): If I was satisfied that the Minister understood the effect of leaving subsections (2) and (3) stand I would be satisfied, but I am not sure he does.  I believe he realises that he has been beaten on the legal argument, on which he could not be expected to be an expert.  However he has now changed the whip and wants to come out with the political argument, on which he is an expert.  Since Senator Cooney introduced a similar Bill in this House we had the denunciation by the Minister's party of that Bill.  We had the historic document which Deputy Leyden refers to as the manifesto and this Bill with its explanatory memorandum. The Minister is now arguing that he never intended giving a fee simple to the applicants but the first three paragraphs of the memorandum state that the applicant is to get the fee simple for £5 or £12.</P>
      <P>Any law student knows that the fee simple is full and absolute ownership. The Minister cannot be expected to be technically knowledgeable, but he has revealed several times that this Bill does not enforce compulsory registration.  He is misleading the uninitiated in this House by that statement because compulsory registration only applies to unregistered land in scheduled counties, County Kildare being one.  If the land in those scheduled counties is registered, then in order to convey a fee simple ownership it must be registered in the Land Registry.  But if it is unregistered land, of which the Minister appears to be making some virtue, it must be registered in the Registry of Deeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister conceding that for the £5 registration fee the applicant anxious to purchase his ground rent will get a vesting certificate which is the equivalent of a transfer or conveyance? <Col N="1575" /> Indeed, if it is registered land, Deputy O'Keeffe through research has discovered, the certificate is valueless and it will be null and void and not worth the paper it is written on after six months if it is not registered in the Land Registry. That is spelled out in the sections of the 1964 Act referred to in this Bill. It will be void, become defunct, extinct, no use and the poor man will have to start all over again.  He is being misled.  He is being tricked.  He certainly is being misled because if the innocent person I was talking about, let us say, comes up from County Limerick and finds his way into the Land Registry, gets his business done and is given a vesting certificate, he will be forgiven if he goes home and puts that in the bank and gets a safe custody receipt for it and thinks that they are his deeds.  If he does that without a solicitor&mdash;and he is being encouraged not do go to a solicitor&mdash;after six months that certificate will have spent itself, it will be no use.  He will have given his money and the ground landlord will still own the thing.  If it is land that is to be registered in the Registry of Deeds in Henrietta Street, unless he finds his way up there, gets a memorial on some sort of special paper and goes through the whole rigmarole and registers it there, he will not be protected.  He will want a map in either case.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is conceding that all he is doing here&mdash;and this is it&mdash;if he admits here that all he is really doing is fixing the price of the ground rent and if there is a dispute about it he will arbitrate on that but that in order to perfect his title and put himself in an unassailable position against <i>bonafide</i><Col N="1576" /> purchasers for value without notice the person concerned will have to spend an unspecified sum to get it done, then we would know where we stood and the people who accept this ingredient of an historic document will know where they stand and will be able to judge the Minister and act accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not having the doubtful benefit of being a legal man, I have listened to the professional men here.  We were led to believe by the Minister that under a previous Bill there was no fixed fee for purchase of ground rent and that in this Bill there was a fee of £5 and in the case of a search an extra £12.  We understood and every layman understood and possibly the Minister who is a layman, not a legal man, understood, that a person could buy out his ground rent by paying a £5 fee.  Is it admitted now that if I buy out the ground rent and pay the £5 legal fee I can discover after six months, that unless I register, this document is completely worthless and that there is no fixed legal fee for what it will cost me to register it?  Is that the position?</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Dental Health Services: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy O'Connell on Tuesday, 25 April 1978:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, noting the present inadequacy of our dental health services, calls on the Minister for Health and Social Welfare to introduce as a matter of urgency, a new improved service that will (a) provide immediate free dental care for all school children (b) eliminate the present abnormally long waiting lists for treatment (c) introduce a choice of dentist scheme for medical card holders; and for this purpose to undertake a massive recruitment drive of dental surgeons, as well as initiating a programme for the training and utilisation of dental auxiliaries in a national dental service.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1579" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;accepts that it is the intention of the Minister for Health to undertake a comprehensive review of the public dental services and to embark on a programme to remedy such deficiencies as that review may bring to light, and is satisfied that the Minister will implement necessary improvements as soon as circumstances permit&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was talking about the need to have dental auxiliaries introduced into the entire dental field.  Apart from the other purposes for which auxiliaries could be used as outlined by Deputy O'Connell, they could also be used in a massive programme of education in the areas of oral hygiene, diet control and other preventive measures in the schools. The national school dental system and the entire system of dealing with the dental health of young people could be improved by the introduction of an educational programme and by the use of trained auxiliaries to implement such a programme.</P>
      <P>The situation in regard to staffing structures and career possibilities for dentists in the public service is very poor.  These are virtually non-existent in some circumstances.  There are only two positions in the health boards, those of senior dental surgeon and dental surgeon.  Consequently, young dentists are not attracted to the public service.  Since 1973 there has been no position in the Department of Health of senior dental adviser.  Although interviews have been held in regard to this appointment I am disappointed that there has been no announcement so far.  Hopefully, the Minister will be able to tell us this evening that the position has been filled at last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In contrast to the career structure which consists merely of a senior dental surgeon and a local dental <Col N="1580" /> surgeon, the dentists' association recommended some time ago that there be set up a structure whereby there would be a chief dental surgeon with consultant status, a deputy chief dental surgeon, a senior dental surgeon, a deputy senior dental surgeon, a district dental surgeon and a deputy district dental surgeon.  In other words the association suggested that there be six levels and six promotional grades, thereby allowing for a proper grading structure and an adequate number of staff.  There has been no indication from the Minister of any change in the immediate future in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is much disquiet, too, at the situation whereby the job specification of the senior dental surgeons has not been outlined or specified.  That is a poor situation considering the health boards have been in existence since 1970.  I understand that in Dublin and Cork there are two positions of chief dental surgeon but that this situation does not apply to the rest of the country.  The fear is that it is the intention of the Department to phase out those two positions on the retirement of the occupants.  I should have thought that rather than phasing out, there should be talk of introducing the other four grades that the association have asked for.</P>
    <P>In a submission made to me the complaint was that the recommendations of the profession are almost always ignored by the Department, and the suggestion was that the consistent failure and resistance of the Department concerning advice in relation to recruitment, to the provision of dental auxiliaries, to specialist and consultant services in orthodontic and oral surgery and to a proper staffing and administrative structure for a national dental service has left the dental profession disillusioned and angry.  That is fair comment.  I do not think anybody could blame the profession for that.</P>
    <P>There is a need on our part to accept that dentistry is a specialist medical field, that it is not a para-medical field, which is how it has been treated up to now by the Department and the health boards.  One of my suggestions is that a dentist be appointed to the Health Education Bureau.  I suggest <Col N="1581" /> also that there be a dental representative on Comhairle na nOspidéal who would be involved directly in ensuring that there was adequate staffing in the county hospitals.</P>
    <P>To sum up, then, there is a need for a radical shake-up in the national school field, a need to include children attending post-primary schools, a need to introduce a scheme on a fee-per-item basis similar to the social welfare scheme for medical card holders, a need to extend the social welfare scheme to include dependants, a need to replace the 1928 Act, a need for planning at this stage to provide for the physical training and the provision of sufficient staff for the training of auxilaries, a need to revise the career structure in the public service, a need to clear up the confusion on whether to meet the statutory requirements that are not being met now and a need to clear up the confusion on whether there is to be a new dental hospital in the St. James's complex and whether it is to serve the dual purpose of teaching and training.  There is a need, too, to emphasise preventive medicine and to appoint a dental representative both to the Health Education Bureau and to Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>
    <P>What there is not need for is a review body such as is referred to in the Minister's amendment, because if Deputy O'Connell and I and perhaps others can come here and outline clearly and simply the needs in the dentistry field, needs that are recognised widely, the last thing that is required is a review body.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by acknowledging that there are many aspects of our public dental services which do not achieve the level of provision that we would all desire.  The service is still at a growth and development stage.  It does not provide, nor has it ever provided, on a readily available basis the full range of treatment procedures required by eligible persons.</P>
      <P>All previous administrations have accepted that fact.  However, compared with the position as it was ten years ago, the service today provides a much greater range of treatment and examination per year both in relation to children and adults and it places a much greater emphasis on fillings and other conservation procedures.  The proportion of fillings to extractions is increasing.  This is a good indication of improving standards in the service. It might be no harm to remind the House that in 1965 there were 88 whole-time dentists in the public dental service while in February this year, the number was 194.  If we take into account the additional sessions worked by these officers and also the service provided by private practitioners, the service is now operating on what is estimated to be a whole-time equivalent of 222 dentists.  That figure was mentioned by Deputy O'Connell.</P>
      <P>In association with that considerable increase in the number of dentists employed in the public dental service, funds have been made available to improve the standard of clinical facilities available to health board dentists. This improvement has received a ready acknowledgment among the profession, and any proposal for further improvement is considered sympathetically by me in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the improvement is significant it is not enough to provide 100 per cent cover for all eligible persons. In this situation we must operate on a system of priorities, and that, too, has been accepted by all previous administrations. Indeed, it has been <Col N="1583" /> accepted also by the practising profession.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking the current system gives priority to children, to expectant mothers, to persons suffering from TB and to certain handicapped persons. The system allows scarce resources to be allocated to those areas of greatest need and in which the greatest benefit can accrue.  Regrettably, though, it entails an element of sacrifice on the part of some older age groups, but at least there is consolation in the fact that children and the most needy benefit.</P>
    <P>The case for developing the dental services is obvious and is accepted by all.  This Government have clearly indicated already their intention to divert resources towards the improvement of the service.  However, that is not an objective that can be achieved in large measure overnight.  I want to make it clear to the House that there are many problems involved.  It would be superficial to dismiss these problems.  It is important that the House and the public know what the problems are. Only then will there be full appreciation of what is being done and what can be done reasonably quickly to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to our public dental officers, that very dedicated group of men and women who are working against considerable odds but despite which, down through the years, they have provided consistently a first-class service.  The current demand for improved dental services is the greatest tribute that can be paid to them.  That demand comes largely from people who as youngsters obtained a good standard of treatment from these public dental officers and who learned to appreciate the need for good dental hygiene both for themselves and for their children.</P>
    <P>The curious thing is that most dental diseases are a product of our civilised way of life, a direct result of our dietary patterns.  In short we eat too much sugar and the price we pay for this self-indulgence is dental disease, a painful and debilitating condition as we all know all too well.  It gives rise to much misery and suffering.  Any health service worthy of the name must <Col N="1584" /> regard it as a major health problem. I would emphasise that it is this Government's intention, and my intention to treat it as such.</P>
    <P>Conservation measures alone will not eliminate dental disease.  All the authorities agree on that.  There must be a very strong emphasis on preventive techniques to reduce the treatment case load.  This is a point I wish to stress very strongly.  It is fundamental to any organised assault upon dental disease on a national basis.  The treatment case load must be reduced by positive preventive measures.</P>
    <P>The two main branches of dental disease are dental caries, which attack the teeth proper, and periodontal disease which attacks the supporting tissues.  Happily the two branches are responsive to some extent to preventive measures.  Fluoridation of piped water supplies is the most effective agent yet discovered for reducing the incidence of dental caries.  We are fortunate in Ireland that fluoridation of piped water supplies commenced in 1964.  At present supplies serving about 57 per cent of our population are equipped for the process.  There were some problems with the service in recent years largely arising from the fact that home produced supplies of fluoride virtually dried up.  Supplies are available again on a regular basis and every effort is being made to have all plants, even the smallest, restored to full operational efficiency.  In Dublin, for instance, the incidence of caries among four year olds has been shown to be 65 per cent less than it was prior to the introduction of fluoridation.</P>
    <P>I might mention that in this field also we keep a constant watch on the possibilities of other preventive procedures emerging.  The most promising of these in recent times is xylitol, a form of sugar substitute which is claimed to be caries inhibiting.  While xylitol appears to have some promise, I am advised it is not certain that it will eventually emerge as a viable public health measure.  Nevertheless, we will keep in touch with the developments on this and other procedures to ensure that every advantage is taken as soon as possible of any new preventive procedures emerging.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> The other main preventive field lies in the control of plaque and this is largely a question of correct and constant personal hygiene.  What is needed is effective instruction in personal dental hygiene aided by regular treatment. The public dental service does a great deal of work in this field and is anxious to extend the range of its activities by using auxiliaries.  We must also acknowledge the contribution of the Irish Dental Association and the Health Education Bureau in awakening public awareness of the need for good dental hygiene.  Deputies are aware that the budget of the Health Education Bureau has been very considerably increased this year to enable it to extend all its activities, including education in dental hygiene and preventive techniques.</P>
    <P>However, no matter how well we deploy our preventive resources we will still have to cope with a very large treatment requirement.  It is in the deployment of manpower resources to meet this treatment requirement that our real problems arise.  I want to suggest that neither of the two main Opposition speakers has adverted sufficiently to this aspect.  I do not think I would be unfair if I accused them of ignoring it, but it is the key to the central problem.</P>
    <P>We must maintain a balance between the treatment requirements of the private sector and the treatment requirements of the public sector.  The World Health Organisation have suggested an overall provision of one dentist for every 2,000 population.  I do not altogether accept that approach. For our circumstances and our population structure I could be more inclined to accept a ratio of one dentist for every 1,500 children and one dentist for every 2,500 adults. This suggest a national requirement of 1,550 dentists which, as it happens, gives on a national basis a figure very close to that recommended by the World Health Organisation, that is, 1,560.  However, whichever approach is used the figure which emerges is far higher than the total of dentists currently registered to practise dentistry in this country&mdash;that figure stood <Col N="1586" /> at 898 on 31 March 1978 as against 1,560 which is the required number.</P>
    <P>Obviously there is a servere manpower shortage&mdash;something in the order of 600 to 700 dentists for our population as a whole.  This shortage is by no means confined to Ireland. Many other countries are faced with a similar problem.  Our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, estimates that it will be the year 2000 before sufficient dentists are available to meet their requirements, and this despite the fact that operating auxiliaries, who are not fully qualified dentists, are employed there.</P>
    <P>We have two dental schools capable of qualifying about 75 dentists every year.  That should yield sufficient dentists to meet our requirements. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of our graduates elect to emigrate. This is not a situation which can be easily rectified and certainly not where there is virtually a worldwide shortage of dentists.  Furthermore, the Treaty of Rome provides for the free movement of dentists from Ireland to other member states within the European Community.  That is an existing right and directives which are intended to facilitate dentists wishing to exercise that right are at present being finalised in Brussels.  In this context one must remember also that the United Kingdom, which traditionally has taken the bulk of our emigrating graduates, is also a member state of the European Community.  There we have our first major problem.  How are we to deal with this manpower shortage?  Is the answer to increase our output of graduates and accept that a proportion of them will emigrate?  We must remember also that it takes five years to train a dentist.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes suggested that adults should be catered for by the private sector&mdash;something on the lines of the choice of dentist scheme as mentioned in the motion.  At first sight that might seem attractive, but if you examine it carefully you will find that it raises some very serious problems.  Children form the main priority group for dental care.  Everybody agrees on that.  If, however, we ask the private sector to provide dental care for eligible adults, <Col N="1587" /> say on a choice of dentist basis, then inevitably the earning capacity in the private sector will increase.  Consequently, dentists will be drawn away from the public sector.  No matter how you look at it this simply means that more eligible children will be denied dental care.</P>
    <P>No matter what arrangement we may make with private general practitioners, we would still be faced with the problem that sufficient manpower is not available.  Here we must remember that an important objective of the public dental service is to seek out those children most in need of dental care.  Manpower shortage has prevented this objective being achieved to date but we must look forward to the day when it will be possible to achieve it. However it is an objective that can only be achieved through a public dental service.  This is simply because the services of private practitioners would be availed of only by children whose parents were sufficiently interested to seek out the service for their children.  Those children whose parents were not concerned about dental care &mdash;or in some cases who were not fully aware of the need for it&mdash;would simply not be brought forward for treatment. Either approach would mean that in a manpower shortage situation our main priority group, our children, would undoubtedly suffer.</P>
    <P>In this type of situation there are other options which must be taken into account as has already been adverted to in the course of this debate.  First, there is the question of the hygienist. The hygienist undertakes some of the more routine dental procedures such as scaling and polishing of teeth and instruction in dental hygiene techniques. This grade would be welcome by the dental profession.  It is intended to make provision for this grade in an amending Dentists Bill which is now under active consideration.  While hygienists would be a boon to the public dental service I fear that experience in the United Kingdom and other countries indicates that thehygienists themselves prefer to work in the private sector.  However, irrespective of whether their preference is for <Col N="1588" /> public or private sector work, they would help to decrease the workload which now has to be undertaken by too few dentists.</P>
    <P>There is another very important option which must be fully examined and that is the New Zealand type dental nurse.  This nurse is an operating auxiliary who works only in the public sector and who provides what to this day is accepted as a first class dental care service for children.  These nurses undertake a two year training course and care for about 500 children each.  They tend to be based at local level, functioning within the school system.  My information is that they provide a very effective service for children and their role is fully approved by the dental profession in New Zealand.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom considered the introduction of this grade in the 1950s and finally opted for a modified version, called colloquially, the new cross auxiliary.</P>
    <P>The basic difference between the systems in New Zealand and the United Kingdom is that in New Zealand the auxiliary works virtually on her own responsibility whereas in the United Kingdom she works under the direct supervision of a dentist. Faced with our current and likely future shortage of dentists, we have no option but to examine fully the potential of these grades of dental auxiliary in our public dental services. A factor that would tend to influence me in this context is that emigration outlets for these grades would be limited. Consequently, we could plan for the future with more assurance.  Again, on the basis of New Zealand staffing levels we are talking in terms of about 1,000 jobs, a not unimportant consideration in the context of our national economy at present.</P>
    <P>Another problem that is assuming increasing importance is the question of specialist and consultant level services. There is a growing demand for specialist dental services, particularly in the orthodontic area.  Again, this is a reflection of the higher standards of dental care now being enjoyed by increasing numbers of children but it poses a problem in a situation where <Col N="1589" /> scarce resources have to be rationed on a priority basis.  To what extent should we expand our specialist services where basic services for the main priority group&mdash;children&mdash;are not met? Should we encourage the development of a consultant status service at this stage?  If so, should we model our post-graduate programme on the European mainland approach of three years' intensive training, or upon the United Kingdom system of an eight-year training period?  Which specialities should we recognise and what role will the public dental services play in all of this?  It is obvious that the answers to these problems will require considerable negotiations and discussions and here I must seriously take issue with Deputy Boland when he suggests there is no need for any review, examination or discussion in this area, that the only thing required is to get on with it.</P>
    <P>There are many other important issues that must also be considered. Should the public dental services be extended to cover adolescents?  Indeed, should these services be extended to the limited eligibility group as a whole?  The legal requirement for this was included in the 1970 Health Act and, in fact, was in health legislation as far back as 1953.  Pressure on public funds for other needs has prevented this legal provision being implemented to date.  Quite clearly, the time has now come to decide upon the pathways along which the public dental services will develop in the coming years.  There are two ways of approaching this.  We can take a piecemeal approach and try to solve existing problem situations by attempting to recruit additional officers or by involving private dentists to a greater extent. Bearing in mind that the private sector also has its needs, by solving a problem in one area&mdash;such as by offering special inducements to dentists to settle in neglected areas&mdash;we must not create problems in other areas.</P>
    <P>What we must do is to have a very full examination of the whole pattern of present and future services.  This would have to take into account all the options open to us.  In particular, <Col N="1590" /> it would involve a decision as to whether we should rely totally on dentists in the future or whether we should promote the development of auxiliary grades.  I should not like to take decisions on issues as fundamental as these without the fullest consultations with the various interested agencies including in particular, the health boards and the dental profession.  Indeed I am fully satisfied that the practising dental profession would welcome and, in fact, anticipates this consultation process.</P>
    <P>Here I come to something of considerable importance and it is by way of reply to criticism which Deputy Boland, in particular, has levelled at me, namely, that I am too anxious to review and examine matters and to engage in consultations.  His suggestion was that I should plunge into immediate action.  Since I took up office, and long before that, consultations between the Department and the profession in regard to the many problems that had to be faced had been inhibited by the absence of a full-time dental adviser in the Department.  I am glad to be able to announce now that a new chief dental officer has been selected and shortly he will take up duty.  The full laborious procedure of the Civil Service Commission selection machinery has been gone through, a man has been selected and it is only a matter of some further details before he takes up his post.</P>
    <P>I could not really get down to the kind of examination that I want to make of the dental services and all the problems and to project policy even for the immediate future until I had such a man beside me to advise me in regard to these difficult, complicated professional matters.  The appointment in this case will make available to me a professional input of a high level that I am certain will be of great benefit in the resolution of the many problems that have to be faced and particularly in the continuing consultation with the dental profession that is fundamental to this matter.</P>
    <P>What is required is a comprehensive development programme worked out in consultation with the interested <Col N="1591" /> agencies and taking all possible options into account in the consultation process.  Only in that way can we produce a worth-while programme. That programme will have to maintain a balance between the legitimate needs of the eligible patients, the legitimate interests of the dental profession and of the general body of taxpayers. It is no easy task and there is no simple solution.</P>
    <P>This consultation process inevitably will produce a number of new approaches. There is no doubt in my mind that an overall comprehensive programme will cost a great deal of money but I am glad to be able to say that we have more money at our disposal this year.  The Government and the Minister for Finance have recognised that an improvement is necessary in this area and money has been made available for suitable development. There will also be very heavy demands on available manpower. I believe we will have to proceed on the basis of priorities that we will have to sort out.  The Government have recognised the problem and have indicated that resources must be directed to improvement of the dental services.  I want to get on with the consultation process as quickly as I can and try to hammer out the lines on which we will proceed.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some of the arguments put forward in the course of the debate.  Deputy O'Connell asked for details of the format and the terms of reference of the review of the dental services that I am proposing. Deputy Boland went further and seemed to interpret from the amendment that I was going to set up a review body.  There is nothing of the kind intended.  I agree that a review body is not necessary.  I intend to carry out a review as expeditiously as possible with my advisers and with the chief dental officer when he is appointed.  There is no need for any other kind of review.  A review in depth with expert advice available to me in the form of the chief dental officer is necessary and I think Deputy Boland was wrong in brushing it aside as unnecessary.  Perhaps he was indulging <Col N="1592" /> in a legitimate political tactic in suggesting it is something I am using only to delay action but I want to assure him it is not.  It is necessary and important.  I hope I have given some indication of the problems we have to resolve and the decisions we have to take.  I repeat again that the basis of the problem is the question of manpower.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Boland made the point that a new dentists Act will be required by the EEC directive regarding dentists which is nearing finalisation.  There is need for a new dental Bill.  That is under way and I hope it will not be delayed much longer.</P>
    <P>I readily acknowledge that this motion and the putting down of it have served a purpose in focusing attention on the problems in the dental service.  I assure the House clearly that the proposals and ideas put forward by the Fine Gael and Labour Deputies will be considered carefully.  I hope I have given some idea first of all of the sort of problems that confront me, the issues that have to be faced, and the fact that I am concerned and anxious to get on with the review whose aim is the formulating of policies in this field.  I have indicated a number of problems which confront us.</P>
    <P>In the short term context of this year, money is not one of them.  We have some additional finances both in the preventive and the other side and I would hope that improvements will be made in the course of the year. However, I want to make it clear that there are real difficulties which prevent simple straightforward solutions to the serious problems confronting us in the dental field.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has agreed there was justification for the leading contributions made by spokesmen like Deputy O'Connell on the issue of dental care.  In his contribution the Minister acknowledged that there is a great need, after the reviews he has promised, for remedial action at official level.  I interpret from the Minister's contribution that this, like any <Col N="1593" /> other area of health care, is a question of choice of priorities.</P>
      <P>My only reason for intervening is that I want to make a few brief comments on certain complaints I and other Deputies have received from parents of schoolchildren who, on the figures available to us, do not receive adequate dental care.  It is true that public education comes into this, but there remains for the Minister for Health of the day the problem of credibility, of explaining how it happens that the present Minister is anxious to improve the situation at a time when the percentage of total health expenditure devoted to dental care has dropped.  Of the total expenditure in the Health Estimate in 1977, 1.2 per cent, or £3.9 million, has been devoted to the dental service.  The total Health Estimate was £350 million.  The size of that indicates the enormous burden on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The Minister claims that the amount allocated this year represents an increase of 12 per cent, but the percentage devoted to dental care is only 1.2 of the total sum.  I do not know the priorities which guided the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that priority.  The Minister will agree that the cases made here yesterday by Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Boland were alarming.  I doubt if the Minister will challenge their accuracy.  These figures certainly do not explain why that small percentage for the dental service was agreed.  Perhaps the Minister is laying a foundation for a more significant advance in the future, but that reduction in respect of the dental service has not been explained, and therefore the Opposition were right to draw attention to the need for more investment in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that there is a manpower shortage.  That is true. Speaking of the general manpower shortage the Minister referred to the emigration of dental graduates, which is very difficult to stop because of the greater attractions, remuneration included, in other countries.  In the context <Col N="1594" /> of that general exodus is the problem of the public service itself and its attractiveness for dentists.  We say that the remuneration in the public service is not sufficiently attractive to keep adequate personnel in that area, and that must be tackled in whatever review structure the Minister considers necessary.  I accept the common sense of having an adviser for the Minister in this matter.  <i>Prima facie</i>, there is a case for the argument that remuneration for public service dentists is not sufficient either to attract fresh graduates or to retain staff.  Dentists remain in the public service only for a short time. I have not got figures to substantiate that, but from the two cases of which I have knowledge, I know that the job of public service dentists is regarded as a temporary state before the personnel take up private practice. Because there is this manpower shortage the conclusion is inescapable that only by altering the remuneration structure available will we get the incentive for dentists to remain in the public service&mdash;only in that way will the public service have the necessary attraction for people to come in and stay in.</P>
    <P>The Minister was right when he said that it is the children who are the principal victims of the inadequacy of the present system.  We have, theoretically, a dental service for schools but the figures are quite alarming.  We have some information on the frequency of school health examinations in primary schools.  It is considered desirable for schools that have more than 50 pupils to be visited each year and that smaller schools be visited at least every two years.</P>
    <P>Questions that have been asked here about the frequency of those visits suggest that the examinations are very infrequent, presumably because of the shortage of manpower.  It means that a great number of the children simply receive emergency treatment.  There can be little question of preventive treatment where the personnel are so thin on the ground and where the examinations take place so infrequently. If children do not benefit from an adequate dental service at an early age, whatever importance may <Col N="1595" /> be given to the question of public education in relation to dental care, if the majority of children in the country do not as of right get adequate dental care and preventive treatment in their school years we are obviously creating a future of dental trouble for those children.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are 320,000 eligible schoolchildren who did not receive any dental examination at all in 1976.  I suppose the figures for 1977 and this year will be an increase on that figure.  All the TV ads in the world on the necessity for proper dental care will not get away from the weakness the whole system suffers from and which those figures expose. Only 46 per cent of our children received any dental examination under the programme in 1976.</P>
    <P>The Minister may justifiably say that the problems he is facing are not of his creation, that they have been there for some considerable time.  We would not deny that.  I am not sure the Minister is right in saying that the choice of dentists suggested by the previous Minister would not be of any assistance.  This should be looked at more carefully in his review of the whole service.  The previous Minister, from what I can gather, appeared to think there might be some benefit even in the present situation in adopting that choice system.</P>
    <P>I do not want to leave the Minister with the impression that we are saying that this is a new problem.  It has obviously gone on for a long time, but now he is the responsible Minister. Crudely, what it requires, for improvement in the short term and in the long term, is a large infusion of extra cash. I do not think it requires much examination of the options before us to realise that the glaring need is for more personnel and a bigger investment. Admittedly the whole health area needs larger investment, but this cries out for an urgent injection of capital in order to get an adequate dental service for our children.  If we are concerned about the public education aspect of this problem, we must give priority to our children in seeing that a decent dental service is provided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> Additional money is required to solve such problems as remuneration of the personnel in the public service, to make it more attractive for them. If this new dental Bill comes before us in the near future money will be required for the new auxiliary people the Minister referred to.  The dental profession would have to be consulted on this and they appear to welcome this proposed auxiliary service.  I saw from a recent interview with the President of the Dental Union that he appeared to welcome the provision of that type of extra help in the service.</P>
    <P>We cannot escape responsibility for initiating very early action to improve the position in the country.  International statistics on the subject suggest that there is a truly alarming position here.  The preventive side of dental care is not, obviously, accorded very high priority.  How could it be accorded high priority when one considers the few personnel operating in this area?  There is need for improvement in the service to the schools.  People on medical cards can obviously receive only emergency dental treatment.  There is a long queue for appointments.  I believe that the average is about nine months' waiting time for children and ten months' for adults.  Very early action is required in that area and there is need for a greater number of personnel.</P>
    <P>We must have the highest extraction rate of all EEC countries because of the make-up of our dental service, its undermanned state.  We certainly must have the highest rate of dental caries in the Community.  We need more dentists in the public service as well as in the country at large.  I ask the Minister, in his consideration of this matter with his advisers, to look into the case of people who receive their dental treatment by means of the insurance stamp.  I believe consideration should be given to the actual payment to dentists for examination.  I have heard that the amount paid for examination to dentists is less than&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not paid for examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought some payment was made for examination, but I now learn from Deputy <Col N="1597" /> O'Connell that no payment is made, which makes the matter even worse. If there is no payment for examination and only a fee-per-item for treatment there seems to be a bias there on what should comprise dental care.  I would like the Minister to have a look at that matter.  This suggests that the whole system, with all its inadequacies, is geared only to the treatment side of dental care and is not geared to the preventive, which is the more important area.  I have not an adequate answer to this but I imagine that the Minister is back to the old problem again in respect of how he primes up the treatment side.  He will be back to the question of additional moneys being made available again.</P>
      <P>There is a plan for a new dental hospital in Cork and a plan for one on the site of St. James's Hospital in Dublin.  Obviously, that will improve the situation.  The Minister indicated that we appear to turn out sufficient graduates if they remain in the country but there is no easy way of ensuring that they will remain here.  It would help if the conditions were made attractive.  There have been calls for improved conditions in the public dental services run by the health boards and better promotion and career structures for dentists.  Apart from the question of remuneration those matters should be given early attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good thing that we will shortly have a new Bill dealing with dental services that appears to have as its main feature the appointment of auxiliaries.  I accept the Minister's point that more public education is needed on this matter.  We cannot blame the Minister for the incidence of dental caries or the state of the teeth of the people of the nation but we can criticise him if he does not prove to the House annually that he is at Cabinet level securing sufficient cash for the improvement of the service. If he sees his role as one of discussing the options, as one of a public educator-in-chief on the necessity for correct dental care he will be making the same mistake and subject to the same criticism as the wife of the Lord Lieutenant at the start of the century who, looking at malnutrition, put the <Col N="1598" /> cause of it down to the faulty diet of the unfortunates concerned.  The Minister's sincerity in this area will be called in question if he cannot tell the House that he has secured from the Cabinet the right priority.  As far as a Minister for Health is concerned the right priority&mdash;I accept that the Minister approaches his task in a serious fashion&mdash;is to carry his sincerity and seriousness into force at Cabinet level to secure sufficient investment in this area.  If he does not do that he will have failed as Minister for Health and, instead of being, as I understand is his ambition, the best Minister for Health in the history of the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures suggest that he has not succeeded this year in getting the right cash allocation to correct some of the weaknesses in this service.  In his role as public educator in this matter I would like him to consider the situation in relation to toothpaste.  It has been brought to my attention that toothpaste is regarded as a cosmetic and as such is liable to VAT.  Toothpaste appears to be some help as a preventive treatment and it seems wrong to regard it as a cosmetic. I understand that one brand of toothpaste is manufactured here.  Toothpaste should be considered to have some medical property and relieved of the VAT imposition.  The Minister should talk to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, about this matter and I am sure he will secure the utmost co-operation from him.  It would not do the Minister any harm to ensure that VAT was removed from toothpaste.</P>
      <P>The dental profession do not consider that they are being taken as seriously as the medical profession in the Department of Health.  I do not know the attitude of the Minister in this matter but I presume he believes that all medical personnel should be treated equally.  This view is corroborated by many dentists when they see that within the health boards they operate under the jurisdiction of medical doctors.  I hope the Minister will have a look at that aspect in any discussions he will be having with his chief adviser.</P>

      <P>I welcome that development.  The Minister appears to agree with the opinion I have heard expressed that dentists are not taken as seriously as medical doctors.  Dentists have been fighting for a long time for professional recognition.  Considering the problems we have in that regard we should resolve any feelings we have of that character that may still exist.  I was anxious to air the complaints I have received about the dental service over the years.  Parents have complained about the inadequacy of the service, especially at school level where children receive only emergency treatment.  If we are anxious to develop the preventive side of dental care this is a poor foundation for the future.  As well as introducing this new Bill dealing with dental services the Minister should, by supplementary budget or otherwise, prove his goodwill by arranging the provision of extra funds to be devoted to the dental care side of his Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed that the Minister did not accept this motion.  It would have been a gesture of his goodwill and his intention to tackle this serious problem.  His amendment seems to indicate that he is putting the matter on the long finger.  I am not accusing the Minister of being responsible for dental care here in the past.  But he is here now and he has the responsibility for it.  It is a very big responsibility.  Talking about preventive health care seems to be the order of the day.  Teeth play a vital role in health, particularly in the health of young people.  Teeth are the gateway to the body and defects in the mouth can have serious repercussions. The ill-health that bad teeth can cause cannot be quantified.  We cannot point the finger at a death and say that it was the result of bad teeth, but over the years neglect in this area can cause a serious decline in health of large numbers of people, and that is easily recognised when we hear of people having teeth removed for health reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> The personnel problem is a large one.  A number of our dentists leave the country.  Perhaps they do so because they feel that the training they get in our dental hospitals might not be up to standard.  Since I came into this House there has been a number of problems in the dental hospital in Dublin, and these can have only a detrimental effect on the training of dentists.  Only months ago there was a protracted dispute concerning an extension of six months in the training period for dentists before they would qualify, and this would mean a further cutback in dental care.  Dental care is the Cinderella of the whole health spectrum.  The affluent in our society can afford to go to a dentist and pay. The less well-off have to wait many months before they can receive treatment, and consequently severe damage to their general health occurs while waiting.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister stated that there will be a new dental hospital. This is long overdue and should get priority as early as possible.  When one walks through some areas of the dental hospital here one would seem to be in a museum, a memento of something that was a dental hospital 50 or 60 years ago and now is there to show what was done in the past.  It is crude, and how people trained there I cannot understand.  The whole dental hospital is a disgrace, and the dental board who control it had serious reservations as to whether they would qualify people trained there.  Stop-gap arrangements were made there to carry on.  The hospital epitomises the attitude of successive Governments to dental care as something that could be put off, that we did not have to spend money on because there was no urgency about it. Many young people, particularly girls, need orthodontic treatment.  The very long delays often mean that when they do get the treatment it may be too late. They cannot get it done privately because of the prohibitive cost which their parents would have to meet. These children&mdash;again with special emphasis on the girls because they want to be glamorous and look well&mdash; are the sufferers and they carry this stigma, as it may be called, right through their lives.  We have tolerated <Col N="1601" /> this over the years without doing anything to remedy it.</P>
    <P>The amendment put down is a further recipe for doing nothing.  The Minister should have been courageous and accepted this motion.  We would not have expected him to operate it overnight.  It will take a number of years to get some progress on it, but we would at least have a clear indication from the Minister that he was going to do something.  The only indication we have is that the Government will merely undertake a comprehensive review.  That is what we have been hearing from the Government since they came into office.  In every Department we are having a look at this, we are going to review that, we are examining the other thing.  That is all right and will get them by for a while, but they must face up to reality.  It is not the solution to this very serious problem.  I am surprised at the Minister adopting this stance in this case because there is no doubt in anybody's mind about the dental problems in this country.  Let us cut out the codology of reviews and face reality.  If children have to wait nine months for treatment that is scandalous.  Adults have to wait longer than that and people needing specialised treatment may have to wait three or four years.  It is time that this was remedied.  The sooner we get down to doing something about it the better.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's approach to this very serious problem. From the point of view of political gain there may be nothing in this, so it is put on the long finger.  There is no real pressure and no real outcry for a change in the system and therefore it is not a matter of urgency and we can defer it until another day.  That is the only conclusion I can reach.</P>
    <P>We cannot defer the problem until another day because of the decline in young people's health as a result of grave dental problems they have due to the type of food they eat.  Because of easy access to sugared items and soft drinks the situation is much worse than it was years ago.  This is all the more reason why we should tackle this problem urgently.  I ask the Minister to accept this motion as a gesture of his concern for the problem.  In <Col N="1602" /> other areas of health the Minister has shown concern but in this area he has not grasped the nettle.  Perhaps he has been advised by the people in the Department that this has been deferred for a long time and that we can procrastinate a little longer on it and nothing will happen.  It is bad.</P>
    <P>In the short term we should consider some form of mobile dental treatment. There are mobile services in other areas.  There is no reason for not being able to attract people to the service. It is said that our young dentists are emigrating but they are emigrating because the stakes elsewhere are high. Let us make the stakes here high for them.  If the people across the water can pay them we should be able to pay them also.  We need them to work in the built-up areas and in the schools where comprehensive and regular checks are important.  If the service were satisfactory there would be a gradual cutting down in the need for dental attention because defects would be diagnosed in time.  Another important aspect is that of education in relation to dental health.  There is very little such education, apart from the odd word of warning that may be included in some of the slick advertisements on television for the various kinds of toothpaste&mdash;the ring of confidence or whatever&mdash;but that is not education.  It is aimed only at selling the various products.</P>

      <P>Education in this sphere is of the utmost importance and the right place to begin is in the schools.  We need personnel to visit the schools and lecture children in oral hygiene and so on.  It should be possible, too, to put in train some mobile <Col N="1603" /> dental units provided we can keep adequate staff here.</P>
      <P>Generally our people prefer to work at home but they may emigrate if the terms elsewhere are much more attractive. England provides a large market for dentists because of the comprehensive service that is available there, whereas the young dentist here may have to struggle for a number of years after qualifying.  We must do everything possible to make conditions attractive for them.  The situation for most of them is that on leaving the dental hospital they drift around for a while and then emigrate unless they find it possible to set up a private practice but that takes time to develop.</P>
      <P>While the Minister is waiting for his comprehensive review he can at least improve the standard by utilising those dentists that are available but he must increase substantially their rate of remuneration. Money spent in the area of preventive care is money spent wisely.  It is an investment for the future.  I ask the Minister to accept the motion in the name of Deputy O'Connell. In this way the Minister will be showing his concern for the people, particularly for those who cannot afford private dental treatment.</P>

      <P>The motion has achieved some purpose in highlighting the deplorable state of our dental services. In addition it has brought from the Minister an acknowledgment that the situation is far from satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that it was found necessary to bring in the amendment.  I do not consider the proposal in the motion in my name to be extraordinary especially since the Minister of State at the Department of Education called for greater steps.  He called for a further extension of our dental services and said that those middle-class people who are not insured need dental care for themselves and their dependants.  The Minister of State said that the wives of such people were depriving themselves of essential dental service in order to allow their children to have attention.  I pay tribute to Deputy Tunney in going a step further than I have gone.  All I <Col N="1604" /> was attempting here was to have provided an interim kind of service that would be an improvement.  I was not advocating any sort of socialist solution to the problem.  If I were to do that I would be calling for a full national dental service.  I am humble in what I have called for compared with what Deputy Tunney has called for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that the Minister will consider seriously what the Minister of State has called for. The Minister has emphasised the preventive aspect of dental care and said that I had not attempted to do this.  In this context perhaps the Minister would take immediate steps to provide that the Department of Social Welfare will pay for dental examinations. Deputy O'Leary adverted to the situation in this regard.  It is something the Minister should do as a first step.</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need, too, for the initiation of a public education programme in order that the 80 per cent who are entitled to benefit would be so aware.  Only 20 per cent of those people are availing of the service.  The launching of such a programme would be an indication of the Minister's sincerity in this area and of his determination to provide a proper dental service.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, too, the Minister will arrange that dental examinations in schools will be conducted more frequently so that defects will be discovered and attended to in time.  Perhaps, too, steps would be taken to ensure that the 320,000 children whose teeth were not examined in 1976 would have them examined now.  To take action on these matters would be a major step forward on the road to improved dental services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something else that the Minister might do is to talk with his colleagues about the EEC grant for the flouridation of milk&mdash;dental milk as it is known.  If the Government are prepared to contribute 50 per cent of the cost involved, the EEC are prepared to pay the other 50 per cent.  About 40 <Col N="1605" /> per cent of our population will never have a flouridated water supply.</P>
    <P>The Minister adverted to the manpower shortage and said that of the 70 dental surgeons who qualify each year, the majority emigrate.  Would the Minister take steps now to have incorporated in the dental Bill that is to come before us shortly a provision whereby a dental surgeon would have to complete a compulsory year's service on qualifying.  This would not be without precedent.  There has been such a provision since 1953 in regard to doctors.  It would give us immediately an extra 70 dental surgeons per year in the public dental service.</P>
    <P>This would immediately help to alleviate the manpower shortage in the public dental service.  Is it too much to ask dental surgeons who have received State grants towards their education to give one year's service to the public dental service?  This is the time to do it, before the dental Bill is introduced.  In my view we are achieving something in discussing this motion.  Although this is not mentioned in the motion, the Minister should give it serious consideration because it could be a step towards alleviating the manpower shortage in the public dental service.  The Minister says the cash is there and that we do not have any money problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that &ldquo;money has been made available; there is more money now&rdquo;.  Is there any reason why we cannot use that money to provide a free dental care service for all school children?  This is one big area which demands immediate action.  School children who go on to secondary school cannot have this service at the most important time of their lives.  If they were given this service it would mean a vast saving to the State.  To deprive them of this service as soon as they go to secondary school is false economy.  We want them to go to secondary schools but we are not willing to provide that service.  I am asking the Minister to provide the money for this one aspect of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> I am not blaming any Government for this.  We have so-called free education but parents have to pay so much and this added burden for dental care for their children could be alleviated if the Minister took one bold step forward.  As I pointed out last night, there has not been an increase in the proportion of the total health expenditure devoted to this service.  It was 1.2 per cent and it is 1.1 per cent; it has been reduced this year.  We should seriously look at this and not say that there has been a 12 per cent increase because in terms of the proportion of the total expenditure it has been a reduction.</P>
    <P>Why not bring in a supplementary estimate and do the few things I asked?  That would be a stop-gap measure but would do something to help.  This Minister is decisive and this is one area where his efforts would win public acclaim.  Would he look seriously at the payments made to dental surgeons in the public service in order to attract more people into that service?  I know from experience that if he were to improve the conditions of service and the salary structure in the public service, many people would be attracted into that vital area.  This would help to alleviate the chronic waiting list because there are on average 24,000 children waiting an average of 9.9 months&mdash;and they could be waiting up to two years&mdash;and 27,690 adults waiting an average of 10.9 months.  We must not neglect the aged, the impoverished who need dentures and often have to wait two or three years for them.  They suffer serious digestive disorders because they cannot chew their food.  That is happening to many old age pensioners. The Minister would save a great deal of money on pills and medicines if these people were provided with dentures. If that is not false economy I do not know what is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking now as a doctor and I can tell the Minister that 80 per cent of the digestive disorders suffered by old people are due to the fact that they are not masticating <Col N="1607" /> their food properly and because they have no dentures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could look at that.  It is a shame to have to write a prescription for antacids and other correctives for digestive disorders.  If the Minister would look into this, his Department would save money.</P>
      <P>To have a choice of dentist is not creating a precedent because it is already incorporated in the social welfare code.  Would he consider doing this as an interim measure to relieve the waiting list?  This would reduce the tremendous backlog that exists.  He could discuss this with the Irish Dental Association and I am sure they would be very willing to discuss this subject seriously with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the Minister is serious <Col N="1608" /> and sincere about wanting a review and I have no doubt we will get action. Would he give some indication when it will take place or could he bring a report to the All-Party Health Committee of the Dáil?  If he did that we would know where we stand.  That report could tell us that we would have this scheme before us for consideration in two or three months' time.  That would be a step in the right direction.  I ask the Minister to consider the other suggestions I have made.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to call a vote on this because I think the Minister is sincere about it and I am prepared to accept his amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Motion, as amended, agreed to.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he is aware that money was sanctioned in June 1977 for the dredging of Sligo harbour; that in recent times ships have been grounded on entering Sligo port; that shipping companies are not prepared to renew contracts if dredging is not carried out as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I have been advised that in recent times ships have had difficulties entering Sligo harbour because of siltation.  I am aware that my predecessor indicated on 4 July 1977, that he would be prepared, subject to technical clearance, to recommend the making available of a grant for dredging at Sligo harbour.</P>
      <P>It was necessary to obtain additional financial information from the Sligo Harbour Commissioners to permit of full examination of the proposal, and the supply of that information was not completed until last week.  I will now endeavour to give an early decision on the question of a grant.</P>

The procedure for recruitment to fill staff vacancies follows a normal pattern and in the meantime by temporary redeployment of staff there is no interruption in the payment of grants in County Sligo.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 205 of 9 February 1978, I was at that time reviewing the scale of expenses for lay witnesses in court cases, which had been unaltered since 1964.  I have since completed my review and a new scale of expenses has been put into operation with effect from 1 January 1978.</P>
      <P>Taking all relevant factors into account, the scale has been increased by approximately 300 per cent in so far as travelling, subsistence and allowances for loss of time are concerned. The existing arrangements whereby a salary or wage earner may, on production of an appropriate certificate from his employer, be recouped any permanent loss of wages that he may incur by attending court as a State witness remains in force.</P>

I am awaiting the outcome of that process.  I already met a deputation from the Southern Cross route study group, when I suggested that they should keep in touch with the council members for their area.

Cospóir are aware of the Government's policy regarding the question of Irish teams or individuals participating with individuals or teams from South Africa.  The council will be co-operating as appropriate with other countries and organisations in the interests of sport including the implementation of the United Nations general policy on apartheid in sport&mdash;which policy the Government fully supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The normal conditions attached to the awarding of grants to sports bodies <Col N="1545" /> under my Department's scheme of aid to sport is that the money be spent in the areas of coaching, administration and equipment only.</P>
    <P>As for my Department's attitude towards grant-aided bodies taking part in sport with a racially selected team from South Africa, all of these bodies have been advised of the Government's policy of support of the United Nations resolutions on apartheid in sport.</P>
