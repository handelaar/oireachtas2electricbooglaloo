      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): May I mention a matter which I think is of importance?  On 30 November last, following a ruling by the Chair that a Deputy was disorderly, and on that Deputy refusing to resume his seat or to leave the House, the matter was dealt with by adjourning the House for 35 minutes.  Yesterday, for a much lesser offence, Deputy Enright was named quickly and suspended.  I respectfully suggest that this represents a very different ruling and that it smacks of discrimination. I think it should be on the record of the House and I suggest that it calls for an explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil at its rising this week do adjourn for the Christmas Recess until Wednesday, 31 January 1979.</P>
      <P>In case there is any complaint this morning, I understand the script will be circulated almost immediately.  When the House rises at the conclusion of this debate, it will do so at the end of one of the most successful periods on record for the Irish economy.  I said when the Government were elected to office that I would be content to have our performance judged above all by reference to the success we achieved in increasing employment and reducing the numbers out of work.  On this criterion, I believe that we can look back upon 1978 with justified pride.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1587" /> While firm estimates cannot be made until the official mid-April 1979 employment estimates become available next year, the available information indicates that the overall net increase in employment will be 17,000, the largest year-on-year increase in the last 30 years.  Indeed the closest increase in that period was the increase of 10,000 recorded in the year to April 1974.</P>
    <P>The unprecedented progress flows largely from the direct job-creation programme undertaken by the Government. It will be recalled that our pre-election manifesto undertook to take immediate action to provide 20,000 new jobs within 12 months.  However, in the budget last January, we provided sufficient funds to speed up the programme so as effectively to replace the manifesto commitment by a new target of 22,860 new jobs to be directly created over the 18-months period to the end of this year.</P>
    <P>This revised target will be fulfilled. Direct job creation in the three areas covered by the programme, namely, the public sector, building and construction and youth employment, will be of the order of 24,000 by the end of this month, of which some 22,600 will have been filled.  The remaining 1,500 vacancies will be filled early in the new year. This represents a massive attack on the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>From the evidence available, it appears that in the building and construction industry, as a result of the high level of resources directed to it through Government policies, output and employment have increased significantly. The Department of the Environment, in the &ldquo;Review of the Building and Construction Industry in 1977 and Outlook for 1978&rdquo;, published in June 1978, had anticipated that the increase in output for the industry in 1978 would be 7.6 per cent.  Recent indications, however, would suggest that a real increase in the range 10 to 12 per cent would be a more accurate forecast.  It is anticipated that the numbers directly employed in the industry in 1978 will show an increase of 5,000 on the 1977 figures.</P>
    <P>The following is some of the evidence of this increase in activity and employment <Col N="1588" /> in the building and construction industry. The total number of houses completed in 1978 is expected to be in excess of 26,000.  This compares with a total figure of approximately 24,500 for 1977. The number of applications for house improvement grants and loans for the first nine months of 1978 is almost double the number for the corresponding period of 1977.  Cement sales for the period January-November, 1978 increased by 15 per cent relative to the corresponding period in 1977.</P>
    <P>Job creation in the public sector will be in line with the target.  In the youth employment area, progress has been very satisfactory and job creation will exceed the target of 5,000 by more than 1,400 jobs.  While some of these jobs are of a short-term nature, I believe they are valuable in giving young people experience of working life, in the acquisition of skills and knowledge and in avoiding, for those concerned, the corrosive effects of long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>The direct programme of job creation to which I have been referring was, of course, only one prong of the Government's frontal attack on our employment problems.  We also took measures to stimulate demand in the economy and to encourage investment and expansion by the private sector.  As a result of these measures and other factors, there have been significant increases in employment in the private sector of manufacturing industry and services.  The estimated net increases in employment in both the public and private parts of industry and services are 7,000 and 10,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>However, the positive contribution of the private sector to these increases now seems likely to be less than had been expected, firstly because the level of job losses through redundancy is above expectation and secondly, because the bulk of increased industrial output is coming from greater productivity rather than greater employment.  The trend towards higher redundancies is disappointing but it is hardly surprising given the many pressures for wage increases well in excess of the national wage agreement and the lost output and disruption caused by industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> In manufacturing, IDA new job creation is on target but there appears to be a lag between output growth and increases in employment in existing firms.  A number of factors appear to have been responsible for the sharp rise in productivity and the associated slower growth in employment in 1978.  The overall rise in output reflects exceptionally strong growth in particular sectors such as chemicals and textiles in which there has been a high level of investment in new projects in recent years; this investment has raised the level of productivity in these sectors in particular, and in manufacturing industry in general. Furthermore, higher than expected wage increases led some firms to offset these increased costs by increased productivity with the result that in some instances employment increased more slowly, while in others, workers were made redundant.  In addition, it is likely that firms which were previously working at less than full capacity were able to increase output without having to increase employment.  Indeed, average hours worked appear to have increased in many sectors while, in some firms, increased output may in itself have facilitated the introduction of more efficient procedures.</P>
    <P>It is evident that the impact of the very large increase in employment which has taken place is not fully reflected in the live register returns.  There is not a one-for-one relationship between these magnitudes because, for example, some of those taking up employment, such as school leavers, may not have registered as unemployed.  Nevertheless, the progress we have made has been seen in a significant reduction in the numbers on the live register.  These have been running throughout the year in the range 10,000 to 12,000 below the corresponding figures of last year.  At the most recent date for which figures are available, the live register was about 10 per cent below the comparable 1977 figure.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to record this degree of progress in tackling this problem which has for so long been a blot on our country and a cause of anxiety and hardship for those affected and their families.  The elimination of involuntary <Col N="1590" /> unemployment will remain the principal objective of this Government.</P>
    <P>The progress which has been made in raising employment and reducing unemployment reflects rapid growth in output, exports and investment.  The growth target of 7 per cent which we set ourselves, will be achieved and, for the second year in succession, Ireland will have achieved the highest growth rate in the European Community.  Indeed our growth rate will be one of the highest achieved in the developed world.</P>
    <P>The indications available suggest that fixed investment has expanded very rapidly this year.  Imports of producers' capital goods for the first ten months of the year showed a rise of almost 30 per cent on the same period last year.  I have already referred to the increase in cement sales.  Overall, the increase in fixed investment may reach 15 per cent.  This augurs well for continued rapid growth.</P>
    <P>Exports of goods and services, it is estimated, will show a rise of 14 per cent, with agricultural exports rising, in volume terms, by about 20 per cent and industrial exports showing an increase, in real terms, of about 12 per cent.  The rise in world trade was about 5 per cent while the growth in our major export markets was no more than 7 per cent. Thus, our exports increased their market share.  This is gratifying.  Tourism also enjoyed a very successful year.  The latest estimate for the balance of payments deficit is £150 million which is a considerably more favourable outturn than many commentators predicted. This deficit is more than matched by the inflow of capital so that our reserves are higher this year than at the corresponding date last year.</P>
    <P>I turn now to developments in industry and agriculture during the past year.  The performance of the manufacturing sector in achieving the Government's economic and social objectives is of critical importance.  It will influence the achievement of these objectives both directly and indirectly.  Increased output, exports and employment will result directly from the expansion of manufacturing activity and this in turn will induce related expansionary effects in other sectors of the economy.  The manufacturing sector will also play a <Col N="1591" /> key role in helping to secure a more balanced pattern of regional development consistent with the Government's objectives.</P>
    <P>The sector has continued to grow rapidly in 1978.  Following an increase of almost 8 per cent in 1977, output is expected to increase by almost 10 per cent in 1978.  This significant increase will be due to strong growth in home sales, which has been facilitated by the Government's domestic measures to stimulate the economy, as well as the rapid growth in exports to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Performance in 1977 and 1978 indicates that the agricultural sector is playing a major role in the realisation of the Government's national targets. Gross output rose by 9.4 per cent in 1977 and further substantial growth is expected in 1978.  The target in the White Paper of January 1978 of a 25 per cent gross output increase in the four years to 1980 was, therefore, a realistic one.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, in spite of this excellent performance, the development of the sector is hindered by certain problems which prevent it from making an even greater contribution to the national economy.  It is, therefore, the Government's intention to implement measures in 1979 which will assist in raising the longer-term growth rate in Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the biggest obstacle to improving the growth rate in Irish agriculture is the poor structure of land ownership.  Many younger farmers are hindered from undertaking development through lack of land.  At the same time there is much land held by older farmers who are unable or unwilling to improve their farms or expand farm output.  To deal with this and other problems of land structure, the Minister for Agriculture is preparing proposals for land structure reform.</P>
    <P>The Minister is pressing, at EEC level, for reforms in the farm modernisation scheme which would, <i>inter alia</i>, enable more farmers to qualify for development status.  The development of the agricultural sector, as well as the Government's primary objective of full <Col N="1592" /> employment, requires that all farmers with development capacity should be encouraged to realise it.</P>
    <P>The Government are acutely aware of the importance of farmer training and education in promoting agricultural development.  Under legislation currently before the Dáil, An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta will take responsibility for the advisory service and will co-ordinate farmer training and education.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to encouraging agricultural development has been illustrated by its decision to accelerate drainage operations in the west. The accelerated programme, with EEC aid, will run for five years and will cover 100,000 hectares (about a quarter of a million acres).  The EEC and the Irish Exchequer will each contribute 50 per cent of eligible expenditure under the programme which on present estimates will cost well over £40 million.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that the food processing industries provide scope for increasing employment with minimum import content.  The Minister for Agriculture has already succeeded in having the EEC remove anomalies which adversely affected the chilled and frozen beef industry.  He is continuing to press vigorously for the removal of anomalies affecting the canned and cooked meat sectors.</P>
    <P>It has to be realised that farm price increases of the magnitude of recent years will not be available in the future. Growth must come from efficiency and effort.  The Government are committed to encouraging the development of Irish agriculture and intend to ensure that the common agricultural policy will not be altered in a manner which would lessen the incentive to output growth.  I will avail of this opportunity to say that the suggestion, made yesterday by the leader of the Labour Party, that the CAP might be fundamentally altered as the price of British entry to the EMS is, to anyone who appreciates the attitudes of other member states, totally in the realm of fantasy.</P>
    <P>I wish to say emphatically that at all stages of the discussions on the EMS, no matter how preliminary or how advanced, I insisted at all times that the CAP was not up for bargaining or <Col N="1593" /> renegotiation in connection with the EMS.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to turn for a moment to Northern Ireland, where the problem of ending violence and establishing agreed political institutions seems to be no nearer solution than it was at the time of the last Adjournment Debate six months ago.  Earlier this year there were some encouraging indicators on the level of violence in the area.  For example, the number of persons killed this year is down on the 1977 figure.  In the past month or so, however, the Provisional IRA have stepped up their campaign determined to impose their will on the community at whatever cost in terms of human suffering.  This campaign of destruction postpones still further the day of peace and reconciliation in our country.  For its part, the Government will continue to do all in its power to frustrate the activities of the terrorists.  I am glad to say that co-operation between the forces responsible for security on both sides of the border is on a sound footing and will hopefully continue to help in the task of bringing those engaged in violence to justice.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I have always emphasised that the elimination of violence is but a small part of the solution to the problems of the North.  The development of political institutions commanding widespread support among both sections of the community remains a basic necessity.  Over the past few years I have repeated the view that if the British Government were to declare their interest in the unity of Ireland by consent, an important step on the road ahead would have been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have emphasised this time and time again in my meetings with the British Prime Minister and, as I indicated to the House in reporting back on a number of occasions after the European Summit meetings, on that point we have to differ. I shall be persistent in bringing that <Col N="1595" /> forward because I believe it is the basis for a move forward which unfortunately does not seem to be taking place at present.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I wish to make it clear that in the regular reviews of Anglo-Irish relations whether between Mr. Callaghan and myself or between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his counterpart or anybody else in the British Government we do not seek in any way to take from or diminish the rights of the majority in Northern Ireland.  There is no place in our plans for unity by force or for any instantly imposed solution.  We seek a settlement achieved following reconciliation of all the different interests involved and based upon agreed political structures involving the whole of Ireland.  I think that the advantages of a solution along these lines are coming increasingly to be recognised.  The economy here is growing at a pace which makes it attractive to the Northern people to work, live and invest here.  We have common interests in the European Community and can argue for and advance policies which are of benefit to the entire island.  In any form of administration for the island as a whole the Northern people, with a population approximately half of ours, must have a proportionate voice.  By joining with us they would have a say in their future greater than they can ever attain under present arrangements.  And the stability which could flow from an agreed settlement would be of immense benefit not only to the people of Northern Ireland, but to the people of this part of Ireland, and of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I have made our views known to Mr. Callaghan on the occasions I have met him and I have said that it was on these lines and not through policies like closer integration of the North with Britain, that the Irish Government saw the solution.</P>
    <P>I may say again that I raised that point with Mr. Callaghan at my last meeting with him in Downing Street about two weeks ago.  He re-affirmed to me that the extension of seats to members representing Northern Ireland in Westminster Parliament was in no <Col N="1596" /> way indicative of a move towards integration.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, I established a study group with the Fianna Fáil party to review North-South relations in all aspects.  Work in that group is going ahead rapidly on this highly complex subject.</P>
    <P>Apart from the longer term issues, there are other practical matters on which co-operation can be of benefit. When I met the British Prime Minister for talks in September 1977 we agreed that it would be of mutual advantage to improve co-operation between the Republic and the UK on economic matters. There have been a considerable number of meetings at political, diplomatic and official level since then.</P>
    <P>Both of our Governments attach great importance to North-South economic co-operation, and we wish to see closer contacts and further co-operation develop.  A key task of the Anglo-Irish Steering Group set up after my meeting with Mr. Callaghan last year is to ensure that the impetus given to economic co-operation is sustained.  I am anxious that all Departments and semi-State bodies should play their full part in enhancing or intensifying this co-operation which is, I stress, of mutual advantage to both North and South and to our respective countries.</P>
    <P>The topics discussed by the various North-South official committees and also by the Anglo-Irish Steering Group have included matters in the transport, energy, customs and excise and economic planning fields.  There have been useful exchanges of views and information on subjects such as road haulage, tourism, civil aviation, the electricity interconnectors, that is the system of sharing over-loading of electricity generation between the two islands, also simplification of customs requirements and approaches to economic planning.</P>
    <P>Three cross-border studies have been completed or are currently in progress. The first of these is the Derry-Donegal communications study.</P>

      <P>A study of the Erne catchment area from the point of view of tourism and development of agricultural resources through arterial drainage is about to commence.  This study is being funded in part by the European Community, whose support for this cross-Border project is particularly welcome. Officials of the two administrations North and South have put in hands an examination of the scope for a coordinated approach to infrastructure planning and development of the Newry-Dundalk area.</P>
      <P>The process of consultation which was established after my meeting with Mr. Callaghan in September of last year has proved to be a valuable one.  I look forward to continued progress in the various areas referred to and I trust that it will be possible to enhance co-operation in this sphere of activity to the advantage of all the interests concerned.</P>
      <P>I now come to industrial relations. Over a period of years the number of days lost annually due to industrial disputes per 1,000 civilians at work in Germany has ranged from about 3 to 40.  In the Netherlands the statistics show a nil loss for a particular year.  Denmark lost an average of less than a 100 days per 1,000 employees.  Here the figures are about half-way between those for the country with the worst record and the best figures.  In other words our record is in or about average.  It is important to bear this consideration in mind on this important and complex subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, here, disputes in recent times have hit at services which concern a great number of people.  Telephones, milk deliveries, bus transport and electricity supplies are not just peripheral services.  They are vital to the life of the nation, and it is these services which have been affected recently by the breakdown of industrial relations.  It would be unwise to apportion blame, as a sort of universal general rule, on either unions or management, in the same way <Col N="1598" /> in all cases.  That is not my concern here today.</P>
    <P>What does, however, concern the Government is the way in which procedures which have been agreed by management and workers are so often ignored by small groups who rely on traditional attitudes and loyalties to try to enforce their will&mdash;ignoring the commitments and agreements which have been made on their behalf and for their protection.  This issue goes far outside the individual or firm concerned.  It is something which vitally affects the public interest.  The Commission on Industrial Relations is reviewing the problem and the Government are giving it their most serious attention.</P>
    <P>Now for the outlook for 1979.  The foundations for fast growth were laid in 1978, in particular the stimulation of private sector investment through the Government's expansionary economic policies.  It should be possible to achieve substantial growth in 1979 and once again to be at or near the top of the European growth rate.</P>
    <P>My reason for this confidence is twofold. On the domestic front investment demand should continue at a high level in response to the buoyant demand conditions experienced in 1978 and the relatively favourable outlook in the domestic and international economies for 1979.  The tax cuts and incentives given by the Government in the 1978 budget should also boost investment during the coming year.</P>
    <P>The substantial progress made in reducing inflation during 1978 can be maintained during 1979: and even a moderate rise in incomes should be sufficient to ensure a continued rise in living standards.  Indeed, it is on our ability to operate an incomes policy successfully that the success of all other policies depends. We cannot increase employment and maintain high rates of economic growth if we destroy the very foundation of the economy by paying ourselves more than our work is worth.</P>
    <P>On the external front the outlook for world trade is brighter.  Mainly as a consequence of the concerted reflationary action programme undertaken by the main industrialised countries during 1978 the volume increase in world trade <Col N="1599" /> should accelerate during 1979.  The latest OECD forecast is for a rise in the total import volumes of its members of over 5 per cent, as compared with 4½ per cent in 1978.  If our competitiveness can be maintained, we would also expect to increase our percentage share of the world market.  Increased home demand will increase imports, and we expect the balance of payments deficit to increase as a result.  However, this is unlikely to be a significant constraint, given the relatively high level of external reserves.</P>
    <P>Overall, therefore, the outlook for the Irish economy in 1979 is relatively bright provided we act responsibly.</P>
    <P>We have spent much time over the past few months debating whether or not this country should enter into the new European Monetary System.  The reasons for and against have been spelt out again and again at great length and in detail.  I do not intend to go over them here again.  In fact, this morning, I am not in a position to add anything to what has been said about the Government's stance on the question of this country's participation.  What we are all agreed on is that the fundamental objective of this system is desirable.  Every country and every trading bloc wants and needs monetary stability.  Each country must reduce inflation, if economic growth and employment are to be sustained and increased.</P>
    <P>The debate on this has centred on the question of resource transfers.  Relatively little attention has been given to the actual functioning of the system&mdash;or the domestic conditions necessary for our successful participation in it.  Ireland's case for transfers is good, indeed unique, and is widely accepted by our partners in Europe.  However, I think that it is no harm for us here now to look at some of the other factors which could determine how the new system will affect us.  These considerations apply whether or not we are in that system&mdash;because the fact that the system exists means that there is a new economic climate within which we must operate.  We sell about three-quarters of our exports to the other member countries of the EEC&mdash; including the United Kingdom and it is in those markets that the effects of <Col N="1600" /> monetary stability will be felt.  Whether or not we are in the system, we will be affected by it: and we must look to those areas in which we are likely to be most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>The first concerns our rate of inflation. This year it will probably be in or about the European average.  At that level it is just under one-third of what it was three years ago.  The improvement has been brought about, in part, by cheaper imports resulting from admittedly, the appreciation in the value of sterling.  But it has also been brought about, in part, by our own efforts.  Unfortunately, these efforts have not been sufficient.  When we were drawing up our programmes for 1978 we looked to a certain level of increase in wage incomes. That has been significantly surpassed with the consequence that the rate of price increases here is now higher than it need be.  Whether or not we are in the new monetary system it will be one of the prime objectives of Government to reduce inflation so as to make employment secure and to guarantee the real value of wages and other incomes. We must start now to think in terms of continental levels of increases&mdash;2 or 3 per cent a year, and continental levels of development and prosperity.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a second major consideration. We can argue forever here and in other fora about whether increases in incomes generate price increases or price increases call forth demands for higher incomes.  This debate is sterile and has no place in the world in which we are living.  The major powers in Europe are now firmly committed to the reduction of inflation and to the creation of monetary stability.  In these conditions, whether or not we enter the new system, the concept of two digit increases in incomes is obsolete&mdash;or worse.  It is a recipe for national disaster. In their approach, therefore, to the question of income increases in the coming year the Government will be basing their strategy on the objective of securing increases which are at or very close to the increase in productivity in the economy as a whole.  It is a basic truth that to the extent that we depart from this standard, we increase prices and throw people out of jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> There is one further consideration. Within a Europe which is drawing ever closer together it will be vital for us to counteract the disability which distance from the centre imposes on this country. We must improve our transport and communications networks.  We must expand and modernise our industrial infrastructure. The changes which the Government made on coming to office were designed specifically to achieve these ends.  We have orientated the taxation system so as to remove disincentives to investment and enterprise.  We have increased public investment.  In fact, we have now reached the point where the level of investment, both public and private, in this country is among the highest in Europe.  The rates of economic growth we have attained are laying the foundation for a future in which all our people can find worthwhile work in their own country.</P>
    <P>What I want to stress in all this is the degree to which we must rely on our own efforts.  I have listened to Opposition speakers here during the past few days make the case for additional transfers to Ireland.  Transfers are, indeed, necessary&mdash;and the basis on which we founded our case in an EMS context is sound.  But the essential point is that the primary responsibility for our wellbeing rests here on our own shoulders and within these shores.  As has been said time and again, no matter how strong is our case for transfers in the event of our joining the EMS no country owes us a living&mdash;that is a matter for ourselves to work out.  And it is on the level of intelligence, efficiency and commitment of the Irish people that the future of the Irish nation rests.  It is in this belief, and on these principles, that the Government's strategy for the future is based.</P>
    <P>I have backed up with figures and comparisons the outline of improvement in employment, in economic development, in GNP and in reduced inflation. This improvement indicates an excellent rate of progress.  However, percentage increases are not enough in themselves. We must always remember the low base from which we started, and this low base was contributed to immeasurably by the neglect of the Coalition and especially <Col N="1602" /> by their failure in the winter months of 1974 and in the early spring of 1975 to take the kind of action that would have enabled us to recover more quickly from the recession and to take off more buoyantly and more effectively once that recession had ended.  Unfortunately, the benches opposite are almost empty.  This Government took the steps that were necessary, and now we are on the move, but we must not expect too much too quickly especially in terms of wage increases. It is on our efforts and our restraint in certain areas and on our commitment to the improvement of the economy and to the value of living in our own country that our future will depend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of this party I express my agreement with one of the central points in the Taoiseach's address, that is, that the elimination of involuntary unemployment will remain the principle objective of the Government. We agree heartily with that objective. Undoubtedly the greatest waste that can occur in any country is waste of human time and human talent.  The fact that such waste is occurring here on a scale higher than is the case in most other European countries must be a matter of prime concern not only for the Government but for all of us here.  We must realise, too, that this waste will not be eliminated by any magic solution.  In May and June of 1977 some people may have believed there was an easy way to solve this problem, but the only way in which unemployment will be eliminated is if we have the ability to produce and sell competitively both on the home and on foreign markets.  Also, we must use our capital resources to the maximum effect in order to achieve employment. In all discussions relating to our economic performance we must have regard to those two pointers of our success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate to consider what has happened in terms of performance since Fianna Fáil were returned to office.  As this is the closing debate of the 1978 calendar year we must consider especially what happened during this year. There are five major areas in which the Government's performance can be judged.  First, let us take exports.  The <Col N="1603" /> volume of our exports for this year is little more than half what was achieved in 1977&mdash;18 per cent as against 30 per cent, a significant drop.  The figures I have given are in value terms, but obviously the growth in exports in volume terms has been approximately 10 per cent or even less.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the amount that the Government are spending by way of budget deficit in order to achieve these objectives has doubled in 1978 compared with the previous year.  In other words, they are spending more than they are taking in but are not achieving their objectives. This is a matter of grave concern.  The external debt of the Government is now £150 million more than it was in July 1977.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, apparently the best terms that this Government have been able to negotiate in respect of our entry into the EMS&mdash;although we await further intelligence on this&mdash;are such that our external debt will be doubled approximately if the full facilities are to be taken up.  As I said yesterday, this is a matter of serious concern from the long-term point of view of this country for a number of reasons.  First of all, it reduces our control as a debtor nation over our own economic policy-making.  Secondly, the interest payments, which will be very substantial on such external debt, will not be subject to Irish income tax and, therefore, will not be capable of being recouped to the extent or in the same way as would interest payments on domestic debts.  Therefore, the Government's contribution so far seems set fair almost to double our national external debt.  Thirdly, if one adjusts inflation to eliminate from the calculations for 1978 the effect of the once-off removal of rates from houses, our rate of inflation in 1978 is likely to be 9 per cent as against 8 per cent in the UK.  For as long as we are in the one currency area it is not possible for any major divergence to take place between our rate of inflation and that in the other country with whom we are linked in currency.  However, any divergence is an indicator of the relative health of the two economies within the same system.  The adjustment which I mentioned, which is a once-off matter, <Col N="1604" /> does not indicate any underlying improvement in our competitive position.  It is merely transferring resources from one pocket to another.  The fact that our rate of inflation is running faster by this extent than the UK rate of inflation is a clear measure of the effectiveness in this area of the policy of our Government <i>vis-à-vis</i> that of our neighbour country.</P>
    <P>Next, in relation to the matter that I mentioned first, the reduction of unemployment, the Government are clearly off target.  It is stated clearly in page 9 of their election manifesto that they sought a reduction of 5,000 in the number of unemployed in 1977 and a further reduction of 20,000 up to the end of 1978.  That should mean, given the rate of 112,000 unemployed in July 1977 when this Government took office, that unemployment, if the targets set out in the manifesto had been achieved, would now stand at 87,000.  Unemployment is at or about 98,000.  The Government have gone barely half-way in the period so far in achieving their own stated objective in terms of reduction in unemployment.</P>
    <P>These failures which I have indicated can be traced directly to the policies which the Government themselves adopted in taking office in 1977 and subsequently in their budget of 1978.  In the first place these policies involved the raising of expectations, and the creation, prior to the 1977 election, of the idea that all that was needed to solve our problems, in the short-term at least, was to spend, spend, spend.  When they got in, that is what they did.  They pumped money into our economy on a very considerable scale.  This pumping into the economy of money at that time was described by one member of the Government as the biggest gamble in the nation's history.  In view of the indices that I have quoted&mdash;the fall in the growth of exports, the increase in budget deficit, the increase in external debt, our relatively poor rate of inflation compared with the UK and our failure to reach the Government's employment targets&mdash;is it not time to ask whether this, the biggest gamble in our nation's history, is going to come off?  As a result of this gamble there was an unprecedented consumer boom and the <Col N="1605" /> two detrimental results of this were, firstly, a substantial relative increase in imports over exports, and secondly, very much increased speculative profits to the detriment of the consumer.</P>
    <P>I will illustrate the comparison I have made in relation to imports over exports. Where did the money go that the Government pumped into our economy to generate this consumer boom?  It went abroad in relatively larger measure than it stayed at home.  Retail sales in 1978 have increased in volume by 10 per cent but imports at the same time have increased in volume by between 12.5 per cent and 14.5 per cent.  If imports have increased by that scale it is likely that domestic sales have increased by less than the average of 10 per cent. Relatively speaking, this pump-priming exercise, because of its undifferentiated nature, did not take account of the sectors of our economy where pump-priming was specifically needed.  The Government adopted what could be described as a macro-economic approach where they should have applied a micro-economic approach.  The result was that this money which was pumped into our economy with a view to creating employment is, relatively speaking, making a greater contribution to creating employment abroad in countries selling goods to the Irish economy than it is in creating employment in this country.</P>
    <P>Secondly, this led to speculation and profit-taking by groups in our economy who are best placed to do so.  I can best indicate this by reference to the situation in the housing sector.  In the first six months of this year as against the first six months of last year, as a result of the Government's £1,000 grant and other measures intended to promote housing developments being in the form that they were, the cost of a house to somebody buying one has increased by three times as much as the cost of a house to the man who is building it.  Clearly, the money being used with a view to creating improvement in housing is not being used to assist the consumer, the person who is buying a house, but it goes into the pockets of builders or other people in that sector.  In the first six months of 1978 as against the first six months of 1977 building costs are up by <Col N="1606" /> only 10 per cent, whereas the cost of a house to somebody seeking to buy one has gone up by 33 per cent.  Those figures just do not add up unless there have been very substantial speculative profits.  The £1,000 grant served no other purpose than to provide money for those engaged in the building industry without improving the position to any appreciable extent of those seeking houses.</P>
    <P>I contend also that the spend, spend, spend approach characteristic of the Government's economic policy in 1977 contributed to the fact that wages, salaries and incomes generally during 1978 ran far ahead of increased production in our economy and is contributing also to a significant reduction in our competitive position.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this stage to remind the Government of what they thought they would achieve in this context in 1978, as indicated by the Minister for Finance in his budget statement of February last.  I shall quote extensively from the Minister for Finance on that occasion.  I shall leave it to the House and the country to compare the performance in this context with what the Minister hoped would happen, as expressed in his budget statement, when he said, at column 357 of the Official Report of 1 February 1978:</P>
    <P>The Government believe that improvements in real incomes are best secured in present circumstances through moderate increases in nominal incomes associated with personal tax concessions.  For the year 1978 our target is to pay increases of about 5 per cent.  To make this acceptable, we have already reduced or abolished rates, motor taxation and social insurance contributions and are proposing concessions in personal taxation&mdash;concessions which will result in substantial gains in after-tax pay for wage and salary earners.  Adjusting for the expected rise in consumer prices this year, there will be a considerable improvement in real take-home pay, and this will be a lasting improvement, not an illusory one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1607" /> The Minister continued to say, at columns 357 and 358:</P>
    <P>I should like to clarify aspects of the pay target proposed by the Government.  The target was formulated</P>
    <P>&mdash;this is a target of 5 per cent&mdash;</P>
    <P>only after careful and detailed examinations of the requirements of the economy in both the short- and medium-term.  Demands for flexibility and for adjustments in line with inflation have to accommodate themselves to the need for pay moderation.  The Government's commitment is unequivocal and, if agreement to such moderation cannot be achieved, we shall have to take the necessary measures to ensure that excessive increases, if any, are recovered from those who secure them.  The Government would be failing the community if they did not take such steps.</P>
    <P>What happened?  In fact the increase was not 5 per cent.  The total increase in wages and salaries in 1978 is expected to rise by 18 per cent.  The result of that has been identified by the Central Bank as a significant loss in competitiveness for our exports abroad.  The Government set out to achieve a 5 per cent target.  By virtue of their failure in political leadership, by virtue of what has been described in this House on many previous occasions as the anti-social nature of many of their policies, far from achieving the 5 per cent which the Minister for Finance so trenchantly insisted would have to be achieved, they had an 18 per cent increase, which is over three times as much as they had hoped.  Of course the result of this has been a loss in our competitive position.  The fact that imports are running ahead of exports in our economy in 1978 is a direct result of this failure of Government economic policy. The fact that such a wage agreement was negotiated stemmed directly from the raised expectations created during 1977.  The impression was given at that time that the money was there for the asking.  There was money there to abolish rates, to abolish motor tax. <Col N="1608" /> Naturally then the workers, through their negotiators, ask why should there not be money available to give them significant increases in real incomes?  On the one hand the Government were saying that the money was there for one purpose but that it was not there for another.  And it is not any great wonder that they were not believed.</P>
    <P>If we are to succeed as an economy we must ensure that we remain competitive and that increases in incomes do not run ahead of those in real economic production.  This will not be achieved simply by talking about it.  It will not be achieved by speeches being made in this House or elsewhere.  It will be achieved only by consistent political leadership on the part of the Government.  There is no use hoping, as the Government seem to do in their White Paper on the Economic and Monetary System, that, in some magical way&mdash;perhaps by becoming members of the Economic and Monetary System&mdash;our income increase problems, in so far as they exceed production increases, will be solved magically.  The Government say that furthermore the discipline involved in membership of a zone of monetary stability acts as a powerful aid in the fight against inflation.  That discipline will take place only if there is concerted leadership from the Government.  It will not take place automatically unless, of course, the Government envisage that the discipline to flow from membership of the EMS is that of further unemployment. I do not think that would be acceptable to anyone.</P>
    <P>My criticism of the Government at present is that they are not taking steps that should now be taken to achieve a moderate national wage agreement in 1979.  This was most evident in the negotiations for entry to the EMS.  These were complex negotiations, in many cases directly affecting the potential livelihood of workers in industries vulnerable to appreciation of our currency <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling.  Did the Government attempt to take on the social partners?  Did they attempt to take the unions representing the workers in those industries into their confidence in the EMS negotiations?  They did not even give them accurate information as to <Col N="1609" /> what was happening in those negotiations. They made no attempt to assess the likely impact on particular sectors of our economy of our becoming members of the EMS.  There was no taking into the confidence of the Government of the trade unions, the employers or the other sectors of our economy in these negotiations, as there should have been.  If we are expecting as apparently the Government are in their White Paper, that discipline will occur automatically as a result of our becoming members of the EMS, we are bound to be sadly disillusioned. Discipline will occur only if the Government show their earnest progressive social policies and by taking those involved on both sides of industry into their confidence in negotiations taking place.  It is through those means only that discipline will be achieved voluntarily. Discipline cannot be achieved externally, as the Government seem to think, simply by joining a system or by making speeches.  Discipline will be achieved only by conscious policy.</P>
    <P>I wonder are the Government actively seeking a national wage agreement at all at this stage.  Indeed, if we do not get a national wage agreement, the consequences in terms of industrial unrest will be immeasurable.  The Taoiseach has referred to this already, pointing out, rightly, that the actual number of days lost does not fully represent the position, because the days lost in Irish industry have been in strategic areas of our economy which cause widespread hardship.  One cannot measure those simply and solely in terms of days lost; one must measure them in their overall economic context.  There is no doubt in my mind that the strikes that have been taking place in our economy since the present Government assumed office have been far more damaging in overall economic terms than one might expect from the average type of strike that takes place across Europe.  If we do not get a national wage agreement, if there is no discipline at all in this situation, obviously the strike situation will worsen from its already unacceptably bad state. The Government should be taking positive action, in the form of the consultations I have mentioned and taking the social partners into their confidence, <Col N="1610" /> to achieve the moderate wage agreement necessary for the success of our exports and economy.</P>
    <P>The lecturing posture they are adopting will not suffice for this object. There is great need to strengthen the position of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and I very much regret that the whole area of industrial relations has been shelved by the Government in their establishment of an industrial relations commission.  This body will not, I gather, issue any interim reports and we may wait for a very long time for a report, during which period industrial relations will continue in their present bad state without any legislative action being taken.  Far from awaiting the report of this commission, a commission set up, it seems to me, as a delaying tactic to avoid the taking of difficult decisions, the Government should now be considering entering into consultation with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to see what can be done in an overall structural sense to improve the climate of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I believe, too, the international credibility of the Government's economic policy is more important now than it ever was in the history of the State.  Hitherto it was possible for Governments to behave in their economic policy with reference only to domestic political considerations.  It was possible for them to have election budgets and to have artificial injections of money into the economy at particular times, when it suited them politically, without reference to the economic needs of the country.  This will no longer be possible.  From now on the international credibility of our Government's economic policy will be of critical importance for two reasons: first of all, because it now looks as if our foreign debt will, as I said, be doubled and, if it is doubled over its present high level as a result of the terms of entry to the EMS, that will mean that the Government's finance will be coming to a far greater extent from abroad and the bankers of the world will have a much closer eye than hitherto on the policies of the Government.  The Government will, therefore, have to take account of their views.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" /> Furthermore, if as now seems likely, we are to have an independent currency in the context of the EMS and if we are to stay within the bands of relativity <i>vis-à-vis</i> the central currency in the EMS, again we will have to take account of possible speculation against our currency and so the Government's economic policy will have to be such as will command confidence both on the part of those who are lending the Government money and those who may or may not be in a position to buy and sell our currency in the international exchange markets.  The first essential then on the part of any Government for a credible economic policy internationally must be that it be consistent.</P>
    <P>I believe the policy of the Government falls on its face in so far as consistency is concerned.  There has been no consistency whatsoever in the Government's economic policy.  The Government are pursuing a diametrically opposite policy in the latter half of 1978 to that which they pursued during 1977.  In 1977 there was money to abolish road tax.  In 1978 there is no money to maintain the roads even at a minimum standard of safety. In 1977 there was money to abolish domestic rates regardless of the size of the houses.  In 1978 there is not apparently, if the Government's pronouncements and flag waving are to be taken into account, money to maintain food subsidies and, remember, food constitutes a far greater proportion of the budget of the poorest section of the community than it does of the budget of any other section.</P>
    <P>Now these are manifestly inconsistent policies.  In 1977 there was money for anything.  In 1978 there is apparently money for nothing.  Can we expect people abroad to have confidence in a Government whose policies are so inconsistent and who seem to be operating what one could describe as a zig-zag economic policy, this way this year and another way next year?  I do not believe people abroad can have confidence in such a Government and I believe the Government must mend their ways if we are to achieve international credibility and confidence in Government consistency and belief in the seriousness so <Col N="1612" /> essential to the survival of the economy, not only in the EMS but also in the competitive world in which we are now living.</P>
    <P>I have so far been concerned with what I regard as the failings of the Government's economic policy with reference to a number of indicators.  I now propose to make suggestions which I believe the Government should take into account in an effort to improve its economic policy.  The priority for any economic policy must be the creation of employment and that will only be done if, on the one hand, we can produce and sell competitively abroad and, on the other hand, use the capital resources of our economy to maximum efficiency in terms of employment creation.  There are a number of areas where action can be taken to improve the situation.  I will mention eight areas of action.  First of all, I would like to see the Government take action on the private investment trust suggestion made in the Green Paper published by the National Coalition Government.  This was a novel idea designed to bring together private and public capital, to bring together what one could describe as a joint enterprise to establish new product ideas.  For instance, where the technical expertise might exist in one firm and the capital might exist in another there would be created some means of bringing the two together in a private non-governmental union without undue bureaucratic interference. That idea should be put into effect.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we must seek to maximise the use of our existing capital stock by the encouragement of renting of such capital stock.  At the moment too much of our capital lies underutilised because of the strict emphasis on owner occupancy. I believe this policy can be achieved in three major areas.  First of all, it can be achieved in the encouragement of greater long-term leasing of land.  There is room too for such a policy in the area of fishing where boats are invariably skippered by one individual with the result that they stay in port for two out of three days whereas, if there were emphasis on renting, it would be possible to have two skippers and two crews and the boats could stay at sea for <Col N="1613" /> a substantially longer period.  There is need also for greater encouragement of renting in housing.  Much of our housing stock is underutilised because renting terms are unattractive.  The Government should take a look at this whole area to see what can be done to achieve its housing objectives by increasing utilisation of our existing housing stock as well as by improving the output of new houses.</P>
    <P>There is need also to examine the grant and tax incentive package to industry to see if it puts an undue emphasis on capital intensive industry to the detriment of labour intensive industry, the creation of employment being the optimum objective of Government policy and, if such industry is competitive, is it more desirable than capital intensive industry if it can survive and remain competitive.</P>
    <P>Taking on the one hand that grants are given as a proportion of the total cost of investment rather than of the new industrial jobs created by the IDA, on the other hand there are very substantial incentives to industry in the form of relief of income tax for interest payments on debt, and these two combined, to create an incentive to invest in substantial blocks of capital for the creation of new industries rather than the creation of new jobs, involve an artificial element&mdash;one cannot put a figure on how high this is&mdash;which is partial to the creation of capital intensive rather than labour intensive industries.  This area should be examined in a critical fashion by the Government.  The overall package of incentives to industry, both grant and tax, should be studied in order to distinguish such an artificial element in incentives and to remove it.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is a strong case for a much more serious approach to manpower planning in the economy to ensure that we will get the best possible return for investment designed to create employment.  There is no point in making substantial investments to create a type of job in which people are not interested and for which there is not sufficient demand, while neglecting other areas of the economy where people are seeking but cannot get employment.  We have been pumping in money and hoping that in some magical way it will <Col N="1614" /> reach those who need it and create jobs for those who need them.  That is not the right approach.  Any injection of money into the economy for job creation must be based on a thorough analysis of our available manpower and must be directed towards the employment of that manpower.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we need a much more detailed analysis of the live register to find out where the unemployed are, who they are, what skills they have, how available for work they are, and having done that we should draw up an action plan to find jobs for those specific unemployed people.  We must think of them as people with skills, people with homes, people living in particular parts of the country, and having identified them as individuals, we must then try to provide jobs for them rather than persisting with the macro-economic policy approach of pumping in money in the hope that by some formula it will reach those who need jobs.  Heretofore, under the macro-economic system, a substantial portion of the money given to housing ended up not in new houses but in increased profits for builders without commensurate increases in housing activity.</P>
    <P>Our whole educational system needs to be examined from a manpower point of view.  There is a need for a central manpower planning unit in the Department of Education to examine the entire output of the educational system at second and third levels to see if our educational system is producing the type of people for the types of jobs that are likely to come into being in our economy.  Increasingly, it is Government money more than anything else that is involved in our educational system, and there is no use spending substantial amounts of Government money educating people in skills for which the economy does not have any use, while on the other hand there are many skills in our economy which are scarce.</P>
    <P>We therefore need a central manpower planning unit involving not just the Department of Education but also that of Labour so that in so far as State funds are concerned&mdash;people are entitled to do what they wish with fees contributed by them for educational purposes&mdash;the money will be spent with the <Col N="1615" /> primary purpose of having people coming out of our educational system who will be able to find jobs.  We must ensure that our job creation and educational programmes will be synchronised.  I would describe this as a micro-economic approach and it is the right one at this time.  The time for the broad ranging Keynesian approach has gone out the window.  We are an open economy and much of the benefit of a Keynesian pump-priming effort in our economy goes abroad because we are so open to trading abroad.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a need for reclassification of our capital budget.  At the moment, projects which are directly productive and projects in the capital area which are not productive at all are classified together as capital projects.  A hierarchy should be established by our capital budget with priority being given to Government capital investment which has a directly productive effect.</P>
    <P>In the concluding portion of my contribution I shall now deal with agriculture.  I regret that there are five major items in the Government's election manifesto in relation to agriculture which remain unimplemented.  I will just mention the items which have not been implemented.  First of all, there was a promise to establish a national livestock development programme.  Apparently that has not been heard of.  Second, there was a promise to establish a grain marketing and information board.  It has not been heard of.  Third, there was a promise to introduce a potato marketing and development board.  It has not been heard of.  Fourth, we had a promise to introduce a 3 per cent subsidy on interest rates in an expanded capital development programme.  That has not been introduced.  Fifth, there was a promise to establish a new body to supplement and co-ordinate the activities of the existing agricultural marketing organisation.  This new body has not appeared and there is not a sign that it will.</P>
    <P>There are many areas in regard to agricultural policy which need urgent Government attention.  First of all, there is significant evidence that our beef herd is declining rapidly and that our capacity to avail of opportunities in the years <Col N="1616" /> ahead for sales of beef is being reduced. There has been an increase in our dairy herd but it has been at the expense of our beef herd in which there has not been an overall increase in numbers.  There is an urgent need to introduce a scheme along the lines of the in-calf heifer subsidy scheme to give a direct incentive to increase our beef herd numbers.</P>
    <P>If we cannot and do not increase our beef herd numbers now the cattle will not be there for export and for the provision of jobs in our meat factories throughout 1979, 1980 and 1981.  It appears to me that as well as the increase which is apparently taking place in heifers being put in calf of 7,000 this year, to make up for the losses through cow slaughters we would need to have an increase of 50,000, not 7,000 heifers in-calf this year.  The figure given recently by the Minister of State is quite inadequate to compensate for the loss through slaughter.  I therefore call on the Government urgently to introduce an in-calf heifer subsidy scheme.</P>
    <P>There is great scope for the export of malting barley particularly as we know that there were some exports of malting barley last year to Germany.  If the Government had established as promised the grain marketing information board I think that body would or should now be seeking increased markets for malting barley abroad so that we could use the land that is being vacated by the declining numbers in the beef herds&mdash;that is another area where action should be taken urgently.</P>
    <P>We also need to look at the composition of our sheep flock.  There is evidence that the decline in lowland sheep numbers has been such that there is undue concentration in the overall flock on mountain breeds.  In so far as the terms of the French lamb agreement are a determinant factor&mdash;and they are because much of our lamb is going to France&mdash;these mountain breeds alone are not likely, if crossed with one another rather than crossed with a lowland breed, to produce the type of animal that will meet the strict criteria which exist for admission to the French market.  I therefore urge a special incentive scheme for the use of these cheviot <Col N="1617" /> breeds, for instance, on these mountainsides.</P>
    <P>I believe there are great prospects for improvement in meat processing and processing of meat and food in general to a much greater extent than has been the case so far.  One of the bottlenecks in the meat industry is the training of sufficiently skilled personnel for this purpose. One of the reasons for the bottleneck is that we have the Department of Agriculture on one hand dealing with the meat industry itself and the Department of Education on the other dealing with the educational institutions such as regional technical colleges.  The Government should take action&mdash;the Ministers for Agriculture and Education together&mdash;to establish a meat industry training scheme to provide the type of skilled personnel necessary if we are to get added value in our meat industry and in other processing industries of the type that will enable us to maximise profit in this country from our important agricultural production.</P>
    <P>The last part of my address is concerned with the remarks made by the Taoiseach in regard to Northern Ireland. I agree with the emphasis that has been put on an agreed settlement.  I also agree with the emphasis on practical co-operation, but as Deputy Harte pointed out in an interjection during the Taoiseach's address there seems to be little actually happening in terms of co-operation between North and South.  There have been proposals, talks and studies but very little, if anything, is actually happening on the ground.  I contend that there are two areas where action could be taken immediately.  One is in the area of drainage.  There is money available from the EEC and we can see how quickly it could be put into use in the west of Ireland under that heading. Money is also available for cross-Border drainage.  The Government could be doing much more to drain those river catchments which cover both sides of the Border.  I also believe that there is a need for a joint training scheme in agriculture involving young farmers on both sides of the Border which would enable southern students to attend Northern Ireland agricultural colleges and northern students to attend southern <Col N="1618" /> agricultural colleges.  Such a scheme could be introduced very quickly if the Government had the will to do it.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one sentence in the Taoiseach's speech which I think requires to be clarified.  He said:</P>
    <P>There is no place in our plans for unity by force or for any instantly imposed solution.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach does not envisage any instantly imposed solutions does he envisage a solution imposed in some way other than instantly?  The fact that the idea of an imposed solution had to be qualified by using the adverb &ldquo;instantly&rdquo; is to my mind an equivocation on the Taoiseach's part in respect of an important matter.  The Taoiseach should clarify his position in that regard.  He should make it clear that he does not intend to use coercion in relation to a solution for Northern Ireland either instantly or otherwise.  The fact that he thought it necessary to insert that adverb is to my mind a matter of concern which should not be so left for long and which should be clarified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to two matters in the Taoiseach's speech. The Taoiseach began his speech in a very crowing way about the Government's performance in regard to job creation.  The whole matter of unemployment and the large numbers who are unemployed has become, as far as the Government are concerned, a matter more of distorting the reality of unemployment than of any genuine progressive plan to end unemployment.  I shall give two illustrations of what I mean.  We hear the Government at all times talking about job creation.  The use of that phrase is not accidental; it is meant to distort, to present a picture that is not accurate.  It is meant to confuse the people in regard to the Government's performance in putting people into employment and reducing the live register of unemployed, which they are committed to do according to their manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here are two illustrations: in June 1977 the figure on the live register was approximately 108,000; it stands today at approximately 98,000 and in the <Col N="1619" /> meantime in excess of 14,000 people have emigrated.  That is one illustration of the Government's failure in regard to employment and their commitment in regard to it.</P>
    <P>The other illustration is the use by the Government and its spokesmen of the term &ldquo;jobs created&rdquo;.  That bubble was burst by Deputy Horgan in a question to the Minister responsible regarding the number of jobs created in State and semi-State bodies and the number of jobs filled&mdash;two different and distinct things.  I cannot remember the precise date but the answer given early in November was to the effect that of the jobs the Government claimed had been created less than two thirds had actually been filled.  So, it is farcical for the Taoiseach to say, as he said in his opening remarks, that the Government have been successful in regard to their commitment to reduce the live register and put more people to work.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the Taoiseach's concern about my statement regarding the danger to the operation of the common agricultural policy.  It is a danger that has been made even more of a possibility by the Government's mishandling of the EMS negotiations.  We all know that the Taoiseach himself stated in this House that he was aware&mdash;and we have read it in the paper and we have seen Mr. Callaghan in person on television talking about it&mdash;of the extreme dislike of the British Government for the operation of the common agricultural policy within the European Community.  They have in the past endeavoured to change the nature of that policy.  The Taoiseach this morning tried to imply that my own party, through its associations in Europe, are trying to change the operation of the common agricultural policy.  I state categorically that that is untrue.  The one representative that the Taoiseach left us in the European Parliament, Deputy Liam Kavanagh, has not only himself voted consistently to maintain the present operation of the common agricultural policy but, because of his contacts and membership of the largest and most influential political groupings in the European Parliament, has also <Col N="1620" /> been able to persuade other members of those groupings who may otherwise not have done so to support that point of view.</P>
    <P>What we have been critical of and what we will continue to be critical of is the way that this Government at national level refuse to redistribute to any degree the considerable monetary benefit that this country receives through the present operation of CAP. That we will continue to be critical of.</P>
    <P>It is only fair, since the Taoiseach raised this question, to comment on this. The Taoiseach, on behalf of this country, was in Europe seeking, through various mechanisms within the EEC, a transfer of resources from the richer parts of the Community to the poorer parts of which Ireland is one.  He was seeking a redistribution of the wealth within the Community.  Contrast that and his endeavours to achieve that in the context of the Community with his performance as Taoiseach and his Government's performance with regard to the redistribution of wealth within our own national community.  The Heads of Government of the member states in Europe know precisely what the attitude of the Taoiseach and that of his Government is with regard to the redistribution of wealth within our national community. They know and I believe act accordingly, that the Taoiseach cannot speak with any moral authority in Europe when he is seeking a transfer of resources from the richer to the poorer sections because one cannot practise one policy at home and, with any authority, at European level ask them for the operation of a policy contrary to the one which one is operating oneself. There is no doubt&mdash;and it has been stated clearly in publications by totally objective sources&mdash;that there has been an increase in the gap between the richer and the poorer sections within our national community since the Fianna Fáil Government came into power.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach was talking about the common agricultural policy, as is his wont he used words that he could not be nailed to in some future reference, but he clearly tried to imply that they were defending the operation of the common agricultural policy and it <Col N="1621" /> was in no danger, that they had sorted all that out at the summit.  That is what the Taoiseach tried to imply irrespective of what his exact words were.  There are two things that further add to my disquiet about the undermining of the operation of CAP as a result of the present mishandling and incompetence of the Government in the EMS negotiations. My belief is reinforced by two things.  One is that in the Taoiseach's speech this morning at page 9 where he states&mdash;and it is a clear indication of what is to come because this is the way Fianna Fáil operate:</P>
    <P>It has to be realised that farm increases of the magnitude of recent years will not be available in the future.</P>
    <P>That is a little throw-away line at the end of page 9 of the Taoiseach's speech, but it is very useful for future reference; he can refer to it.  But the Taoiseach did not tell us about the statement of Mr. Roy Jenkins, the President of the Commission, on the very night of the miserable failure at the summit meeting of 4 and 5 December.  On the very night on which that meeting broke up creating a disastrous situation for Ireland Mr. Roy Jenkins, who not only is the President of the Commission, but is also a former Chancellor of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom, said that at the very least farm prices in the coming year would have to be frozen and that the Commission would be putting forward the proposals for a review of the operation of the common agricultural policy.  I believe that the Taoiseach and the negotiating team has helped very considerably in the furtherance of Mr. James Callaghan's ambition to have a total review of the common agricultural policy, and there will be tremendous efforts made by this Government to ensure that if the inevitable has to happen it will not happen before 7 June of the coming year because that would affect their electoral chances on two fronts, both in local elections and in European elections.  There is no doubt that Mr. Callaghan's ambition in that direction has been strengthened very considerably by the mishandling and the incompetence <Col N="1622" /> of this Government in the EMS negotiations.</P>
    <P>Normally on an adjournment debate one would go through the various Departments and analyse possibly in some detail their operations.  I do not intend to go through the various Departments in any great detail but I will try to illustrate what I believe to be the truth.  I believe that Fianna Fáil are two things. They are, by their policy, by their philosophy and by their implementation of their policy&mdash;particularly since June 1977&mdash;a Tory Party; they can be accurately described as the Irish Tory Party.  Not only are they a Tory party but they are an incompetent Tory party at that.  They are both; they are both Tory and they are incompetent.  Their incompetence is not confined to the EMS negotiations.  That is just the issue that got the most publicity, was the most glaring and the most visible to the ordinary man or woman in the street.</P>
    <P>There are other areas where that incompetence is equally obvious if one looks for it.  We have only to look at what has happened to the Family Planning Bill.  We know that there can be difficulties within the Cabinet and the Fianna Fáil Party that may be delaying its publication.  It is very strange that over two years ago in this House and in the other House we were told by Fianna Fáil leading spokesmen, people who are now members of the Cabinet, that they had a Family Planning Bill ready and when they came into office they would implement it.  Now, we cannot even get the Bill circulated to Members of the Dáil.  I cannot understand how a Senator who is now a Minister could say that Fianna Fáil had this Bill ready and they knew precisely what they were going to do with regard to this particular problem in our society but 18 months after coming into office the Bill has not yet seen the light of day.  This is one aspect of their incompetence.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we had the Minister for Justice announcing that we would have a referendum on the position of adoptive parents.  This party have been advocating that for a long time.  That announcement was made by the Minister on behalf of Fianna Fáil 14 months after the Taoiseach had described the situation <Col N="1623" /> in relation to the validity of adoption orders as a matter of urgency.  God help the country if that is how they interpret urgency.  We have still pending the publication of the White Paper on the economy.  We were assured by Fianna Fáil that it would be available in early autumn.</P>
    <P>We are now engaged on the adjournment debate and we will be entering into a budget debate in the near future.  We have had a series of discussions and announcements of the EMS.  The production of a White Paper would have been a very valuable input, even if it was inadequate, in discussions on the economy. Where is it?  It has not emerged yet.  This is a further indication of the incompetence of the Government.  It may be that due to the Exchequer crisis which is now facing the Government, and the very uncomplimentary reception that the Green Paper got from nearly all sections, that we have not had a White Paper.  It was promised, like the other things that were promised, and the Government have not got around to producing it.  There are ample illustrations, if one looks for them, of their incompetence.</P>
    <P>We also have the old Fianna Fáil ploy in which things have to be confused.  If things are going bad you must make sure that you muddy the water, try to confuse the electorate, have them wondering who is saying the right thing and if you get enough Ministers saying conflicting things the people will not know who is saying the right thing.  This is a very successful pioy if one does not take serious matters too seriously, which they apparently do not.</P>
    <P>We have the question of job creation in which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development&mdash;the Taoiseach told us this again this morning&mdash;have been telling us how successful their employment policy has been.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, wherever he is hiding himself, emerged six weeks ago at some dinner and he at least came out openly and said that as far as the youth employment programme was concerned it was a total failure.  This is a senior Minister in the <Col N="1624" /> Fianna Fáil Government who made this statement at a public function.  The Taoiseach came in this morning and tried to convince us otherwise.  The Minister also said at that same gathering that the job targets of the Government would not be reached.  He has been very right on both counts, because the youth employment programme has been a total failure and there is no doubt that as far as the unemployed people in the country are concerned the Fianna Fáil strategy of relying almost exclusively on private enterprise to provide jobs after giving massive handouts to do this, has also proved to be a complete failure.</P>
    <P>When one subtracts 98,000 from 108,000, which was the unemployment figure on the live rigister in June 1977, one gets a figure of 10,000.  This would appear to be an improvement with 10,000 more people in employment, but one has to take into account that over 14,000 people have left the country since, so the question of jobs is not a very happy one.</P>
    <P>We could go on in great detail about various aspects of Government policy, but I said at the beginning that I only wanted to prove two things.  I wanted to prove that Fianna Fáil are Tory, that they are pursuing Tory policies and they are not even doing it in a competent manner.  I would like to prove what I am saying because it is not a political charge.  I ask the House and the people of the country to answer this question. What does this add up to?  Abolition of wealth tax in a society which has approximately 25 per cent of the population living in the poverty area, an adjustment in capital gains tax, a cut-back in local authority housing and spending in general, a proposal to remove food subsidies, a proposal to tax children's allowances and a proposal contained in the Green Paper to cut back on education&mdash;one could go on and on but it all adds up to the same thing.  The similarity between the policies that are being implemented by Fianna Fáil and the proposals that are being put forward by the British Tory Party are there for all to see.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are hiding behind the name of which the literal translation would appear to be the soldiers of <Col N="1625" /> destiny but I am glad that, despite the repercussions of their policies, it is beginning to become crystal clear just what Fianna Fáil stand for.  Unfortunately, there has not been any natural political development in this country.  This has been due to a number of factors but that situation must come to an end with the realisation on the part of the electorate that there are two types of parties in politics.  There is the type represented by the policies pursued by Fianna Fáil, policies that will help the exploiter, while there are socialist policies such as are advocated by this party and which will seek to help and protect the exploited. The division is very sharp but hopefully it will become clearer to the people as to how important it is for them and for their future development and quality of life, that the distinction is made.  By definition capitalist parties protect and further the profit-making interests of capitalists.  The capitalist system is built on and fed by profits, sometimes exorbitant profits.  The kind of legislation that we have had from Fianna Fáil since June 1977 has been of a kind that is orientated totally towards the wealthy and influential sections of the community at the expense of both the lower-and the middle-income groups.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Taoiseach told us that we must start now to think in terms of continental levels of price increases of 2 or 3 per cent per year and of continental levels of development and prosperity. We are a European country but we must realise that the level of development and prosperity in some of the other EEC countries has not been achieved by accident. Some of our European partners are small countries, not unlike our own and, like us, are dependent mainly on agriculture.  So far as social and economic issues are concerned their development can be attributed to some extent to their geographical location on the continent but we must remember too that they have been through the Second World War and have known extended periods of occupation.  However, their levels of development and prosperity and their levels of social services right across the board are due in large measure to their having either socialist governments or large influential socialist parties.  That <Col N="1626" /> is what accounts for the level of development to which the Taoiseach aspires for this country.  But it is a level of development that can never be achieved by the Irish people so long as they continue to support capitalist parties.  The only way that the continental type of development can be achieved is by the utilisation of our resources, not for the benefit of some individual or group of individuals but for the welfare of the majority of the people.  If the Irish people realise that at the ballot box they vote against their own interests when they vote for a capitalist government, we can have some hope for the future.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow this House adjourns for the Christmas recess.  The coming season is one of festivity, especially for children.  We are not a poor nation in the context of the nations of the world but yet 25 per cent of our population are living in poverty.  This represents about 750,000 citizens in this Christian society of whom at least 300,000 are children. The situation may not appear to be dramatic because we do not see on television, for instance, pictures of children with swollen bellies.  In other words, these children are not starving but they are hungry, some of them hungry perpetually.  They are badly clothed, poorly educated and live in bad housing conditions.  There is no future for them in the society we have built. Some of the reaction that we get by way of vandalism, some of the acts that inspired the Government to establish Loughan House has been due to a realisation on the part of these children that they are born into poverty, that they are condemned to a life of poverty and that they are eliminated from the society we have created.  But there is an alternative to that type of society and we can create this alternative from our own resources.  In this way we can create a more just, a more equitable and a more caring society but this can be done only by a political party who are prepared to pursue socialist policies that will bring about an equitable redistribution of our existing wealth and will result in the development of our resources in the interests of all our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the <Col N="1627" /> Taoiseach's speech this morning on the adjournment and I note the tremendous progress made in the course of the year in the development of our economy and in the fight against unemployment.  It is difficult to tie in Deputy Cluskey's figures of 108,000 on the live register in June 1977 and 98,000 for December 1978.  Of course he knows very well he is not comparing like with like.  No one being reasonable about the situation would compare a June figure with a December figure.  However, it is hardly necessary to go very far in refuting his allegations because the Taoiseach at the beginning of his speech has made clear the development which has taken place in employment, and the people are very well aware of it.  The overall net increase in employment is expected to be 77,000, the largest year on year increase in the last 30 years.  This is probably the most relevant and realistic figure that any of us can have regard to and it is 1.7 times the highest previous recorded net increase of any earlier year.  It is not necessary to go much further into that because statistics in the numbers of school leavers who have come on to the market since June 1977 would alone provide material for a debate.  I noticed that Deputy Cluskey in mentioning the figures for 1977 chose a period just before very large numbers of new students came on to the market.  However, this aspect has been well covered early in the Taoiseach's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey tried to tie the Fianna Fáil Party in with the British Tory Party and to suggest that, because the British Tory Party are now proposing some policies which are similar to Fianna Fáil policies, Fianna Fáil are a Tory party.  Both the Tory Party and the Labour Party in England have in recent times been copying policies introduced by Fianna Fáil in the election period which are aimed at increasing and stimulating the economy and at reaching the levels of growth and increase in employment which we have been seeking. It is only natural that not only these parties but various others around Europe and elsewhere have a very considerable interest in the strategies and <Col N="1628" /> policies which have been adopted in Ireland to reactivate our economy and to get the country moving again: However, I do not intend to become unduly involved in these at this stage.  In my contribution I hope to deal with our relations with the European Economic Community, with some housing matters, and finally with a matter pertaining to education.</P>
    <P>Concerning the EEC, three major areas arise.  One of these is the EMS which has been debated at great length in recent days.  The second is the direct elections to the European Parliament, and the third is the question of the enlargement of the EEC.  All of these three are inter-related in the overall concept of the development of Europe in this respect.  Whether one is for or against the EMS is an important indicator of commitment to the future development of Europe.  We are committed to the development of Europe and we have been quite clear-cut in our approach in that respect.  This is something in the debate on the EMS that people have not really referred to very much, but it is very important that enlargement would proceed at a reasonable pace.  In this respect it is related particularly to Greece and also to Spain and Portugal. It is particularly important that the steps which they have taken in recent years to meet the requirements of the EEC and to join and become members in the fullest possible way are not frustrated by any of the developments or actions of member states at this time.  We have seen how Greece has reintroduced democratic régimes and Spain has introduced a full democratic constitution.  All have taken a whole variety of other steps which were necessary towards joining and full membership of the EEC.  We must realise fully the importance to these countries of coming into the EEC with the appropriate transitional arrangements, and we should not at this stage allow these aspirations to be frustrated. Frustration of their aspirations could have a major effect on those countries and on the development relating to Europe in the Mediterranean region generally.</P>
    <P>We have spoken about the EMS and a two-speed Europe.  It is important in <Col N="1629" /> relation to the development of the EEC that we do not get into a three-speed situation.  We would hope that the present members will advance further towards unity in that area.  I believe the Taoiseach and the Government have given the right leadership and taken the correct initiative in relation to the EMS, and we must follow through on this development.  It is clear that no very major concessions have been given in this respect, and therefore, in contrast to Deputy Cluskey's view, I see no need to give concessions on a common agricultural policy, nor do I expect that the other member states will see any need to do that.  A common agricultural policy has been one of the most successful aspects of the Community's development, and it has redistributed a considerable amount of wealth to the poorer regions within the Community. This is an aspect which people are inclined to overlook.</P>
    <P>We must consider what the EMS is all about.  It is about monetary stability through closer monetary co-operation, and it is in the interests of all the member states, including Ireland.  Monetary stability is vital to the interests of the Irish people.  It is about such ordinary things as prices, inflation, the value of the £ and the number of occasions on which it may be devalued and the extent to which it may be devalued.  It is about interest rates, whether they relate to houses or to economic development; it is about exports, and in our experience since we joined the EEC we have had a substantial swing of our exports to the Continent.  It is about very practical things which could be elaborated on on another occasion.  It is also about investment, as the Taoiseach said in his speech yesterday, and about our ability to attract long-term capital into this country. In recent times we have been particularly successful in this respect, but if we wish to go on attracting capital we will have to have that kind of monetary stability which will attract capital to set up here and assist in the development of our country.</P>
    <P>Monetary stability also relates to the long-term capital purchases from the Continent.  As any one who has been purchasing from the Continent will <Col N="1630" /> know, one does not like to find oneself paying virtually twice for a commodity because of the devaluation of the £ in between purchase and payment.  This has been the experience of quite a number of Irish industrialists and even people in agriculture.  On adopting a loan on the basis of, say, the Deutsche Mark or Dutch currency and paying back, because of devaluations in the £ one has to pay back very much more than one originally intended.  This can be a very strong disincentive to long-term capital purchases from the Continent.  This is an aspect which I would like to see overcome.</P>
    <P>Monetary stability is related to growth, job creation and the whole question of wealth and real income.  Of course we may ask ourselves, and the ordinary person looking at this whole question of the EMS will ask why the Government adopted such a direct, straightforward and honest approach to our Community partners.  The reason they did was that we are generous and committed Europeans and are recognised as such within Europe.  Our approach and stance were totally vindicated by the EEC experts who supported the transfer calculations made. Additionally, as a country, we support the closer integration and development of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I felt it would be desirable to look beyond these figures and investigate what the EMS and developments in Europe generally mean in terms of money in the pocket so far as the man in the street is concerned.  I rooted out some figures to ascertain the gross domestic product for each worker employed.  I wanted to ascertain the picture in 1972 before we joined the EEC and again in 1977, after that five-year period.  I wanted to ascertain what was the situation for a large country like Britain and that of the new members.  On the other hand I felt it would be desirable also to look at the position of Germany and the Netherlands.  We are inclined to foget that the Netherlands is a very small country within Europe, that it is in size only like Munster whereas, West Germany, on the other hand, is a very large one.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we may look at actual dollars <Col N="1631" /> in the pocket.  Of course this involves using current rates of exchange to change incomes into dollars in the pocket but it is a reasonable comparison to make.  If we examine our position in 1972 we find that the average gross domestic product for each worker employed was $5,073. In the United Kingdom it was $6,323. Therefore, on our entry to the EEC, the United Kingdom were somewhat ahead of us.  By 1977 we had risen to $8,762 whereas the United Kingdom average then was $10,000, meaning a 73 per cent increase for us and 58 per cent for the United Kingdom.  We are fairly well aware of this rate of speed of increase. We are aware also that the United Kingdom started off in a somewhat better position.  The increase per head over the five-year period in terms of dollars in the pocket, emerges as $3,689 in our case and in that of the United Kingdom $3,697.  We might say to ourselves that this is a reasonably satisfactory position, a fair increase in percentage terms.  I accept that we are dealing with averages at this point but it must be acknowledged to be a fair increase in percentage terms and in terms also of extra dollars in the pocket.  We can take the mean of these two figures and ascertain what is the average for Ireland and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Turning to look at West Germany, initially we find that their figure was $9,729 which increased, in 1977, to $20,000, giving them a 112 per cent increase or, in terms of extra dollars in the pocket, $10,800.  The Netherlands commenced at a figure of $10,000 going up to a figure of $23,000, at 134 per cent increase, leaving them with $13,000 extra in the pocket.  Therefore, taking the average of Ireland-England against that of West Germany and the Netherlands, at the end of that period, we find that the Irish-English average person employed, had on gross domestic product, $3,693 whereas, taking Western Germany and Holland into account the mean figure showed an additional $12,135.  When we examine these figures in a fairly simple way we begin to see the problem of the two speeds.  Of course, there are two elements involved in this, that of productivity <Col N="1632" /> and of the exchange rate, both of which have had an effect on the kind of increase that has taken place.</P>
    <P>In terms of ratios it means that West Germany versus Ireland increased at a rate of 1.92:1 and, in the case of the Netherlands versus Ireland, 1.97:1.  In 1972 the ratio was 1.92:1 and, in 1977 the position of West Germany versus Ireland had increased to 2.35:1, the Netherlands versus Ireland having increased to 2.67:1.  Therefore, the overall increase between West Germany and Ireland was $7,161 extra in the pocket whereas the Netherlands versus Ireland was $9,730.  Examining this increase as between West Germany and Ireland one finds that 57 per cent was due to currency fluctuations, that is, taking the middle point of exchange rates for 1972 and 1977 and comparing them.  These figures in themselves reflect the economic strength and growth.</P>
    <P>There are a number of lessons to be learned from those sets of figures.  Firstly, they show that a small country, the Netherlands, by being self-reliant, by having high levels of productivity and by going out and selling in the context of Europe, did particularly well and, on average, can actually do better than the very wealthy West Germany.  Of course they illustrate also that there are two speeds here.  Having gone through the total transitional period following entry to the EEC, if we want to break loose of this two-speed problem we must look not only to productivity, which is vital here, but also to the question of currency fluctuations.  It is in that respect that the whole question of the EMS and its importance arises for us.</P>
    <P>Over the period to which I have been referring West Germany increased their currency by 34 per cent, the Netherlands by 29 per cent, whereas the £ sterling was reduced by 23 per cent.  I have taken these figures from the United Nations monthly bulletin of statistics for October 1978.  This establishes fairly clearly what we are seeking here, extra income and extra wealth per worker employed. Clearly both elements are of great importance in that quest.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has been questioned by the Opposition on his approach to the EMS.  To any one looking objectively at <Col N="1633" /> the situation it must be clear that the main problem was the inability of some member states to deliver themselves because of the domestic situations with which they were faced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey referred to Britain and the common agricultural policy, and the various views of Britain in relation to this.  Of course Britain is the country affecting us most.  We are well aware of the fact that there is a general election pending there in the near future.  We are well aware of the fact also&mdash;I do not think anybody has made any secret of it&mdash;that Britain has been openly seeking a revision of the common agricultural policy.  I do not really see much prospect for them in that objective.  Having succeeded in keeping the exchange rate for the £ sterling stable for over a year, with help from North Sea oil and gas, which contributes something of the order of £3,000 million to the balance of payments at this stage, Britain feel quite confident that they can continue to maintain the £ sterling stable for a further period and do not want to risk joining the EMS until after their general election.  Britain feels quite confident that she can continue to keep it stable for some further period and she obviously does not want to risk joining the EMS until after the election.  For that reason she was prepared to go through all the stages of preparing for the summit.  She would not stand in Ireland's way.  Yet her negotiators went to Brussels saying they would keep in line but they wanted the credits and the resource transfers. They wanted an enlargement of the regional fund and they wanted the CAP revised.</P>
    <P>It reminds me very much of the EEC producer groups where, in order to get the benefit of intervention and certain grants, one had to sign a market agreement.  It is quite common to find people saying they would like to go along and adopt the marketing disciplines but they do not want to sign an agreement. If, of course, one does not sign an agreement one does not have the benefit of intervention or of grants.  It is as simple as that.  Where Britain was concerned the position was similar.  There was no way in which the package could be obtained. <Col N="1634" /> It just was not on from the beginning and I think the negotiators knew it was not on, but they used it as a delaying device until timing might be more favourable from Britain's point of view for a convergence of European currencies.</P>
    <P>In relation to the EMS, a great deal more is involved than exchange rates or our agreeing to becoming involved.  If we are within a reasonably stable currency area then the future will depend very much on ourselves and our own productivity. In terms of providing jobs and greater wealth for all the future will depend on how we perform, not on how the British, the Italians or the Dutch perform. I believe the majority of our people would like to be judged on our own performance.  Management and workers have over the years shown at various levels that they like to get credit for performance instead of having it said that success is due to something outside ourselves and has nothing really to do with us.  If our future depends clearly on ourselves and we are not tied to external influences, as we have been to the £ sterling, then we will have to face up to reality in whatever capacity we find ourselves.  We will have to face the fact that our future depends on a reasonably stable overall economic climate for future growth and development and they in turn depend on ourselves.  I believe the EMS will provide this stability.  The initial resource transfers would be right and reasonable.  They would give us the right foundation from which to take off. I quoted figures in regard to Germany, Holland and Ireland and the development that has taken place in the five years of transition in regard to our entry into the EEC, and the one fact that stands out is the fact that we started from a lower base because we had less developed resources.  Our roads are not developed.  Our infrastructural facilities and needs are not so well catered for.</P>
    <P>Now Britain sought very extensive investment. Britain has the foundation on which to build.  Our seeking some initial transfer resources was for the purpose of giving us an opportunity to take off from our present level without undue delay in building up a proper infrastructure.  I believe involvement in the EMS would <Col N="1635" /> provide us with the proper economic stability, and the initial resources would be very valuable in terms of our take-off position.  Of course, we must also have a national sense of direction and social balance.  I am tired of listening to people saying this will not be the evolution and that we cannot do it.  I am tired of listening to people trying to find reasons why we will not succeed instead of making constructive proposals as to how we might do better.  Such proposals from both sides of the House would be very welcome, and if Opposition Deputies have any such proposals, they should voice them here publicly and they will be given full credit for them.  We all recognise that our people are highly intelligent in terms of electoral preferences and we give them full credit for the work they do in that respect.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a national sense of direction and social balance.  We all want people to have better incomes.  If we are to achieve this we must have greater productivity.  We must look at our management and labour relations. We must look at our semi-State bodies, some of which are making great progress indeed in management and labour relations.  The B &amp; I have a particularly good record in this respect. Bord Bainne have introduced flexi-time with considerable success.  We have to revise our approach and do things in a co-operative way in order to bring about the development to which we all aspire.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see a closer identity between the State, semi-State and private sectors.  Here I disagree with Deputy Cluskey.  He seemed to believe that most of the development and improvement on the Continent stemmed from the fact that where that has taken place there are socialist governments and socialist political parties.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that we must start now in terms of continental levels of price increases of 2 to 3 per cent a year and continental levels of prosperity. I agree with that.  I am very familiar with the Dutch situation because of a business in which I was involved.  I am very familiar with the way in which the Dutch approach business.  It is very different <Col N="1636" /> from the approach here.  It has not as much to do, as Deputy Cluskey would seem to think, with the fact that there is a socialist government or a socialist party.  There is instead a very close sense of identity between State, semi-State and private business.  Here there is a close identity between State and semi-State.  It works quite well, but a close identity between private business and the State is something we have to evolve.  We must view the function and the role of private business in close liaison with the public sector in the broadest sense.  That is a concept well established on the Continent.  One of the secrets of their success there is that they have a very close understanding and working relationship between private industry and State and semi-State services.</P>
    <P>The other feature is that there is very strong and frequent mobility between these sectors, which is something we could learn from.  I should like to see this type of closer understanding extending not only to semi-State bodies but to private business because it would be in the overall national interest.  I would include in this also the unions, working closely with State and private business and semi-State bodies, because ultimately we are all in this together and it is time we learned to work together to avail of the opportunities presented now that we are full members of the EEC and which will be presented if we operate within the EMS.  This will give us considerably expanded opportunities in all our sectors.</P>
    <P>The EEC is being enlarged and if there are not any delays in the present target date further opportunities will be available for our industrial and some of our agricultural products, and we should be taking appropriate steps now to ensure that we will be able to avail of these further markets.</P>
    <P>The second point I shall deal with relates to housing and to the environment in general.  There are many things one could say on housing but it is difficult to talk on the subject in the relatively short time at our disposal.  If one wishes to deal with a number of items one must select on priorities, and one of the key priorities is the supply of houses and the money for houses.  There are three items which at this stage I <Col N="1637" /> should like to see the Minister giving attention to when he comes to consider his 1979 Budget.  The first is the SDA loan scheme on which the £3,500 basic applies. I suggest that this needs revision.  If overtime were excluded from the calculation of this figure it would extend the £3,500 to cater for quite a number of people.  I hope the Minister will have a look at it again.  I am aware that he increased the qualifying level and the income level and the size of the loan itself on two occasions but I believe that there is need for a further revision at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I should also like to suggest to the Minister an improvement in the low-rise mortgage system.  It is a very valuable scheme which could be used more extensively and I should like to see the Minister considering an extension of the concept because in practice quite a number of people are in a position to avail of that scheme and I should like to see it extended to cover a greater number of those seeking houses.</P>
    <P>The third point I should like to ask the Minister to look at, particularly at the beginning of the year, is the question of stabilising the interest charges of building societies.  We have had a period of great stability, but being tied to the British £ we will be faced with a considerable increase in this area.  Therefore, I should like to see introduced a means of stabilising these interest charges.  I congratulate the Minister on the work he has been doing in this area and the success he has been achieving.  Some of the suggestions made in previous adjournment debates were subsequently taken up by the Minister and I hope he will give attention to the points made today in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to some extent about the conditions of employment of wardens in the centres for elderly people around the city.  The system has grown up from small beginnings and I should be obliged if the Minister would look at the conditions of employment and the wages of these wardens.  They are a small group who do tremendous work throughout the city and totally the scheme has been a success.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to education. There are many items in this respect <Col N="1638" /> which one could deal with but time allows me to discuss only one or two points.  The one which causes me greatest concern and which I have chosen to speak about is the standard of entry to universities and third level institutions. I am particularly concerned about the level of entry and this is a very broad subject which would take a great deal of time.  I do not like the points system and the requirement that students must speak to a computer located in Galway.  I have seen it at work and it is almost unbelievable.  Students do not speak to anybody other than the computer in Galway, their answers go to and fro and in practice it is a frightening situation.  I realise it is necessary because of the large number of students involved. I am concerned about the matter of vocations and this is not taken into consideration in many aspects at this stage.</P>
    <P>In the requirement for 1978 we find that the points required for entry are as follows: medicine and veterinary science, 25; dentistry and pharmacy, 24; architecture, 23; law, 22; and engineering, 21.  All these are very high levels and I do not think one would have to go far to find that in many of these areas there are people practising below these points. If you exclude mathematics, which in 1978 was +2 points, you will find that for six As the points are 30, which is 85 per cent.  Six Bs yield 24 points; six Cs produce 18 points; and six Ds produce 12 points.  If you get 24 or 25 points for medicine and veterinary science it is an extremely high level, and if you compare them with the marks related to other subjects there is inconsistency as between A, B, C and D.  It is far too great.  I do not believe it is in any way objective or fair.  I could elucidate on it but I have not got the time.  What I would propose instead of the present system is that within the As there should be A1, A2 and A3; that within the Bs there should be B1, B2 and B3, in the Cs there should be C1, C2 and C3; and within the Ds there should be D1, D2 and D3.  I also suggest that the points should be extended from 12 points down to one and that for 95 to 100 you would get A1, for 90 to 95 you would get A2 and for 85 to 90 you would get A3.  This <Col N="1639" /> prevents a huge drop in points once you get under 85.</P>
    <P>On the other system as it stands at the moment, if you get 84 marks instead of 85 in six subjects you drop six overall points, which is far too great a drop for one or two points difference.  It does not make sense.  If the marks and the points mean anything the only way you could reasonably handle the matter is either to use the marks themselves initially, which in some ways would be the fairest method, or if you want to have categories, they must be smaller, I believe.  Certainly, I would like to see them changed so as to have within the As an A1, A2 and A3 and similarly within the Bs and Cs and so on.  On this basis you would have points reducing for each five marks lower by 8 per cent. It is an 8 per cent reduction all the way instead of some huge drop in percentage when you take the other system as it now operates.</P>
    <P>I say this as something which I believe could simply and positively be done at this stage.  In regard to the whole points system, it is a very unfair aspect of it to have this great drop.  It seems a lazy sort of system.  I do not understand who put it together in that way in the first instance or why they did so.  I certainly recommend to the Minister that he should have a good look at this system.  I accept that the wider matter of the points system is a much broader question and would require much wider debate and discussion.  I accept that because of objectivity the points system has been installed.  I greatly regret the fact that practical experience, proficiency, vocation are not catered for within that system.  At this stage I cannot offer a solution for that, but certainly within the points system there could be much fairer distribution of the points and I suggest it could be along the lines of A1, A2, A3 and B1, B2, B3.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe the Taoiseach has given us a very comprehensive report which has been very factual and valuable at the end of this session and this year.  I welcome the report and fully support the statements and approach in that report and the actions of the <Col N="1640" /> Government during the year particularly as regards their very sensible, reliable, honest and forthright approach to the EMS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have an opportunity to speak in the Adjournment Debate.  It gives one a chance to see what has happened and what may happen.  Certainly, by way of legislation very little has happened here this session. The pot apparently is just kept boiling. Nothing imaginative has come before us.  From the utterances of the Government in the past few months it would appear that what we may look for in the coming year is a cut-back in local authority housing, which is very serious, and the removal of food subsidies, which are very beneficial.  Their removal would mean without doubt that there would be definite hardship, poverty and hunger. Many basic foods such as bread and butter will be placed beyond reach of a large number of people.  We hear the threat of the possibility of wage restraint, wage sanctions.  This has been a trend in past months in the speeches of various Ministers.</P>
      <P>Coupled with that, we had one piece of legislation which further downgraded local government.  Whatever little authority local councils have, even if basically they were only rubber stamping the rate each year, at least they had the privilege of doing that.  This is now being removed.  And it is being removed, not to take some of the responsibility from the shoulders of the councillors in asking them to strike a rate but solely because of a cutback that is coming in local authority expenditure in the New Year.  Responsible councillors when estimating their needs for the next year will naturally decline to cheesepare year after year and see their own area being run down.  They will do what every natural person would do&mdash;refuse to strike a rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To avoid the embarrassment of having to eliminate the various local authorities for failing to strike a rate the Government have decided to remove that onerous task from them.  That is sad when we should be considering how we could improve the whole structure of local government, give it more authority <Col N="1641" /> and expand it in every way.  But, a Government with a very strong majority here can use its muscle.  That is basically what we are talking about, muscle to usurp the right of local government.  It is a sad day for this country when such legislation is put through this House.  It was contained in a Bill removing rates from domestic dwellings and that made it very palatable, easier to sell.  In years to come this legislation will have grave consequences for local democracy. Unless something is done quickly I believe it sounds the death knell of local government as we know it.  This is the result of giving too much power to any Government.  This is the type of legislation that emanates from such a government. They become lazy, indifferent and insensitive to the people's point of view, but if they do, they do so at their peril.</P>
    <P>The construction industry is doing very well.  Everything is going nicely. Employment is up.  Listening to the speech one would wonder why we have so many problems today.  From the first few pages of the speech one would think that literally everything in the garden was rosy.  Let us look at the garden that is rosy and see if it is not indeed becoming a rather weedy garden as a result of indifferent Government.  We have near enough to 12,000 people on the waiting list in Dublin Corporation but the Minister stands up and says that we have now got to grips with the housing problem of Dublin so it will not be treated as a special case.  That just shows how far removed that Minister is from the very facts that exist in this city.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Taoiseach tells us that he is setting up an inter-departmental committee to look at the inner city of Dublin?  That is nice: we will probably get another glossy report about the problems we have and then it will be laid to rest on some shelf or other like a lot more glossy reports.  What we want here is a little action and a little honesty on the whole question of local authority housing.  I speak from the point of view of my own local authority area in Dublin where people are living in hovels, in basements which have been flooded and in rat-infested rooms.  This is not emotive talk.  These are facts and can be checked out.  But what are we told? <Col N="1642" /> We are told it is not a special area any longer because we have come to grips with the housing problem.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government when they came in saw the great need to try to revitalise Dublin particularly by way of inner city housing and they went about it swiftly.  The Minister of the day, Deputy Tully, appointed to Dublin City Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough a housing co-ordinator because he knew that Dublin city was a problem and right away, with particular emphasis on inner city development, that has gone ahead. There are positive housing developments now going on in the inner city of Dublin. It is costly per unit in comparison to other houses but in relation to the need, in relation to the overall development of our city, how expensive are they?  How expensive are they in relation to the infrastructure which already exists there, for example, schools, churches, roads? When we put all that together what are the costs then?  But the small-minded officials seem to do a sum and say that is the cost of a house and leave it at that. They say they do not think that is good value and that they are better off building one and a half or two houses at the same price out at the far corners of County Dublin at the risk of letting Dublin decay further.</P>
    <P>It behoves this Government to think before they make their allocation for Dublin city, to think again, to ensure that sufficient funds are made available to eradicate the poverty and the bad housing.  Only a couple of months ago a particular area in Dublin was scheduled to be knocked down.  Is this coming to grips with the problem when we still have other areas that could be treated in a like manner and when we still have 7,000 people on our housing list?  Surely we are living in cloud cuckoo land if we think we have eradicated any real problems.  If we remove or reduce our capital allocation it is going to mean tremendous hardship for an awful lot of people.  Even if they want to provide a home for themselves what is the story here?  Unless they have money on deposit for two years and have possibly £2,000 invested the building societies do not want to know them.  If they go to the local authority the maximum loan is <Col N="1643" /> £9,000 and when one considers the price of a house today one is talking about £14,000 at least, if a house can be got for £14,000, so we are talking about a deposit of £5,000; if a person is earning over £3,500 per annum he is told that the local authority is not in the business of financing him and he will have to go elsewhere.  But he has looked elsewhere and he cannot get a loan, so what is he to do?  He is thrown back onto the housing list.  The Government cannot have it both ways.  They cannot reduce the capital allocation because the housing problem is not as bad as it was and at the same time refuse to give adequate facilities for people to provide their own homes.  This the Government is not doing.</P>
    <P>One way the Government could help is by making low rise mortgages available.  That was something that was brought in by the Coalition Government. It was an excellent innovation and it has worked very well, but it must be expanded to meet the needs of many more people, because as houses are getting dearer the repayments are getting very much higher and it is really putting people to the pin of their collar to meet the repayments.  The great advantage of the low rise mortgage is that for the first ten years it had a subsidy built in and generally after that time increases in wages or salaries tended to let a person meet the repayments.  But they are terribly restrictive.  If a person is living in any sort of accommodation at all even with one child he is debarred; if he is married and has a child he has to wait 12 months before he can qualify and he must be in overcrowded and very poor conditions.  That is a narrow and restrictive policy, particularly in view of the fact that there is talk about cutting back on local authority housing.  At least if there are to be cutbacks in money for housing they should make it possible to provide the necessary finance and the necessary subsidies and aids for people to house themselves.  But they are doing neither, and we are again going to be faced with a terrible housing problem because this Government have not got the will to tackle this problem.  They use no imagination whatsoever on housing.  I <Col N="1644" /> suggested some time ago that they should consider the operation and organisation of housing aid societies which could go into business and buy houses which the local authority, for one reason or another, does not wish to buy. I am thinking of old houses which could be bought and renovated and made available to young married couples. There are many run-down properties in Dublin which could be bought over and refurbished by housing aid societies. There is no question that the will would be there within the area of people who want to get involved in this.  Surely this must be spearheaded by the Government. They must put the money in.  They must encourage this.  I suggested also some time ago the question of housing trusts.  In my constituency there is a fairly big housing trust and because of legislation for controlled rents they are now losing substantial amounts of money.  I believe that they should be directly grant aided, because if they are not and if property runs down the cost of developing and rebuilding it will certainly amount to a fortune.  It is money well spent but there does not seem to be any imagination in the housing area to do something like this.  Bad housing results in ill-health and suffering, the breakdown of marriages.  We should not contemplate a cutback in the capital allocation for housing.</P>
    <P>With regard to social welfare I hoped that, coming up to Christmas the old age pensioners, people in receipt of disablement pensions and others, would have got special consideration.  They have to make do with the small amount of money they have.  They are not being given any bonus this Christmas.  There does not appear to be a lot for them in the long term, if we are to heed the statements of Ministers that things are not good now.  They did not tell us that in June 1977 but they are telling us now when they are firmly ensconced in Government.  I hope that in the coming budget the social welfare recipients, particularly the elderly and the disabled, will be given special consideration to ensure that they have adequate money to live in reasonable comfort.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke about job creation this morning.  He spoke about the <Col N="1645" /> great work that was done and about the fall in the live register.  They are always talking about the live register.  I wonder where the dead register is?</P>
    <P>(<i>Interruptions.</i>)</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told that the live register was 110,000 and it is now down to 98,000.  The Government said they would have jobs, not necessarily for the boys, but they forgot to tell the people that they were in Liverpool, Birmingham, Glasgow and other places in England.  We are now back to the situation in the fifties and sixties.  The live register looks a bit respectable because of emigration.  People who draw unemployment benefit are being asked where they have applied for employment when they go in to sign.  They have to produce a few letters from former employers.  If they do not produce those letters they lose their unemployment benefit.  That is intimidation of the worst type.  If one is unemployed and goes to an employer looking for a job he may not want to spend one minute putting something on paper saying that that particular person called but there was no employment for him or her.  That is another way the Government can show that the figures on the live register are coming down.  There is no actual quantification of the real jobs got.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach said that redundancies are still high because we all know that this is the case.  I compliment the IDA on the work they are doing but it is not coming along as quickly as we would like it.  Unfortunately redundancies are increasing.  It is nice to quote figures but when one examines them they do not stand up to scrutiny.  We know that people have been forced off the live register by some means for the sake of keeping nice respectable figures that can be thrown across the House without any consideration for the unfortunate people who have not got jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said that the Government have been doing a great job in regard to school leavers.  The Minister for Labour set up a youth employment committee.  I do not know if that is alive or dead as we do not hear a lot about it. That was to take the onus off the Minister.  The Government's attitude is <Col N="1646" /> that if they have a problem they set up a committee and let them deal with it.  I believe that this committee are a failure because they were not given any teeth. When the committee wanted to do something they could not do it because AnCO or some other group might have been doing it.  When one asks a question about youth employment one is invariably told that this committee are working on it.  I know they came up with some schemes, such as the community work schemes, which are in operation, but they are temporary, as the Taoiseach said.</P>
    <P>We all know that local authorities are to have cutbacks.  I hope that when it comes to renewing the special grant which was given last year to this committee that we will not be told that the money is not there.  Young people were given some hope early this year and I hope their hopes will not be dashed when it comes to the budget early next year. They were given promises and if they are not fulfilled the day of reckoning will come for the Government.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Woods talk about the EEC, the commitment of the Government in relation to it and their concern for other countries to join.  At the same time they have aligned themselves to a party who are opposed to direct elections in Europe, who are not interested in the expansion of Europe and do not want those countries in. Fianna Fáil have rather strange bedfellows. Democracy is giving the people the right to choose their candidates but the Government have aligned themselves with the people who do not want this.  A statement to that effect was made in Cork although I believe the press got it wrong as they got a few things wrong last week.</P>
    <P>When mistakes are made scapegoats must be found.  During the last couple of weeks the scapegoats have been the Press.  But I expect that the Press are well able to look after themselves in that respect.  I was both amazed and amused by Deputy Woods' contribution.  I suppose any of us can live in cloud-cuckoo land at any time but that will not solve any problem.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal recently about the EMS but there is still a good <Col N="1647" /> part of that road to travel.  We are told that membership of the EMS would result in keeping down prices and in reducing the level of inflation.  That sounds fine but we are told that we must be cushioned against the effects of joining. Consequently, it is important that we consider those effects, one of which is that we would not necessarily have the safety valve of devaluation to the same extent as we have had up to now but then we might become uncompetitive and, consequently, lose a lot of jobs. One of the Ministers tells us that we might have compulsory wage restraints to offset that problem.  That is his contribution to solving the problems that would be associated with membership of the EMS.  Perhaps in the long term that attitude would be correct but in the short term we would appear to be going in with our eyes half closed.  There has been reference to the setting up of a committee in Europe of three wise men but our three wise men did not have many answers when they arrived back at Dublin Airport.  They had various stories to relate but I am convinced that when their stories were related to the Department of Finance they were told that the Department had a budget drafted on the basis of the readies coming in and that in the event of our not joining there will be real trouble.  Consequently, I suspect that the Government were advised to go back to Europe and try again.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach was not back more than a couple of days when he began pussyfooting about and trying again to join.  This was no doubt after the facts had been put to him fully by the Department of Finance.  The Department probably told the Taoiseach that although what was offered might not be what we are looking for, it would be sufficient to plug a few holes.  Obviously if we do not join, the budget will have to be very deflationary and there will be steep increases in tax on various items.  Such a move would not be very popular so the idea must be to get back to a negotiating position so that money can be got from somewhere.  I am concerned, then, with this rather dubious <Col N="1648" /> reason for joining the EMS but no doubt if things go wrong the Government will find a scapegoat.  During recent months the trade unions have been criticised and one Minister suggested that the Government would use their 84-seat position to bring order into the situation but that is not a way in which to get co-operation.</P>
      <P>The Government have not made any effort to come to grips with the very serious problems of industrial relations. According to them everybody but the Government are irresponsible, but the irresponsibility begun with the pre-election promises of Fianna Fáil when they raised very high hopes among the people but now when the expectations are not being fulfilled the people are asking questions.  Fianna Fáil gave the impression that if the Coalition could be removed from office all our problems would disappear.  Fianna Fáil knew very well that the promises they made were not capable of being implemented and now they accuse all of us of being irresponsible.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the Government's position regarding the problems of industrial relations.  A commission have been set up to investigate this area but I expect this committee will be merely another smokescreen.  There should be an examination into the causes of strikes with a view to determining what action can be taken to avoid them.  Surely that is a positive function of industrial relations. There is no sense of direction on the part of the Government so far as this question is concerned.  All we have are veiled threats week after week but these threats will boomerang on the Government because they will not get from the trade union movement the kind of co-operation that is necessary unless some direction can be given.  The sooner that the Government are in a position to give the sort of direction that is necessary, the better for all of us.  That can be done only by a positive approach of goodwill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about profit sharing?  Have we any policy with regard to worker participation within a company?  What are they doing about rights? The Coalition brought in a Bill about workers on boards.  That is all right, but it is not anything like enough.  That is starting at <Col N="1649" /> the wrong end.  You would want to start at the shop floor and build up a proper framework of good relationships.  This can be done with goodwill.  It can be done by incentives from the Government of the day.  Surely it is the responsiblity of the Government to do that in involving profit sharing and special tax concessions for workers and for employers who will participate in this type of good relationships.  We hear a lot about the Continent where there are not many strikes and where they are very responsible people, but if one goes to the Continent and examines their management structures, their incentives and salaries and the whole framework, one will see clearly why they have not got the problems.  We do not seem to want to grasp the nettle and tackle the problem at the proper level.  We have not the will, we are lazy.  As long as we persist in that we are in dire trouble in our industrial relationships.  It is a pity, because the Irish worker is very receptive. The trade union movement over the years have been responsible for national wage agreements and so often face reasonable opposition from their own members.  Why?  We cannot say that the trade union movement and their members are irresponsible.  They have been neglected and it is high time we revised our thinking and did something positive.  We are almost in the 1980s; we are in Europe.  We are in the big world and unless we equip ourselves and are fair to our workforce we are going to continue to be in trouble.  This is one of the problems that have to be tackled in a radical fashion, and if this is done it will be of great advantage to this country in a few years.</P>
    <P>The record of this Government over the last year and a half, and particularly over the last few months, has been uninspiring, with no real legislation coming through the House.  Their reputation internationally as a result of the type of negotiations we were conducting has been tarnished.  When the Coalition were in office we were held in high esteem.  We had people who could negotiate, who were respected and who got goodwill for us.  We have seen this goodwill being eroded in a very short time by shilly-shallying and dithering.  That is sad <Col N="1650" /> because it is not this or that side of the House which suffers.  It is the overall country that suffers because of the inadequacy of the people we send to negotiate.  It is a sad day for Ireland when that happens.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the future does not look very bright.  The prospects are grim and instead of new hope we have no hope.  There is a certain amount of despair emanating from the far side of the House.  The next few months are going to be hard.  The money that we get from the EMS may bail out the Government temporarily, but unless they get down to operating concrete policies which have some meaning, instead of the conglomeration of gimmicks that were in the manifesto&mdash;and the sooner that document is laid to rest the better&mdash;and positive ideas are brought to the fore, this country is going to be in trouble.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that I am disappointed with the present Government's performance.  It has been slipshod and lacking in vision.  They have not lived up to their promises.  From their utterances of late it is quite clear that we are in for a tough time because of all their inadequacies. As an Opposition we have to ensure that they will not get all their own way despite the fact that they have such a large majority.  Coming into the year 1979, under the present Government things do not look as rosy as they foretold they would in July 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to bring this debate to a degree of reality.  Deputy O'Brien, in his otherwise excellent contribution, sought to bring into the debate a degree of subjective reasoning and of politicisation of the situation that does not get away from the real economic figures indicated, which I will quote now for the benefit of Deputy O'Brien, Deputy Bermingham and the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as economic growth is concerned, we have achieved this year, for the second year in succession, a 7 per cent rise in growth.  In case that is regarded as just a percentage figure, that is not in a relative sense.  That is the highest growth not alone in the EEC but in a list of OECD countries, many of whom are regarded as the most advanced <Col N="1651" /> industrialised countries in the world.</P>
    <P>The figures that I have just mentioned in regard to Ireland are in a table that I am looking at on page 32 of the Central Bank Report of autumn 1978, showing Ireland in terms of GNP percentage increase the highest, not alone in the EEC, but in the OECD countries that include the USA, Canada and Japan and the whole list of EEC countries as well. Therefore, we are there at the top of the lead not just of the EEC but of the OECD list of countries.  That is the economic reality, the basic barometer test of the percentage rise in economic growth.  To show that this is not just for one year, this is the second successive year in which we have had a 7 per cent growth rate increase in respect of the economic growth of wealth to be distributed throughout the whole of the Irish community in the form of an equitable budgetary arrangement.</P>
    <P>I shall cite just a few other barometers. Our exports are up 14 per cent this year on last year.  Our external reserves have gone up, more than counter-balancing the deficit of £150 million in the balance of payments.  Therefore, we have a situation in which we can carry the balance of payments deficit by reason of the increased inflow of funds and investment to this country.  That is another very practical barometer of progress.</P>
    <P>I have just mentioned the economic aspects of progress but the most important one of all is the social aspect of employment.  That is what all economic development is about, the creation of employment and jobs.  In that respect the net increase in employment in the past 12 months of 17,000 people&mdash;which is the present estimate, to be confirmed&mdash;is the highest in 30 years&mdash; direct job creation by the Government resulting from investment in the public sector, stimulation of the building and construction industry and youth employment; the direct job creation comes to a figure of 24,000.  I shall not go into the inadequacies of the live register.  The register itself at present shows a reduction of 12,000 people compared with this time last year, consistently <Col N="1652" /> at that rate over a number of months.</P>
    <P>There is there, if you like, a whole photograph of the economy, the whole spectrum&mdash;a situation of a 7 per cent growth target achieved this year, on top of 7 per cent last year; a situation of exports being up 14 per cent this year compared with last year and a net increase in employment of 17,000 people compared with the same time last year.  This illustrates how the Government, through direct action in the way of direct job creation, by way of tax and stimulants, and rates abolition&mdash;putting more money into people's pockets and encouraging enterprise amongst people&mdash;through policies pursued at two levels, on direct action in regard to job creation and direct action also in regard to rates abolition and tax incentives, have created a situation resulting in the picture I have outlined in brief statistical terms.</P>
    <P>Apart from arguing out this matter on a statistical or economic base, there is one even more fundamental fact, that is that Fianna Fáil won the last general election, won it so well that the people who have money to invest, Irish nationals, and non-nationals are coming in here so numerously now that the job of the Industrial Development Authority is rendered easy by reason of the obvious attraction here for foreign investment and restored confidence.  As long as the Fine Gael Party in opposition have the Labour Party around their necks, as long as the Socialists are around the necks of the conservative party in opposition, but more seriously for the country in Government, there will not be the type of inflow of funds by way of investment in Ireland that we require for our future development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about confidence; I am talking about where money and investment move.  That is very pertinent to something I will be talking about later in regard to the European Monetary System, that as far as investment is concerned the elixir of investment, the motivation of investment, is confidence.  Apart from the positive <Col N="1653" /> measures taken by the Government I have outlined already to stimulate development and employment, the basic intangible ingredient is the restoration of confidence.  That factor did not exist in the Irish social and economic climate in the period 1973 to 1977.  This is no reflection on the estimable people sitting opposite, the estimable people within the Fine Gael and Labour parties.  I am not responsible for this and they are not responsible.  It is merely a fact of life that money and investment will flow only where money and investment feel that confidence resides.</P>
      <P>The picture, since the general election in 1977, has been one showing a flow of funds and investment into this country that have helped, to a large extent, in the job-creation drive I have just mentioned. Therefore, apart from the direct Government aspects of encouragement, there was this fantastic, intangible creation of confidence which attracted funds and direct fiscal investment from abroad, particularly from North America where the IDA are having very substantial success in attracting North American firms to Ireland to use Ireland as a springboard for their business outlets within the EEC.  The figure I mentioned some moments ago emphasises that, despite the fact that we are running a balance of payments deficit currently of £150 million, much lower than anticipated, we have a rise in our external reserves way ahead of that figure. Therefore, we can run now a balance of payments deficit on the basis that we are attracting sufficient funds in here on account of the confidence created by reason of the investment climate created, to attract funds to outweigh the balance of payments deficit.  This is the sort of practical, economic situation that could never have arisen as long as the Fine Gael Party were in Government with the Socialists around their necks.  As long as the Socialists were around their necks like an albatross, the Fine Gael Party could not succeed.  Indeed many of their own supporters saw that in the last general election and acted accordingly, quietly, in the secrecy of the ballot box&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going through a very constructive résumé of the economic indicators showing the success of the Government's economic policies; the economic indicators are there in regard to the 17,000 increase in employment, the largest increase in 30 years. The economic indicators are there in the direct job creation of 24,000 employed <Col N="1655" /> by reason of direct Government action in the public sector and stimulation in the building construction industry and job creation area for young people.  The 7 per cent growth rate this year is more than twice as high an economic growth rate as that of any of the other Community countries.  Indeed, as I indicated, it is a higher growth rate than that of the USA, Canada and Japan.  That is the evolution for the second successive year under a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
      <P>I was going on to the very fundamental fact that this did not all just happen because we adopted the right tax incentives in the last budget or because we organised direct job creation.  It happened mainly because we created a climate of confidence in regard to investment and that confidence is reflected in the fact that our external reserves have risen higher than our balance of payments deficit.  We had a deficit this year of £150 million and our external reserves exceeded that.  That is what confidence means, an inflow of funds and investment, direct and indirect, which is reflected in that sort of figure.  That is what economics are about, and economics are a direct reflection of the political stability of a community.  So long as you have a Government who know their business, act in a majority here and creates the sort of confidence I am talking about so long will you have a repetition of the figures I have just given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year there was a 17,000 net increase in employment.  The figure on the live register is down by 12,000 as compared with this time last year.  I want to quote now the <i>Financial Times</i> of Thursday, 14 December, where one can see the basic reality of going into a European Monetary System if the terms are right.  Forward dealing against the £ in regard to the German Deutschemark is 9.27, a very substantial figure.  In regard to the Yen it is 10.97.  In regard to the Belgian Franc it is 3.70 and in the case of the Guilder it is 3.43.  Sterling is maintaining a reasonable parity with the dollar. The importance of these figures is borne out by the Central Bank Report published in the autumn of this year.  I refer to table 7, section 2 of the <Col N="1656" /> statistical appendix.  There is a very interesting statistic arising out of loans mainly floated by the Coalition Government, to our enormous disadvantage. The external debt of State-sponsored bodies is up by £252 million as of March of this year.  There is a corrective note, which appears for the first time, and it shows the stupidity of the Coalition Government borrowing so widely.  The note says that it is estimated that, when exchange rate changes are taken into account, the amount outstanding was of the order of £310 million.  That figure of £252 million becomes therefore a figure of £310 million, a 20 per cent increase in the outstanding debt of State-sponsored bodies alone.  That runs right through all the loans taken up by the Coalition Government in non-sterling currencies and that is why it is so important to be linked with a reasonable basket of currencies rather than taking up loans from sterling or non-sterling currency areas. That is why I quoted current figures from the <i>Financial Times</i> which show a forward borrowing position as against sterling in regard to the major currencies of the world.  That is very basic and very fundamental.  It is important to remember that so long as we continue indefinitely to be tied to a sick currency, such as sterling, so long will we continually be dodging trouble as the British have been dodging trouble since the end of the war.  It was not the French, the Germans or any other of the Community countries that caused our problems in regard to negotiating the best possible deal within the Community. It was the British.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy has in mind duty-free sales on all sea and air routes into this country.  It is estimated that, in the year to 30 September 1978, revenue of the order of £8 million was foregone in respect of such duty-free sales.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that this £8 million should be taken into account in any costing of fares, as well as any other ongoing increases in costs which have been held to justify the alarming fare increases in recent times.</P>

      <P>I have two observations on that.  Clearly the argument is open to anyone to make who wishes to do so; whether it is accepted is another matter. The other observation relates to a point which is not quite clear in my reply.  The figure includes revenue foregone in respect of sales at duty-free shops.</P>

      <P>The centenarians' bounty was increased from £5 to £50 with effect from 1 August 1970 and I am not considering increasing it further at present.  The bounty is essentially a gesture or token of recognition and the amount itself has no special significance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance how it is proposed to use the £467,154, voted for agricultural grants by the Dáil in 1977, but remaining unissued at 31 December 1977; why it has remained unissued; and if he will give an assurance that the money will be used for agricultural purposes in accordance with the vote of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Moneys voted by the Oireachtas for the public services are based on estimates of expenditure prepared before the commencement of the year to which they relate.  It is not unusual for actual expenditure to be somewhat different from the amount originally estimated for a particular service. <Col N="1661" /> In the instance referred to by the Deputy the difference was not large, being little more than 1 per cent of the amount voted, which was £41.2 million.</P>
      <P>Under standard Government accounting practice any excess amount voted for a particular year but not needed for the purpose intended in that year is automatically surrendered to the Exchequer.  There can, therefore, be no question of the surplus amount referred to being made available specially for agricultural, or indeed any other, purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in approving the Estimate concerned the Dáil voted £500,000 for agricultural grants which was not used for that purpose and that by absorbing the money into the general fund he was not acting in proper accordance with the Vote of the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious from the answer I have already given.  It is a question of estimating as best one can and in this case the Estimate was extremely accurate, given the amount involved.  It is a question of estimating in advance of the year concerned what is likely to be required. It could be reasonably argued that the Dáil in voting the money was endeavouring to ensure that the sum available would be adequate for the purpose required, which it turned out to be. It does not follow that the Dáil was saying this sum was to be voted for this and no other purpose and spent in this year and no other year.  This is the implication of what the Deputy is suggesting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has any plans, in the context of the next budget, to reduce or remove altogether income tax assessment on social welfare and other pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the operation of the personal reliefs and age allowances, an old age pensioner is not at present liable to tax unless the total income exceeds £1,000 in the case of a single person and £1,910 in the case of a married man.</P>
      <P>Alteration of any of the income tax reliefs or allowances is a budgetary matter. It would not be appropriate at this time to give any indication of what proposals the next budget statement might or might not contain which would affect the position of old age pensioners in the matter of income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will not the Minister agree that it would be a welcome gesture if the portion of the income that constitutes a pension be exempted?  The people concerned are old and have given a lifetime of service to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, the limits were increased this year, far in excess <Col N="1664" /> of any increases given in the past.  It would be true to say that most pensioners are not liable for tax, but on the proposition of exempting such portion of pension as exceeds those limits where that arises, the difficulty is that one is then giving special relief to those who are better off rather than to people who are not as well off.  The basic principle of income tax should be related to income. The Deputy may know of cases where people are in receipt of pensions and are also in receipt of other incomes that put them in a high income bracket.  I do not think there is any case for exempting such people from tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to exempt them from tax but only to exempt the pension part which is only a small share of their income.  The Minister spoke about generous increases. Will he not agree that there was no increase for those people in October this year, as was customary in the past few years under the former Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now referring to social welfare increases.  The vast majority of people in receipt of social welfare pensions are not paying tax, but since the Deputy raised the question may I point out to him that the increases when they were granted in October were granted for two reasons: first, the rate of inflation was enormously high, about three times what it is today and, secondly, it was a method by the then Government of saving money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of tax concessions to many other sections of the community, does the Minister consider it socially just that an old age pensioner is liable for income tax on any earnings or income in excess of £19 per week?  This is the situation with regard to single old age pensioners.  Does the Minister consider that is an adequate allowance in any circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>Works under the Corrib-Mask-Robe will probably start early in 1979 and on the other two schemes at a later date. There will be no expenditure in the current year.</P>

      <P>The regulation governing the regional fund allows member states the option of using contributions from the fund either (i) to supplement the national aid granted to the project in question; or (ii) as a partial repayment of national aid, on the basis that fund assistance is used to supplement the overall regional development efforts of member states.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it is the second of these methods which has been used in Ireland, receipts from the fund being applied to the financing of increases in the public capital programme.</P>
      <P>I am still not convinced that the existing arrangements for using fund receipts are the best way of achieving the objective of demonstrating clearly that the moneys received are used to finance additional investment especially in the areas of greatest need.  Accordingly, as I mentioned in a reply to a parliamentary question earlier this year, the matter is being re-examined at my request by my Department.  This re-examination cannot be completed until the review of the fund regulation which is currently taking place at Community level has been finalised.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have powers under the National Monuments Act, 1930 to provide for public access to national monuments of which they are owners or guardians.  I do not consider it appropriate that they should provide for public access to any monument of which they are not the owners or guardians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very complex question involving the constitutional rights of farmers and others.  Sometimes we have to travel through three or four fields to gain access to a monument. This will be considered in new legislation which is being prepared.  Farmers are reluctant sometimes to allow people to travel over their lands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to take compulsory powers, but the Office of Public Works should have power to seek access rights through negotiation, and that would not involve constitutional difficulties.</P>

      <P>Priority lists for major catchment areas&mdash;those over 100,000 acres&mdash;and minor catchment areas&mdash;those under 100,000 acreas&mdash;were drawn up in 1946 and a decision to proceed with the preparation of schemes under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 for the catchment areas on the lists was taken about that time.  An <i>ad hoc</i> decision is taken in regard to the carrying out of each drainage scheme&mdash;the date of the decision to carry out the first drainage scheme under the Act, that is, the Brosna Drainage Scheme, was 18 August 1947.</P>
      <P>Details of the lists will, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, be circulated with the Official Report.  Following are the lists:</P>

      <P>It is excusable in certain circumstances.  I want to explain that one of the first things to which I directed my attention on becoming Minister for Health was the very unsatisfactory conditions in out-patients' departments because I have personal experience of them, particularly in Dublin hospitals, and I set out to see what could possibly be done to reduce the waiting time, to facilitate people, to make them more comfortable while they are there and to reassure them while they are waiting to be seen and looked after.  I have been working consistently on this for 12 months and among other things we have provided, in practically all of the major centres, very considerably improved facilities for out-patients.  It is a top priority of mine and I resent Deputy Blaney's suggestion that I am not doing anything about it.</P>

      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Chomhairle, to take Questions No. 34 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>Under a vaccination scheme administered by my Department, rubella vaccination is offered to all girls aged 12-14 years.  My Department's statistics show that the uptake of this form of vaccination averages 76 per cent of the target figure.  In addition a recent survey of the immunity levels of women entering maternity hospitals indicated that over 85 per cent were immune to rubella. In the light of these figures a major outbreak of rubella is highly unlikely.</P>
      <P>My Department endeavours to publicise the availability of all forms of vaccination offered to the public and the response to the rubella vaccination scheme for girls is reasonably satisfactory. In addition rubella vaccination is available through health boards to women at risk, for example trainee nurses, doctors and teachers and it is offered in maternity hospitals after the delivery of their babies to those women found to have no immunity to the disease.  If a woman in early pregnancy, who has no immunity to rubella, comes in contact with the disease, she may be given an injection of gamma globulin which helps prevent her getting the disease.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I will take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The major part of Exchequer funds used for cancer research is included in the total grant from the Minister for Health to the Medical Research Council. In 1977 the council allocated approximately £142,000 of this grant to cancer research.  In that year the council also received a grant of £4,500 for cancer research from the National Science Council.  In addition voluntary contributions for cancer research amount to over £120,000 in a year.  In the face of many competing priorities, I believe that the Exchequer has made a significant contribution to the finance for research on cancer.</P>
      <P>The bodies which are mainly engaged in cancer research are the Medical Research Council and St. Luke's Cancer Research Laboratories.  In addition, cancer research is carried out by a number of research workers in a number of locations.  The work which they are doing and the results of their researches are well publicised and co-ordination is not a problem.  A survey of the work being done in this field has been carried out by the Irish Association for Cancer Research and in view of the Deputy's interest in this question, I will arrange that a copy of the report of this survey is sent to him.</P>
      <P>Irish researchers keep up to date with international developments in their field of work.  They are represented on the major international organisations such as the World Health Organisation and the Union of International Cancer Control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are debating this situation prior to the adjournment the net point involved in the course of my remarks and some interjections was the situation concerning Ireland going ahead on her social and economic development programme on her own and the disadvantages involved in being tied irretrievably and forever to a sterling link which I tried to show had already developed in a very alarming way as far as our public finances are concerned.  I referred to Table 7 of section 2 of the statistical appendix of the autumn 1978 Central Bank Report to bear out my point that already in the current year we are facing a situation where £252 million external debt incurred by State-sponsored bodies had already appreciated to £310 million by reason of sterling depreciation.  There is a specific note on that page of the Central Bank Report stating that these particular exchange rate changes <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling have to be taken into account in regard to loans incurred outside of the sterling area.  Most of those loans were incurred by the previous Government.  We are already incurring a 20 per cent loss in respect of existing non-sterling loan credits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an on-going situation which can disappear within an EMS situation, where we are on the basis of being within a basket of currencies which are stable from the monetary point of view and do not put up interest charges in that <Col N="1807" /> respect.  Let me give a practical example which brings this down from the esoteric financial banking level to a practical level.  The recent increase in mortgage rates can be attributed directly to our link with sterling because when the Bank of England rate rose we automatically had to increase our mortgage rates so far as the building societies are concerned. This has applied across the board over the years, whether in regard to building societies, banks or any lending agencies in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I quoted from today's <i>Financial Times</i> already.  They stated in this respect that the automatic fact is that sterling borrowing has to be dear borrowing because people will not lend to sterling countries unless they lend dear. They have to lend dear because of the actual position of sterling as a currency in world markets.  It can be quite clearly seen from today's <i>Financial Times</i> the sort of situation which operates in regard to forward borrowing against sterling in regard to the major currencies in the world.  If one is talking in regard to the Yen it is 10.9 per cent and in regard to the Deutschmark it is 9.27 per cent. That, basically, is the problem of staying forever with sterling.  I believe it is very important, provided the terms are right, for us to get out of this cul-de-sac situation where we are locked in with a currency and a country which are not performing. The matter is as simple and straightforward as that.</P>
    <P>This, however, involves very real problems so far as we are concerned. Will we rise to the challenge of moving into a new currency system that will undoubtedly demand disciplines and a sense of responsibility which heretofore have not been exercised within the UK and which, unfortunately, due to the influence of television and of Britain generally in regard to our island, have been followed to a certain degree here? Can we really break from Britain to the fullest extent?  We have broken from Britain in the sense of political independence and we are, hopefully, breaking from Britain since we entered the EEC.  We are now, hopefully, breaking from Britain to a greater extent in <Col N="1808" /> regard to entering an economic and monetary union system with other countries in Europe.  Can we break to the fullest extent by ignoring the bad habits of management ownership, of the maverick people in the trade union movement in Britain and the bad habits of socialists in Britain who are tied to an ideology that has no relevance to this country's needs and requirements?  It will be our challenge in the immediate months and years ahead to ignore Britain's bad habits which are unfortunately influencing our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a full debate yesterday on this matter and I am referring to it now incidentally because it is fundamental to our progress as a nation in the economic and social sense.  It is very important that we stabilise prices and control inflation.  We have succeeded in bringing down inflation from a level of 21 per cent during the period of the Coalition to a 7 to 8 per cent level, but we must bring it down further to a 3 <Col N="1810" /> to 4 per cent level.  We must reduce interest rates because these are far too high and are hurting both existing and prospective mortgage raisers in respect of houses.  The reason for these very high rates is our link with sterling.  In the sterling money market the building societies cannot raise the money that is necessary because of inflation in interest rates. Therefore, regardless of whether the inflation relates to prices or to interest rates our fundamental problem is that since the war we have been tied to the inflation chariot of Britain.  Since the war successive British Governments and particularly socialist Governments, have led Britain into an abyss, to the bottom, by reason of continuing policies of inflation and of depreciation of sterling in a very blatant effort to con the British people.</P>
      <P>We have been brought along in the wake of that chariot but what first saved our community from going into that situation was the EEC into which Fianna Fáil as a Government succeeded in bringing Ireland on 1 January 1973. By reason of our membership we secured guaranteed outlets and price structures for our agricultural produce and for our processed agricultural produce.  Consequently, we have been able to earn the foreign exchange and to develop that section of our industry to the extent that the whole country has been made viable as an investment country and as a country in which confidence reposes.  A classic example of that is that our external reserves have increased beyond the £150 million balance of payments deficit of last year so that we could carry easily the balance of payments deficit incurred this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next step must be, assuming the terms are favourable, an association with other currencies, an association that would ensure an availability to us of money at much lower interest rates than has been the case up to now, because in the past we had to borrow money in non-sterling areas at rates that go against sterling.  For instance, in regard to the Deutsche Mark we have substantial loans already at the rate of 9.27 per cent.  Therefore, whether we borrow in sterling or in non-sterling, our <Col N="1811" /> membership of sterling militates severely against us because of having to borrow at inflated rates.  As a result, the consumer is affected not only by ordinary prices but by the cost of borrowing money.  Money is a commodity. Whether we are buying goods in the shop or borrowing money we are subject to the inflation rate of sterling which has been predetermined since the war by irresponsible British Governments in order to con their own people and to sell to them the idea that Britain won a war, which, in fact, she lost.</P>
    <P>We must get away entirely from that type of situation and realise that we have the skills, the abilities, the educational and training systems to guarantee that Irish men and women and our young boys and girls can practice in a skilled way in the factories of the future.  All of the IDA information now furnished to the Government is precisely on those lines.  North American industry in particular is coming to Ireland, which is an attractive base for Europe within the Community.  These industries are coming here because Irish labour is intelligent, educated, well trained and adaptable. We have the skills and the ability to attract the type of industry that can make use of modern technology.  Our people can participate in the highly-paid type jobs such as those in the electronics, computer, and light engineering industries, industries that are non-pollutant, which have a high wage structure but which are dependent on a skilled labour input.</P>
    <P>That is where our future lies.  In that context I wish to emphasise one point again, that is, that the re-equipment necessary for industry in Ireland today and the investment needed for expansion depends on the availability of low-interest credit facilities.  So long as we are in a situation of fluctuating exchange rates and of high interest sterling rates we cannot get the money at the right rate for the expansion required for industry. What industry needs more than anything else today is a stability of interest rates.  That applies throughout the Community, because in such circumstances management can plan ahead on <Col N="1812" /> the basis that there will not be fluctuations in regard to whatever credits they must obtain in order to re-equip and extend their factories.  This is a very practical reason for stability in regard to the whole currency and interest rate situation.</P>
    <P>The most important thing for everyone to remember is that if we are to succeed we must forget about internal party policies and about class rows within the Community at least for the next 12 to 18 months.  At the time of the next general election there will be plenty of opportunities to fight the issue of whether the Government have succeeded. I would say particularly to trade unions, to employers and to the other political parties that we are at a very serious juncture, possibly the most serious juncture in terms of our national affairs since the foundation of the State. In that situation it is of vital importance that there be a sense of discipline and of responsibility as a nation.  We want an example from everybody of practical patriotism, because unless we have that we shall not succeed.  No arrangement, either within or without a currency basket, will work during the next couple of years unless we all exercise a sense of discipline and responsibility and acknowledge that for the next 12 to 18 months what counts is not a particular group, a trade union or an employers' association, but Ireland.</P>

      <P>In a debate of this kind it is fair and appropriate that we examine what has been taking place, the policies of the Government in power and the results, as far as we can judge them, of these policies.  The policy of the Fianna Fáil Party since they were returned to power has been a very unsocial one from the point of view of the poor and the less well off in our society.  I was interested to hear the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry practically saying now that our tie with the British currency has been the cause of all our inflation and of the rise in loans up to now and how things have been bad in England.  Fianna Fáil have the happy knack of blaming somebody else when they are in trouble themselves.</P>

No one can take that kind of talk, even from a Minister, very seriously.  That is the kind of talk we heard a year and a half ago from him and his party when they were fighting an election campaign. We talked about the increases in the cost of living, and they paraded the country and on television with a thing known as the shopping basket.  I respectfully ask the people who were conned by that gimmickry to have a look at that shopping basket now.  We are still under the same monetary system and our shopping basket is in a very bad state.  There have been very substantial increases in the price of cheese as a direct result of Government action in removing the subsidy during that period.  There has been a substantial increase in bread prices, butter prices and sugar prices, all of which items were in the shopping basket.  As to the price of meat&mdash;I need say no more about this.  Fianna Fáil said: &ldquo;Look at the prices of the contents of this basket&rdquo;. If the people took a look at that basket now they would realise that during the time since this great manifesto was issued, the great Fianna Fáil administration have introduced inflation all over the place.  These foods were the principal items in the diet of the poor and the prices have been increased by 12 per cent to 14 per cent under the same monetary system or currency or whatever Fianna Fáil like to call it. These increases are on top of others which Fianna Fáil complained about.  I stress that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I go to another area where they won <Col N="1814" /> many supporters by their manifesto, and it is legitimate and correct that we now examine their performance after 18 months.  I speak of housing.  They told us how easy it was going to be for people to build their own house under a Fianna Fáil Government.  They said that they would give a £1,000 grant and they would increase the income limits for local authority loans.  They said that there would be more money available from building societies and so on and that it would be far easier for everybody to own a house.  We know what happened. We do not deny that they increased the income limit and they gave the £1,000 grant to first-time owners. But we also know, and it has been admitted in this House by Ministers, that the price of that house increased by 33½ per cent.  It has been stated recently, and I do not doubt the people who stated it, that the greater part of the blame for this increase must be borne by the Government because they created a false impression in the minds of people who thought that now they could buy their houses for which they had been struggling for so long.  Of course the immediate reaction was that the price of houses went up and the grant and the loan structure became irrelevant.</P>
    <P>Then the Government proceeded to issue to local authorities a circular saying that we should reappraise the people for whom we should build local authority houses, that we should take their income into account and examine the matter carefully to see if they were able to build houses for themselves.  I want to talk about the predicament in which the county manager of Kildare, in my consitituency, finds himself.  The Government have said &ldquo;You can loan an applicant £9,000 now but there is no increase in his income limit.  He must be earning under £3,500 per annum&rdquo;.  The county manager is a knowledgeable man who understands the problems of an ordinary family.  He knows that he cannot lend up to £9,000 to a man with £3,500 income because of the amount of the repayments at present rates.  We can assume that, as with the building society mortgage, local authority rates are sure to rise.  A £9,000 gross loan limit on a person with £3,500 income is strictly enforced <Col N="1815" /> and no account is taken of how many children that person has or any other such matters, and the repayment on that loan is £90 a month.</P>
    <P>That is not the end of it.  Everyone in this House knows well that there is no way that anyone will either build or buy a house for £9,000 today.  The cost will be £12,000, £13,000, £14,000 or £16,000 for a very ordinary family house.  They know that if that man has the money to buy a site&mdash;which let me say has increased tenfold during the term of office of this Government&mdash;if a young married man can gather that money together he is an exceptional person.  He can get a loan from a local authority provided his income is as I have outlined.  But he must then get £4,000 to £5,000 somewhere else; that, on top of £90 a month out of £3,500 gross, having paid whatever tax he is liable for and keeping his wife and family, is no mean feat.  The prospects for the ordinary man endeavouring to house himself are not very bright.  According to the circular I have mentioned already this man will now be debarred from getting a local authority house.  He may apply but he will be ruled out on income grounds because it will be deemed that he is now in the category of a person who can build his own house.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of resource we have got from the rosy picture printed prior to the general election.  The circular sent to my local authority has suggested also that we should reappraise our method of selecting tenants for local authority housing: they must be family units of three or they should not be considered at all, irrespective of the position of a man and wife who, through no fault of their own, may never have a child. Such a couple cannot be considered for housing at all.  That is contained in a circular issued to my local authority under a ministry of this Government.  If that is the type of Government we should be supporting, saying they are great boys, I do not believe it and do not stand for it especially when I consider their budgetary practice in going completely overboard to facilitate the rich and very <Col N="1816" /> rich within our society; when I consider that they wiped out £10 million in wealth tax and wiped out also approximately £20 million in car tax.  How any Government could do that and tell a man and his wife living in a caravan, no matter what their circumstances, that they were ineligible for a local authority house, I fail to understand.  That is what has been happening.  I doubt if some people in Fianna Fáil realise that that type of circular emanated from the direction of one of their Ministers.  That criticism applies equally when one considers the huge taxation amounts allowed to the rich, to the big industrialists, to others who were well able to pay.  Of course, I know it was a very popular thing to say there would be no tax on cars after 1 August or some such date.  That action won a lot of votes for Fianna Fáil from unthinking people.  That promise was carried out to a certain extent, in that the motorist now has to pay £5 only; I do not know whether it is tax or what it is.</P>
    <P>I am not attacking them for not keeping their promise.  They did keep their promise in that respect but it was irresponsible. Any Government who would do that kind of thing are irresponsible when they did not continue the process started of reducing the eligibility age for old age pensioners.  They found it unnecessary to continue that process but they could throw away £20 million in car taxation.  In all honesty and fairness I ask where was the money most needed?  I think there can be only one answer given to that question.</P>
    <P>I should point out also that despite these tax concessions to the very few, 5,000 people, eligible to pay wealth tax, despite the handing to them of £10 million&mdash;because that is what that amounted to&mdash;they could not afford to issue the normal increase to recipients of social welfare benefits in the month of October that had been the practice over the last few years: oh, no, that could not be done at all; that was one of the areas in which it was necessary to effect savings. But they had money to hand to those people who did not need it&mdash;let us be candid and honest about it, they did not need it.  We were given no guarantee; the Government maintained they would <Col N="1817" /> create employment, do this that and the other but we know they did not.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Economic Planning and Development in this House after the last budget told me they are trying this out and, if it did not work, they would be prepared to listen to some suggestion of a State corporation, or of the State doing something about the unemployment problem.  That Minister knows well at this juncture that the tax concessions to those people did not bring about the results envisaged.  All the talk on the other side of the House is about the thousands of jobs they produced.  First we understood there was to be a reduction of many thousands on the live register.  Then we discovered there were only 65 jobs for every 100 that came off the live register.  These facts are proven. It has been said by the Minister who has just left the House that 12,000 fewer people are on the live register.  According to the best available figures, it is a well-known fact also that 15,000 emigrated in the last 12 months&mdash;some reduction in the live register.</P>
    <P>The Government's performance in the area of job production has been very dismal indeed.  They did set up an organisation, a committee or some kind of body&mdash;they are very good at setting up such bodies to examine this and that&mdash;to see what could be done about youth employment.  They did produce jobs; some of them lasted a week.  I am not saying anything against it; if a man gets a week's work it is better than none but it is not the type of action that justifies a Government talking about job creation.  They are not the type of jobs in which any young person can get any idea of establishing a career for the future.  It is better than being completely idle but no Government would have any right to boast about it.</P>
    <P>I have outlined quite a few areas in which there is no doubt in my mind &mdash;and I do not think there is any doubt in any reasonable person's mind&mdash;that the Government have failed to deliver the goods they so ably promised in their election manifesto.  I do not think there is any doubt in anybody's mind that housing is in a mess.  I do not think there is any doubt in anybody's mind that the <Col N="1818" /> Government&mdash;by means of circulars, in the Green Paper and in everything else&mdash;are determined to cut down on the number of local authority houses built Everything indicates that.  In the town of Newbridge we had 21 houses which were part of a scheme started by the Minister in the Government I supported. There are 290 applicants for these 21 houses and I was told by the medical officer that every one of the 290 applicants would qualify.  The manager asked the Department if they would allow him as a priority, to build 100 houses which would meet one-third of the demand and he was told he would have to phase the 100.  That is the kind of thinking we have now in the Department of the Environment. That is the kind of thinking on the part of a Minister in a Fianna Fáil Government which claims to be fair towards and honest with every section of the community.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in anyone's mind as to where the Government's priorities are. The £10 million given to the wealthy by way of tax relief would build a good few houses.  So would the £20 million given to people with cars.  I must admit I enjoy not paying motor taxation.  I admit many of my friends voted against me because they wanted to go on running their cars.  That is a selfish attitude.  It is a sorry state when money is taken away from old age pensioners and houses are not provided for those who need them while those who can afford two, three or four cars get the benefit of paying no tax on them at all.  This is the action of a Conservative, Right Wing, Tory Government, a Government that feeds the money to the rich and starves the area of social concern.  We profess to be Christians.  Let me tell the House about two cases in my own constituency where social welfare is concerned.  An old age pensioner who reaches 80 years of age qualifies for an increase in pension.  Prior to that in one particular case there was a payment of £1 per week supplementary welfare allowance to help the recipients out.  Immediately one old age pensioner reached 80 years of age and qualified for the increase the supplementary welfare allowance was taken away and he was back where he started.  That is the kind of social policy being pursued by this <Col N="1819" /> Government in regard to the most needy.  But they have £10 million, £20 million and many more millions to throw away in other areas by way of relief in taxation for the benefit of the rich.  I have a duty to my constituents to stand up here and condemn that kind of policy.</P>
    <P>Our people are entitled to employment in their own country.  Fianna Fáil gave us the idea that with their new think tank and with a Minister for Economic Planning and Development there would be no trouble at all in providing employment for every one.  Fianna Fáil always had a method of dealing with unemployment. Of course, it was easier when there was plenty of work elsewhere, when the British labour market was crying out for workers.  That removed the danger of critical unemployment here.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Economic Planning and Development promised that there would be employment for all our young people.  I warned him of the consequences if that were not the evolution.  I know a good part of the country and I know my own constituency very well. Before the election great play was made by Fianna Fáil, now in Government, and by people who are now Government Minister touring around the country about the non-availability of employment for school leavers.  It is still non-available. I have failed to see any availability of jobs in my contituency for school leavers.  There have been schemes.  Some lasted for a week.  Some lasted for three weeks.  If that is the kind of employment they were talking about let them admit it.  I do not think that is the kind of employment the young people to whom they were talking at the time envisaged.  I think the kind of employment they expected was long-term employment which would provide them with the possibility of a normal life, of getting married and rearing a family in decent comfort.  That kind of employment is not available, and Fianna Fáil have failed miserably in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any doubt in anyone's mind that they have failed in the area of housing.  But they have failed in other areas as well.  It was not in the manifesto, I think, but it was certainly in <Col N="1820" /> the literature distributed in Kildare prior to the election&mdash;I do not know what the word for it would be, maybe sharp practice&mdash;that there would be more money available for roads if Fianna Fáil were returned to power.  That was specifically stated.  Of course, there was more money but it did less because the cost of the upkeep of roads increased considerably. Deputies complain about the condition of the roads in Kildare.  They complain to me.  They should really complain to their own Minister.  There has been very serious deterioration in the roads over the last couple of years.  Most of those who complain only see the primary roads.  It they had experience of the county and other roads they would be amazed at their condition.  The Government abolished rates.  Both sides of the House promised to abolish rates before the election.  Fianna Fáil claim credit for removing rates on houses.</P>
    <P>The principal part of local authority income was derived from rates and we understood that local authorities would be compensated.  That has not happened. Last year Kildare County Council, of which I have the honour to be a member, drew up their estimates prior to the famous directive from the Custom House.  Fianna Fáil have a majority on that county council.  Despite that drawback they have always been a responsible council.  They did not do anything very rash and always felt there should be progress in providing services for the community.  I say that in full recognition of all the members of that council of whatever political persuasion.  In their wisdom they decided last year that it was necessary to have a 16 per cent increase in order to maintain services and carry out necessary improvements in those services.  Then the Fianna Fáil Minister said they were confined to an increase of 11 per cent.  That was accepted in good faith and there was no political furore about it.  Most local authorities had savings which they used to tide them over.  Spending was tight and they had to cut out some of the servies they had intended to provide.</P>
    <P>The manager, on the advice of the Government, included a figure to cover the expected wage increase of 5 per cent <Col N="1821" /> which was being talked about at that time.  If he had included any more he probably would have been rapped on the knuckles.  Of course, the increase was much higher than that and a productivity increase was agreed in the Labour Court and sanctioned by the county council.  Late in the year Kildare County Council were faced with an expenditure of £85,000 and the Minister said they must find it within the 11 per cent increase. They were faced with the prospect of not paying this sum or laying off workers contrary to Government policy or of performing a conjuring trick and cutting down on various works. They were very lucky because there was a dispute with local authority engineers who went on a go-slow and much of the work could not be done.  That saved the Government from a difficult predicament because they had refused to allow excess expenditure by any local authority, which had been a normal practice since county councils began.  I refer to excess expenditure for such emergencies as productivity agreements for workers sanctioned by the Labour Court and approved by county councils.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Bill removing rates, the Minister told us that local authority members have as much power as ever. The only power they ever had was to strike a rate and if they could provide money they could order a manager to do anything that was needed.  Apart from that, they have some planning powers. They had power to raise money for specific purposes.  That power has now been removed and they are confined to an increase of 10 per cent this year.  This will not meet inflationary increases, particularly in the building industry with which county councils are very much involved. I am not referring to house building which is financed directly.  I am talking about road works which involve materials, the cost of which has increased by much more than 10 per cent. Our county manager will probably say he will manage with 10 per cent because that is the message from the Custom House, but every reasonable person knows that it will be almost impossible for the vast majority of local authorities to maintain their present services with an increase of only 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1822" /> The manner in which rates are being removed is abolishing completely the power of local representatives.  The Minister has the right to prevent a local authority from deciding what money they will spend within their area. Members of local authorities are not irresponsible. They have to face an electorate and landowners and business people still pay rates.  Rates will not be increased wantonly and without necessity. If Kildare County Council were free to make the decision; the increase would be 16 per cent or 18 per cent and there would be a fair balance between the services needed and the availability of money.  It is irresponsible that the necessary money cannot be provided by local taxation.  It is fair to say that the Minister cannot allow a local authority to spend what they like, though I do not think any of them would go wild.  After all, some people must still pay rates, but unless there is some form of local taxation local authorities will not have any power.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few suggestions about what should be happening in the agricultural field.  I want to criticise the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, though I am not attacking his Bill.  Maybe he was right but it is time that the advisory services knew where they were going.  I understand that the Bill will not be before this House until March or April.  This is irresponsible and the Minister should not treat the agricultural community in this way.</P>
    <P>I shall not comment on the Bill.  It has to come before the House and I shall make known my views then.  I am opposed to some provisions in it.  If the Minister wished, that Bill could have been passed before the end of this session. The Government have been in office for more than 18 months.  The Minister made no secret of the fact that he was opposed to the original Bill.  He should have ensured that an alternative Bill was introduced and passed.</P>
    <P>There is a report with the Government on land structure.  In answer to a question here some time ago the Minister told me he intended to bring the heads of a Bill before the Government before the end of this year and he said that there <Col N="1823" /> would be legislation enacted this time next year.  I do not know what will be in that Bill but judging from remarks by members of his party and himself it is not intended to limit the acreage that one person may own.  Most of the land will be bought by speculators and big farmers if the Minister delays in bringing forward the Bill.  The Deputy on the Government bench knows that what I have said is true.  If the Minister does not take action he will be irresponsible.  The Government had a lot to say about agriculture in their manifesto and they are acting irresponsibly if they allow him to delay any longer.</P>
    <P>There was one undertaking in the Fianna Fáil manifesto that I was glad to see, namely, that we should process all our food.  This was the first time a political party said what I have been saying for a long time.  It is madness to send out cattle on the hoof when we could do much more processing work. There has not been any action by this Government to increase the level of processing work of any foods.  In Deputy Callanan's constituency we allowed a State body to close a food processing plant.  We should re-examine the Fianna Fáil manifesto as well as everything else on the Fianna Fáil side. If we mean to take action with regard to land structure let us do it, but if we do not we should be honest about it and say so.  I have often had to backtrack on things I said when I found I made a mistake.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have been the exact opposite to Robin Hood.  They have given to the rich and taken from the poor.  I have outlined what is happening in the social welfare area and what Fianna Fáil have done for the wealthy.  With regard to industrial relations, by their action in abolishing car tax and in abolishing wealth tax they created a feeling among workers that there was plenty of money. Naturally the workers demanded some of that money and the president of the ICTU has spelt that out clearly.  The workers got some tax relief but they found out afterwards that they were paying more tax.  PAYE workers have to pay 82 per cent or 83 per cent of the <Col N="1824" /> total income tax but everyone knows that they do not hold that share of the wealth of the country.  When the Government give us a true and democratic tax system where everyone will pay tax, then we may have some semblance of an incomes policy.  It will not be achieved by threatening people, by saying that they will use statutory wage measures against the workers while the wealthy are allowed to get away with everything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the previous speaker leaves the Chamber I hope he will afford me a few minutes to correct some of the glaring inaccuracies in his statement.  He used the local authority in County Kildare as the criterion to assess Government policies.  I am sorry he has left the House because he knows that the arguments he made cannot be substantiated. He knows that local authorities were not short of money to provide their services.  A sum of £100 million extra was pumped into the local authorities by the Department of the Environment this year.</P>
      <P>I cannot speak for Kildare but the previous speaker was trying to pretend that every local authority was in the same position.  I should like to bring him back to reality.  The fact is that 16 local authorities were unable to spend their money this year.  I am a member of Longford County Council and we had to make special application to the Department of the Environment in the past three or four weeks to ask them to leave us the balance of road grants that would not be spent and to have them credited and spent in early January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency local authority housing has not suffered.  This year we got more than ever.  I was amazed to hear a member of the Labour Party castigating Fianna Fáil with regard to the £9,000 local authority loan ceiling. As a member of a local authority I repeatedly drew attention to the folly of the Labour Minister's attitude towards private housing when he refused to raise the ceiling from £4,500 and an income limit of £2,250.  We have gone from £4,500 to £9,000 and we have increased the income limit to £3,500.  I would be <Col N="1825" /> glad if it was increased still further because I know the difficulties that young couples are up against in trying to get their first house.</P>
    <P>In the housing market as in any other market supply and demand determine price.  When we came into Government the land banks were there but there was no confidence in relation to developing it.  The confidence has been restored to the construction industry since we came to power and a large number of jobs have been created.  What has happened now is that the industry has not the capacity in terms of skilled operatives to keep up with it.  As has happened before under previous Coalition Governments, the emigrant ships have taken the skilled craftsmen we need for this industry.  The Deputy made many more points in relation to local authorities but there is no need to answer them because the facts are there and the people know them.  Apparently the Deputy has misread the facts and the feelings of the people.  Last June 12 months the people turned their back on a Government which had disgraced themselves and had locked this country into a recession, and looked to a party to provide the leadership and to restore the confidence that would take us out of the recession.  To this day the message does not seem to have been received by the Coalition.  If they keep trying to perpetuate what are not facts, they will stay in the Opposition benches longer than they think.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the removal of car tax as being irresponsible.  Would he and his party put car tax back on if they were in office?  Does the Deputy as a Member of the Labour Party not represent the workers who use cars to go to work?  Did the Deputy not see this as part of a package designed by this Government to decrease inflation and to act as an incentive to get people back to work?  During the previous Government's reign a national malaise affected the whole country and it was more lucrative not to work than to work.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also complained about the removal of rates.  It is hard to know if he is for or against the removal of rates. It was hard to know whether his party were for or against it as they could not <Col N="1826" /> muster enough Members to oppose the Bill when a Division was called.  If they were back in office would they put rates on houses?  I do not believe they would They would know where they went wrong the last time.</P>
    <P>The Deputy wound up by expounding a socialist theory which I do not accept, and I have never made any apologies for not accepting it.  I believe in our system of Government.  I believe that private enterprise should do the most of it and that where private enterprise fails, then the State should intervene.  If the Deputy or his party can point to any country where their philosophy has worked I will debate the issues again.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said that the Minister for Agriculture was irresponsible.  I refute that allegation.  In what way is the Minister irresponsible?  Is the Deputy's classification of an irresponsible Minister a man who can go over to Europe and negotiate the very best deal we could possibly get, a thing which the Coalition failed to do?  We now have entry into the French market for our lamb exports.  I am sure the county which the Deputy represents would not wish him to call the Minister irresponsible. They know what returns they are getting for their lambs now as against the returns they got a few years back. Does the Deputy call the Minister irresponsible for introducing a national arterial drainage scheme in the west where a boost is badly needed to bring agricultural production up?  Would the Deputy call the Minister irresponsible for introducing a new scheme of field drainage giving the farmers a 70 per cent maximum grant for draining and reclaiming their land?  Was it irresponsible of the Minister to go to Brussels and get the best price increases we have ever got?  I would give an Oscar to the Minister as the man who has done the finest job for agriculture in the short term he has been in office.  I look forward to many more years of success under this Minister.  There is no point in somebody trying to take away from the Minister's performance because the farmers know full well of his success.</P>
    <P>This debate gives us an opportunity, as Deputy Bermingham said, to look at <Col N="1827" /> the record of the Government and the Opposition over the last year and a half. How have we performed in relation to achieving our targets and how have the Opposition done their part as a responsible Opposition?  How effective were the Opposition in showing where Government policy was not working and in showing where future decisions should be taken?  The Opposition have a duty to put forward their point of view.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's EMS debate was the most important debate ever to take place here and I was listening yesterday, as were the people throughout the country, for the Opposition to bore holes in the Government's approach to EMS.  I had hoped that the level of debate would be raised by the people in the Opposition.  I expected them to try to show clearly what they would have done and what we should do now, and how they would assess our position.  I was disappointed as were the people, I am sure, because all we got was the Fine Gael Party trying to undermine the credibility of the Taoiseach.  That was a very erroneous approach.  The credibility of the Taoiseach stands higher than any other man's in this House.  We had confidence in the Taoiseach when he went to the summit meeting and we still have confidence in him.  I have dealt with European people at times and I know how tough one has to be.  There was no better or tougher man than the Taoiseach to represent us in Brussels.  All the Opposition said is that his approach was wrong and that his efforts were a failure.  Can anybody say that the Taoiseach's approach in getting so far along the road was wrong?  We are not even finished with that exercise.  It has continued ever since, as the Taoiseach said it would.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I listened to Deputies over there castigating us for the mistake they said we had made in not consulting with the Italians.  They repeated it today.  The Italian Parliament yesterday voted in favour of joining the EMS and the fact that they are in makes our position much stronger.  Anyway, why should we have allied ourselves with the country that would be looking for two or three times the amount we needed?  The <Col N="1828" /> Taoiseach went to Germany and to France, the people who hold the purse strings.  It was no advantage whatsoever to us to go to the Italians.  It will be seen when the negotiations have been completed that we will get what we need, thanks to the excellent work done by the Taoiseach and the Cabinet who went for the best possible deal.</P>
    <P>The EMS is a challange for this country and if we face that challenge we can produce economic growth that will give us the jobs required by our young people as well as an increasing standard of living.  Fine Gael have been telling us that we could not assess the position because we had not got the necessary figures.  Those figures were given yesterday in fine detail by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, but I am sure not many of those over there were able to follow his calculations.</P>
    <P>The forecast of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is the only one that has been proved to be correct in regard to economic growth. The Central Bank report forecast rates of 5 per cent and 5½ per cent and 6 per cent.  The ESRI report went along the same lines as the Central Bank, and they all settled finally for the Minister's forecast.  The Deputies over there were asking for a lecture on economics, and they got it from that Minister yesterday. I hope they are prepared to agree that his forecast was correct.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at the statement last night that the value of the moratorium was not of much use to anybody.  There is a businessman sitting over there at the moment and I am sure if he got £1 million or £10 million for five years without a moratorium that he would agree he was not getting very good value and that that value will appreciate throughout the next five years in relation to the inflation rate.  I was amazed to hear the Deputy over there talking about the lack of value of such a moratorium, particularly when he said that five experts whom he had consulted could not put a value on it.  I would not give him a job running a cake shop in Coolock.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Hegarty saying last night that we would need more money in <Col N="1829" /> the long term than in the short term. Surely the money is more needed in the first couple of years when the problems will be greatest.  I suggest that if one calculates a three year moratorium based on interest subsidy on the figures given we would come up with a figure of £70 million.  The economic brains are supposed to be over there.  I say they are on this side.  One of the rarest qualities today is common sense, and if those on the other side possessed that quality they would know that, now that Italy has decided to join the EMS, the other partners, who know that Britain intends to stay out, will say: &ldquo;There is only Ireland left out&rdquo;.  Anyway, the whole thing was political dynamite in Britain, where the Government were defeated twice last night.</P>
    <P>There is another point to be considered in our favour.  We do not pose the same problems for the French and the Germans as the Italians do.  After all, they are direct competitors of the French.  If the regional fund had been manipulated to help the Italians it would mean the French would be helping to subsidise a nation which is their competitor.</P>
    <P>The situation is totally different now and we are in a strong position.  I am fully behind the Government in going into the EMS.  I know the Government have done the necessary calculations and I have confidence in their handling of the situation.  I should be surprised if they do not come up with even more before 1 January.  I believe there is a genuine wish in Europe to get us into the new system, that the Germans want to redeem the prestige they may have lost by the collapse of the Summit, that the French have had second thoughts and now that the Italians are in, I believe they will be able to offer more money.  I support the Government, the Taoiseach and the Cabinet in recommending that we go in.  I would not be surprised if the offer is improved.</P>
    <P>We still would not know whether the politicians over there would be behind us.  I listened to Deputy FitzGerald and his price for going in, I understood, was £600 million per annum, a total of £3,000 million.  I do not consider that <Col N="1830" /> realistic or practical.  Why does he think the European system should give us £3,000 million?  Many people seem to have an unrealistic approach to this matter.  How could we have the muscle and power that Opposition speakers are trying to say we should have around the European table?  We are a full member of the EEC but we are a very tiny nation compared with the strength of the others around that table.  Some say we should not go around with a begging bowl, but no matter what name you put on it when we come back with a deal such as we shall have got when it is brought to its final stages, I do not think it so bad.  I commend the Taoiseach for playing his cards close to his chest and watching developments, because he was the only one from this House sitting at that table with the rest of the Nine and he alone knew whether they wanted this system to work.  He was the only one who could judge.</P>
    <P>Of course there were hysterical headlines screaming that we had got it wrong, that we were conned and so on. It is time enough for that when the offer is there and the decision made.  We should not shout before that time.  I believe that a fantastic job was done and that we will see the fruits of it.</P>
    <P>The Irish people got very little from the debate here as far as the Opposition were concerned.  The Government published a White Paper giving all the facts but the people expected more to come out of the debate.  The ordinary people want to know how this decision will affect them.  They could be forgiven for thinking that the debate was about the zoological gardens because they read in recent weeks about snakes, baskets, parity grids, about emus and ecus and naturally they were confused.  The Opposition tried to add to that confusion and hopefully to discredit Fianna Fáil in some way&mdash;a very unnational approach in such a serious situation.  In the circumstances we should put all our brains together in an effort to get the best deal possible.  This is for Ireland, not for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour.  That should have been our approach.  Instead some of the Opposition members <Col N="1831" /> showed distorted thinking about whether we should stick with sterling and with Britain saying that the only reason Fianna Fáil spoke about getting away from sterling was because it was a political issue, that we were trying to wave the green flag and saying it was time to get rid of it.</P>
    <P>We know it is time to get rid of it because we have seen what the country suffered in the past four or five years since instability of currency rates began in the 1970s.  We saw what happened when the Americans stopped paying 35 dollars an ounce in gold against their dollar.  That was the start of it and it has been happening since, sometimes quietly and sometimes with devaluations.  We were going steadily down.  But when we look at our economy today we are as well prepared as ever we will be, in my opinion, to go into another monetary system.  In spite of all the forecasts to the contrary the balance of payments is working out quite well this year.  We were told we would produce a consumer boom that would destroy our reserves and our balance of payments position. We know that will not happen now. Investment has gone up by 14 per cent and confidence is back.  There are problems on the horizon and we hope to tackle them later but we are now as well prepared as we shall ever be.</P>
    <P>No time is ever quite right.  When the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement was being discussed we were told it was not the time for it, that the country would be destroyed and every job gone.  Certainly, there was a watershed as there always will be when you change circumstances like that.  When it came to the decision about joining the EEC I heard it being debated by the Labour Party whether every factory in the country would be closed down&mdash;how could we compete with this and that?  We knew the balance of advantage lay in getting a proper price for our agricultural produce.  That was what we wanted and if we got that side of our economy right we knew we could bring up the other side also.  We were told by the Labour people that everything would be gone.  There was some watershed, as there always is, and <Col N="1832" /> in this situation I believe there will be some more watersheds.</P>
    <P>I am not pointing the finger of blame at the workers: I consider this a cooperative job.  If we enter the EMS, as I hope we will, there is no place in that system for stale or feeble managements that will not tackle the problems within their own industry, that will not bring up productivity and are not prepared to share increased productivity with their workers, managements that look backwards instead of forwards.  There is no place for people who will not recognise and appreciate the problems of workers in some industries today.  They also have a responsibility, and if they fail to measure up to it, neither this Government nor any other Government will have a responsibility to them because they are reneging their own responsibility to themselves and their workers. If they go by the board it is just too bad, because all the incentives are there for them to make themselves competitive. All they have to do is to work themselves.  I had this experience myself. They have the chance to do it now.  They may not get a second one.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with them always pointing the finger at the workers, who certainly also have a responsibility.  We have seen so often small groups of workers tending to go against the general opinion and indeed the general wellbeing of their fellow workers.  That I would decry.  We have seen many unofficial strikes by small groups who at the end of the day are inflicting more hardship on their fellow workers than on those they think they are affecting.  I like to see a very strong trade union movement. That is what we need in the new situation.  We need a coming together within the trade union movement so that instead of having perhaps 80 or 90 voices speaking for our relatively small workforce it could be confined to a few. A spirit of partnership is needed here.</P>
    <P>When we talk about restraint and discipline we see trade union leaders react instantly as if the finger points at them and nobody, else.  As far as I am concerned it points at more than them.  It points at everybody, the Government, the farmers and right across the <Col N="1833" /> economy when we say we need discipline to get our economy moving properly.  We must carry that responsibility, and as public representatives we should not be afraid to get up and say it.</P>
    <P>We have the opportunity to build our country into a very prosperous nation that can give us all we want out of life and can give our sons and daughters the type of things they want.  If we allow ourselves to go up a cul de sac it will not happen and the responsibility will be on all our shoulders.  We have our destiny within our own hands.  We can decide where we will go and where we will not go.  We have heard a lot of talk about the value of different currencies, but the value of any currency rests on the capacity of the people of that country. They can decide by their own actions how much carrots or anything else they will produce and at what price they can sell them.  That is the real value of any currency either inside or outside an EMS.</P>
    <P>One speaker said that we should think about what the situation was many years ago.  We can be self-sufficient.  We can feed ourselves and have small things but if we want the things we have today we must be prepared to pay the price for them.  We must be prepared to accept the disciplines that can guarantee them to us in the long-term.  If we are prepared to accept a low standard of living we do not need to go into the EMS.  We are an agricultural country and can produce enough between growing potatoes, wheat and barley and catching fish which will feed our people, but if we want to be the prosperous nation which our people aspire to and our young people look forward to we must accept disciplines.</P>
    <P>I hope the right decision will be taken when all the facts are known.  I look forward to seeing us join the EMS and accepting the disciplines that go with it, so that we can build for our people as good a country as any in Europe, because for too long we have been dependant on others to do the job for us. This may be because of our dependence on England over the years.  I believe we have the opportunity to shake off that dependence and get ourselves back on <Col N="1834" /> the road to building on the great foundation which was laid by last January's budget.  Many people did not agree with the underlying thinking in it because they felt that the Government were taking away from the poor people and giving to the rich people.  That has never been the philosophy of Fianna Fáil and is not their philosophy now.  One speaker today called Fianna Fáil a right wing Tory party.  Fianna Fáil are a party of practical men who respond to the wishes of the Irish people.  I do not expect everybody on the other side to agree with what Fianna Fáil are doing.  Fianna Fáil are saying to the people: &ldquo;That is what we meant, and we leave it to you at the next general election to decide if we were successful or were not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some of the people on the other side still take up the manifesto.  I did not stand on platforms in the last general election campaign waving the manifesto because I did not need it.  I knew what the feeling of the people was.  The people on the other side are trying to convince everybody that they have gone up in popularity since the general election, but the last Gallup poll that was taken shows that they have gone down further.</P>

If the Deputy wants to check with his Mullingar friends who have been building in Longford if they can get builders' labourers or craftsmen they will tell him they are not available. Despite this we have people who hold up the live register and say that it is the Bible.  I want to be practical about this because I think the time has come to put the people who are unemployed into sections and see what the size of the problem is.  I would like to know what kind of jobs the thousands of people who are looking for work want.  If the Coalition Government had taken the census we would know where those people are. As soon as the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the Minister for Social Welfare get around to it they should sectionalise the live register so that we know where the problem is.  I know there may be people looking for jobs in other parts of the country but there are not any in my county.  Deputy L'Estrange's area has had quite an amount of industrial development in the last few years and I am sure they have no unemployment problem either.</P>

As Deputy L'Estrange, who is a member of the European Parliament and an aspirant to the permanent European Parliament knows well, the MCA's do <Col N="1836" /> not operate in favour of canned goods from Ireland.  It is cheaper to go to the UK, bring the produce from here and get it canned there.  I am a business man. Consequently I am in the business of providing jobs, but I would not be able to provide them for very long if I did not make enough money to pay the wages. The MCA's are totally in reverse.  The man who is in partnership with me knows the score very well.  When the MCA's have gone the factory will materialise.  Indeed, there would be another three or four factories if I could find the people with the right ideas. What is wrong in this country is that while the opportunities are available the entrepreneurs are not taking advantage of them.  That is because the last Government killed the whole system whereby people were prepared to put their money into business ventures.</P>

There is no point in blaming the private sector for not providing the jobs.  Our infrastructure is not in a position to stand up to the big demands on it.  The private sector can go forward if, in a short number of years, we can provide the necessary infrastructure in terms of roads, telecommunications and so on.  But Europe is the place to get the money that is required for this purpose.  We will provide the facilities for expanding industry in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important issue by far to come before this House during this session has been the question of the EMS, but in this regard I am not prepared to follow the blind attitude of the last speaker.  Entry to EMS is a move towards European unity and to cohesion within the EEC.  That is an objective shared by this party and put forward by us since the sixties.  In their negotiations the Government sought a resource transfer of £650 million for a five-year period or £130 million each year for that time.  There was a reason for seeking these resource transfers.  Our economy is much weaker than the economies of our neighbours, and consequently we would be faced in an EMS situation with the danger that would be inherent in a rapid reduction in inflation and in our having to work within a very confined system, a situation which, if not handled properly, could cause severe unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1838" /> However, as I see it, a resource transfer is a direct grant aid, a direct transfer of resources on a grant-aid basis from the richer to the poorer countries. This is what was understood clearly by this side of the House and indeed by the country generally, but it transpired that the negotiations were not going that way and eventually, in early December, there was an offer, not of a transfer of grants, but of the establishment of soft loans to the tune of £225 million per year for a five-year period, making a total of £1,125 million.  This was to be subsidised to the extent of 3 per cent with a moratorium being put on the repayments for a period of from three to five years.  This moratorium and interest subsidy has been calculated as being in the nature of positive financial benefit and has been calculated to be of the order of £45 million per year for five years with a quantification that has been put on the moratorium and on the interest subsidy by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
    <P>I challenge the final value of that approach to this matter.  We are to get a subsidy of only 3 per cent, and that 3 per cent will have to be paid to us by the other EEC members with our paying back for a 15-year period at a rate of, say, 6 per cent, assuming that the subsidy is 3 per cent on 9 per cent.  I do not think that is of any real or lasting benefit to our economy.  Perhaps the transfer of the subsidy will turn out to be the use of that subsidy and that there may be a certain value placed on the use and availability of the £45 million.  But as an economist I am not satisfied that the real value placed by the Government on the exercise has any substance.  I doubt very much if the exercise they have entered into because of their failure to get direct grant aid is to the benefit of the economy in the long-term.</P>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, have established a constructive attitude to the EMS question.  We understand that it is of major national importance.  We have awaited the outcome of negotiations and we are disappointed that the Government failed to persuade our partners to get this grant transfer.  It appears that we had the goodwill of German Chancellor <Col N="1839" /> Schmidt but there was no direct reference in the Taoiseach's statement to Giscard D'Estaing, the French President. It is well known that the Gaullist party are not in favour of European elections, and that party themselves are not in any way helpful to the cause of a unified Europe and certainly not helpful to the Irish case abroad.  Yet this is the party with which the Fianna Fáil Party have allied themselves on the European scene and it is one which is militating directly against the position of Ireland in the sphere of unity and evolution of the EMS.  In the White Paper this week on page 7, paragraph 12, it is stated:</P>
    <P>Ireland indicated that grants were the preferred form of Community aid for the reason that it was the Government's aim to reduce the borrowing requirements as a percentage of GNP.</P>
    <P>That is a euphemism.  Grants were sought and we did not get them.  It was on that basis that the Government decided not to joint the EMS, although current rumours are that the Government have entered into and have concluded negotiations and are now considering, and there may be an imminent announcement that we are going into the EMS.  If there has been a re-negotiating position and if there is to be a decision to join the EMS, that matter should be debated in this House.  I do not agree with them when they said last week that it was a Government decision.  It is not the Government's decision.  It is a matter for the Members of Parliament to examine and decide on the merits of the case.  We on this side will look at it in a constructive way because we are basically committed to the concept of European unity and to doing away with fluctuations in exchange rates and having equilibrium in this field.  The Government need not fear us.  We are anxious to play our part in Europe.  Certainly it is a matter for Parliament, not for the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay on this matter, except to say that the manner in which the Government have handled it leaves a lot to be desired.  They sought grants and did not get them.  They got loans.  They <Col N="1840" /> got subsidisations of those loans and they tried to portray that subsidisation as a benefit.  It is a fraction of a benefit; it is not a benefit as described by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  We are getting soft loans and they have to be repaid.  The basic reason that the Government will decide on entry into the EMS is that our borrowing position has become so perilous, unhealthy and irretrievable that, irrespective of the pros and cons of the argument to joint the EMS, the Government are left with Hobson's choice. Hobson's choice is to get their hands on the cheap loans because otherwise they may have to go shopping to the money market.  They will have to go shopping because it is well known that the current budget has to be funded to the extent of over £400 million and the capital budget has also to be funded to the same extent. It is also well known that the national debt has increased from approximately £4,300 million at the end of last year to a nice, round figure of £5,000 million at the end of this year.  That is the reply to a question which I had in the Dáil.  The borrowing position is precarious and that is the reason that the Government will decide on entry.  That is unfortunate, because any decision to enter a system should be from a point of view of strength.  In this case the decision is emanating from a point of view of weakness.  That is unfortunate for the country, because the terms as laid out by the Government in the White Paper are not beneficial to Ireland over the long term.  In juxtaposition to increasing our external reserves referred to by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry earlier this afternoon it is really only a mirror job because these external reserves, if taken up, become external liabilities and must be paid back.  It is not a healthy position.  Even though external reserves may be used to pay off other external loans, it is an unfortunate position for the Government.  That is all I wish to say on the EMS.</P>
    <P>I wish to take up the question of unemployment which has been, is and will continue to be a central problem in our country, and it is a matter to which I would like to refer at some length.  I do so simply because of the dishonest <Col N="1841" /> fashion in which at Question Time in this House over the past while, Ministers have simply refused to discuss the question of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I do not mean employment.  We have tremendous statements on the figures of job creation.  We have even gone to such a length about job creation that we speak of the number of jobs created, and then, maybe as an addendum, we say that because of the time lag some of these jobs have not yet been filled.  That is probably an apology in relation to job creation.  I want to discuss unemployment. Down the years for as long as I am a Member of this House, until quite recently, the normal indicator of unemployment has been the live register.  I admit that it is not perfect.  It is crude.  It does not include certain categories and it does not include the under-employed.  It is, nevertheless, an indicator.  The White Paper <i>National Development 1977-1980</i> laid by the Government before each House of the Oireachtas in January 1978 has a table on page 20 which indicates:</P>
    <P>Reduction in numbers out of work: 1977, 5,000; 1978, 20,000.</P>
    <P>Those are specific figures.  That would indicate a reduction up to the end of this year in the numbers out of work of 25,000.</P>
    <P>I will now quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 14 January 1978 regarding an interview given by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development:</P>
    <P>In a briefing at Leinster House, the Minister said that, based on these figures, the number on the live employment register would fall from 110,000 at the end of 1977 to 62,000 at the end of 1980.</P>
    <P>That was a clear statement.  It was quite difficult to get the Minister to commit himself on this question of the live register.  On 25 November 1977 the total numbers on the live register were 107,213.  On 24 November 1978 the numbers were 98,438, a reduction of 8,775.  I suggest that figure is very far short of the 25,000 suggested in the White Paper.  Any of us involved in the field of politics know that there is a continuing high level of unemployment in <Col N="1842" /> the country, and this even in the light of a figure of emigration in the region of 14,000 for 1978.  Had there not been that emigration of 14,000, or whatever may be the final figure, let us say, even 10,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Had there not been emigration the fact of the matter is that the numbers on the live register would have increased.  Frankly, I am fed up with Ministers coming into the House, failing to answer questions on unemployment, but rather converting the whole question to that of creation of employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Positive thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not that I am not concerned about it; of course I am.  Of course I am concerned about the policies which will be prompted by the Government.</P>
      <P>I might refer now to the Taoiseach's statement this morning when he said:</P>
      <P>It is evident that the impact of the very large increase in employment which has taken place is not fully reflected in the live register returns.</P>
      <P>This is the beginning, the crack.  It is just not happening.  There is not a one for one relationship.  Then he continued to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... These have been running throughout the year in the range 10,000 to 12,000 below the corresponding figures of last year.  At the <Col N="1843" /> most recent date for which figures are available, the live register was about 10 per cent below the comparable 1977 figure.</P>
    <P>Those are the only inroads made by the Government and are not significant because of the emigration factor.  It demonstrates that the policies of the Government to date have not been successful.</P>
    <P>Concerning youth employment, the Taoiseach had this to say:</P>
    <P>In the youth employment area, progress has been very satisfactory and job creation will exceed the target of 5,000 by more than 1,400 jobs. While some of these jobs are of a short-term nature....</P>
    <P>In effect, this is what the Government have been doing with the youth employment schemes.  They are offering employment to young people for a few weeks and using that as an essential ingredient of their job creation policy.  Short-term jobs of a matter of weeks should not reckon in those calculations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy deny the importance of job experience?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not at all deny the importance of job experience.  But to use short-term jobs of weeks' duration to justify their employment policy and again to use that figure in relation to unemployment is sharp practice, to say the least.  Some of these jobs are of a very short-term nature.  It is something which must be investigated and improved if this scheme is to be taken seriously by the young people concerned.</P>
      <P>The most significant statement of all in relation to employment in the Taoiseach's speech was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the positive contribution of the private sector to these increases now seems likely to be less than had been expected, firstly, because the level of job losses through redundancy is above expectation <Col N="1844" /> and, secondly, because the bulk of increased industrial output is coming from greater productivity rather than greater employment.</P>
    <P>Surely, in relation to any job creation policy the question of redundancies would be dealt with and built into the scheme.  There is no point in the Taoiseach coming back into the House and saying: The level of job losses through redundancy is upsetting my original calculation.  It is either that or that the whole position of private industry is in jeopardy.  Why are we having such increases in refundancy?  These are questions to which I should like answers.  Of course, the fact is that the policies being pursued by the Government&mdash;and this has been acknowledged by the Minister of State sitting opposite&mdash;have led to an atmosphere of uncertainty in the private industrial sector.  Certainly the recent statement that the inflation rate will exceed the projected 7 per cent level is disconcerting; certainly it is disconcerting to employers.  The whole question of confidence, which was so valued apparently, may evaporate rather quickly if the Government are admitting now that their targets are not going to be met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to promote and maintain confidence.  A situation in which a Government go on a spending spree, ending up with a budgetary deficit on current account of £400 million plus and something similar on the capital budget side, is unlikely to lead to confidence because people in business are well aware it will lead to inflation. The Minister acknowledges this and acknowledges also that the question <Col N="1845" /> of wage drifts, which was discussed in the House here yesterday, has also caused an increase in inflation.  The absence of a guiding hand by the Government in relation to a new national pay agreement is interesting.  It is a typical example of Government leading from behind.  Whereas before the Government insisted on being part of the national pay agreement, because they were the biggest employers, now they are running for cover because it has gone out of control through their lack of interest.  They have opted not to positively promote a new national pay agreement. That is a most unfortunate attitude to be adopted by any responsible Government.  Indeed it leads me to the conclusion that the Government are irresponsible, and it would not be the first time that thought crossed my mind.  The lack of a national wage agreement, the possibility of a free-for-all wage bargaining is a serious matter the Government cannot possibly ignore or run away from, as they have done to date.</P>
      <P>The balance of payments has come up for discussion.  The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, or Bird's Eye Fish Fingers, or whatever, came in today&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a proper way to refer to a Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw it.  He was quite happy to see a worsening balance of payments.  In the Central Bank Report of Fomhar 1978 it is stated:</P>
      <P>The external deficit now envisaged by 1980, although somewhat lower than the £500 million projected in the Green Paper, is quite considerable and may prove to be a problem. Balance of payments deficits of this order of magnitude could exert considerable pressure on the external reserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a clear and concise statement and a very important statement.  The need for a rapid reduction in our balance of payments deficit was referred to in the White Paper in the context of our entry into the EMS.  This is an aspect that has <Col N="1846" /> not been discussed fully in the White Paper, in this House, or by any Minister. It is a vitally important aspect from the point of view of economic policy.  In the White Paper, page 5, there is the following statement:</P>
    <P>In order to attain this, the balance of payments deficit on current account might well have to be reduced to lower levels more rapidly than envisaged in the Government's strategy.</P>
    <P>That is an aspect that has not been discussed. This policy could lead to unemployment but there has been no reference at all to that.</P>
    <P>I would like now to look at some of the policies of the Government which will affect the ordinary people when the new year dawns.  I am sure the housewife will be pleased by the announcement about the phasing out of food subsidies. The subsidy has gone in respect of cheese and now the housewife can look forward to the phasing out of subsidies, which were introduced by the National Coalition Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>At page 83 of the Green Paper there is the following statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While subsidies are useful in moderating inflationary pressures it is not envisaged that they will become a permanent feature.  At the same time it would be wrong to discontinue them abruptly since this would give a noticeable boost to inflation.  The <Col N="1847" /> more appropriate approach would appear to be to phase out these subsidies over a period of years.</P>
    <P>I submit that is more than speculation.  It is a positive statement, the most positive I could lay my hands on.  This would be a brutal anti-social move by the Government. The commodities affected&mdash;milk, butter, flour, bread and town gas&mdash;are the items most used by the lower income groups.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Paper is a discussion document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The good housewives can look forward to the abolition of food subsidies if the suggestions in the Government's Green Paper are carried through into their White Paper, the White Paper they did not have the guts to publish before the Dáil goes into recess.  I warn Deputies opposite that if they attempt to remove food subsidies we will resist that tooth and nail because we would consider it a most anti-social move, but a move to be expected from this anti-social Government.</P>
      <P>Again, there is a suggestion in the Green Paper to tax children's allowances for the purpose of apparently recouping revenue that cannot be found in some other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was discussed at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>And I think they had a slight disagreement there also.  The idea of taxing children's allowances is a monstrous one.  They represent the only few shillings the mother gets and any move to tax them will be strenuously resisted by this side of the House.  Of course the Government can do it by stealth.  They can do it by amending the personal allowances.  This will be another anti-social move by this anti-social Government intent only on making the wealthy more wealthy still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of removing rates from houses is basically good but it is also regressive.  I am sure Deputies opposite are all happy in the knowledge that the <Col N="1848" /> lords of the land in their castles, their mansions and their manors are all tax free from the point of view of rates.  Was that a tremendously socially progressive move by a socially conscious Government?  I would fully support the removal of rates from ordinary dwellinghouses, but the Government gave the millionaires a few thousand pounds. That is a good example of the Government's social policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that rates be reimposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a clear statement and I do not want the Minister of State to twist it.  I support the derating of ordinary houses and I oppose the policy of the Government in removing rates from the mansions of the wealthiest people in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What valuation cut-off point would the Deputy suggest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>From the valuation of the Minister of State's house upwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Derating up to a valuation of £50 might be reasonable.  I do not think that would be anti-social.  I am not a valuation expert.  Perhaps there could be a graded system up to £70 valuation.  I do not want to be harsh.</P>
      <P>Education is a very interesting area for which I have some responsibility. This subject was touched on in the Green Paper and the possibility was mentioned of doubling university fees.  Is that the way to encourage people to pursue third level education?  In Germany third level education is free.  It is suggested that those who do not qualify for grants should be given loans.  This State runs the poorest student financing scheme in Europe.  The participation rate in third level education is among the lowest in Europe, and Fianna Fáil are now considering the doubling of university fees, another socially progressive step by that great party.  A loan scheme is anathema to the USI.  It is anathema to any policy designed to evolve a comprehensive system of State financing of third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1849" /> We are short of teachers, especially in the primary sector.  In the context of the numbers of teachers who will be required to service the rising population, we should be encouraging students to enter teacher training colleges.  The Green Paper is against that.  According to the Green Paper, teacher training college students enjoy a level of State support which far exceeds that of other third level students.  We need teachers but we will not encourage them.  The restrictive suggestion is made that their board and maintenance should be discontinued.</P>
    <P>In the last budget social welfare recipients received an increase of 10 per cent across the board.  They did not get anything last October, and the effectiveness of that 10 per cent meant a real annual increase of 6 per cent or 7 per cent, lower than the rate of inflation. That budget was the most anti-social I have seen in years.  There was no consideration for people in genuine need who are suffering from the effects of inflation. I refer specifically to old people, those with families to support who cannot find work and those in receipt of disability benefit.  It was a socially disastrous budget and an example of the manner in which this Government operate.</P>
    <P>Mortgage interest rates now exceed 14 per cent.  When that happened during the Coalition term of office, we subsidised interest rates.  This Government have stated clearly that they will not subsidise mortgage interest rates; it is beyond them.  Do they defend that decision?  It is the most disgusting and disgraceful decision made to date.  They want to encourage young married couples to buy their own houses, yet they run away from the problem when interest rates are in excess of 14 per cent and fail to give a financial subsidy as the National Coalition Government did.</P>
    <P>I now refer to house prices and the famous £1,000 grant.  Over the past year house prices have risen by 26 per cent, a staggering increase in one year.  A house which last year cost £10,000 now costs £12,500.  The emphasis is being put by the Government on the private sector rather than the public sector.  The effect will be to reduce the net stock of houses <Col N="1850" /> available to people who cannot afford to purchase their own homes and they will be forced into a market where prices have increased by 26 per cent.  They will face the prospect of raising large loans which, because of their age, they could not possibly afford to service.  The Government have created a serious social evil affecting young married couples by their failure to control house prices and to subsidise mortgage interest rates.  They are causing a new social phenomenon.  Many young couples cannot raise the necessary mortgage and those who have succeeded in doing so are being strangled by the interest payable.  That is a manifestation of the tremendous social conscience of this Government.</P>
    <P>My last point concerns the Common Agricultural Policy.  Consumer pressure in relation to agricultural prices is a serious matter.  There is a tremendous consumer lobby against price increases in agricultural products under the CAP. That must be resisted.  There is no evidence that the Government will get a substantial increase in agricultural prices next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of matters I wish to raise.  I should like to remind Deputy Collins that the interest rate is now at the same level as when his party were in power but there was not then the £1,000 grant.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>People also realise that wage levels have risen.</P>
      <P>The EMS has attracted more than its fair share of speakers and I should like to deal with health matters.  When Fianna Fáil came back to power 18 months ago health matters generally were in the worst situation I can remember.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the present Minister for Health took over he was faced with a Department that needed revitalising.  That Department had suffered whether from world inflation, as Deputy Collins said, or perhaps the people there were not interested in health matters or the Department was badly handled.  For whatever <Col N="1851" /> reason the morale was low, and this applied also to the staffs in the hospitals and health boards.  Finance was not available for the necessary services.  Staff appointments had been frozen for a number of years, equipment was not available and consultant appointments that had been sanctioned by Comhairle na nOspidéal were not filled.  Even when they were filled the consultants were not given proper equipment to do their work.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil came into office with a health policy that was aimed at providing a first-class general service for all.  It was our policy to ensure that nobody was denied proper care.  The Minister had a number of objectives. First, sufficient funds had to be made available to ensure, as was pointed out in the manifesto, that by better management, careful selection of priorities and planned budgeting the moneys would be spent to the best possible advantage.  It was planned that for the first time the allocation of money to the Department of Health would include provision in respect of preventive medicine.  It was our aim to ensure a better health education for all so that people would be aware of the evils of excessive alcohol, smoking, drug addiction and so on.  It was proposed to curtail advertising of cigarettes, and in recent months the Minister has taken a keen interest in this matter.  It is our policy to show young people the disadvantages of excessive drinking and smoking.</P>
    <P>When the Minister came into office one of the items mentioned was the improvement of local health services.  It is our policy to provide a comprehensive community care programme with a full range of services in each area.  While all of this has not been achieved in 18 months, the Minister has gone a long way towards overcoming many of the problems that existed.</P>
    <P>The Minister's problem was to get sufficient funds.  The budget for the Department of Health totalled £390 million in 1978 in respect of revenue items.  The amount involved in the capital programme was £20 million.  This is a high proportion of our GNP but it has allowed our health services to improve <Col N="1852" /> considerably.  Staff appointments have been sanctioned and temporary accommodation has been provided to alleviate many of the short-term problems in our hospitals.  The sophisticated equipment that is necessary has been provided and the consultants have been given the necessary facilities to carry out their work.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country hospitals are being built or are at the planning stage. Hospitals have been provided in Cork, Tralee, Castlebar, Donegal, Cavan, Drogheda and major hospitals are planned for the north side of Dublin city.  In the past few years there have been considerable delays experienced by patients awaiting admission to hospitals in Dublin.  The Beaumont hospital that is being constructed is bound to alleviate the problem.  In the Mater hospital temporary accommodation has been provided for out-patients and this will ensure that people are treated quickly.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments failed to realise that the Department of Health should also try to educate the people with regard to their health.  If money is put into sporting facilities it can help people to stay healthy.  This is preferable to spending enormous sums of money on building hospitals.  Health education is an important part of any health service. If people keep fit and well, when they do fall ill the possibility is that they will recover more quickly than those who were unfit in the first place.  This has been proved in other countries.  In Ireland the average stay in hospital is ten days but in other countries it is 8.9 days. Until recently the average stay in Irish hospitals was considerably more than ten days.  If we had a healthy people generally there would be a considerable saving in the funds provided for health and the money saved could be put into sporting facilities.  Even if a small percentage could be taken from the drug bill it would probably build a few football pitches and swimming pools each year.  This is the first time a Government have taken the decision to look at health from this viewpoint.</P>
    <P>When the Government took up office they felt strongly that no person should be denied medical care because of his inability <Col N="1853" /> to pay for it.  The Minister recently announced a change of policy so as to assess the services available to medical card holders who comprise approximately 40 per cent of the population, to those with limited eligibility, comprising about 45 per cent and to those who are presently paying patients.  I welcome that.  It is long overdue.  Many people at present have major operations costing up to £1,000.  When they should be convalescing after the operation they find themselves under severe pressure from collection agencies and legal organisations to pay the bill.  Some of these people never thought they would be sick and were not covered under VHI and have no hope of paying the bill.  The revision of categories is not finalised, but apparently medical card holders will still be entitled to the full range of services free of charge and they will be entitled to free GP services and free drugs.  The limited eligibility category will be entitled to free hospital services, and if they wish to opt for private or semi-private accommodation that will be subsidised, and there will also be free maternity services. Under the new scheme no one will have to pay more than £6.50 per month for drugs, and that is a tremendous step forward.  People earning over £5,000 per annum will from April be entitled to a free full range of public level hospital inpatient services.  They will be subsidised if they wish to have private or semi-private accommodation.  They will also be entitled to special diagnostic and treatment services on an out-patient basis in public hospitals and they will only have to pay their consultants.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that the VHI will be introducing new conditions to make it easier for people to pay their bills, if they take private or semi-private accommodation in hospital.  In most of the big general hospitals the accommodation in the public and the private wards nowadays is much the same.  The differences in meals and services that were heard about in the old days are no longer present.  The VHI have also intimated that they will suspend the 65 years age limit.  There will be an opportunity for people who have had a previous medical history and who would not be accepted before, to join the VHI <Col N="1854" /> without restriction.  That is also a tremendous step forward, and it goes a long way towards fulfilling Fianna Fáil's election promise of 18 months ago of free health services for all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience in Dublin I know that if local community services in relation to child guidance and child psychiatry are set up they will be of tremendous benefit.  General hospitals do not cater for a lot of the child problems which clinics or community centres would cater for.  Any money spent to get the children away from the hospitals and institutionalised organisations is money well spent.  Unfortunately, over the years the policy of successive Ministers for Health has been to institutionalise everything and not to spend money on community clinics or community centres.  I congratulate the Minister on the money spent this year in relation to children and I hope that further money will be made available in the health Estimate.</P>
      <P>The renegotiation of the contract with the doctors involved in the general medical services is still doubtful according to today's <i>Irish Times</i> but I hope that what happened four years ago, where a whole scheme which could have benefited 100,000 people died because of the attitude of 1,000 people will not happen again.  There seems to be no doubt that the scheme envisaged by the Minister will go ahead from April and that the contract will be sorted out and that there will be improvements in the general medical service.  I have noticed that it is very difficult to deal with the health board and the general medical services.  They seem to be disorganised, but it is hard to see where the problem lies.  Perhaps the EHB covers too large a region and is trying to cater for too many people and it cannot adequately do the job that other health boards seem to be able to do.  I know the Minister is looking at that area and I hope that he will solve these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks Deputies have spoken about the dental and ophthalmic services, <Col N="1855" /> the mental homes and the closure of St. Brendan's Hospital in line with Government policy.  Apart from overcrowding, facilities in many hospitals are still very backward.  Indeed a healthy person would not be too happy living in these conditions not to speak of a patient.  The Minister this year has provided several hundred thousand pounds to help to remedy some of the problems for both staff and patients. Works were carried out costing sums like £10,000 and £12,000 each.  They were small improvement jobs but the staffs and patients were able to see that efforts are being made to get away from the old prison-type hospital conditions.</P>
    <P>Earlier I referred to medicine and drugs and the cost to the Exchequer in regard to these matters.  Reverting to medicine, I have always felt that the drug companies make excessive profits&mdash;the cost of drugs has gone up at an annual rate of about 40 per cent when general costs were increasing by 20 per cent&mdash;and the explanation has been that the money has gone back into research.  If such money were given to the Department to administer there would be evidence that it was being spent on research and for the betterment of society in general.</P>
    <P>There is another important point in regard to the cost of drugs.  It seems there is overspending and possible over-prescribing. In this sphere something seems to have gone wrong during the years, particularly in regard to the volume increase.  Many of our drugs seem to be imported.  These are all matters which should be looked at by the Department with a view to cutting back our expenditure on drugs.</P>
    <P>On the question of local authority estimates, many Deputies suggested that this year there would have to be severe cutbacks in the amount local authorities will have to spend, and therefore in the services provided.  I can speak only for Dublin Corporation, and during our estimates meetings during the week we were told that there will be a small comparative cutback of £400,000.  I say it is small because I am taking it as a percentage <Col N="1856" /> of a total budget of £100 million. Local authority managers have ways and means of providing for savings when they are preparing their estimates. It is a pity to have to cut back on anything, but in relation to Dublin Corporation the percentage is marginal. Indeed, in regard to many important services it will be found that increased moneys will be available next year and that the local authority will be in a position to maintain jobs at the 1978 level. Therefore, all this talk about huge cutbacks is nothing but scaremongering.</P>
    <P>Speaking of Dublin, housing standards have been improved in the last few years.  In my area of Finglas housing standards were deplorable some years ago because of low cost schemes. However, the 1978 standards are a credit to the local authority.  The Minister has said that the Department will do everything possible to remedy housing defects.  We can achieve better housing conditions with even less money if we spend the money wisely and keep our building standards up.  The Minister is completely aware of the problems in Dublin housing estates.  The builders responsible for the schemes in my area were engaged in low cost building.  An IRS report stated that builders were not spending the money provided, they were building cheap houses, and they had been forced by the Department and the Corporation to return to these estates and rectify the shoddy work they had done.</P>
    <P>People argued today about country areas and the number of unemployed, but nobody can get anybody to work in those areas.  I would not say that applied to my area, where there still is unemployment but the figure has dropped and the position is better than it was this time last year or 18 months or two years ago.  It is a fair point to make that there are many people on the dole who are working in some way.  It would be helpful if the register were divided, as Deputy Reynolds suggested earlier, into those who will not or do not want to work again and those who are working.  If the latter were weeded out we could try to solve the problems of those who are unemployed. Nobody denies that unemployment <Col N="1857" /> exists, but with the present structure of the register it is very hard to know how many exactly are unemployed. Everybody here, I think, will tell you that they find that when they suggest to people that they should apply for the summer jobs with the local authorities, these people are not interested in working for that kind of money because they are getting more elsewhere.  Certainly some of them probably have to work because they could not live on what they get on the dole.  But there are others who can find no work.  The register should be weeded out and the money possibly utilised in a better way.  I would rather see the available dole money each year given to those people who are totally unemployed.</P>
    <P>Earlier I omitted to mention the recent nursing dispute.  Many people said the Government had no interest in the nursing profession but were prepared to use them, that the nurses were doing a great job, that they were all Florence Nightingales.  People on this side of the House fully appreciate the tremendous work done by the nursing profession over the years and their dedication.  It has become obvious in the past week or so that the Minister is on top of this problem and that shortly an adequate solution to the nursing problems in this area will be forthcoming, that it has almost been worked out by the Minister. The nursing profession, while they realise they have been hard done by over the years, with problems of trying to live on a small basic salary when not on night duty or something like that, suddenly realised that they should have been seeking an improvement in their conditions years ago.  There is total understanding of that attitude on this side of the House and the Minister has been working very hard on the problem.  We can see in the papers that a solution has almost been found and that an interim report of a commission will become quickly available if the problem is not solved before that.  We know that the Government will be very happy to see the nurses with a proper salary structure.</P>
    <P>Most speeches today dealt with the <Col N="1858" /> EMS, but people forget that there are many other areas, and many other things have been done in the past few months.  While people have been watching one national issue tremendous work has been going on in many other Departments and people in the various constituencies fully realise this.  It was suggested earlier that we are losing popularity and support, but any backbencher knows that the people realise that we are living up to our manifesto.  We did not just bring out a ten or 14 point plan and then throw it aside.  We know that each Department is working in accordance with what was stated and, within the moneys available, they are doing a very good job.</P>

      <P>In the course of this debate I want to talk about the Taoiseach and his contribution in a number of interesting respects since the Government came into office and in particular since the summer.  I want to talk about the economy and about jobs, prices and incomes, and education. These are areas in which I am personally interested and are all vital areas for the future well being and development of the country.</P>
      <P>First, I want to draw the attention of the House and if possible of the people to the fact that when the Taoiseach stood up this morning to move this formal Adjournment Debate motion he did more than that.  He moved the adjournment and then said in his quiet, unassuming way that the intention was that the House would adjourn until 31 January.  I do not know if this fact is widely appreciated, because if it were there would be a howl of protest that this House should be adjourning in these days for more than a month.  It is not only not necessary, it is possibly even dangerous.</P>

      <P>I am quite aware of that, but we must take intentions as they are stated, and if the Taoiseach has moved the adjournment of the Dáil until 31 January, it would appear likely at the very least, that we shall not come back <Col N="1859" /> until then.  Everybody knows that the Deputies, including the Deputy interrupting me from the opposite benches, will be working hard for the greater part of what is called a recess, in our constituencies. But the point is that unless the Taoiseach makes a later and contrary decision there will be no Dáil scrutiny of the activities of this Government or of any of its Ministers until 31 January.  That fact should be widely known and widely resented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could be of more assistance to me by not interrupting me.  Given the advent of the EMS and the other things that we are talking about, it is a rather long adjournment in the circumstances, to put it mildly. To my mind, this is fairly typical of an attitude which seems to develop with great rapidity whenever Fianna Fáil come into office, whether as a result of an election in which they defeat a Government or whether they succeed themselves.  It is a slightly imperial attitude <Col N="1860" /> to the people and the Dáil&mdash;keep those who matter in subjection by fear and let those who do not matter have bread and circuses.</P>
      <P>As a simple instance of this attitude I would quote what the Taoiseach said during a series of exchanges in the House on the question of the appropriate role of the Government Information Services in relation to the public broadcasting services.  On Wednesday, 8 November 1978, the Taoiseach said that the job of the Director of the Government Information Services is to ensure balance and impartiality.  He was referring to RTE.  He misdescribed the person concerned, as he later admitted, when he told the House in response to subsequent questions from me on 29 November 1978, that he was actually talking about the Government Press secretary.  Accepting that he misdescribed this person in the heat of the moment it is still true that he made this statement about the role of the Government Press secretary and that when pressed to withdraw that statement in relation to the role of the Government Press Secretary on 29 November 1978, his silence was eloquent. In other words, he believed then and he still believes that the role of the Government Press Secretary is to ensure balance and impartiality in RTE.  If he cared to deny it at some stage the atmosphere would be clear, but he was given an explicit opportunity of denying that statement and refused to deny it.</P>
      <P>I would like to contrast that attitude, which I described as an imperial attitude and one which flies totally in the face of the spirit of the Broadcasting Act which laid the duty of ensuring balance and impartiality in RTE on the authority appointed and subject to dismissal by the Government for that purpose, with the attitude of the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy J. Tunney, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 9 November 1978 when he was addressing the general conference of UNESCO in Paris on 8 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that in considering questions relating to the mass media my Government holds firmly to the view that there are certain fundamental freedoms which enable the media <Col N="1861" /> to carry out their work in an impartial way, so that matters of legitimate public concern can be fully and freely discussed.  Control or rigid supervision of the media by public authorities is no guarantee that questions of public interest will be presented in an objective and balanced way&mdash;Indeed its effect is often quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>This is the classic Fianna Fáil Governmental line, one attitude for the benighted foreigners abroad&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I wonder is this kind of allegation that has been made about impartiality in Fianna Fáil and the misinterpretation of the Broadcasting Act in order?  We have only to look at where the two former directors of the Government Information Services are now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Political charges as such, whether they are right or wrong, are in order.  If any allegation is made against a Member of the House and it is brought to my attention or I hear it, I will have it withdrawn but political allegations are part and parcel of the proceedings here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple point that I am making is that this is a classic example of the Fianna Fáil governmental attitude, one gospel for the benighted foreigners abroad&mdash;at home, the mailed first and the velvet glove.  This has always been their style especially in relation to the broadcasting media and it is something to which anybody who is in the broadcasting media should pay proper attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are even as of yesterday and today substantial differences between the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers in relation to certain fundamental matters. Take for example the question of the European Monetary System.  We had intervening in this Adjournment Debate today, with all the panache of the US Fifth Cavalry, the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry coming in to tell us that it was the sterling link which was the cause of all our problems and, once we had swept this nasty piece of international <Col N="1862" /> fiscal obstruction out of the way, we would be all fair set for wherever we were going.  If the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry thinks this aspect of our negotiations to join the European Monetary System was so important why did the Taoiseach not refer to it once in his speech in the EMS debate yesterday morning?  There is not, I grant, a direct contradiction but it is, to put it very mildly, extraordinary that something which the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry considers to be absolutely fundamental is regarded as being of so little importance by the Taoiseach that he chose not to refer to it at all.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Taoiseach, in the last few days, has been embarrassed and annoyed by some of the speeches from these benches which compare his policies and the policies of his party with those of the Tory Party in Great Britain. He must have been equally embarrassed, as I pointed out in the EMS debate last night, to find out that it is not among the allies of Fianna Fáil in Europe that help for Ireland is to be found in the context of the EMS but among the socialist parties in Europe.  The double irony is that if proof were needed that Fianna Fáil is fundamentally at heart a Tory party we had it again in the speech of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry today when he came in to attack socialists, root and branch, as second only to the sterling link as the source of all Ireland's problems abroad.  The classic definition of Tories is that they attack socialists so, after the Taoiseach's embarrassment, here comes the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry as a very large and voluble visual aid to prove our thesis that the policy line that that party is taking most closely resembles that being taken by conservative parties not only in Britain but in other countries of Europe as well.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the question of the economy in general and in particular to the question of jobs.  We have had since this Government came into office&mdash;and more particularly since the publication of the Green Paper&mdash;an extraordinary display of professorial attitudes by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Ireland's answer to Sir Keith Joseph.  We have <Col N="1863" /> seen the creation of a smokescreen of frenetic activity and policy making and speech making designed to conceal from the public at large what actually has happened in the period since this Government assumed office.</P>
    <P>What was happening in 1977 when the Coalition Government left office and Fianna Fáil assumed office?  What was happening at that time&mdash;and the figures prove it and cannot be denied&mdash;is that employment was rising and had been rising for some time; inflation was falling and had been falling for some time; a whole series of processes had been set in motion, and were to continue for some time after Fianna Fáil assumed office, in those twin aims of reducing inflation and increasing employment.  The simple proof of that can be gauged from the fact that the day after the Taoiseach assumed office in this House the live register fell by 500.  What economist, what politician, what statistician in his right mind would claim that the fall of 500 in one day was due in some miraculous way to the arrival of the present Taoiseach on those benches over there?</P>
    <P>Of course it was not due to that.  It was because policies had been inaugurated, decisions had been taken, things had been set in train which were having that effect on the country and continued to have that effect for quite some time while every Minister in this administration went charging around the country for the first four or five months opening things in the glory of being back in office.  It was the brand new red-painted chromium-plated Fianna Fáil fire engine arriving on the scene long after the fire had gone out, its firemen pouring water into the upper stories of the house and creating far more damage than the fire itself could ever have done, others of their members hacking down with their hatchets and reducing to matchwood doors that were unlocked in an attempt to get into the house.  Finding that the fire was out did not dissuade them; they had to pretend that without their arrival on the scene with their brand new gleaming fire engine the whole house would have been destroyed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1864" /> In fact the opposite was true.  What happened was that their extraordinary mix of policies, while they had certain beneficial effects in certain areas, upset a number of very carefully balanced economic factors and produced within a very short time substantial problems which they are only now realising they will have to sort out.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made great play of the fact that the number of people in employment over the last 12 months has gone up by a very substantial figure.  That is true but we must look at that figure in context.  The context in which we are looking at it is that of Government policy, especially that outlined in <i>Development for Full Employment.</i>  That says clearly that the first thrust in employment creation will be in the State and semi-State sector and after that it will be up to the private sector to reciprocate.  When we look at the grand total of those new jobs, assuming for the moment that they have been filled&mdash;all of them have not been filled&mdash;and if we ask ourselves how many of those are in the State and semi-State sector this year and to the end of 1977 and we look at the Government's projections for the origins of the next 20,000 jobs and the 20,000 after that, we will see that there will plainly be a distinct tapering off in the role of the public sector.  The private sector are now being asked to respond.</P>
    <P>It is our belief and one which has been backed up by frequent utterings by the private sector, that they do not see themselves in the business of mopping up unemployment to suit the Government. Mr. Hugh Munroe in a recent article in <i>Hibernia</i> said that any industrialist who is in business to provide jobs is not an industrialist but a philanthropist.  Industrialists are in business to make money, not to provide jobs.  If they provide jobs they will provide them as a by-product of making money.  We do not deny that stimulating the private sector will create jobs, but we deny that it will create enough jobs to soak up the serious long term unemployment which has always been one of our major problems.  We do not believe either that the role of the State and semi-State sector <Col N="1865" /> should be confined merely to the provision of service jobs in areas where employment can be rapidly expanded. We know that those service jobs are needed.  There must be much more State involvement in industry than has been the tradition up to recently for any State or semi-State involvement in employment creation to be radical and far reaching.</P>
    <P>When the Labour Party publish their detailed proposals for a national development corporation the Government will be able to see exactly what we mean when we talk about direct State involvement in the job creation area.  We are waiting for a plan from the Government. The Green Paper, <i>Development for Full Employment</i>, is only a discussion document.  It is certainly not a plan. I doubt the Government's ability to deliver a reasonable and rational, much less a radical, plan.  We do not get plans from the Government benches, we get plots.  The people on the other side are plotters.  The chief thing they plot is how to stay in office for as long as possible at the least possible expense to themselves.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the effect of the policy initiatives taken by the Government in certain areas as spanners thrown into very delicately balanced economic mechanisms.  There is one area where this has been classically proved true. That is in the area of housing.  The famous £1,000 grant we have been talking about had barely touched the fingers of the unfortunate house purchasers before it vanished into the pockets of the builders.  I suspect that a number of other measures had the immediate result of inflating the demand for houses beyond the point at which the present supply system for them could possibly meet it.  The logical effect of that, as every serious unbiased economic commentator has pointed out since then, is that because houses were scarce and there was a demand for them the price rose to something far beyond their real value in non-inflationary terms to the people who were to buy them.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken on this on the Labour Party Private Members Motion and I do not propose to go into it in any detail.  It is a classical example of the <Col N="1866" /> over-enthusiastic fireman approach of Fianna Fáil, throw a few pounds around and everything will work out marvellously. Things are not as simple as that. We need more sophisticated, more subtle economic initiatives than the Government have provided since they came into office.</P>
    <P>There is another item, which would be of interest to the general public, on which we should have a detailed reply from the Government.  This is an answer to the simple question: why are we still paying on some grades of petrol 15p a gallon more than they are paying in Northern Ireland?  I can think of no excuse for this other than the Government's unwillingness to tackle the oil companies, which have effectively created a cartel in petrol prices here. Before Fianna Fáil assumed office the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy was vocal in his apparent intention, which luckily for him did not find a place in the manifesto, to remove us from the outer zone agreement, which at the moment effectively allows the petrol companies and not the Government to fix the price of petrol.  We have heard very little about that from the Minister since he assumed office.  The motorists who are still paying 15p a gallon more than their counterparts in Northern Ireland have probably already calculated how many 15ps it takes to make up the cost of the car tax which the Government removed.  There should be firm action by the Government to reduce the price of this essential transport commodity.  Motorists will not get this from the Government.  I believe that early next year we will see for the first time under a Fianna Fáil Administration, the price of the top grade petrol going up to £1 a gallon.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy will find that very difficult to concede.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the question of incomes.  It is strange that, for some reason I do not really understand, despite the many speeches by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, in which he has told us that real disposable income has gone up by 8 per cent this year, the same conclusions and the same assessment of the <Col N="1867" /> economic situation is not widely shared by the people actually earning the wages and paying the prices.  <i>The Irish Press</i>, a newspaper which, in virtually all things, apart from its editorial on Northern Ireland, is to be listened to with great care wrote an editorial on 13 November last stating:</P>
    <P>Many workers today are frustrated and angered about the shrinking value in real terms of their wage packages, sorely hit by the inflation of the past five years...</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government were in power for three and a half of those five years but Fianna Fáil were in office for one and a half years of that time.  The editorial went on to say:</P>
    <P>...and with the Government trying to limit wage increases to 5 per cent, they see little hope of a correction of the imbalance within the present framework.</P>
    <P>That is the voice of <i>The Irish Press</i> speaking on behalf of the many trade unionists who read that paper.  They may not have heard the Minister for Economic Planning and Development or, perhaps, they did not believe him if they heard him.  Let us accept for the purpose of argument that real disposable incomes have gone up by 8 per cent, the real question there is: whose incomes?  The percentage rise in some incomes is obviously greater than the percentage rise in others, and it is possible for percentage rises in some incomes to be accompanied by percentage decreases in others.  Even assuming, on an average basis, a percentage rise in some incomes by 8 per cent we have to look ahead to what the Government plan to do next.</P>
    <P>What the Government plan to do next is spelled out clearly in the options presented for discussion in the Green Paper, <i>Development for Full Employment.</i> The implications of what that discussion document contains have been spelled out in turn with ruthless honesty by the NESC in their comments on the document.  Regarding table 2.7 which refers to the implied growth in certain components of personal income for the <Col N="1868" /> years 1977 to 1980 along the lines of development for full employment, they say that if the proposal is to be implemented in any foreseeable way the figures will be as follows: in respect of domestic wage and salary earnings outside agriculture, 3 per cent per year; agricultural income from self-employment and other agricultural income, 8 per cent per annum; current transfer payments which comprise social welfare benefits, zero percentage per year.  In other words, this is starting at the end and going backwards.  According to the Government's strategy there is not to be any increase up to 1980 in real terms in the purchasing power of social welfare benefits.  There is to be a 3 per cent increase in real terms for domestic wage and salary earners and there is to be more than twice that percentage&mdash;8 per cent&mdash;per year in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>The unfairness of this hardly needs to be spelled out in any more detail, but in the same document the NESC point out, in relation to crude comparisons of relative tax levels, that in 1977 more than 15 per cent of schedule E wages and salaries was paid by way of income tax, that a comparable figure for farmers' income is not available but that it is known that 1 per cent of agricultural income from self-employment was paid in income tax in 1977.  There is a gap to be bridged there, but if these proposals are to be implemented that gap will be widened rather than bridged.  The council are upset particularly by the Government's intention effectively to peg social spending.  This council are representative of employers as well as of trade unions, and they point out that it is not adequate to hold constant the level of social welfare payments in real terms, especially when real incomes in the community are increasing.  It is pointed out that it is widely accepted that poverty is about relative if not absolute deprivation and that the council would wish to see a real increase in <i>per capita</i> income maintenance payments.  The Green Paper gives no hope of any such real increase. Indeed, the price movements during the past few quarters have if anything suggested that the real value of present social welfare payments is being eroded <Col N="1869" /> by the fact that the price rises in respect of food&mdash;and social welfare recipients spend a much greater proportion of their income on food than do other categories&mdash;is much steeper than the increase in respect of other commodities and products on which these people do not spend so much.</P>
    <P>This, then, is the writing on the wall so far as social spending is concerned.  It is the line taken by the Government in respect of development for full employment. We have not heard that line being departed from in any way significantly by any spokesman for the Government. As my final example of the threat this poses to our social services, I will talk briefly about the threat it poses to education. The section about education in the Green Paper is one of the most mealymouthed statements on education that I have ever known to come from a Government.  It is couched more in terms of regret that they cannot think of a reasonable rationale for cutting expenditure than in terms of a hope that real expenditure will be increased.  I would have argued that, for example, education should find a part in a discussion paper of this kind in the infrastructure section and not in a finance implications section.</P>
    <P>Education is a developed mental activity on the part of the State, on the part of the private interests engaged in it and also on the part of both those adults and young people who are benefiting from it. The other day the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in an exchange with Deputy Kelly was very scornful of a point of view that the Deputy had advocated.  When the Deputy suggested that there was a difference between service jobs and productive jobs, the Minister said that the Deputy was talking in terms of old economics.  But if ever I saw an example of old economics, it is contained in the section on education in this Green Paper.  As an illustration I will quote a sentence from page 1 of the document <i>Observations of the Higher Education Authority on Paragraph</i> 7.33 <i>in the Green Paper &ldquo;Development for Full Employment</i>&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>It should be kept in mind that these high levels of benefit, paid for by all <Col N="1870" /> taxpayers, accrue in large part to a small and relatively privileged section of the community who also enjoy the prospect, as future graduates, of relatively high earnings.</P>
    <P>They are referring to higher education grants.  The Government's proposals indicate a 19th century view of education. They regard education as a commodity, as something in the marketplace, which is of use only to the people who receive it.  The Government view this old-fashioned and simplistic approach to education as part of an argument aimed at increasing radically the fees payable by students in third-level institutions.  I am glad to note that the HEA, at page 7 of their document have concluded that:</P>
    <P>it will not be possible to transfer any significant proportion of the cost of higher education from the Exchequer to those who benefit from it merely by increasing fees.  Such a policy would put many courses, especially university courses, beyond the means of many students unless a State-administered loan scheme were introduced.</P>
    <P>That was the judgment of the HEA on this quaint and old-fashioned idea, but there is a better answer, and this is the answer given by Professor Brendan Walsh in his comments which were published by the ESRI in their document &ldquo;<i>A Review of Irish Economic Policy</i>&rdquo;. Professor Walsh says that increased public expenditure on education can potentially enhance the productivity and employability of those seeking work, that money spent in this manner should not be regarded as a non-productive transfer payment but rather as an outlay with considerable potential for yielding a social and economic return in the future, that this also yields direct employment effects through the expansion of the education system.  That is the new economics, but the Government's Green Paper is full of old economics so far as education is concerned.</P>
    <P>There are two matters also in relation to education to which I should like to refer briefly.  One of these relates to primary education.  The Taoiseach in a major speech&mdash;a solemn utterance as it <Col N="1871" /> was delivered in Maynooth&mdash;on 3 March 1977&mdash;delivered himself of the opinion, as read for him by the present Minister of State at the Department of Education, and I quote:</P>
    <P>That portion of our education system up to minimum school leaving age is the only part which is shared by the vast majority of our people.  It also happens to be the most underfinanced part.  My Party is concerned to provide much better facilities for this sector...</P>
    <P>What has happened in this sector since this Government came into office?  It is true that new teachers have been provided, but they have been provided in a smaller proportion in the primary sector than in the post-primary sector.  The capitation grants for primary school pupils have been increased, but this is the increase to which the previous Government were committed.  Even at this late stage, there is no sign of the increase which the Fianna Fáil manifesto promised would be introduced immediately. This has yet to take place.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of primary education to which I feel I should refer, and that is the refusal of the Minister for Education to make funds available for the purchase of sites for multidenominational schools on the same basis as he has&mdash;generously, I might say&mdash;made them available for all Irish national schools.  I have one project of each kind in my constituency so I might be accused of special pleading, but these are not the only projects.  There are many others like them.</P>
    <P>In the same speech the Taoiseach spoke at considerable length and depth about two things, the need to revive the Irish language and the need to unite the people of Ireland.  He related both of these fundamental Fianna Fáil aims to the educational system.  In relation to multi-denominational education he said:</P>
    <P>Some of the ways I have suggested for trying to build friendship bridges include cross-border economic and cultural co-operation and encouragement of meetings between young <Col N="1872" /> children from different religious and cultural backgrounds.  In this context I have raised the issue of a small pilot scheme of interdenominational schools on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>Later on in the same address he suggested:</P>
    <P>Where a majority in a community wish to establish a single denominational school that is their constitutional right and the state has a corresponding obligation to provide it....</P>
    <P>Where a clear majority want a multi-denominational school in a viable school situation they have similar rights.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office this Government have put their money where their mouth is in relation to the provision of sites for our Irish national schools, but in relation to the other national aim, which I would consider to be at least as important, the aim of uniting the people and the children of this part of the island and eventually the island as a whole, across the deep denominational barriers that divide them, there has been a flat note. The Minister for Education has told me in this House that it is not his intention to extend the scheme of special help for all Irish national schools to parents trying, in the face of desperate financial obstacles, to create and found the type of school which I have been describing and to which the Taoiseach himself has been committed on at least an experimental basis.</P>
    <P>If the Government are serious about the two national aims they should put their money where their mouth is.  They should recognise that the present structure of our primary education system effectively discriminates&mdash;not, strictly speaking, in religious terms&mdash;against those who cannot lay their hands on the necessary cash or credit to pay for sites for national schools.  There is a self-evident need for special Government assistance for site purchase for these schools.  Before the election the Taoiseach spoke of pilot schemes.  We have not seen a single pilot scheme of multidenominational education started <Col N="1873" /> and financed by this Government since they came into office.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would draw the attention of the House to a splendid article by the present Minister for Education in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 4 February 1975 and headed &ldquo;The Fianna Fáil attitude to the Government's education plans&rdquo; which is a comment on the 1974 Coalition Government decision.  One paragraph of this reads:</P>
    <P>No reasons have been given in the proposals for refusing independent university status to the colleges in Cork and Galway.  This is an unpardonable omission.  Since July, 1968, these colleges have lived in that expectation. They should be immediately freed.  The Federation of University Teachers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>whom the Minister has not yet met&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;urges that Maynooth College, in view of its accelerated expansion, should have &ldquo;the option of independent status&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There has not been a peep out of the Minister on the question of when this famous Universities Bill will be provided, although that is something that in 1975 he said should be done immediately.  He assumed responsibility for that portfolio in 1977.  Not only are we still told that this Universities Bill is on the long finger but we are being refused any assurance that St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, will be given independent status without which it will lapse under the tutelage of the Catholic Hierarchy and end up perhaps a different kind of educational institution from the full university which it is entitled to be.</P>
    <P>In this Government, in relation to education, the Minister for Education in his first Estimate was given about £5 million nett for extra teachers and maybe £1.5 million nett extra for a few more things.  Any other developments that he has overseen have been achieved merely by moving around money within the Estimate and by cutting, for example, the free school books scheme savagely. But he has been given £5 million, £6 million or £7 million in his first estimate to put up the higher education grant and to <Col N="1874" /> do a few more things like that.  He has been told that he can go away and chew on that now for at least two or three years because there will not be another bob for him until the next election.  We are now serving notice on the Government that this strategem will not be ignored and will be widely published, because it indicates that the writing is on the wall for social spending in general and for the educational service in particular. We will be reminding the people of this throughout the period of office of this Government and we will not let them forget it when the next polling day comes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I said here last week that when this Government took office 18 months ago they did so with an overwhelming mandate from the electorate based on economic and social policies that had been put before the people.  These policies were intended to deal with the economic crisis which faced the country then.  We had record unemployment and the worst inflation rate in the EEC.  Listening to Deputy Horgan, one can sympathise with him because he was endeavouring in opposition to portray in his speech a situation that even he, by his own admissions in that speech, knew was unreal.  For example, he said that at the time of the change of Government, employment was rising and inflation was falling.  He failed to say that confidence in our economy was also falling, and very rapidly.  This is the basic difference that exists between now and the position of 18 months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will come back to employment later in some detail.  Before doing that I would like to comment on the other points made by Deputy Horgan.  He referred to plotting and planning.  I am not sure what he intended in his speech, but I suspect that there was some sort of plotting and planning, of I am not sure how constructive a nature, contained in that speech.  He spent the first 10 or 15 minutes trying to prove that there were technical differences between some comments of the Taoiseach and some comments of the Minister.  He did it in no convincing way and I believe not even to his own satisfaction.  I have referred to <Col N="1875" /> what he said about inflation, and I remind him of what the Taoiseach said this morning when he referred to the inflation rate for this year being about European average and about one-third of what it was three years ago.  The reason I say that is that he quoted from an article relating to the inflation growth over five years.  I am sure Deputy Horgan, being basically an honest man, would agree and must be satisfied that there has been a substantial improvement in that area created by the confidence in our economy by the return of Fianna Fáil to power.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to education; more of the details of that were taken up by other speakers in the debate.  I should like to remind him again how selective he was in some of the areas he mentioned and indeed in some of the quotations he made.  He credited the Minister at least with having increased the number of teachers; he was complimentary to the Minister there.  Then he went on to say that capitation grants had been increased because of a decision of the previous Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">

      <P>The Deputy will have to admit it was a very significant month after a long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with some matters affecting the Department of Labour and to prove in no uncertain fashion to the House, particularly in the area of employment, the progressive steps and the measures taken by this Government&mdash;referring to the restoration of confidence I mentioned earlier&mdash;that have substantially improved not only the employment situation but what is even more important, the employment prospects for our young people especially in the future.  I want to <Col N="1876" /> say as well that oft-times the Department of Labour become, in the public image, a Department concerned only with industrial relations.  There are very many other aspects of the Department of Labour that deserve to be mentioned, particularly in view of the progress made over the last 18 months.  It is as well to mention that the subject of industrial relations was discussed in a three-hour debate here last week.  For that reason I intend to concentrate on some areas of a more positive nature.  I shall commence by referring to manpower policies, their importance and the importance of integrating them into our social and economic planning.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, recently I established a new manpower consultative committee comprised of people from both sides of industry, from the trade union movement, from the employer organisations together with the essential State agencies covering the areas of industrial development, of training, of manpower placement, along with some other interested parties.  The first meeting of that committee was held yesterday.  It was my privilege to chair that meeting and it will be my privilege also to continue to chair it during my period of office.  The function of that committee is to advise on the role of manpower policy in the economic and social development to which I referred.  The committee is broadly based and will be concerned particularly with industry&mdash;when I refer to industry I mean both sides of industry&mdash;and with Government Departments involved in the whole field of manpower policy and planning and with education, which forces a vital part of manpower planning and is also represented on that committee.  I might mention as well that I believe there is a tendency to under-estimate the contribution which manpower policy can make to our economic and social development, indeed perhaps also a tendency to understate the progress we have made in developing manpower programmes.</P>
    <P>The two central elements of any manpower policy were and are the placement and guidance functions of the National Manpower Service and the training activities of AnCO.  These services have <Col N="1877" /> been augmented in recent years by a number of schemes aimed at increasing the number of jobs.  The manpower service was established in 1971 with the main objective of aiding job seekers to find suitable work and employers to find suitable employees.  This objective is achieved through the placement service. Of course, that service is composed of skilled and trained placement officers with backgrounds of experience in industry, both sides of industry, and commerce, in that particular area.  The service has been extended significantly this year.  It is important that the House know that.  Thirty-eight new placement officers will have taken up duty by years end, bringing their total number now in the 30 manpower offices throughout the country to a figure of 93.  I do not have to emphasise the importance of this 40 per cent increase in the vital area of placement because, if we have not a structure, if we have not the personnel available for a placement service such as that&mdash;and I must emphasise that that service was allowed run down, from a manpower point of view, by the previous Administration&mdash;particularly at a time of high unemployment it imposes an unnecessary and harmful strain on an already too small or reduced personnel. It has been substantially increased.  I shall come later to prove the advantage of that improvement.  In addition to the present activities there have been improvements also in the guidance services. Three additional assistant regional directors were appointed.  Indeed I intend to establish guidance units in all of the eight manpower regions as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We come now to the number of job seekers registering with the service, which is expected to be 67,000 this year, a slight increase over the 1977 figure. However, what is of particular importance&mdash;and this is one of the points I advance to prove the point I made earlier about restoration of confidence&mdash;is the increase in the number of vacancies notified.  That is a significant figure.  We expect that in this year 42,000 vacancies will be notified, which is an increase of 50 per cent on the figure for 1977.  That is a very substantial increase, a very significant one, which commences to <Col N="1878" /> prove the point about what a restoration of confidence in our economy has meant&mdash;that the number of vacancies notified to an improved National Manpower Service, by year end, will be 50 per cent over what it was last year.  This has an additional important factor, that is, that our placement service has the necessary staff and confidence of employers generally enabling them to translate that confidence into having vacancies notified to them so that they can help young people especially; indeed all age groups, but young people especially, are inclined to turn to the National Manpower Service and it is important that they have that kind of confidence. Certainly that is a very substantial improvement in an area that had not been given any attention by the previous Administration.</P>
    <P>Let me come now to the improved live register figures.  In other words, to the improvement in the employment situation, to which the Taoiseach referred this morning.  He went on to say that the live register was not the only indicator where improvements were seen because quite a number of young people going into employment are not taken from the live register at all.  Here I am reminded of some former Ministers, now on the other side of the House&mdash;especially a quotation of my predecessor in the early part of 1976&mdash;forecasting that by the end of that year the unemployment figures would come under 100,000.  They did not; they did not come even near it, nor indeed did they do so until Fianna Fáil were back in office.  The live register on 1 December this year shows just over 98,000 people as unemployed.  If we compare this figure with that of last year it represents a decrease of 8,637 and indicates an unemployment rate of 8.6&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not take emigration into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another vital factor here of which the Deputy may not be aware, that is that the comparability of the live register with previous periods has been adversely affected this year by the very welcome relaxation since 1 October 1978 of the contribution regulations for single <Col N="1879" /> women and widows applying for unemployment assistance.  The Central Statistics Office estimate that the live register figure for 1 December would have been 2,300 less had the regulations remained unchanged.  We are talking, therefore, about a figure approaching 11,000.  That does not mean&mdash;let me emphasise this&mdash;that there is any cause for complacency or that we can afford to be complacent because much remains to be done, but it is important that I should emphasise the fact that the substantial drop in the live register again reflects the return of confidence to which I referred earlier.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the inflation figures and the importance of controlling inflation.  He also referred to the unemployment situation and here I should mention another factor to show that our Government's commitment is not only in the employment creation area but that the results of some of our policies in the maintenance field have shown that the number of notified qualified redundancies in 1978 on present calculations&mdash;there are only about two weeks to go&mdash;should be about 2,500 less than it was last year.  This indicates a still further improving employment situation in keeping with the Government's programme.</P>
      <P>Speaking of redundancy, Deputies may be interested to know that following a review of the scheme, and after consultation with both sides of industry, I recently submitted to the Government proposals to amend the scheme.  These proposals have been approved by the Government and during the Christmas recess I intend to circulate a Bill designed to amend the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1973.  The pursuit and attainment of full employment has been identified by this Government as the single most important social and economic objective.  I believe this to be so and I believe it is imperative that we as a nation should believe it also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures I have given are an indication of the progress that has been made and of our commitment as a Government. Part of this progress can be attributed to two schemes administered by <Col N="1880" /> the National Manpower Service, schemes designed to increase or maintain jobs.  I refer to the employment incentive scheme and the employment maintenance scheme.  The employment incentive scheme was introduced by my predecessor and I am quite prepared to commend a worthwhile effort by him.  It was introduced by him but it applied only to the manufacturing and agricultural sectors.  Despite many pleas from me and many requests to him to extend the scheme to the services, to building and to the hotel sectors he failed to do so.  However, I extended these schemes in September of last year and I will now give some figures to prove how useful that exercise was from the point of view of creating jobs, especially jobs for young people.  Again, the success of these schemes portrays a return of confidence.</P>
    <P>The employment incentive scheme reduces labour costs to the employer by the payment of premiums in respect of additional eligible employees.  As I said, the scheme has been extended since September 1977 to the construction, the hotel and catering industries.  Expenditure on premiums this year will be almost £4 million in respect of some 10,000 jobs.  Compare that with the figure for 1977.  The total for 1977 was less than 2,700.  In other words, there has been a fourfold increase.  The youth figure contained in that 10,000&mdash;mainly school leavers&mdash;is 4,000 compared with a figure for 1977 of something slightly less than 700.  That is a very substantial increase indeed and it is very, very significant.</P>
    <P>The jobs created are permanent.  I mention this because a Deputy on the opposite side, who was obviously not aware of the scheme, asked whether or not the jobs were insurable.  The jobs are permanent.  From the figures I have quoted the House will appreciate the success of this scheme and understand what that success portrays.</P>
    <P>The employment maintenance scheme, introduced in the budget of 1978 by the Minister for Finance, enabled my Department to assist firms in the clothing, footwear, tanning and textile industries, industries currently experiencing <Col N="1881" /> difficulty in international trading.  A sum of £5 million was provided and payments have been or will be made by the end of the year in respect of some 30,000 workers from 3 April 1978 to date.  Again, that is an indication of the Government's concern not only to create new jobs but to aid employment-intensive industries as well.  A subsidy was called for on many occasions in previous years but it was not granted by the then Government.</P>
    <P>The most recent scheme initiated by the National Manpower Service is the work experience programme proposed by the Youth Employment Action Team.  This programme has specific regard to the problems of young people entering the labour market.  Its purpose is to give young people an opportunity to learn about the work environment by giving them practical experience in a range of different jobs.  It provides a very important bridge between the schoolroom and the outside world.  We know from our own experience that the young people who find it almost impossible to get into their first jobs are those with no experience of the workplace. This scheme endeavours to bridge the gap.  It certainly has been very successful. Under the programme priority is given to young people between 18 and 20 years of age who have left the educational system but have not yet got their first jobs.  After an initial induction training period they are placed with both public and private employers.  The programme lasts six months during which time they receive an allowance of £20 per week from the employer who, in turn, is recouped by the National Manpower Service.  The National Manpower Service has responsibility for running the programme.  The programme was launched on a national basis at the beginning of September 1978 and up to 8 December more than 1,400 young persons were placed in firms throughout the country through the medium of work experience programmes.</P>
    <P>I regard this as a very useful exercise, an exercise in providing young people with experience of the workplace.  To date 110 participants have withdrawn from the programme, the vast majority, <Col N="1882" /> I am glad to say, to take permanent jobs. It is proving valuable because in the short-term it is giving experience to the young person and in the long-term it is improving his job prospects and will continue to do so.  This scheme, the figures for which I have quoted, should be viewed in a positive way as an indication of the success of the programme in achieving the basic aim of providing work experience.  I am satisfied that by the end of December over 1,500 young persons will be participating in this.</P>
    <P>The other main agency involved in implementing national manpower policy is AnCO.  The number of training places in AnCO-owned centres has increased by nearly 400 from December 1977 to 31 October 1978, making now a total of just over 3,500 places available.  Taking account of all AnCO direct training activities such as community youth and the spare capacity training programmes, the numbers in training increased from 3,900 to 5,000 over the same period. The number of apprentice training places at 31 October 1978 was 1,423 and it is planned to continue the growth of these places so that all designated apprentices will have off-the-job training facilities by 1982.</P>
    <P>To prove the point I am making I think I should compare.  I mentioned the figure of apprentice training places as 1,423.  The figure for the end of December 1977 was 1,094; in other words there was an increase of approximately 350 apprentice training places. The number of training places for adults in AnCO centres at the end of October this year was 2,105 with well over 6,000 trained since 1 January.  This included some 1,000 girls and women. That refers to direct training within AnCO.  Another welcome development is that the percentage of girls and women forming that total has increased substantially during the current year.</P>
    <P>The situation in regard to placement proves my point about the return of confidence and the general improvement. Placement in the main courses over the year was 67 per cent on average.  The percentage figure for 1977 was less than 50 per cent.  I will select a few areas at random.  The placement figure this year <Col N="1883" /> for Athlone is 90 per cent as against 55 per cent for 1977; the figure in Ballyfermot this year is 75 per cent as against 42 per cent in 1977.  Understandably I will mention Cork where the figure for this year is 70 per cent as against 64 per cent in 1977.  It should also be mentioned that there is a substantial increase in the numbers training in Cork because of another extension there.  These are positive figures indicating the return of the confidence to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Training facilities have been expanded within the new centres.  New centres have been provided in Athlone, Tallaght, Waterford and Cabra and there have been a number of extensions.  Last week I had the pleasure of opening one in Cork.  A further 134 training places have been provided there.  The growth of facilities in existing locations, including Athlone, enabled new types of training to be introduced.  This included new courses of particular interest to women which were also matched to local industrial development.  The expansion plans for AnCO centres are continuing and will be augmented as required in the Government's measures to reduce unemployment.</P>
    <P>Spare capacity in-company training and training in various institutions has enabled many people to be trained in very diverse occupations.  There were nearly 650 in training at the end of October and a total of 1,661 have completed training since 1 January this year. I can summarise the figures for AnCO training by saying that in 1978 AnCO will have trained 15,000 persons.  The figure for 1977 was less than 12,000.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the availability of grants from the European Social Fund has been of considerable assistance in recent years.  This has helped in developing our vocational training facilities, and in each year since our accession to the European Community the level of Social Fund assistance has been increased.  I am pleased to be able to say that the rate of increase in the total of our grant approvals from the European Social Fund in 1978 over the corresponding figure for 1977 should exceed very substantially the amount attained <Col N="1884" /> previously from one year to the next.  I expect grant approvals for 1978 to be in the region of £29 million, representing an increase of about 50 per cent on the 1977 figure of £19.3 million. The House will note how often during the course of my contribution I have mentioned an increase of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to be able to say that we have been able to take good advantage of recently introduced improved payments procedures from the Social Fund to the extent that in the first 11 months of this year we received payments of grants amounting to about £18,750,000.  This is a very satisfactory situation, especially when it is taken into account that payments in the whole of 1977 came to just over £8 million.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the difficult employment situation being experienced by youth.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that by the end of this year nearly 4,000 young people will have benefited from the schemes which the Employment Action Team put forward in their submission to me and which were approved by the Government.  This is a very satisfactory outcome, all the more so when account is taken of the unavoidable delays which arose in the implementation of the ideas put forward by the team.  This level of success is perhaps the most eloquent reply which I can offer to those who criticised the team in the past.  They were vocal in this House in the earlier stages; their silence was more noticeable in recent times.</P>

      <P>The environmental scheme is designed to provide employment, mainly for young people, on works of environmental benefit to the community.  The programme, which is administered by the Department of the Environment through the local <Col N="1885" /> authorities, commenced in March 1978 and at the end of October a total of 1,935 persons, of whom approximately threequarters were young people, were employed.</P>
      <P>A somewhat similar Department of Education scheme aims specifically at providing job opportunities for young workers through projects aimed at improving local amenities.  The scheme relates to local projects sponsored mainly by youth and sport organisations. During 1978, 133 projects involving the employment of almost 1,000 young workers were approved.  The corresponding figure for 1977 was 390 and I do not have to spell out the improvement there.</P>
      <P>I have referred already to AnCO's Community Youth Training Programme which is designed to provide basic training coupled with work experience for young people under 25 years.  Projects are sponsored by community organisations and the results of the work usually form an improved or extra amenity for the community.  The numbers in training under the programme during 1978 will be 1,800.</P>
      <P>I am glad to be able to say that the various youth employment schemes which I have mentioned may now benefit from Social Fund assistance as a result of a recent decision by the EEC Council of Ministers which I attended. The assistance which we have been receiving from the fund to date has been almost entirely directed towards vocational training programmes, for the simple reason that the scope of the fund has been confined largely to vocational training.  When my party were in opposition we repeatedly made the case that the fund should be extended in scope to enable it to assist employment in a more direct and positive way through assistance towards job creation.</P>

    <P>The Council of Social Affairs Ministers have recently given approval to the extension of the scope of the fund on the lines we advocated so that it can assist the promotion of employment for young people.  The extension will come into operation with effect from 1 January next.  As a result, we are confident <Col N="1886" /> that the Social Fund will be available to help financially the development of various youth employment schemes.  Undoubtedly this is a most important development and one which should certainly help us to increase further the benefits we derive from the fund.</P>
    <P>As I have said, many of these schemes resulted from the proposals of the Employment Action Team.  Today I received the team's second set of proposals and I propose to have them examined as quickly as possible in consultation with my Cabinet colleagues. The Government's decision on the proposals will be announced as quickly as possible.  The team's success is all the more praiseworthy when it is recalled that it had to work outside the framework of existing job and training structures so as to avoid any unnecessary duplication of the efforts of existing Government job-creation and training agencies.  Notwithstanding this constraint, with the proposals contained in their first and second submissions the team will have outlined opportunities over and above the Government's expectations.</P>
    <P>I am aware that I have given many figures during my contribution but I believe it was necessary to do so to indicate the contribution which these Government schemes are making to economic and social development.  The figures are impressive and have contributed in no small way to the reduction in the number unemployed and to providing a better labour force.</P>
    <P>In brief, the use being made by job seekers of the National Manpower Service increased with some 67,000 job seekers registering this year.  There has been a significant increase in the number of vacancies notified to the service at 42,000&mdash;an increase of 50 per cent on 1977.  Substantial progress is being made in alleviating the problem of youth unemployment through the various employment schemes in operation for young people and the manifesto target of 5,000 will be exceeded.  Some 10,000 workers will benefit from the employment incentive scheme this year and 30,000 from the employment maintenance <Col N="1887" /> scheme; 1,600 young people will benefit from the work experience programme and AnCO will train 15,000 this year.  That proves the points I made about the return of confidence.</P>
    <P>Despite this progress there are certain manpower areas that are in need of development or expansion.  I have been aware of the need to develop the employment service to handle the increasing demands made on it.  The expansion of training services over the next five years will be on a massive scale.  Substantial efforts will be necessary to achieve the increase in the number of training places required over the next few years in order to meet the Government's targets for more trained manpower.  I have asked AnCO to enlist the co-operation of industry in providing training capacity in excess of AnCO's own resources, which will be fully utilised also.  In addition, the community youth and the spare capacity training programmes will continue to be developed to the full.  Possibly the manpower area most in need of development in the short-term is the provision of an adequate information service as an aid to developing policy and in preparing and evaluating our programmes.</P>
    <P>Some improvements have been made in our manpower information, such as the introduction of the sample labour force surveys and my Department's annual school leavers' survey, and more are envisaged including the computerisation of some NMS operations.  I intend also to have the service publish regularly classified job-seeker and vacancy data and the service will be discussing with interested parties the classifications to be used.  Nevertheless I accept that despite these developments much more requires to be done to provide the level of manpower information we need.  This area is to be discussed by the Manpower Consultative Committee early in the New Year.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of labour shortages which has received increasing attention of late.  This is, of course, another indication of the improving employment situation since it is generally <Col N="1888" /> that when we are coming out of a recession such shortages occur.</P>
    <P>Last week in the Dáil in a three-hour debate we dealt thoroughly with industrial relations.  It is a matter of concern to the Government, I hope to both sides of this House, to both sides of industry and to the community generally. As we had that debate last week I do not intend to go into the matter in detail again.  However, I should like to finish by a brief reference to recent developments in worker participation.  I am pleased to report the successful conclusion of elections in the B+I Company and the ESB, two of the State bodies covered by the Act of 1977 dealing with worker participation.  Within the next few days a third company, Bord na Móna, will be in a position to announce the results of polling held in the company. I understand that elections in Nitrigin Éireann and in the Sugar Company will follow as soon as possible and that in the case of the remaining companies&mdash;Aer Lingus and CIE&mdash;arrangements will be made for the holding of their elections following the completion of consultations.</P>
    <P>I trust the advent of employees as board members will add a new and fruitful dimension to the functioning of the enterprises and that the elected employees will make a positive contribution to their boards deliberations because they will bring with them a wealth of practical knowledge and experience of their operations.  The operations of the system adopted for the State companies under the 1977 Act will be monitored by the European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions in conjunction with the Irish Productivity Centre.  The information gathered from this initial experiment will be applied to the extension of the Act to other State enterprises and in the longer term in the promotion of worker participation in the private sector.  It is primarily in the long-term that we can look forward to the benefits associated with the extension of worker participation and the development of improved communication and consultation leading to an improved industrial relations climate and an assured commitment on behalf of employees to <Col N="1889" /> the overall welfare of the enterprise. Consequently, my Department are preparing a discussion paper which I propose to have published next year on all aspects of worker participation including profit sharing.</P>
    <P>All of the programmes and schemes I have mentioned are contributing towards the development of a comprehensive employment and manpower policy.  I look forward with confidence to the development of that policy.  The Government's performance to date has been creditable, particularly when compared with the inept handling of our economy by the previous Government. There has been a return of confidence, increased employment and reduced inflation.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil need not think that they can erase all the horrors of their maladministration, the emigration ships, the dole queues, the lack of interest in satisfying the needs of the under privileged and the handicapped.  If history tells the story correctly Fianna Fáil will be held responsible for the bad administration since the 1930s.</P>
      <P>Listening to the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry earlier today I got the impression that he too was living in a dream world.  The Minister's contribution was so comical that I will not go into it.</P>
      <P>There are two major issues before us. One relates to economics and the other to the national issue.  As Fine Gael spokesman I have been saddled with the responsibility of trying to create new relationships between the North and the South.</P>
      <P>It is an indictment of the system we operate that a party elected with 84 members should have only two Deputies in the House.  It is shameful.  I am sure many unsuccessful Fianna Fáil candidates would have been more sincere in their efforts to represent the people here. It is the Government's responsibility to provide a quorum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Security&mdash;on which I am also spokesman&mdash;and politics run on parallel lines.  The security in the whole of Ireland is our responsibility, and the ambivalence on this point is a weakness in our approach to Irish unity.  We cannot honestly assure the Northern Unionists that they will be safe in an all-Ireland <Col N="1891" /> settlement.  We cannot show them by performance that we mean what we say. This is one of the basics on which we are falling down.  Security is a serious matter; it is not a political plaything, and I will not behave as did the present Minister for Justice when he was in Opposition in relation to it.  The present Minister for Justice held the then Minister, Senator Cooney, responsible for every bank robbery, every shooting and every crime committed here.  That was unfair of Deputy Collins.  Anyone going through the records of these debates will see that Deputy Collins' whole contribution during that period was of destructive politics.  That is not my attitude.  I retain the right to criticise the Minister but I pledge my support and the support of my party to the present Government in trying to come to terms with the serious situation which exists here.</P>
    <P>Throughout the world crime is on the rise.  Urban crime is particularly frightening, but rural crime is as frightening to those affected by it.  The basic reason for crime is because we have never examined our responsibility as elected representatives, or the conditions necessary to aid socially underprivileged and politically underprivileged people.  All these people are driven to crime and end up in jails.  We deprive their families of their companionship; we punish the innocent as well as the guilty.  That is happening because this Parliament, and particularly this Government, have never been big enough to realise that Ireland comprises 32 counties and four provinces sadly divided by two political systems.</P>
    <P>The Irish are the people who live here. They are not the Catholic, the Gaelic or the Fianna Fáil Irish, but they have been born of families who have lived here for generations.  If we aspire to Irish unity, if we believe in the full meaning of it, we have got to accept that a quarter of the Irish people have validly held views, and if we want to give them equal citizenship we must reject all aspects of the suggestion of second-class citizenship.  We must recognise their right to practice their own religion, to express their own <Col N="1892" /> cultures and, above all, to hold their own political views.  If we do not believe in that, the argument of Provisional Sinn Féin is the right one: let us tell them to get to hell out of here, that they have no right in this island.</P>
    <P>What have that party done to achieve Irish unity, the party represented in this Parliament by 84 Deputies, only one of whom is in the House now?  What has been their contribution to Irish unity since they came into being in 1927 and into Government in 1932, on two basic principles: the unity of Ireland and the national language?  I will leave the progress of the national language to other people to analyse.  Irish unity has not been a subject in respect of which the Fianna Fáil Party or any member of Fianna Fáil can hold up a flag and say, &ldquo;We have served the Irish people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>They have codded the Irish people, not alone those in the South but the nationalist-minded people in the North. They have made them believe foolishly that either by physical force or constitutional means they had the power to bring those people into the Utopia of a united Ireland.  Fianna Fáil have driven them away from living with their neighbours, their fellow Irishmen in the North of Ireland; they have driven them to violence, to killing their fellow Irishmen in the North.  They have taught them to steal, to rob and to kill, and history will record that as being Fianna Fáil's contribution. As long as the violence was in the North of Ireland, as long as the robberies and the shootings were in the North of Ireland, as long as they were shooting the RUC and destroying the system in the North of Ireland, who cared, who gave a damn?&mdash;it is not our system and the quicker it is destroyed the better.</P>
    <P>We never thought that the innocents who were being killed in the North of Ireland, whether they were called Protestants or Unionists or old age pensioners or infants in prams, were Irish, that perhaps they believed in Irish unity more than some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies who have been elected on the pretence that they had it in their power, individually and collectively, some day somehow to unite this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1893" /> I have no doubt that the press when ignoring my statements on the North of Ireland, have been saying: &ldquo;When this man talks about Northern Ireland any more he switches people off.&rdquo;  Is it not a terrible indictment of the national and provincial press and of southern society that if anyone talks about his own country&mdash;that is what I am talking about&mdash;he becomes a bore, he is talking about irrelevancies, abstract nonsense, about people up there who should behave themselves and stop killing one another?  That is the attitude of the present Government.  I do not often agree with anything Deputy Blaney says on this subject but he said in Donegal last week that by their lack of interest the Government were not doing anything about Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I was sitting here listening to the Taoiseach in an adjournment debate last June.  I had got an advance copy of his script and I turned the pages to discover what he would say about Northern Ireland.  He spoke in glowing terms, and I thought that if I had been a Protestant sitting in the gallery I would have wondered if the Taoiseach were talking about my Ireland.  He spoke about the Irish people, about the Irish economy, he told us to buy Irish and to support Irish industry, and he spoke about the Irish Government.  He said his party were the largest in the Dáil because they had received the greatest support from the Irish electorate.  He spoke about the unity of Ireland, about a nation on the move.  He referred to &ldquo;this nation&rdquo; and &ldquo;this country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I wondered would that Protestant in the public gallery, who had come down here to examine our system, have thought the Taoiseach was talking about him.  I submit that the Taoiseach was not talking about the unemployed in Strabane, or about something going wrong in Ballymena.  He was not talking about supporting Irish industry in Larne or about the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; Campaign in relation to goods manufactured in Newry.  He was talking about a 26-county Ireland.</P>
    <P>These statements have been repeated in his 21-page script today.  He used terms that are inappropriate to the island <Col N="1894" /> of Ireland.  If we talk about the unity of Ireland, if we talk about Irish, the people, surely we should spell out exactly what we mean and not exclude not alone the one million Protestants that Deputy Lynch talks about but also the half million Catholics who live North of the Border.  We have excluded them and told them: &ldquo;You are not part of this Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A few moments ago we listened to the Minister for Labour talking about the direction this nation must go in.  Which nation, which people?  Whom are we talking about?  Are we talking about the Irish people and about Ireland or have we accepted Partition?  If Fianna Fáil have accepted Partition and excluded those people in the North of Ireland, let us be honest and say that we have excluded them.</P>
    <P>As public representatives in the parties which we have the honour to be members of and of the people who have elected us, it is our duty to be honest with them.  If we are to lead them in the proper direction we must express clearly what we mean.  I have yet to hear a member of Fianna Fáil, although for the first time to my knowledge the Taoiseach mentioned it today, use the word &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.  They will talk about Ireland and about Ireland's entry to the EMS.</P>
    <P>It is not Ireland's entry to the EMS: it is the entry of the Republic of Ireland.  If we say that the Taoiseach is negotiating for entry for Ireland, then we mean we will take in the Six Counties with us, and if that is the proposition the Taoiseach will be putting before the House before we go into the EMS, I will support it. There are too many unanswered questions, too many social, political and economic implications for us to go in in advance of that other part of Ireland which we call Northern Ireland.  These implications are so far-reaching that I do not understand them and I venture to say there are very few Members of the House who understand them.  There are men of high economic qualifications who understand clearly the implications of EMS membership for Ireland but who do not understand the implications if we go in in advance of Britain, because that means we are going into the EMS in advance <Col N="1895" /> of a quarter of the Irish people, a quarter of the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether other Members of the House have the same fear in this regard as a Donegal Deputy. If we decide to go into the EMS I wonder what will happen if the British Government decide to devalue their £.  I wonder how many busfuls and coach loads of people will go from the South, from counties other than Donegal, to buy goods in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is a statement from John Taylor in today's newspapers.  He is not one of my heroes, far from it.  He asked real questions about things that are happening&mdash;he was not painting a picture that is not there.  He sees many people going across the Border to avail of cheaper groceries and other consumer goods of all descriptions.  If we go into the EMS and our punt becomes stronger than the British £, it is logical to say that we will be able to buy more in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>So, it will be more attractive to them to go in there to spend their punt, but if we are being caught up in the political game between Germany and France on one hand trying to persuade or pressurise the British on the other to come into the EMS&mdash;as I suspect we could be&mdash;the British can play their final card, which is devaluation.  If they devalue by 10 per cent, may God look to the small groceries, the small businessmen and the small people who live very close to the Border in the Republic, because many of their customers will go across the Border to buy their goods.</P>
    <P>Not only that, but in the reverse situation the farmers or cattle dealers who come from the North to buy our livestock will be able to find livestock cheaper in the mainland of Britain, in Scotland, Wales and England.  There is no use in pretending that with modern means you cannot stallfeed cattle to the extent that you can be almost self-sufficient, because it has been done in countries where grass is a rare commodity. The implications of entry for the Republic to the EMS are so serious that I would say to the Government: &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;<Col N="1896" /> We went into the EEC in partnership with our fellow countrymen in the North of Ireland.  That meant we had to go in with Britain.  But we can do the same thing now.  We can maintain our independence, retain the right to negotiate terms for our own entry, but I think it is wrong and could be serious for us to go in in advance of Britain because it means going in in advance of one-quarter of the people and the island of Ireland.  There are far too many unanswered questions for me to be happy about it.</P>
    <P>I know that the British Government will go into the EMS immediately after the general election there.  That means that irrespective of the result of the election&mdash;it will not matter whether Margaret Thatcher or James Callaghan is the next Prime Minister in Britain&mdash;it is my guess, which I think would be shared by many people, that the British nation will go into the EMS.  That is only six months away or, perhaps, less than 12 months.  I do not see the gain for us in going in.  I have heard the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development use glowing terms, nice sounding talk, very convincing to southern so-called Republicans who believe in the super image of being Irish, but I wonder what it means when they say: &ldquo;When the terms are right for us, we will go in.&rdquo;  When the terms are right for us they will also be right for Britain. At that stage I think it is right that we should go into the EMS.</P>
    <P>Without doubt there is political deadlock in the North of Ireland.  The fault is not confined to the two communities there.  We have contributed to that deadlock and will continue to play our part in the continuing deadlock unless we change our attitudes and our thinking on what Ireland is and who the Irish really are.  Unless we do, there will be a continuation of violence to the degree that people will become more sophisticated.  They will learn to make more lethal weapons, to kill by more horrific means.  Are we to have repeats of bloody Sunday in Derry, bloody Friday in Belfast, the Miami Showband, the Le Mons massacre or the McGurks' Bar where a family were almost wiped out in Belfast, or the shooting of the people in <Col N="1897" /> the Top of the Hill Bar in Derry, or repeats of bombings in Monaghan and Dublin.  Surely these terrible deeds that have been carried out mostly by one Irishman against another tell us that all our policies have been wrong.  The policies we are talking about are the policies of republicanism, nationalism, unionism and loyalism.  It is no use pretending that it is loyalism or unionism that is wrong.  It is no use saying that the present people believe in republicanism&mdash;they do not understand the meaning of republicanism.  I heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs address Deputy Blaney last week in the House and criticise what I assume to be the Provisional IRA because their understanding of republicanism was different from his.  His understanding of republicanism as far as one-quarter of the Irish people is concerned, namely the Ulster Scot or the British Irish, is just the same thing only it is not decent to be using a gun: it is more respectable and, of course, public representatives are respectable; they talk about republicanism; the other fellows believe in it more so and use a gun.</P>
    <P>Whether we like that or not those are the thoughts that occur to the northern Unionists, and, if we believe in Irish unity, they are the people who hold the key to Irish unity.  Unless we reach a firm understanding with them and accept them for what they are they will never be part of us.  That is the cold reality.  This codology is portrayed by Fianna Fáil particularly.  Fianna Fáil Deputies who stand before their own convention at general election time or new candidates seeking election seek it on a mandate of Irish unity.  I wonder if they were all present here how many could put up their right hands and say: &ldquo;I have been in the North of Ireland so many times since I was elected&rdquo; or even &ldquo;I was there once.  I have spoken to northern Unionists.  I have shaken hands with northern Unionists.  I have respected northern traditions because they are Irish.&rdquo;  Is it not a fact that not one of you give a damn about Northern Ireland, about the northern Unionist or Northern Loyalist? When you get back benchers pointing the finger across the House at me because I do this sort of thing, suggesting that in <Col N="1898" /> some way I am a freak, that I should not be doing it, not alone are they dismissing the rights of northern Unionists to Irish nationhood and citizenship but they even question my right to be part of it. This superman mentality that has invaded the minds of Fianna Fáil Deputies is so far removed from reality that they even fool themselves.</P>
    <P>I have said in many public debates that I wonder how many Fianna Fáil Deputies, how many Fianna Fáil candidates standing before their conventions at general election time, would honestly say: &ldquo;I have no interest in Northern Ireland, no interest in talking to the Loyalists, no interest in trying to understand one-quarter of the Irish people.  I do not know where Northern Ireland is. I have never been across the Border.  I am not interested in Irish unity and if you elect me I will do damn all about it.&rdquo; How many honest people, believing in the philosophy of the Fianna Fáil Party, holding deep loyalty to that party and being genuine supporters of that party, paying out of their own pockets and believing the things they are being told, thinking that they have the best party in the country, the party that could serve this part of the country best, would give their votes to nominate such a candidate?</P>
    <P>May I ask those who have selected their candidates, if they can hear me through the medium of the press, radio or television, how many of the candidates they selected, voted for and nominated to represent them in the massive victory they had in 1977 have even gone to Northern Ireland since?</P>
    <P>If the policies failed as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have said and if new policies must be found to resolve these differences let us be clear about what we are saying.  We are not saying that loyalism or unionism has failed; we are clearly saying republicanism has failed or perhaps, more correctly, what we have moulded republicanism to mean has failed.  I do not believe that Tone had a sectarian thought in his mind when he spoke about republicanism.  I do not believe that Mitchel had anything but good in his mind for the Irish people or that Emmet subscribed to this kind of thinking.  I believe that Parnell, Butt or any of the <Col N="1899" /> other people who made their names in Irish history, men that people like me are very proud of and that Irish people have always had a sense of pride in, subscribed to this kind of thinking either. They were not Gaelic Irish or Catholic Irish but Irish.  When we talk about a united Ireland we should be clear about what we mean.  We mean the unity of the people of Ireland.  If that has any meaning whatever it means all of the people of Ireland without exception.  One cannot exclude one-quarter of the Irish people and logically continue an argument about Irish unity.  If one wants those people, such as the Ulster Scots who are now known as the British Irish, to be part of the family of Ireland they must be recognised for what they are and that they have rights on this island.  We have got to tell them they will have a full part to play in the Ireland which we are trying to build.  We should tell them that we are not only interested in the farms they own, the businesses they run or the property they have because that is what they are thinking about.  We cannot exclude them from the family of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In a report in one of the national papers one Sunday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs was reported as telling the Irish people, north and south, about a conversation he had with Cyrus Vance, the American Foreign Minister, at Shannon Airport the previous day. We read that Mr. Vance had reassured him that President Carters' initiative for pumping money into Northern Ireland was there for the taking, that there would be more money for Northern Ireland people if there was a settlement in the North.  On the same day's paper the Taoiseach told the nation, north and south, that we should take away the steel wall, the massive amount of money which Britain was giving to the North, so that we could force the people of Northern Ireland to the debating table. We had a senior Minister speaking authoritatively on a serious subject, telling us that he would give more money to the North to have the matter settled, and the Taoiseach in a radio interview telling Britain that she should take her money away from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1900" /> We are only fooling ourselves if we believe that the Northern Unionists are being prevented from joining us by the money Britain is giving to Northern Ireland.  It used to be &ldquo;Brits Out&rdquo;, then we had &ldquo;British withdraw&rdquo; and then we moved into &ldquo;British intent to withdraw&rdquo;. We were actually telling them that we would like them to go whenever they were ready to go; we wanted them to move out, whether it was in 50 years or in 100 years.</P>
    <P>The most recent statement I have heard is that the British policy on Ireland has failed.  The British policy in Ireland was never to unite the Irish.  The British policy on Ireland never took into account the unity of the Irish.  If we criticise the northern Unionists we should at least be honest with ourselves. Their politics is more consistent with their position than our politics are with us, because they never said they wanted a united Ireland.  They were always against it.  Everything they did in their Parliament, every Act they brought in, everything they preached on public platforms, was consistent with the basic political position.</P>
    <P>That has not been the case in this part of the country.  We talked about Irish unity but we did not do anything about it.  I believe we were talking about a Gaelic Ireland, not a united Ireland.  Our whole approach to national unity has been wrong.  I am talking about the unity of the people of Ireland, not the removal of the Border, because that can go with the stroke of a pen.  Two Ministers sitting down together, drawing up an economic plan, could make the political border between north and south like a boundary between Cork and Kerry in ten minutes.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke about Northern Ireland today and his words really meant that we believe in the unity of Ireland by agreement and by peace. Where is this policy of peace?  I have been 17 years in this House and I have never seen it.  I want the Fianna Fáil Party, before this debate is concluded, to tell us where it is, because apart from the economic problems this part of the country has, the major one is the national one.  I hope the Government take a greater interest in it.  I know that <Col N="1901" /> the Taoiseach has tried to change the direction of that party and I know that people on this side of the House have given great support to the man who has tried to drag the tail of that party away from the civil war position.  He has succeeded, but there are still people on the back benches of the other side who no more believe in the policies of Jack Lynch than the Provisional IRA do.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would look at some of the advertisements which were put in the provincial papers by a Fianna Fáil candidate during the last general election.  If the Deputy had looked at the papers circulating in the west of Ireland during the last general election he would know whom I am talking about.  That man has pals in this House.</P>
      <P>The unity of Ireland is the unity of the people of Ireland.  The Taoiseach, his Ministers and his backbenchers have a responsibility to ensure that the tragedies of the last ten years will never recur.  If they are not honest with themselves and with the people, they are a pack of hypocrites.  I know there are decent men in the back benches over there who resent me calling them that, but I am not directing that remark at them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government have an obligation to do more about the unity of Ireland.  When people in this part of Ireland talk about British withdrawal they are not saying that the British should get out of Ireland, but that the English, the Scots and the Welsh should make up their minds that after so many years, particularly during this century, they do not have a role to play in the two Irelands, north and south.  We would be moving in the right direction if the English, the Scottish and the Welsh would allow both the British Irish and Gaelic Irish to settle down to some better <Col N="1902" /> type of understanding, but the obligation for all of this rests squarely on shoulders of the present administration. All that I or any other member of Opposition can do is to speak in critical terms of the lack of interest in national question on the part of Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and every other Minister Fianna Fáil.  I would prefer that we had a full House this evening.  Then I could ask the Fianna Fáil Deputies to indicate who among them has lived up, since his election, to the basics of that party's beliefs&mdash;national unity and the Gaelic language.  I wonder how many people Fianna Fáil have talked as fellow Irishmen to fellow Irishmen with northern Unionists.</P>
    <P>I was taken to task by a senior member of Fianna Fáil for having the audacity to circulate among members of the Dáil and Seanad documents that were sent down here by a former SDLP member of the Northern Ireland convention requesting me to have the documents circulated.  With the consent of the Chief Whips of the three parties I had the documents circulated, but afterwards a Fianna Fáil Deputy asked me what right I had to circulate Union propaganda or, as he referred to it also independent nonsense from Northern Ireland.  Did that Deputy not realise that I had as much right to talk to that other Irishman about his problems as the Chief Whip of Fianna Fáil had to talk me?  Had I not as much right to do this as had the Taoiseach, for instance, the right to go to London to talk to James Callaghan or to Margaret Thatcher or to any other British politician about the affairs of my fellow countrymen?  Let us understand what is meant by references to British withdrawal, because a quarter of the Irish people consider themselves British.  That is the situation regardless of whether we like it, but these people are Irish and they wish to be as Irish as I am but they do not wish to be Gaelic Irish.</P>
    <P>Westminster can leave this island by way of any one of several methods. They can leave by unilateral decision on their part.  They may leave as a result of international sanctions or pressures or <Col N="1903" /> they may leave by our talking softly with them and persuading them to leave.  But if they leave without certain guarantees being given to that one quarter of the Irish people, we shall not have a united Ireland.  We might have a 27-, a 28-, a 29-or, even stretching the imagination, a 30-county republic but we would not have a 32-county united Ireland.  The British will leave Ireland when that 25 per cent tell them to go.  For the past ten years there has been a lot of talk from people who presume to speak on the North to the effect that we should get around the table with our fellow Irishmen and talk about the affairs of our country, but this talk is inconsistent if we say at the same time that we will only talk to a quarter of our people on condition that the British leave.  It is a sobering thought to consider how many of these people could afford to sit around the table and talk with us if we insist on that condition.  Who would listen to them after they had gone back to their own community, to their own leaders and would they be prepared to come back to us again?  We know the answers to such questions.  Would it not be much simpler for us to say that we do not like the British presence here, that we wish them to go away but that we are not going to talk to the British about the problems of both parts of this country, that, instead, we will talk to our fellow Irishmen, but that it will be all right with us if those fellow Irishmen wish the British to stay as their security, as their first- or second-line guarantee?  Should we not say to those fellow Irishmen that we want to share Ireland with them in full partnership?</P>
    <P>Would it not be better to assure our fellow Irishmen in the North that we will not make any condition about their joining us, that we want a twin constitutional position, that they should tell us what agreement they can come to with the Catholic nationalist people in the North?  We should tell them that in such a situation we would change our Constitution in order to guarantee their position.  Is it not time that the Taoiseach was saying to people on both sides in the North that they should settle their differences and that we would be prepared <Col N="1904" /> to make our contribution by changing that little piece of paper known as our Constitution in order to guarantee any arrangement they would have entered into among themselves?  This is the only way forward.</P>
    <P>What is the difference between our saying that we want the Unionists to join us by agreement of a majority and the statement of the British to the effect that they will leave Ireland when the majority of people there tell them to go?  As Deputy Blaney said in Milford last week, the Irish are the ones who are keeping the British in Ireland.  It is time that the Gaelic Irish, the British Irish, Catholic and Protestant Irish, pushed aside the extremists on both sides and built an Ireland of which we could all be proud. Then Westminster will withdraw and be glad to.</P>

      <P>If there was much more time available to me I would be tempted to follow Deputy Harte, but I have said so much recently on the subject of Northern Ireland that I do not propose now to devote to it the time available to me except to say that I think the Deputy is coming around to a fairly straight-on indication that there can be agreement among the Irish in this country but that there cannot be such agreement while the British persist in remaining, regardless of what guise they adopt.  I am not saying anything further this evening on that matter although I may have a few comments on it in the morning. Instead, I wish to continue now on what was a rather hurried contribution last night to the EMS debate when I finished on the note that productivity in this country is the answer to our fears and hopes in so far as the EMS is concerned. If we had productivity and full employment we would not care two hoots whether we entered the EMS or stayed out of it, nor would we need any handout to make it possible for us to go in in the immediate future, I hope that that view is in the Government's mind now because I have no doubt that they are going in and I would not be surprised if they had already made the decision to go in although it has not been conveyed officially as yet.  Unless we are fully convinced <Col N="1905" /> that our currency, whether inside or outside the EMS, is the only true reflection of our productivity, there can be nothing but disaster for us whether we join the EMS or not.  If we regard our currency or that of any other country as a token for work done, then if we had more work done we would have more tokens, or if we had fewer tokens they would be worth more if we were doing more work in respect of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can we possibly achieve that when we have the staggering figure, give or take a few thousand in one reason as against another, of 100,000 of our people unemployed at a time when there is an abundance of absolutely essential work to be done?  People are crying out to have it done.  What sort of work is this?  It is providing the houses that our growing population have not got.  It is improving the roads that are creaking and groaning under the over-heavy loads of present-day traffic and machines and juggernauts commuting between here and the Continent and across the channel. It is the services to back up our housing and the general infrastructure of sewerage and water.  These are the things that are crying out to be done at the moment. When this Government came into office I had great hopes that they were going to make a real go of it.  We could have produced these things while we paid 100,000 of our population on average almost as much as it would cost nett if they had been employed producing these essential, useful and desirable commodities.  These things are costing today from 30 per cent to 50 per cent more than they would have cost if the Fianna Fáil Government, after taking over from the Coalition in 1977, had gone about their business as their manifesto would seem to have indicated. That manifesto helped them to get the overwhelming majority that they got, although they would have got the majority if they had had no manifesto at all. It was not a question of seeking to put Fianna Fáil in when the vast majority of our people voted as they did in 1977.  It was rather a conviction that they had to get the Coalition out.  Fianna Fáil made all the necessary sounds and said all the necessary things.  After the election we had a very fast adjournment, which I <Col N="1906" /> deplored.  We should have been talking all that summer through about what we should begin with in the autumn, rather than putting the House in mothballs, going off and making no real impact before the autumn.  By the time the autumn arrived the Fianna Fáil majority who had swept into office a few short months before had stagnated.  They had lost the enthusiasm, drive and euphoria that was theirs to utilise to get the population back working and thus lift ourselves out of the dilemma that we are still in.  Idling our way out cannot but lead to further disaster.</P>
    <P>Since that autumn there have been slight indications of faint-hearted efforts by the Government, who were doing far too little to make any impression on the unemployed or on the economic growth of this country.  We had indications of more people being employed as gardai, teachers and doctors.  That is all very desirable, even if not entirely essential at the time.  All of it was good stuff had it been backed up by ten times as many being put into employment that would create employment.  I am talking particularly about the construction industry which embraces houses, roads, schools, hospitals, clinics, sewerage, water schemes and what have you.  All of these are within the competence of our construction industry which, at the time Fianna Fáil took office, had on the register of unemployed 25,000 more people than had been employed in that industry three years previously.  We were back to 40,000 in the construction industry from a peak three years before of 65,000.  If we had put people to work on the sites at the various jobs I am talking about&mdash;for which we have oodles of plans that have been delayed since sanction because allegedly we have not enough money to do them all together&mdash;and had we made a bold start after the summer of 1977, by now we could have expected that, having geared things up, we would have recovered that 25,000 who were then unemployed.</P>
    <P>For every fully employed person in the construction industry, on a buildings site, on public works or public buildings one other employee is required in the factories and in the workshops, perhaps <Col N="1907" /> with a little delay.  Maybe six months would elapse before such people would come fully on stream, but on they would come.  We should have increased that 40,000 up to 65,000 by now, 18 months after the Government came in.  With this great opportunity and with backing such as no other Government since the foundation of this State had ever had, they should have been able to do that.  Sadly, at this stage they are no longer capable of generating the sort of confidence that would have enabled them to raise the moneys that they would have needed in order to get more people out of the dole queues and on to productive work.  If they had been employed they would by now have created employment for another 25,000 of our unemployed in the workshops and factories fabricating more and more of the off-site components for our construction industry.  I am not exaggerating when I say that one on site fully occupied on stream in the construction industry means one off site in the workshops and factories producing the components.  It would be fine today if, instead of unemployment bordering on 100,000, give or take 5,000 or 10,000, it was down to 50,000.</P>
    <P>It is also a fact that for every three wage packets created and being paid per week for any lengthy periods in the service industries we require one more to service those.  Therefore, if you get 25,000 on site and 25,000 off site in the year ahead, we would be moving slowly into full gear in which we could add one-third to the 50,000, bringing it to well over 65,000.  If we had that would we not consider that the unemployment situation in the country was already defeated, that we were already really in business?  Think of the situation that would be obtaining now, the upsurge that that sort of movement would have brought about, the contentment as well as the employment it would have given, the new houses that would have been occupied now but that have not even left the drawing board at this stage.  Think of the economic activity, the business activity, the absolute regeneration of the confidence of our people so sadly shattered not only by the Coalition of the <Col N="1908" /> last period but indeed even by the previous Government, neither of them not to be blamed in full because galloping inflation had really demoralised our people to the extent that they were in 1977.</P>
    <P>Why then do we find the economic wizards now posing as the spokesmen for Fianna Fáil; why do we have them now coming along trying to bamboozle us with figures as to whether it is 11,000, 14,000, 19,000 or 20,000; that the live register does not count any more, that which was the only yardstick we had known over the years is thrown out the window; we are not allowed consider it any more?  What we are being told is that the Government are guaranteeing 20,000 jobs or 25,000 jobs, they may not quite make it but they will go very near it.  If we point out that despite that, they have not reduced the number of unemployed by a like amount we are told that we were never promised that&mdash;that in this purely technical jargon that now stands for policy statements, we are entitled to look at the small print, the invisible print, the print that is not there at all to decipher, before an election, or in a policy document of a major party, that what was regarded heretofore as an ordinary statement of fact, that is, that we will put 20,000 more people into employment&mdash;the corollary always has been that it is the net that counts and not the gross.  We are being told now that that figure of 20,000, though not quite accessible at this time, for various reasons, is the fault of others outside, in the private sector, in the unions; these people are to blame if we do not reach it. We are being told: but even if we were to reach it more is being done than is shown in those figures because our population is rising: rising in what way?  Rising in a way we have not seen since 1970 when, for the first time not only had emigration ceased but there was a gradual building up of our population not alone through natural causes and events but by the return of numbers of our migrants and emigrants who had left these shores in past or in recent years. That has now changed, not dramatically, for the good reason that the attractions across the channel do not exist as they did ten years ago.  There would be a <Col N="1909" /> flood out of this country on the emigrant ships again if times in Britain were as good now and if employment was as available as it was in the past.  If it is only rearing its ugly head at present in a slow, crawling fashion it is not because of our attraction to the unemployed to remain here half so much as it is the lack of attraction, the lack of work and the poor times there are across channel in Britain.</P>
    <P>These are the facts as we know them. Nobody knows them better than the people from my part of the country and along the western seaboard.  Indeed in my own county we have the highest percentage of unemployed in the country.  What are the Government doing about it?  What about the roads which are becoming impassable, not capable of carrying the type of traffic now on them, a county that has no rail service.  Heretofore at all the old abandoned railway stations we had goods depots, which have been taken from us in the recent past, to be followed by the most recent decision of our State enterprise, CIE, that the goods depot in Derry is now to be abolished and we can go to Sligo as our rail head.  That is the score so far as rail is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have no shipping service in or out of Donegal in any scheduled way, nor does there seem to be any wish on the part of this Government, or indeed any other Government, even if it must be subsidised, to provide that much needed outlet for a county that has not got a rail service of any kind.  Neither do we have any air service, none whatsoever.  We are being panned off all too simply in too many places with landing strips, if you do not mind, to serve whom?  To serve how many, in what way, while there is undoubtedly the opportunity at least equal to that of the Cork region in Donegal, serving Derry and Tyrone as well as Donegal, to provide an airport of modest dimensions from which our people could come and go by scheduled service to the main airports of Dublin and Shannon, or across channel as the case might be.  No, we do not have that; we do not have the shipping and neither do we have the rail service.</P>
    <P>We do not have RTE television except <Col N="1910" /> by freak reception.  If it was to be measured against the present situation and technological development we might say that we practically have no telephone service either.  As I have said, our roads cannot much longer continue to be used as a means of access, which is our only means of access into Donegal. They were never conceived or built to carry the traffic now on them.  All too frequently, even after lots of money being spent on renewing, strengthening and building up some of the so-called main roads, we find notices here and there &ldquo;soft margins&rdquo;.  What that really means is that the cart tracks of 50 and 100 years ago are being covered over, gradually a little more being spread out on both sides each time to try and accommodate the traffic, with nothing underneath to sustain them.  Those are the type of roads we have got mainly in our county, a county with no rail, air or shipping service; practically no telephone service and only by freak and act of God do we have any television reception from RTE.</P>
    <P>What are the Government going to do about it in these times when we have the highest percentage of unemployed in this country in our county; when we have an alarming figure of 100,000 or thereabouts unemployed in this country; when we badly need more houses; when we badly need more schools; when we need extensions to existing and new hospitals built for our people; when we need more water schemes, more sewerage schemes, more public buildings, while we have our people queuing up being paid social welfare with all the demoralisation that that type of living entails?</P>
    <P>We could, we should, we can, but will we, even at this stage&mdash;18 months removed from the advent of the present Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;do the simple, obvious but imaginative thing of deciding that we can and will usefully employ the vast majority of our unemployed of today by putting them to work, not building dry land piers as the British once did, or towers from which the lords and ladies could view the surrounding scenery, but useful things our people need which, ten years from now, <Col N="1911" /> will still provide, at two or three times the cost today, while in the meantime, denying our population those facilities they could enjoy and do not, create the activity, growth and confidence our people so badly need.</P>
    <P>That would be the true answer by the Taoiseach, his advisers and the other Ministers of the Government would gladly be able to use in talking to the partners in the EEC when they are talking about whether we are going around with begging bowls or whatnot.  If we did what is within our own competence&mdash; employ our people doing useful work and step up our overall national productivity&mdash;we need not give two hoots one way or the other whether the other partners wanted us in the EMS or wanted us out.  We would be quite safe, high and dry.  Our feet would never be wet or cold if we did this instead of frittering away the opportunity and with the prospect that in the future the gloom would descend even deeper than it is now.</P>
    <P>There is no way in which a nation, never mind an individual, can idle its way out of its difficulties but, and this has been proved time without number, as the individual can work his way out of his difficulties so also can a nation. But it must have the leadership, and only a Government can give that, and this Government, while thinking along right lines, have been too puny in their efforts, too unimaginative in their thoughts and concepts and have not had the courage really to put their foot down, get stuck in and get on with the job.  We have now an EEC of which we have been a member for some considerable time, an EEC for which I, though somewhat estranged, if not already removed, from Fianna Fáil, campaigned in the referendum that brought our entry about with an overwhelming majority.</P>
    <P>I did not campaign with any sort of rose tinted glasses on.  I campaigned on the basis that, taking two columns, one for and one against, in the last analysis, taking all the broad spectrum into view, we would lose more by staying out than going in.  I still hold to that view and while the counter to that may be things <Col N="1912" /> were so much better now than they were then, I admit they are so much better than they were then in any given walk of life, but what we have got to look at is how far have we got in the grand plan that was the concept, through the Treaty of Rome, in the creation of the EEC, which was to close the gap between the not-so-well-off and the better off nations of Europe.  That gap has not closed despite the fact that each of the member countries of the EEC may without question be regarded as better off today but, relatively speaking, we are not better off <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other members.  We are, in fact, worse off.  We are at the bottom of the pile in so far as the prosperity of our economy is concerned within the concept of the EEC.</P>
    <P>The regional fund was held out&mdash;I held it out much to my regret now&mdash;to the people of my constituency and the people of the west in the undeveloped part of the country as the answer to many of the fears that were then being expressed as to what the EEC would mean to them.  We held it out, as we were told to hold it out, as was indicated by our Government leadership at the time, that the regional fund would in fact do great things for the undeveloped regions to bring them up on a par with the better-off regions of the south and east.  What has happened?  That story has not come true and the regional fund is not a big handout that was going to bring the west up to par.</P>
    <P>The regional fund is, in fact, largely a fake.  It is of such dimensions that it merely fills out the wrinkles in the budgetary bag brought in here by successive Ministers for Finance in recent years and it looks as if that is all it will be in the future.  Niggardly though it is, and despite the little impact it may have made, what do we find?  I had a reply to a question here tabled to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. He defended the role of the Government in utilising the fund by spreading it all over the country.  His answer to me, in defence of that policy was that, because of the fact that within the EEC our entire 26 counties is regarded as an undeveloped area for regional fund purposes, if he were to confine the use of the <Col N="1913" /> fund to the western areas, where it is so badly needed and to the people of which it was promised, he would in fact be cutting the ground from under his own feet when the regional fund amounts for the following year were going to be considered because his partners in the EEC would say: &ldquo;Not all of your country is undeveloped and, therefore, we will have to reduce still further your regional fund&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the greatest nonsense I have ever heard.  Theoretically, we are regarded as undeveloped for the purpose of the fund, but there is no convention in the Treaty of Rome or in the EEC that dictates that our Government, elected by the people and operating and administering the affairs of this 26-county State, may not spend that regional fund money <i>in toto</i> in western regions where it is badly needed and for which it was earmarked initially Neither is there anything to dictate why they could not, in fact, spend all of it any one or two years in the one place under the one bracket.  So much for all the talk about the regional fund and why it is being spread around.  We find multinational companies getting slices of it by the £1 million to keep them in business, people who could in fact give us millions more than we are getting from the regional fund.  But what are we doing?  We are bolstering them up by taking money out of this all too small regional fund allocation to keep them going.</P>
    <P>This fund needs re-examination by the Government.  The whole western way of life needs looking at by the Government and if the regional fund, whether it be large or small, is to have any meaning and bear out that we were telling the truth when we sold the idea of entry into the EEC in the referendum of some years ago, then we have to apply it to the areas of most need and they without doubt lie between Malin Head, the southern tip of Kerry and the Beara Peninsula in Cork, somewhere between those two areas and, heaven knows, there is plenty of scope and plenty of need in that area.  But that is not being done and that is apparently not intended to be done and that approach is defended by the very man we were given <Col N="1914" /> to understand would be the planner of our economic development.</P>

      <P>On 23 November I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, in view of the allegations of continual violations of human rights by the British administration in the Six Counties, the Government are prepared to institute proceedings against the British Government before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  The Minister replied in the following terms:</P>
      <P>The protection of the human and civil rights of all the people of Northern Ireland [that is the same as the Six Counties] is a matter which the Government consider to be of fundamental importance and all developments relating to the question are kept under close and constant review with a view to appropriate action whenever this is considered necessary.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs further stated in column 1796, Volume 309 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the Government can move or should move they should be satisfied that sufficient evidence is available from people who have communicated with them.  The Deputy will perhaps be aware that on the last occasion there was a very wide range of information from very authoritative <Col N="1915" /> sources who requested this action. That position does not obtain at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>The Government are not at present contemplating proceedings of the kind referred to by the Deputy.  The Deputy will of course be aware that it is open to any person in Northern Ireland who considers that he or she may have a case to initiate such proceedings on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister's refusing or declining to institute any such proceedings at this time is because he does not have the sort of situation or the sort of information being fed or communicated to him by people concerned as he had on the previous occasion when we successfully took Britain to the court and exposed her for what she is.  I would ask the Minister what he is short of at this stage.  Is it not well known that things are, if anything, worse now than at the time of the much merited case he and his predecessors in Government took to the Court of Human Rights?</P>
    <P>The fact that a man refuses to wear prison uniform or to do prison work should not entail the loss of physical exercise or association with fellow prisoners or contact with the outside world.  These are human needs for physical and mental health, not privileges to be handed out as rewards or withheld as punishments.  Prisoners have complained to their visitors in the hell hole which is Long Kesh and the source could not be more authoritative than that which I quoted the last time I spoke on the matter of Long Kesh.  That source is the Archbishop of Armagh, Dr. Ó Fiaich.  As a result of his visit to Long Kesh on Sunday, 30 July, during which he witnessed the sad spectacle of the brutalising of prisoners, he said that several prisoners complained to him of beatings, of verbal abuse, of additional punishment for making complaints in cold cells without even a mattress and of degrading searches carried out on the most intimate parts of their naked bodies.  Perhaps that would not be enough.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1916" /> Let us ask ourselves what is the condition of these prisoners, despite this inhuman treatment.  The Archbishop said:</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I was surprised that the morale of the prisoners was high.  From talking to them it is evident that they intend to continue their protest indefinitely and it seems they prefer to face death rather than submit to being classed as criminals. Anyone with the least knowledge of Irish history knows how deeply rooted this attitude is in our country's past.</P>
    <P>The Minister, with his background, is as much aware of the truth of that last sentence as anybody in this House and appreciates it fully.</P>
    <P>For what reason are these men being treated as they are?  The reasons I am giving are not mine.  They are being treated in such an inhuman manner because, as the Archbishop stated:</P>
    <P>The authorities refuse to admit that these prisoners are in a different category from the ordinary, yet everything about their trials and family background indicates that they are different.  They were sentenced by special courts without juries.  The vast majority were convicted on allegedly voluntary confessions obtained in circumstances which are now placed under grave suspicion by the recent report of Amnesty International.</P>
    <P>That is not my opinion or even the opinion of Archbishop Ó Fiaich.  He went on to state:</P>
    <P>How can one explain the jump in prison population of Northern Ireland from 500 to 3,000 unless a new type of prisoner has emerged?</P>
    <P>Will not the Minister submit to the overwhelming evidence placed before him in the statement issued by the Archbishop after his visit to prisoners in Long Kesh on 30 July?  He did not see the Unionist or Loyalist prisoners, though he asked and was refused.  We are talking solely about Republican prisoners at this time.  The authorities in the prison would not let him see the others.  I have quoted extracts from his statement which touch on the fringe of <Col N="1917" /> the sad conditions in Long Kesh at present.</P>
    <P>We have from the prisoners' relatives the following litany which I want to put on the record of this House, if for no other reason than to try to imprint on the minds of people inside and outside this House the absolutely unbelievable conditions which have been obtaining in Long Kesh for over two years; this is the third year of such conditions for the blanket brigade.  The following is a list of what prisoners' relatives consider to be forms of maltreatment:</P>
    <P>1.  Forcible bathing of prisoners and scrubbing them down with scrubbing brushes.</P>
    <P>2.  Intimate and internal searching of prisoners going to and from visits.</P>
    <P>3.  Banging loudly on cell doors throughout the night.</P>
    <P>No doubt this is done by prison staff.</P>
    <P>4.  Continuous use of electric light in cells thus affecting prisoners' eyesight.</P>
    <P>5.  The removal of their last remaining human possessions within the past few weeks, i.e., combs and toothbrushes.</P>
    <P>6.  The withholding of some monthly letters written to prisoners.</P>
    <P>7.  Inadequate food quantity (prisoners are, quite visibly, losing weight).</P>
    <P>This has been said by prisoners' relatives, although they have not been seeing the prisoners in recent times, as the Minister is well aware.</P>
    <P>8.  Leaving prisoners' food on the floor inside cell doors like one would feed a dog.</P>
    <P>9.  Hosing down the cells, leaving naked prisoners to lie on wet mattresses.</P>
    <P>10.  Removing prisoners to the punishment cell for three day periods on the slightest pretext.</P>
    <P>11.  Withholding of all means of mental stimulation, including religious magazines, from the prisoners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in any way reflecting on the Chair in this matter. This is a small publication which comes out irregularly.  It was published with the authority of two people&mdash;and nobody will question their authority in this regard&mdash;Fr. Denis Faul and Fr. Raymond Murray and I need not dwell any further on identifying these two men. There is much more in it but I do not have the time now to deal with it.  We have the result of the visit of the Archbishop to Long Kesh and a small number of extracts from the statement he issued immediately afterwards and a list of the things the prisoners' relatives have ascertained from their visits to the prison during a long period which they regard as maltreatment, and that is putting it mildly.</P>
      <P>Amnesty International have had information available to them, and I am sure they have made this available to the Minister and all who may be concerned about the horrible conditions in Long Kesh.  They cannot be regarded as nonauthoritative. They are no less authoritative than was the information available to the Government of the day when we took our case to the Court of Human Rights some years ago.  I submit that in the jails in the Six Counties there exist conditions not found anywhere in the world.  The grim details are well known, although they have often been repressed so that the demands might not become such that our Government would have to stop their &ldquo;softly, softly&rdquo; approach to the British.  I do not know what new strategy the Government have got or what they think they will obtain by not doing anything to rock the British boat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach refused to answer questions on this matter that had been put down to him during the past two or three months, the Minister is the man on the spot.  He carried the weight of the decision to do or not to do something about ending the tragedy that is the prisons of the Six Counties and particularly the hell-hole that is Long Kesh. From information I received from Long Kesh tonight prisoners whose hair has grown down to their waist have been forcibly shaved.  This treatment has been <Col N="1919" /> given to the prisoners on the blanket.  Up to yesterday 80 prisoners have been forcibly &ldquo;balded&rdquo;&mdash;I would not be surprised to hear that they had been scalped, such is the treatment which has led up to the present situation.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to consider every piece of information he can get on this matter.  I want him to study the information that was put on the record by Amnesty International, by Archbishop Ó Fiaich and by the relatives of the prisoners, the last people who have seen them.  If he is satisfied after that that there is not a convincing case to be put before the Court of Human Rights, either he or I must admit there is something wrong with our head.  Things are so bad they are indescribable.  At this time before Christmas, when we are thinking of the comfort and happiness the season may bring, we should think of the conditions under which these people are living.  They are now in their third year trying to maintain their sanity in circumstances where it is impossible to believe that humans could maintain their sanity.  The Minister should bring to the attention of the British that this Parliament is concerned to the point that it must speak out.  If our opinion cannot force the British Government to do something about the matter we should try to ensure that international opinion will succeed.</P>
    <P>What is it all about?  It is all about status.  The only people who can bring an end to this conflict are the jailers, the British.  Our prisoners can wear their own clothes.  If they could wear their own clothes in the North there would not be any Long Kesh &ldquo;blanket brigade&rdquo;.  There would not be the horrifying pictures that are built up for us by the people who have got information from the inside.  Ever present with us is the tragedy that someone will die, and I would ask the Minister to keep that in mind particularly at this time of year. The Minister should realise that while the morale of these prisoners may be kept up, they cannot possibly defeat the one thing that is ever present, namely, that because of their filthy conditions, malnutrition, the cold and all the other <Col N="1920" /> factors disease may take them if nothing else does.</P>
    <P>In this Irish Parliament we are not really doing anything about it.  It is not enough for the Minister to say he does not have sufficient information or communication. If communication from the prisoners in Long Kesh has been bad in the past few years the Minister will probably find good reason for it.  There was little welcome for anyone who had any story to bring from Long Kesh in the past seven years, and perhaps the Minister has inherited a situation not of his own making.  I ask him to accept that none of the things I have read out here tonight are manufactured.  They are as near to the truth as the Minister can get and they are sufficient to brand those who have perpetrated such conditions on other human beings.  They must be brought before the only tribunal where they can be exposed for what they are. They are hypocritical people who talk about human and civil rights while inflicting these conditions not only on prisoners in the Six Counties but also on Irish prisoner in jails in Britain who are given different treatment from that given to the ordinary criminals, who are not treated in as bad a way as Irish prisoners.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look behind the scenes.  I appeal to him to ask himself if all of this is sheer fantasy, and if it is not sheer fantasy to accept that it is true. I have no doubt that would move him to expose the situation in order to bring an end to the inhuman and barbarous treatment that is taking place.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that this issue was discussed on that date and also that he raised the question of Long Kesh subsequently on the Adjournment.  This evening his question relates to whether the Government are prepared to institute proceedings against the British Government before the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg.  While I know the Deputy may have understandable concern about Long Kesh I would have expected to have heard something more about the suitability of the European Court at Strasbourg to redress whatever grievances real or otherwise that might exist.  But the Deputy has repeated what he said on the last occasion even to the extent of quoting from the record the visit last July of Archbishop Ó Fiaich. As I pointed out to the Deputy, people have acknowledged that things have improved in Long Kesh even since September.  Since September I and my Department have been in regular contact with the authorities most directly concerned at every level.  As a consequence certain reports came to us indicating that the walls and ceilings which had been covered with human excrement were now being cleaned.  Deputy Blaney made no reference to this.  I expect no plaudits from him for whatever limited success we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to Deputy Blaney, I am the man on the spot in a Government which to him is taking the softly, softly approach.  I would again make it clear to Deputy Blaney that the Government are concerned for the protection of the human and civil rights of all the people of Northern Ireland.  It is a matter which the Government consider to be of fundamental importance.  All developments there are kept under close and constant review.  The Deputy will know that on the last occasion when the Government brought a complaint, the complaint was <Col N="1922" /> first initiated in December 1971 and the judgment issued in January 1978. Should our concern be to try to make some impact on the problems in Long Kesh or elsewhere, or should we try to make a public case which if it were to follow the pattern of the previous experiences would not relieve the immediate problem?  I would make it quite clear to Deputy Blaney that whatever abuses there may be in Britain or elsewhere no blame attaches to this Government for any of the problems that have arisen.  To the extent that we have information we pursue inquiries on every occasion and on every possible basis to ensure that all information is fully investigated not just by us but by the responsible people in Northern Ireland so as to try to alleviate any breaches of human rights where they occur.  This matter is a constant issue at all levels.  I would have discussed this matter with the Secretary of State had I met him as arranged in London on 6 December last. I will pursue it with him amongst a whole range of other things when I meet him in January.</P>
    <P>I know we must all be concerned, as I said on the last occasion here, about the fundamental right, the right to live, the right of people wherever they may be to live in peace and to know that they will not be suddenly swept aside by the actions of violent men who apparently have their own strange standards.  This is a matter that must be of concern to Deputy Blaney as well.</P>

      <P>The legislation governing the payment of maternity allowance provides for a weekly payment for a period beginning with the sixth week before the end of the expected week of confinement and ending six weeks after the week in which the confinement occurs. The expected date of confinement is certified by the claimant's doctor.  If the confinement occurs earlier than the date certified by the doctor the claimant may receive payment for less than the 12 weeks, but if it occurs after that date the allowance may be payable for more than 12 weeks.  Payment is, however, always made for the full six weeks after confinement provided the mother does not resume employment.  Any change in these provisions would require legislation.</P>

      <P>The part-time school bus drivers whose claims for unemployment benefit were disallowed for a portion of the summer vacation were disallowed in respect of periods of paid annual leave. They have appealed against the decisions in their cases.  The appeals officer requested that further inquiries be made into the matter.  These inquiries have now been completed and the matter has been referred back to the appeals officer. It is expected that a decision will be given in the near future.  As the Deputy will be aware appeals officers are independent in the exercise of their statutory duties and I am not empowered to interefere with their decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 94 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1708" /> The Council of Social Affairs Ministers meeting in Brussels on 27 November 1978 approved a directive containing proposals submitted by the Commission of the European Communities for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.</P>
    <P>The directive applies to statutory schemes which provide protection against sickness, invalidity, old age, accidents at work and occupational disease and unemployment.</P>
    <P>The principle of equal treatment means that there shall be no discrimination on grounds of sex, either directly or indirectly, by reference in particular to marital or family status, in the schemes to which the directive applies.  This concerns in particular the scope of the schemes and the conditions of access to them, the obligation to contribute and the calculation of contributions, the calculation of benefits including increases due in respect of adult and child dependants and the conditions governing the duration and continuance of entitlement to benefits.  Matters relating to certain aspects of these schemes are, however, on the proposal of the Commission, excluded for the time being from the scope of the directive.  Examples of such exclusions are the age at which old age or retirement pensions may be granted and the granting of increases of old age or invalidity benefits for a dependent wife.</P>
    <P>A period of six years is allowed under the terms of the directive for its implementation. Within that period member states must take the necessary measures to ensure that any laws, regulations and administrative provisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment are abolished.</P>
    <P>The areas in the social welfare code where discrimination exists are confined mainly to the entitlements of married women.  A lower rate of unemployment benefit, disability benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefit is payable to married women than to other beneficiaries.  Furthermore, the duration of the payment of unemployment benefit to married women is limited to 156 days <Col N="1709" /> as compared with 390 days for other beneficiaries.  It is more difficult for married women to qualify for unemployment assistance than it is for married men and it is also more difficult for married women to qualify for increases of benefits in respect of dependents in the case of all benefits.  In the area of contributions, the rates payable by women generally at present are lower than those paid by men.  This difference will, however, disappear from next April when the proposed new scheme of pay-related contributions, which applies equally to men and women, comes into operation.</P>
    <P>At present rates of benefits it is estimated that implementation of the directive would cost at the very outside some £35 million a year.  However, the actual cost will depend on the changes to be made in the various schemes and may indeed be much less.  Until the necessary changes have been determined, firm figures of cost cannot be calculated.  The fact that the changes may be brought in over a period of six years will enable the rise in cost to be spread over a number of years.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I can assure the Deputy that the Government are fully committed to the implementation of the provisions of the directive and I hope that it will be possible to have all the necessary measures taken well within the time scale laid down.</P>

The non-stamping of the contribution card is presently being investigated and his employment during the 1977 contribution year has been confirmed.  Contributions have, therefore, been treated as paid for the purpose of the claims to disability benefit.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>The multilateral trade negotiations are now approaching the final phase.  While some understandings have been reached on the major elements to be included in a comprehensive package, including agriculture, detailed arrangements have still to be worked out.</P>
      <P>Ireland and the other member states of the EEC are represented in the negotiations by the European Commission which negotiates on behalf of the Community in accordance with directives issued by the Council of Ministers.

    <P>As regards cheese and other dairy products requests for concessions have been made to the Community by New Zealand and some other third countries, while for its part the Community itself has made requests for some concessions in third country markets.  These requests are still being processed and it would be imprudent for me to speculate on the outcome.  Ireland is opposed to any concessions by the Community on cheddar cheese and this has been made clear to the Commission and the Council.  I can assure the Deputy that the interests of the Irish dairy industry will be kept very <Col N="1726" /> much in mind when the matter comes up for decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>The decline in cheese exports to the UK this year is attributable to the very difficult market situation in that country in the earlier part of the year. This situation, which was due largely to a continuing high level of stocks in the UK and to disposals there at depressed prices, discouraged Irish manufacturers from producing greater quantities of cheese.</P>
      <P>Market conditions have improved in recent months and this, coupled with a recognition of the need to divert milk from the intervention products, should induce Irish manufacturers to increase cheese production substantially in the coming season.</P>

      <P>The Galway County Committee of Agriculture has not recently made any application to my Department for approval to increase its staff.  In October 1977 the committee requested approval for five extra instructors in <Col N="1729" /> agriculture and for five extra clerk typists for its sub-offices.  After a full examination, the request was refused because of the low proportion of development farmers in the farm modernisation scheme in the county, averaging about eight per instructor, and because in the case of the clerical staff their employment at sub-offices was considered an uneconomic method of deploying personnel.  The clerical staffing of committees of agriculture is at present being reviewed by a joint working party of my Department and the trade union involved.</P>

For the purposes of these studies a distinction was made between short-term effects and long-term effects in the light of different possibilities in regard to the membership of the new system.  There are so many variables involved that it would be wrong to conclude that any sector of industry would necessarily be adversely affected by our entry into the new system.  Under certain conditions, however, Irish firms competing in the home and UK markets against goods of British origin, particularly in price sensitive products, could be under pressure in the short term.  The extent of the repercussions would depend on a number of factors and in particular the size of any possible appreciation of the Irish pound and the degree and the speed with which costs here could be restrained.  The Government's approach to any problems which might arise would be sympathetic and positive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Excessively high imports of consumer goods always give cause for concern and serious attention must always be given to ways for dealing with them.  However, proposals to counteract imports must have regard to our commitments under international agreements.  As far as our membership of the European Economic Community is concerned, this means that we cannot unilaterally place restrictions on imports from other member states.  It means also that proposals for restrictions on imports from third countries must be considered on a Community basis and with due regard to trading relations with those countries.  In the same way Ireland's exports are protected against import restrictions by other states.</P>
      <P>As a trading nation, we are in favour of freedom of trade and would propose counter action only where there is unfair competition and there is a serious threat to our industries or where the adverse effects on our balance of trade would be intolerable.</P>
      <P>Specific action has been taken, in co-operation with the European Commission, to reduce imports of footwear. Agreements concluded between the European Community and third country suppliers of sensitive textile and clothing products under the Multifibres Arrangement provide for quota arrangements and it is expected that this should help to stabilise the rate of import penetration by third countries into the market in the Community and into the Irish market.</P>
      <P>On the general level, the Government's three-year programme for the promotion of Irish goods and services is aimed at obtaining an improved balance between Irish products and competing imports.</P>

      <P>The allegations referred to have been made, for the most part, in a series of articles in a magazine called <i>Magill</i> by a particular journalist, Mr. Browne, who is also described as the editor of that magazine.  The most recent such article appeared in the November issue and alleges, in its heading, that Garda officers tried to frame a suspect in a murder case by falsifying fingerprint evidence, and that both my predecessor and I tried to hush up the scandal.  In earlier articles, and at least by implication in this one, the suggestion is also made that officials of my Department&mdash;as distinct from my predecessor and myself&mdash;were or very probably were involved in a conspiracy to hush up the alleged scandal.</P>
      <P>I propose to refer later to certain aspects of the allegations against members of the Garda Siochána.</P>
      <P>As regards my predecessor's initial reply to a parliamentary question, it is alleged in a <i>Magill</i> article that a statement that I made here on 24 May 1978 shows that what my predecessor told the Dáil was wrong.  It does nothing of the kind and the suggestion that it does indicates, at best, a lack of comprehension.</P>
      <P>In so far as the <i>Magill</i> allegations concern me personally, I do not intend to engage directly or indirectly in any debate with the journalist in question but, in case complete silence at this point might be misinterpreted, I say simply that the allegation that I tried to hush up a scandal is false.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allegations against officers of my <Col N="1739" /> Department, as distinct from myself, began in an article in the November 1977 <i>Magill</i>, which opened with an allegation in connection with an entirely unrelated matter to the effect that my Department &ldquo;partly subverted&rdquo; a Government decision.  Just for the record, may I say that that allegation, like the others that followed it in relation to my Department, is without foundation.</P>
    <P>As for the allegation that my Department was a party to a conspiracy to hush up a scandal, the articles engage in elaborate speculation which is unsupported by evidence and which of course is entirely fanciful concerning a particular departmental note to which I referred in my previous reply.  It would take a detailed analysis to expose the confusion and internal contradictions that are involved in that speculation. Fortunately, it is possible to deal more simply with the suggestion that officers of my Department engaged in a coverup.</P>
    <P>In my previous reply, I referred to the note which was made in my Department at a particular time and which establishes a certain matter.  <i>Magill</i> obviously assumed from that that there is only one document with a bearing on the allegation of departmental cover-up&mdash;hence the attempts to discredit the document.  The assumption that there is only one document is unfounded.  I referred to that particular document only as a source of evidence on one specific point. There is in fact ample and much more directly relevant documentary proof that my Department, far from trying to engage in any so-called cover up, was seriously concerned to ensure that everything would be fully investigated and that whatever action might be needed would be taken.  I did not previously refer to this point because I assumed that <i>Magill</i> would have realised from my previous reply that their earlier comments were mistaken.</P>
    <P>In so far as the allegations concern members of the Garda Siochána, they are essentially the same as those that were made to the Director of Public Prosecutions who, having had the matter <Col N="1740" /> fully investigated, decided as I said in my reply to a parliamentary question on 23 May 1978 that the institution of criminal proceedings was not warranted. The <i>Magill</i> version of that decision of the DPP is quite different and is that the DPP substantiated the account of what had happened as given in <i>Magill</i> but refused to prosecute.  That, of course, can immediately be seen to be unsustainable if only because the matters which the DPP was alleged to have sub-stantiated&mdash;whatever that means&mdash; included matters in regard to which the DPP would have no role or function. Leaving that aside, however, I now place on record that what I said in this House about the DPP's decision had been expressly authorised by the DPP personally before my statement was made.</P>
    <P>There is of course no question of anything that I am now about to say being intended as an analysis or part analysis of the reasons for the DPP's decision.  That is no part of my function. I am commenting only on assertions that are relevant to my functions in that those assertions are put forward by <i>Magill</i> as evidence that information given by me to the House, and which I in turn had been given by the Commissioner, was seriously in error.  Some of the assertions so made consist simply of the repetition of statements in regard to which I have previously made it clear that there is conflict of evidence, and I do not propose to comment on them.  I am now confining myself to certain assertions on facts that are capable of being verified and that have been presented by <i>Magill</i> as being of great importance.</P>
    <P>One such assertion is that fingermark charts are never marked up except for production in court proceedings and that, as they were in fact marked up in the particular case in question, it must have been intended to produce that fingermark evidence in court, i.e. evidence that was subsequently shown to be wrong.  I am informed by the Commissioner that it is not correct to say that charts are never marked up except for the purposes of court proceedings.</P>
    <P>On the same theme, it is alleged in <i>Magill</i> that evidence indicating a conclusive fingermark identification in that <Col N="1741" /> same murder case was included in the investigation file, that that evidence was subsequently removed, and that officers in Dublin Castle could testify that the evidence had been on the file.  I am informed by the Commissioner that this allegation is without foundation and that a number of members of the force, including members working in the Castle who were directly involved in the building up of the file and who would know if any such thing occurred, have separately and individually stated in writing that what is alleged is not true.</P>
    <P>Again on the same theme, it is alleged that a warrant was issued for the arrest of the person who was wrongly thought to have made the fingermark in question. I am informed by the Commissioner that that allegation, too, is without foundation&mdash;that no such warrant was issued.</P>
    <P>There are also some allegations which purport to support the contention that I misled the House.  For instance, it is alleged that I was not justified in informing the House that all the experts were agreed that they had no reason to fear that there were in the past any doubtful identifications apart from those that had been referred to.  <i>Magill</i> alleges that all the experts were not in fact asked.  My statement was based on an explicit statement in a report made by the Commissioner. I have again checked with him and he stands over what he said.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Magill</i> also alleges that I misled the House in what I said about some past doubtful identifications.  What I said about certain cases was that, although identifications may have been correct in fact, the evidence was insufficient to justify the identification, and that that is not acceptable bearing in mind the standards required of the Bureau.  <i>Magill</i> alleges that in one (named) such case, the identification was not just unproven but positively wrong.  I am informed by the Commissioner that it was not positively wrong but, on the contrary, that there is independent expert evidence that was not available to the expert who made the identification and that indicates that the identification was positively right&mdash;not that this matters except as respects the credibility of <i>Magill.</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1742" /> In another case, <i>Magill</i> asserts that there is photographic evidence that shows that an identification which I referred to as uncheckable was in fact positively wrong.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the position is that technical difficulties prevented the taking of any satisfactory photograph and that in fact the article on which the fingermark was imprinted was even taken to a laboratory outside the State in the hope that a satisfactory picture of it could be produced there, but the attempt was unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>There was one other past case where I said in my previous reply that the identification was unsatisfactory even though it may have been right in fact&mdash;<i>Magill</i> seeks to challenge that by saying that a particular (named) expert disagreed with it at the time.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the expert named was not involved in the identification of the mark and did not at any time express disagreement with it.</P>
    <P>Again in relation to my previous reply in the Dáil, I am informed by the Commissioner that <i>Magill</i> is incorrect in asserting that no new safeguard has been introduced in the Bureau.  Safeguards that were in the past supposed to be observed but were found not to have been observed in all cases have been strongly re-affirmed and that in itself is of importance but, in addition, the procedures have in fact been strengthened.</P>
    <P>I should also add, while I am on this topic, that <i>Magill</i> attributes to me a number of statements which I did not make and which&mdash;apart from the fact that I did not make them&mdash;do not represent my position on the issues in question.</P>
    <P>Allegations have been made that the transfer of members of the force involved in the fingerprint affair and the failure of one of them to gain promotion constitute a victimisation of those members.</P>
    <P>Transfers in the Garda force are a matter of internal Garda administration for which the Commissioner has responsibility. I do not involve myself in such matters and as a matter of principle I could not undertake to supply reasons <Col N="1743" /> for such decisions.  However, because of the serious nature of the allegations that have been made I am prepared, exceptionally, to go so far as to say that the Commissioner has informed me that the transfers in this case were made solely in the interests of the force and, in particular, in the interests of the Technical Bureau and that the two members concerned have been informed that their transfers included no element of disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>The allegation that one of the members concerned has been passed over&mdash;and, by implication, wrongly passed over&mdash;for promotion by another member with less experience involves the suggestion that the other member was promoted otherwise than on merit.  Having regard to that I think it incumbent on me to state that the promotion in this case was made by the Commissioner with my formal approval, which under the regulations is necessary in certain types of promotion in the force, and was made on the recommendation of a selection board of three Chief Superintendents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the general policy of the Government to support the promotion of human rights in whatever way possible at the international level.  In this context, United Nations instruments dealing with human rights are kept under review with a view to signature and ratification, or accession, as soon as possible, where this is appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding the first four instruments to which the Deputy refers has been outlined in reply to Questions Nos. 223 and 225 on 7 December last. <Col N="1745" /> The position regarding the other four instruments is as follows: The Convention on the Minimal Age for Marriage came into force on 9 December 1964.  Since the enactment of the Marriages Act 1972, which became fully operative in 1975, consultations have been held with other Departments involved and with the Law Reform Commission on the question of whether our law is now in accordance with the obligations set out in this Convention.  Consideration is also being given to the private international law implications of the Convention.  I hope that these consultations will be concluded shortly to enable a decision to be taken on the question of accession to the Convention.</P>
    <P>The Convention on the International Right of Correction was adopted by the General Assembly on 16 December 1952, before Ireland became a member of the UN, and entered into force on 24 August 1962.  I should perhaps explain that the Convention is not directed towards breaches of human rights as such but provides that a contracting state may issue a <i>communique</i> when a news report which it considers false or distorted is circulated.  Other contracting states within the territory of which the report has been circulated must then forward the <i>communique</i> to correspondents and information agencies within their territory.  To date only ten states have become parties to the Convention. It is my view that the procedure outlined would not be of particular value to us, particularly as so few states have become parties.  In the circumstances I do not intend at present to propose to the Government that Ireland accede to the Convention.</P>
    <P>The Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others came into force on 25 July 1951.  This Convention is the latest in a series of international Conventions relating to the suppression of traffic in persons and refers in its preamble to the feasibility of consolidating a number of international instruments already in force on the subject. Ireland is already a party to all of the instruments enumerated&mdash;four Conventions as amended by two <Col N="1746" /> Protocols&mdash;and we are, therefore, already implementing to a large extent the provisions of this Convention.  Some legislation would be necessary before we could accede to the Convention.  I intend to keep the matter under review but I do not think that this legislation would be a priority at the present time.</P>
    <P>The International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid came into force on 18 July 1976.  When the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Convention and opened it for signature in 1973, Ireland abstained.  I would not propose to seek authority from the Government to accede to this Convention, to which no Western European country is a party.  Deputies are aware of my strong feelings about apartheid but I would not favour accession to a Convention which would require us to exercise criminal jurisdiction in respect of acts and offences, imprecisely defined, committed outside our territory by persons who are not our nationals.  I should also mention that apartheid falls within the ambit of, and is specifically condemned in, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> In considering the attitude to adopt to these resolutions, the Irish delegation was guided by the principles set out by the Taoiseach in his statement to the UN Special Session on Disarmament last May, that is:</P>
    <P>what is urgently needed is a serious, comprehensive programme of arms control and disarmament measures which will cover all of the main issues&mdash;the problem of nuclear weapons, that of other weapons of mass destruction and the growing problem of conventional weapons.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that anyone looking at Ireland's overall voting record on these disarmament issues at the present UN session could be in any doubt that we consider the possible use or further spread of nuclear weapons as anything but disastrous, or that we have in any way departed from this consistent policy.</P>
    <P>The particular draft resolution referred to by the Deputy would have the UN General Assembly declare the use of nuclear weapons to be a &ldquo;crime against humanity&rdquo; and a violation of the Charter.  It also calls on all delegations to submit proposals to the next session of the Assembly with a view to the eventual drafting of a Convention prohibiting the use of such weapons.</P>
    <P>Ireland of course considers that the use of nuclear weapons would be disastrous. The Irish delegation however voted against this proposal because in its view the approach adopted in the resolution does not help to advance the major aim of general and complete disarmament.</P>
    <P>The resolution, in seeking to declare that the use of nuclear weapons would be a crime against humanity and a violation of the Charter exceeded the competence of the General Assembly.  A resolution of the General Assembly which is not legally binding cannot establish a crime.  Furthermore, the mere declaration that the use of nuclear weapons or indeed any weapon violates the Charter is not meaningful since the declaration does not identify any specific article of the Charter which would be <Col N="1752" /> breached, while the Charter specifically provides for the right of individual and collective self-defence, without imposing any preconditions as to the manner in which this right may be exercised.</P>
    <P>In sum therefore, the draft resolution is ineffectual and devoid of any real substance. It has not been the practice of successive Irish Governments to support or condone resolutions of this kind which substitute rhetoric for more constructive and realistic efforts towards disarmament and arms control.</P>
    <P>Thus, despite the superficial attractiveness of the resolution, its substance is not in our view calculated to advance the cause of disarmament which we have consistently pursued.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan's question refers also to the resolution relating to the non-stationing of nuclear weapons on the territory of non-nuclear weapon states which was co-sponsored by the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Mongolia, Afghanistan, Benin, Democratic Yemen, Ethiopia, Ghana and Laos.  Ireland abstained on this because it was couched in terms which were quite unrealistic.  It was an attempt to tackle a complex problem in a way which was based on considerations of propaganda, and it attempted to obscure the real difficulties which must be confronted if all our efforts towards genuine disarmament are to bear fruit.  It takes no account of the explicit provision of the UN Charter which guarantees the right to individual and collective self-defence.  It was not supported by all the nuclear-weapon states, whose support is essential if a resolution of this kind is to be effective. For all these reasons, we were unable to support the resolution.</P>

A fine of up to £250 may be imposed on summary conviction for failure to give such notification.

      <P>The following are the particulars requested.</P>
      <P>1.  Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector&mdash;This was set up in May 1969 with the following general terms of reference: &ldquo;To act as a standing body whose primary function will be to advise from time to time on the general level of remuneration of (a) civil servants and local authority officers outside the scope of conciliation and arbitration schemes, and (b) chief executives of State-sponsored bodies.  In addition to advise the Government specially on other specific issues which the Government may refer to it&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Last June, I asked the review body to report to me in accordance with the following terms of reference:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Reference A:</i>&ldquo;(1) To examine and report on the general levels of remuneration appropriate to (a) civil servants, local authority officers and health board officers outside the scope of conciliation <Col N="1758" /> and arbitration schemes; (b) the ranks of Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner and Surgeon in the Garda Siochana; (c) the Comptroller and Auditor General; (d) the chief executives of State-sponsored bodies; (e) the chief officers of the Dublin Port and Docks Board and the Cork, Waterford and Limerick Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(2)  To examine and report on the levels of remuneration of civil service departmental and professional grades outside the scope of the civil service conciliation and arbitration scheme in so far as considerations not covered in (1) (a) above arise in relation to their remuneration&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Reference B:</i>&ldquo;To examine and report on the levels of: (a) remuneration of members of the Government, Ministers of State, the Attorney General and the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann and (b) allowances of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Reference C: &ldquo;To examine and report on the levels of remuneration of the judiciary&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Review Body is not expected to report before late 1979.</P>
    <P>2.  Public Service Advisory Council&mdash;This was established under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1973.</P>
    <P>The functions of the Council, as set out in the Act, are: (a) to advise the Minister (for the Public Service) on the organisation of the public service and on matters relating to or affecting personnel in the public service, (b) whenever the Minister so requests, to advise the Minister&mdash;(i) in relation to such aspect of, or matter relating to or affecting, the organisation of the public service, or personnel in the public service as the Minister may specify in the request, and (ii) in relation to designation by the Minister of bodies under Section 1 of the Act as coming within the scope of the Council's functions, and (c) to report annually to the Minister on the organisation of the public service and on personnel practices in the public service; copies of such reports are to be laid by the <Col N="1759" /> Minister before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>To date, the Council has produced four reports: for the years ended 31 October 1974, 31 October 1975, 31 October 1976 and 31 October 1977.</P>
    <P>3.  Inter-departmental Committees &mdash;(a) Staff Support Functions: An Inter-Departmental Committee is developing the technical aspects of the functions of finance, planning, organisation and personnel in the civil service.  The Departments of Public Service, Finance and Economic Planning and Development are represented on the Committee which is expected to complete its deliberations in the near future; (b) Internal Audit: An Inter-Departmental Committee on Internal Audit has been considering the question of the establishment of an institutional internal control procedure within Departments for the review of financial and accounting procedures.</P>
    <P>It is not intended that the Committee will produce a formal report; it is expected, however, that it will continue its deliberations in the light of progress made in the establishment of internal audit sections in Departments.</P>
    <P>(c) Functions of Government at Sub-National Level: The Inter-Departmental Committee on the organisation of the functions of Government at sub-national levels was reconstituted on 2 May 1978 with the following mandate:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To examine and report on the appropriate organisation and structures for the planning, co-ordination and discharge of the functions of Government at sub-national levels.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and as an interim step:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to consider specially and make an interim report within two months on the appropriate organisational arrangements for the co-ordination of regional planning and development by the Department of Economic Planning and Development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Committee submitted a report on its interim remit and this is now being considered. Meanwhile, the Committee is addressing itself to the remainder of its remit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1760" /> 4.  Administrative Research Committee&mdash;An Administrative Research Committee comprising representatives of the Department of the Public Service, the Institute of Public Administration, the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Universities assists the Department in drawing up its programme of administrative research, in approving research projects and in monitoring progress.  The Committee does not produce a report but reports on projects produced for this Department are published from time to time.</P>
    <P>5.  Task Forces&mdash;Task Forces comprising representatives of the Department of the Public Service and the other Departments concerned are studying the steps necessary to apply the aireacht/executive unit and related concepts in the Departments of the Environment, Defence and Industry, Commerce and Energy.  It is expected that their deliberations will be concluded in the near future.</P>
    <P>6.  Selection of Administrative Officers etc&mdash;An expert group, which includes some non-civil servants, has been studying the method of selection of Administrative Officers and certain other grades.  The group has already furnished an interim report and a final report is expected very soon.</P>

      <P>1.  Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Relations</P>
      <P>Nature: The commission was established to consider and report on industrial relations generally and to make recommendations.</P>
      <P>Membership comprises representatives of employers and trade unions, and independent members nominated by me.</P>
      <P>Reporting Date: In my address to the commission prior to its inaugural meeting in May last, I expressed the hope that it would be possible for the commission to present its final report inside two years.</P>
      <P>I also indicated that I wished to receive an interim report on the Industrial Relations Institutions, particularly the Labour Court, established under Acts of the Oireachtas as soon as the commission had had the opportunity of examining the matter.  I also pointed out that it was open to the commission to submit interim reports on other issues of pressing concern if it so desires.</P>
      <P>2.  Inter-Departmental Committee for the Employment of Disabled Persons in the Public Sector</P>

    <P>Nature: (1) To deal with problems arising from the quota scheme for the employment of disabled persons in the public sector.  (2) To monitor progress <Col N="1770" /> towards the achievement of the target of 3 per cent set by the Government to be achieved gradually over a period of five years.</P>
    <P>The committee is composed of representatives of Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Reporting Date: It is too early at this stage to say when the committee will be in a position to make a report.</P>
    <P>3.  Manpower Consultative Committee</P>
    <P>Nature: The function of this committee is to advise on the role of manpower policy in economic and social development.</P>
    <P>I am Chairman of the committee which includes representatives from both sides of industry, and interested Government Departments and State bodies.</P>
    <P>Reporting Date: This committee will not be making formal reports.</P>
    <P>4.  Employment Action Team</P>
    <P>Nature: To draw up a list of schemes to stimulate youth employment.</P>
    <P>Reporting Date: The team made its first submission to me in November, 1977.  I am expecting a second submission within the next week.</P>

      <P>The committee has been requested to report as soon as possible (ii) A committee set up in May 1978 &ldquo;to report on the nature and effectiveness of the programmes being carried out by the youth organisations (non-uniformed) in receipt of grants, direct or indirect, from the Department of Education and to make any recommendations deemed appropriate for the improvement and development of the youth services.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>1.  An inter-Departmental committee chaired by my Department is examining the problems of the Dublin inner-city area.  It is not possible to state at this stage precisely when this committee will report, but this is likely to occur in the early part of 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  In the field of science and technology, there are a number of inter-departmental committees chaired by my Department to advise on such matters as the aeronautical sector, data processing, <Col N="1772" /> and science policy in the EEC context. Also, the National Board for Science and Technology has on hands various studies on science policy and related matters.</P>
    <P>3.  Two other bodies might be mentioned. The National Economic and Social Council (NESC), while not &ldquo;in my Department&rdquo;, is charged with advising the Government on the principles relating to the efficient development of the national economy and the achievement of social justice, and reports to the Government through the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. The NESC at all times have a number of studies in the area of economic and social development on hands and they submit reports on these from time to time.</P>
    <P>Second, there is the Central Development Committee which reports to my Department.  It co-ordinates the work of the County Development Teams in the 13 Western counties and considers proposals and policy issues of relevance to development.  It is not at present preparing any specific reports at my request.</P>
    <P>4.  In addition to the foregoing, the Green Paper &ldquo;Development for Full Employment&rdquo; published by the Government earlier this year raised issues for consideration and invited views.  The forthcoming White Paper will set out the Government's decisions.</P>
    <P>5.  Of course, part of the day-to-day work of my Department under statute involves consideration of various issues and consultations with interested parties on these issues.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the following statement.</P>
      <P>The figures included in the table for receipts by way of grants and subsidies represent the amounts of money actually received under the various headings during that period.  These amounts differ in some respects from the figures published in the six monthly Reports to the Oireachtas on Developments in the European Communities (Annex II) which represent the amounts of grants and subsidies approved.  This is because there is normally a time lag between the approval of grants and the date of their payment, with the result that receipts from the Community to date have been somewhat less than the amount of grants approved.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy's questions relate to homes for incapacitated persons unable to look after themselves because of old age or infirmity.</P>
      <P>The Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act, 1964, and the regulations made in 1966 govern the setting up and operation of homes for incapacitated persons of the type referred to in the questions.</P>
      <P>The Act requires a person setting up such a home to notify the appropriate health board at least one month in advance. The regulations specify the standards to be maintained in homes, including requirements that every home shall provide suitable and sufficient care, accommodation, equipment, facilities and staff having regard to the nature and extent of the incapacity of the persons in the home and the number of incapacitated persons maintained.  The enforcement of the regulations is a matter for the health boards and their authorised officers.</P>
      <P>A letter issued from my Department to health boards last September reminding them of the importance of periodic inspections of these homes. From inquiries made I understand that the homes in most areas are inspected regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My functions in respect of such <Col N="1782" /> homes relate to their approval under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970, for the purposes of payment of subventions by health boards to eligible persons.  On receipt of application for such approval the home is inspected by a medical officer of my Department to ascertain if it is suitable.</P>

      <P>I explained in my reply to a question by the Deputy on 29 November 1977, Official Report, Volume 302, column 175, that it is the practice for health boards to hold on behalf of some persons the balance of social welfare allowances which accrue after the recipients have paid their contribution towards maintenance in long-stay institutions; that this normally relates to persons who are unable to look after the money themselves.  I also stated that information was not available in my Department as to the amounts of such moneys held by the boards; neither is the information available in relation to private hospitals and nursing homes.</P>

A total of 235 contributions and credits are recorded in respect of her during the relevant average test period, from July 1953 to June 1976 giving her a yearly average of 10.

      <P>She had been in receipt of widow's non-contributory pension up to 13 September 1977 when she reached age 67 years.

The investigation disclosed that her means had increased since the previous investigation in 1972 and were in excess of the statutory means limit.  By decision dated 29 October 1977 the local Pension Committee disallowed her claim on that ground and payment was terminated from 27 January 1978.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied with the operation of the Act and, in particular, with the operation of the scheme provided by Part III of the Act for the purchase of the fee simple in dwellinghouses through the agency of the Land Registry.  The number of persons who made inquiries in the Land Registry about the scheme&mdash;some 7,500 in the period from 1 August to 12 December, 1978, inclusive&mdash;would <Col N="1793" /> seem to indicate that ground rent tenants in general have accepted the scheme as a fair and effective solution to ground rents problem.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, I am satisfied that the great majority of ground rent tenants are aware that the Land Registry is administering a purchase scheme and, of course, the registry staff are equipped to provide full details on request.  I am also satisfied that ground rent tenants of local authorities are generally aware of their right to acquire the fee simple, at nominal expense, under a separate scheme provided by the same Act.  I also think the most of those concerned do not see any particular need for haste in taking advantage of the scheme as it is well known that it is to last for five years.  I intend to consider, at a later date, perhaps in a year or two, whether some renewed publicity for the scheme may be desirable.</P>

    <P>Pre-retirement courses are currently provided by vocational education committees where demand is evident.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Pensions from State funds are paid to former national school teachers in accordance with statutory superannuation schemes.</P>
      <P>It has been open to religious orders conducting national schools to opt to have grants paid to their schools on a capitation basis.  Among the acknowledged effects of such an option was the fact that personal salary was not paid by the Department to members of the order teaching in the school (as the capitation grant includes payment in respect of teaching services) and, as a result, they were not pensionable under the statutory superannuation schemes. On the other hand, moneys paid by the Department in respect of teaching services in national schools were subject to income tax where paid as personal salary to individual teachers but not where paid to the conductors of a school as a block capitation grant.  It has always been open to the orders conducting these schools to change to the ordinary classification system of funding schools under which personal salary was paid to individual teachers on the staff, whether lay or religious, and their service was pensionable as a result.  Where the conductors continued to opt for the capitation system it must be assumed that they did so because they considered that it was in their interest to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1798" /> It has traditionally been held that the capitation grants paid to the conductors of capitation schools included an element in respect of the superannuation of members of the order teaching in the schools.  However, during the consideration of a claim by the Conciliation Council for Teachers in 1975 it was accepted that there was some evidence to suggest that this payment did not represent the full cost of superannuation and that there might be a case that the State had a certain undischarged liability in respect of these teachers.  In recognition of this, the council recommended that one half of the service given on the minimum staff of capitation schools by members of religious orders should be reckoned for pension in the case of those whose last five years of service was pensionable under the ordinary rules and whose pensionable service ended on or after 30 June 1974.  The council subsequently recommended that this consideration be extended to those with one year of ordinary pensionable service. Both recommendations have been accepted and are being implemented in anticipation of Oireachtas approval of an appropriate amendment to the superannuation schemes.  The council did not recommend that service by members of religious orders on the minimum staff of capitation national schools be reckoned as pensionable service <i>per se.</i></P>
    <P>The teacher whose name has been supplied gave service as a member of a religious order on the minimum staff of capitation schools before becoming a lay teacher.  One half of this service will be reckoned towards his pension and lump sum when he retires.</P>
    <P>This issue has been considered by the Conciliation Council for Teachers on two recent occasions and the agreed recommendations of the council have been accepted on both occasions.  I cannot accordingly accept that there is an anomaly to be remedied.</P>
    <P>I have no information readily available on the number of teachers, such as the teacher whose name has been supplied, who are in the service and who have in the past given service as members of religious orders on the minimum staff of capitation national <Col N="1799" /> schools.  The cost of reckoning their capitation service in full for pension purposes would depend on the number retiring each year and the extent of the service they gave in capitation schools.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the statement referred to by the Deputy.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that these percentages refer to total expenditure on social welfare payments and to total personal income.  Within these totals there is room for variation in estimates of <i>per capita</i> receipts depending on the assumptions made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government policy is to ensure that <Col N="1806" /> the standard of living of those on welfare payments is not eroded by rising prices. Real increases in social welfare payments are not precluded by the Green Paper and the extent to which such are possible in 1979 will be considered in the context of the next budget.</P>
