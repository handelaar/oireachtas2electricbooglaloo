      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Tuesday evening I was speaking about the effects of farmer taxation in the budget. The Government did exactly what they suggested before the election we would do if returned to office. The measures in the budget may not have been unexpected but the Fianna Fáil Party's attitude was dishonest.  They told the farming community that if we were returned to power, they could be sure the thresholds at which farmers would be liable for taxation would be reduced and the multiplier would be increased. Unfortunately, this type of propaganda had its effects and we paid quite dearly for it at the polls.  It was extremely dishonest to propagate the story that <Col N="956" /> we would make these changes and when they got into power to do precisely what they said the National Coalition would do.</P>
      <P>There is no simple way of taxing farming profits.  Unless something is done to change the rating system as we know it there will be all types of discrepancies and anomalies and, therefore, dissatisfaction within the farming community who, interestingly enough, have declared time and time again that they are willing to pay their fair share of taxation.  Surely that fair share of taxation could be arrived at in a much more simplistic way if the rating system made sense, but at the moment it does not.  I cited the example of 338 acres of land in an area I know which is potentially good land.  At the moment it could be described as mountain land, but neighbouring lands have been reclaimed and they are perfect pasture land.  The total rateable valuation on this 330 acre tract of land which was sold lately is £1.  The potential of that land is every bit as great as land only a couple of miles away which is rated in excess of £1 per acre.</P>
      <P>That type of anomaly will have to be got rid of.  I pointed out here on the last occasion that the people to update land valuation are An Foras Talúntais.  I probably over-simplified the case when I said they could regularise the rating of land throughout the country in a relatively short time.  The former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton, once told us that 80 assessors could revalue and reassess the quality of the land of Ireland in about five years.  If that could be done it should be done and the sooner it is tackled the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A commission was set up in the early sixties to look into the whole matter of land valuations because it has been recognised for a long time that they are inequitable, unjust and unfair, especially if the land is close to the sea, or to an urban area, or on the banks of a river.  For reasons which were quite valid 130 years ago, such as the availability of sand and gravel, or the value of being close to a market town, or even their potential for the growing of cereals, such lands <Col N="957" /> were given extremely high valuations. Those factors are no longer valid.  It is necessary to have uniformity and to judge land not upon those criteria but upon its potential.  If An Foras Talúntais could do that in five years, they should go ahead and do it.</P>
    <P>The farmers' organisations should be the first to advocate revaluation along those lines assuming, of course, that we will not have the upping of valuations such as we had over the years in regard to house property.  If you built on an extension it was used as an excuse not just to take up the valuation of the house in proportion to the area of the extension but to double or treble the valuation.  I should like to see a realistic revaluation of land, and I should like to see farming bodies taking the lead in advocating it and demanding that it should be done in such a way that the valuers would not be let run wild. A commission should be set up representative of all interested bodies, including the farming associations, and they should see to it that the readjustments are fair and equitable.</P>
    <P>It has been said from time to time that a fairer way of taxing farmers would be to introduce a land tax, so much per acre per year.  That should not be ruled out.  If there is not to be a reassessment of the quality of the land a land tax should be considered. I appeal to the farming leaders to give these matters serious thought.  Some farmers are being mulcted under the present system and people who are well able to pay are getting away with blue murder because of ridiculously low valuations, especially on land which has been reclaimed and is outstanding land.  That situation cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I omitted one item on Tuesday evening about the social welfare benefits.  I do not think I was overcritical of them, but some people were disappointed such as mothers who felt there should have been an increase in children's allowances, and pensioners who might have expected the qualifying age to be reduced from 66 years to 65 years.  I had representations from another section who were very <Col N="958" /> disappointed, widows who felt that the free travel scheme should have been extended to include them.  They felt that that would have been of great benefit to them, and it would cost the State very little.  They feel quite annoyed that this extension was not made.</P>
    <P>The budget, we are told, is mainly about jobs and we are all concerned that the employment situation be improved. To improve it will not be an easy matter.  We on this side of the House have sympathy with the Government in their problem.  We wish them well.  If they can solve the problem of unemployment we will say, &ldquo;Well done.  You did what we tried to do but we did not succeed as well as we had hoped.  But we did try also, very hard.  Unemployment is not an easy matter to solve&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am going to raise a matter which may stir a bit of dust but I feel it should be raised.  In order to attract industry there must be a proper climate, there must be proper conditions. It has been a difficult task for the IDA over the years to get foreigners to invest their capital in this country and to persuade senior executives to come and live in Ireland. As developed nations in the free world go, we are probably quite a bit behind most, especially the western European countries and the United States, and these are the countries from which we usually hope to attract capital and personnel for industries.  It has not been an easy task.  What has deterred industry in many cases from coming to this country in the last nine years has been the situation in Northern Ireland.  People in these countries have a general view that the troubles are spread not just throughout the Six Counties but throughout the Thirty-two Counties and there has been a resistance, we are told from time to time, on the part of the families of major executives to coming to Ireland because they feel their lives are in danger, and kidnappings and threats of kidnappings have not helped.  We are quite certain that we have lost many industries due to the disturbed state of affairs in the north eastern Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The recent statement on RTE by <Col N="959" /> the Taoiseach, Mr. Lynch, was unfortunate, and far from encouraging people and encouraging industry to come to this country it has had the very opposite effect.  For all the wonderful work Dr. O'Donoghue may do as Minister for Economic Planning or that Deputy Colley may do as Minister for Finance, that type of statement can only do irreparable damage to our hopes of attracting major industry.  I would say it is a major setback to the Government's plans for a huge number of new jobs.</P>
    <P>I do not say that we should sit and be mute and keep our mouths shut and let all undesirable types of happenings take place, be it at the hands of the minority or of the majority in Northern Ireland, but we should be balanced in our statements and should be seen to be fair-minded.  I am afraid that recent statements would give the view that we do have an inherent wish to take over the North of the country by force, and any such view expressed by leaders here in the South can only cause alarm, not just in Northern Ireland but throughout the world. Those statements were particularly damaging, and I am amazed that the Archbishop of Armagh should come along and almost support the Taoiseach, Mr. Lynch, word for word. He did no good for this country.  I would go as far as to say that the renewed campaign of violence we have seen in recent weeks might have been fired somewhat by the feeling amongst the men of violence that again there was a support for their methods in the southern part of the country.</P>
    <P>These are strong words, but events point to that.  We read in the papers today of a renewed campaign of savagery.  A renewed campaign of savagery by the Provisional IRA can only lead to a setback for our industrial prospects.  What people in other countries of the free world read are the headlines, &ldquo;Killings in Northern Ireland&rdquo;, &ldquo;Atrocities&rdquo;, &ldquo;Families wiped out&rdquo;.  That type of headline will seep through to the boardrooms of the major companies in the States and in western Europe and it will seep through to the wives and families of <Col N="960" /> the executives of these companies and they will avoid Ireland like a sore head.  They just will not want to know about us.</P>
    <P>I say that there should be moderation in our speeches.  There should not be any need at this stage for Fianna Fáil and its leaders to try to justify their Republican image.  If they do so they are doing so to the detriment of the working people of this country and, in particular, of the unemployed. Forget about talk of amnesty.  If these people are willing to murder at the drop of a hat, if they seem to delight in maiming, they should be sentenced to long terms of imprisonment if they are apprehended and there should be no question of letting them out.  I feel pity at times for the misguided people who are led by some of these godfathers, as they are known, because they are being led astray.  But, it is not our business to be lenient at this stage. I remember reading of a court case in the Old Bailey in 1971.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has a bearing on the matter of amnesty and the effect that it has on these people's minds.  A group of people, one from south Kilkenny, were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for violence and the cries from the gallery, from the supporters, we were told, were &ldquo;Never mind. You will be out in three years.  There will be an amnesty&rdquo;.  This is the type of lie that these young people are being fed: &ldquo;Do not worry.  We will get you out.  There will be an amnesty&rdquo;. While that type of talk is abounding you will give sustenance to violence, and giving sustenance to violence can only damage our industrial prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that it ill behoves the Taoiseach to make statements like that, and, just as much, it ill behoves Dr. Ó Fiaich to back him up.  I say let us have moderation.  Let us see that everybody is treated fairly.  I agree that there have been excesses, especially in British prisons, towards prisoners and in Northern Ireland there has been torture.  It has been described elsewhere as inhuman and degrading <Col N="961" /> treatment but not torture.  We decry all those things, but we want to see the law adhered to and we do not want to give sustenance to men of violence.</P>

      <P>The other matter I want to deal with, which has been seriously neglected, is the matter of fisheries.  If we want to improve employment prospects it is imperative that we develop our raw materials.  We hear time and again about Navan, Bula, Tara, about smelters and their employment potential.  The industry which has the greatest employment potential of all, which has been untapped, is the fishing industry and the processing industries which should go hand in hand with catching.  It is a sad reflection that 90 per cent of what is exported is exported in unprocessed form.  There are the vast quantities of fish around our coasts and it is a sad thing to see herring going off to Holland to be canned and processed and to end up by being bought back here at hugely inflated prices, sometimes about 100 times what we got for the exported fish. There seems to be unlimited quantities of sprat off the southern coast.  We are exporting it raw to Norway and it is being sold all over the world, even in Ireland, as tinned sardines and brisling. This is one aspect of industry which has barely been tapped.  I would like to see a Governmental drive to achieve the full employment potential of this industry.  Thank you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the opportunity of expressing my congratulations to Deputy Ray MacSharry who is standing here for the Minister and who is Minister of State at the Department of Finance and the Public Services.  Deputy MacSharry has been elected on the nomination of the Taoiseach.  He is one of the many from the west of Ireland who are Ministers <Col N="962" /> in this Government.  The number of persons who have been elected as Ministers from that area clearly shows how this Government feel about the west of Ireland.  In the last Government there was only one person from the west of Ireland appointed as a Parliamentary Secretary, and that appointment was made in the dying days of the Coalition.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the budget as such.  I should like to congratulate the Minister for Finance, the Tánaiste, Deputy George Colley, on his first budget in five years.  It is the best budget that has been presented to this House for five years.  It is a proud moment for Members on this side of the House to see a budget so clearly based on our election manifesto and which sets out in a positive way to implement our election commitment as set out in that historical document.  It is clear that the Coalition partners do not wish to see this manifesto implemented in such a positive sense.  They would like to point a finger at each Fianna Fáil candidate in the next general election but they will be disappointed because we propose to implement every commitment in the manifesto and go beyond those commitments. That is our aim and objective. The budget proves where we stand in relation to that document.</P>
      <P>We will not renege on our election promises and commitments.  The Coalition broke every promise they made in the 1973 General Election.  They set out to break them one by one until their 14-point programme was gone. That is something the Fianna Fáil Government will not do.  We have been criticised for basing the budget so closely on the manifesto, but we adopted the proper approach.  When we went before the people last June we produced a manifesto and we said that if we were elected we would implement it, word by word and line by line. This is what we are setting out to do. The budget implements directly everything we set out in the manifesto and we intend to go beyond that in relation to the creation of more jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most amazing aspect of the contributions by the Opposition, in particular by Deputy Cluskey and Deputy <Col N="963" /> FitzGerald, is that they seem to have no desire to see the Government achieve a national wage agreement based on 5 per cent.  It would appear they would be glad to have an agreement based on a higher rate than 5 per cent.  They want to see a situation arising that will prevent us implementing our policies and creating much-needed jobs.  Their approach is totally irresponsible and their action will be condemned throughout the country because they are inciting the unions not to settle for 5 per cent.  They are encouraging them to ask for more and in this way they are depriving many people of much-needed jobs.  I would appeal to them to be responsible in their approach and to ensure that we can operate in a positive way to implement a national wage agreement based roughly on 5 per cent.  It is to be hoped that the current talks will be successful. It is vital for the economy that agreement be reached without much delay.</P>
    <P>The budget should revitalise the economy.  After four-and-a-half years of depression it sets out to solve the greatest single economic problem, namely, unemployment.  Since taking office last July we have created 5,000 jobs and we propose to create approximately 23,000 jobs this year.  This will solve to some extent the unemployment problem but it is only the beginning. We are embarking on a course to try to remove this scourge.  In the 1960s when we were in Government emigration was the biggest difficulty, but when we left office we had curbed to a great extent that terrible blight on our country.  Practically every family was affected by emigration, particularly in the west.  I was the youngest of eight children in my family, of whom five have gone to foreign shores.  It is Fianna Fáil's ambition to give employment not only to everyone here but also to create jobs for those who wish to return.</P>
    <P>In the building and construction industry many much-needed jobs will be created as a result of the imaginative policy of the Government.  The increase in local authority loans from £4,500 to £7,000 has created tremendous <Col N="964" /> activity in the building sector. The £1,000 grant to first-time buyers of new houses has given a boost to the industry and has helped many young people to buy houses.  They were unable to do this when the Coalition Government were in power.  The improved grants for reconstruction and extension of houses and grants for disabled persons have been of great assistance.</P>
    <P>Although it has been ignored by the media as a whole, the SDA loans have been reduced by 1 per cent from 12½ per cent to 11½ per cent.  It is amazing that this has not been given publicity on a national scale.  The Opposition have not given us any credit for what we did in this area. Since last July they have been asking us to reduce the rate but we were not in a position to do so until now. The reduction of 1 per cent on the £7,000 loan will be a tremendous help to young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still 2 per cent higher than the building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The building society loans are not fixed.  Our 11½ per cent loans are fixed for the duration of the loan and that is very important. Our achievement in reducing the rate has been ignored by Deputy Mitchell and others.  What we have done will give a tremendous boost to the building industry.  During the term of office of the National Coalition grants were virtually removed and loans were inadequate. This meant that many people were put on the housing lists of local authorities but the funds were not available to house them.  The former Minister for Local Government acted in a wrecking fashion so far as the building industry was concerned.  I was engaged in that business before I entered full-time politics and I know what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I told people that above all other things this was one area where the Coalition Government had no concept of how to encourage people to build houses and to give much-needed employment in the industry.  It was a most ridiculous situation and Deputy <Col N="965" /> Deasy confirmed this when he said that the combination of loans and grants available to those on very low incomes meant that they could not provide their own houses.  When we took office we implemented immediately the promise in the manifesto to give £1,000 to every first-time buyer of a new house.  This was a positive step and I am very pleased to be a member of a party that introduced such a measure.</P>
    <P>I know how difficult and costly it is to build houses.  If the Government had not given this assistance many people would not be in a position to provide their own houses.  It is relevant to note that the income limit was increased from £2,350 to £3,500 to make a person eligible for a loan. This will have to be reviewed in the near future.  In view of the forthcoming national wage agreement and the general improvement in wages I expect that the £3,500 limit may be somewhat low.  Perhaps the Minister would take note of this and consider giving an increase in the near future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the capitation grants for special schools for handicapped children as well as the increased grants for equipment for remedial and special classes in ordinary national schools.  This is a step in the right direction and I congratulate the Minister on taking this action.  Again, it has not been commented on by the Opposition: of course they could not criticise such a positive step.</P>
    <P>The 10 per cent increase in social welfare benefits is welcome.  It will be roughly about 5 per cent higher than the inflation rate.  For the first time in four-and-a-half or five years it will be a real increase for old people and for those depending on social welfare benefits generally.  It is a very realistic increase, one that is acceptable and accepted.  The underprivileged&mdash;the old, the infirm, widows and so on&mdash; must be given priority.  I know that Fianna Fáil will never be lacking in giving adequate increases to these people to help them meet the cost of living.  We introduced free transport and free electricity, two very important social amenities.  We were <Col N="966" /> ahead of most countries in introducing free electricity.  That was a very positive step.  I think the Ceann Comhairle was Minister for Social Welfare when these worth-while amenities were introduced.</P>
    <P>The payment of unemployment assistance to women and to girls leaving school is welcome.  In my constituency of Roscommon-Leitrim girls have been unemployed since leaving school and have had to depend on their parents and, perhaps, their brothers for any finances they needed. It is wrong that women should be treated in the fashion in which they were treated up to this.  They are entitled to equality.  This was one area in which women were not treated with equality, and it is about time that situation was redressed.  The Coalition Government went out of their way in order not to give equality to women. I remember Deputy M. O'Leary, as Minister for Labour, was not very anxious to implement equal pay.  He tried to wriggle out of that.  We made sure he was not allowed to do so.  I doubt, if the Coalition Government were in power now, that they would have made this welcome change in the unemployment assistance scheme.</P>
    <P>The veterans of the War of Independence have been given a small boost.  Spouses will be entitled to travel free in their own right.  This is welcome. We must never forget the contribution these veterans made and, when I meet these at the funerals of the old IRA, I tell them that were it not for their sacrifice we would not be here today.  They deserve every assistance and help to make their declining years as enjoyable as possible.  They will now be provided, if living alone, with free telephones, as will the aged. This is very welcome.  I would like to see the special allowance increased.  I would like to see the means test removed.  They deserve royal treatment in their declining years.  I think this is the first budget in which the veterans have been specifically mentioned and given help.</P>
    <P>In regard to taxation, the anomaly that existed as between married couples and unmarried couples living together has been removed.  That is very welcome. <Col N="967" /> The removal of rates from private houses&mdash;£2 to £3 a week in most cases&mdash;and the removal of car tax, approximately £1 per week, will mean a real increase in wages.  Remember, an increase in wages inevitably means an increase in taxation.  The removal of rates and car tax will mean a real increase in wages.  This is welcome and timely.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the £5 a week subsidy for every employee in labour intensive industries is very important because it will to some extent counteract the £20 a week subsidy introduced by the British Government for the textile industry.  The scheme will come into operation in April.  It will guarantee employment in very vulnerable industries.  One industry in my constituency will certainly benefit.  But it will be a boost to many industries which were at a disadvantage in trying to compete with the subsidy in Britain. The Government should insist on the removal of that subsidy because I do not believe it complies with EEC regulations and, if the subsidy were removed, we would not have to have this £5 a week subsidy here.</P>
    <P>Borrowing 13 per cent of GNP as set out in the manifesto has been referred to.  Apparently some people have not read the manifesto too carefully. I am surprised the Opposition have been so surprised about this.  They should know we intend to decrease the percentage of GNP in the years ahead. Running the country is like running a business.  Business has to be revitalised by an injection of capital and the country has to be revitalised by an injection of capital.  For the last four-and-a-half years the country has been stagnating and going down hill.  We intend to revitalise it with the aid of the £821 million we intend to borrow. That will result in the creation of worth-while employment.  A great deal of that money will be spent in my constituency on roads that have been neglected over the last four-and-a-half years.  Employment will be created on the roads.  The local improvement scheme was curtailed by the Coalition Government.  We are revitalising that. This year we will get £500,000 more <Col N="968" /> than we got last year to improve our roads.  This is very welcome.  We are borrowing for productive purposes.  I look forward to a major injection of capital into water and sewerage schemes in my constituency.  Water is very important in south Roscommon. This scheme will proceed soon thanks to the Government.  The scheme was needed in this area of my constituency which is lacking in water.  The money provided for this scheme will help to create employment and will allow people to expand their farms and improve their conditions generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health recently allocated money for the provision of a community care centre in Roscommon town.  This scheme will cost approximately £¼ million and will be going ahead in the next year-and-a-half. We are also being provided with two welfare homes in Roscommon, one in Castlerea and one in Roscommon town.  These two facilities have been on the drawing board for years.  They were neglected because the Government were not prepared to give money to the West.  Under this Government, which is less than nine months in office, those schemes are going ahead.  I am very pleased to go down to my constituency to show the people that their votes were not miscast last June.  In a constituency like Roscommon-Leitrim it is important for the Government to play a positive role in the creation of employment.  I believe that all the State and semi-State agencies, such as the ESB and Bord na Móna, have a greater role to play than at present in the creation of employment.  For instance, there are proposals to extend the Shannonbridge and Lanesboro generating station and this work will give employment in these areas.</P>
    <P>In regard to education, I hope to see a large expenditure on schools in Roscommon.  The vocational school in Roscommon will be built with the help of capital from the Government.  As well as that, there are plans for schools in Boyle and an extension to the Convent of Mercy school in Strokestown. These are the positive results of Fianna Fáil Government and I wish them well in this work.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government to put <Col N="969" /> more money into the provision of industrial centres in my constituency.  We have advance factories in Roscommon and these will soon be filled.  The Government have now decided to build a cluster group in the Monksland Industrial Estate in the southern part of the constituency.  The provision of this accommodation will lead to industry and employment in a very neglected area.  The provision of a 16,000 square foot extension to a factory in Castlerea will create 50 jobs by 1980.  In the years ahead we must ensure that more money is spent on such positive work because this country will not have a future unless we create employment.</P>
    <P>I would encourage the Government to intensify decentralisation.  It was the policy of Fianna Fáil to decentralise, as they did to Castlebar and Athlone, which has given a tremendous boost to both areas.  As the city of Dublin is overpopulated, we should encourage some State agencies to have their headquarters elsewhere, particularly in the West.  Such a move would result in creating employment for school leavers. The problem of school leavers is a difficult one.  Many of them leave school with high marks in their leaving certificate but with little industrial skills.  Through the services of AnCO they will be given the necessary skills for industry.  AnCO are doing a great job in training people for factories in their centre in Athlone.  I congratulate them on their work and I congratulate the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy for encouraging this kind of development.  We cannot have industry without a proper labour force.</P>
    <P>Generally, the budget has been a success.  Hopefully, the national wage agreement will be settled within a few days and this should ensure good industrial relations for the year.  If we settle at a reasonable percentage increase we will be in a better position to create the employment that is needed. The Financial Statement of the Minister in the budget, implementing our manifesto, is welcome and is encouraging for Deputies from this side of the House.  We are able to say to our electors &ldquo;We are implementing what you elected us for last June&rdquo;.  I am proud to be associated with a Government <Col N="970" /> who are carrying out their promises.  The Opposition are criticising us for doing this.  They are saying that the manifesto should not be followed.  We will follow it to its limit; indeed, we will go beyond the contents of that document because we are committed. When we next face the electorate we will be proud to tell them that we did our job.  By that time, please God, I hope we have an updated manifesto.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Before Deputy Leyden leaves I should like to comment on his reference to decentralisation in Castlebar. There is no doubt that it was the Fianna Fáil Party who talked about transferring the Land Commission to Castlebar, and they fought two general elections on that issue.  One of the Deputies who talked most about it lost his seat in one of these general elections.  I should like to tell Deputy Leyden, just because he is one of the younger Members here, that not one brass farthing was spent or no plans made in regard to the transfer of the Land Commission to Castlebar until the National Coalition came into office.  It was we who provided the money and placed the contract.  It was we who carried out delicate negotiations with the staffs of the Land Commission and the Forestry Division to arrange their transfer to Castlebar.  I should like to put that firmly on the record.</P>

As I pointed out yesterday in regard to ground rents, all the work in connection with that Bill is being done in Chancery Street in Dublin through the Registrar of Titles, whereas Senator Cooney's Bill provided for each person to see the local county registrar who is also the local registrar of titles.  Under the provisions of yesterday's Bill everyone will have to traipse up to Chancery Street through the big smoke in the big city. So much for decentralisation.

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): After the general election we had a change of Government and the new Government had available to them all the financial accounts Since then we have had economic debates here, an adjournment debate before Christmas and now the fourth day of a discussion on the first budget of Fianna Fáil.  One thing that has emerged from those debates by direct statements and inferences is that on 5 July last our economy was sound. It was handed over to Fianna Fáil in a sound condition.  We have had <Col N="972" /> the word of a number of Ministers for that.  The Taoiseach also mentioned it in the course of the adjournment debate and we have also the word of no less a person than the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. Great credit is rightly due to the National Coalition who brought the country through three years of an international recession with all the economic difficulties that such a recession brings.  When we left office exports had reached a record and were increasing.  Inflation was reducing and unemployment was coming down.  Perhaps none of these things were being done spectacularly but they were happening.</P>
      <P>This is the first budget that has been introduced by the Minister for Finance since he returned to office and it has been described by members of the Fianna Fáil Party and Government spokesmen as a budget involving risks, a budget in which chances are being taken.  The Taoiseach said that such risks as were involved in the budget were worth-while. The budget has been described by independent economists and commentators as a massive gamble, the gamble of the century.  It is a gamble of a very dangerous type because it is a bet of a very substantial nature beyond the capacity of the punter to afford.  It is a bet that is being made on the nod, a credit bet.  As we all know if credit bets do not win book-makers' accounts arrive and must be paid.  It is nearly a &ldquo;heads I win, harps you lose&rdquo; operation because if the gamble comes off the bet will still have to be paid in this case.  That will involve substantial taxes in the years to come.  If the bet does not come off then we have grim years ahead because we have to pay for this massive borrowing.  It will not be a case of putting a few pence on liquor or on cigarettes, because the amount of money that would bring in would be negligible in the context of the amount required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the gamble does not come off there will be massive increases in income tax and in VAT and savage cutbacks in Government spending on all matters.  The Fianna Fáil Party have <Col N="973" /> told us that this budget involves borrowing to the extent of £821 million, an odd figure.  That apparently has the virtue, for those who are good at mathematics, of being exactly what Fianna Fáil said they would borrow, but I also understand that it happens to be the maximum amount we would be tolerated to borrow.  Fianna Fáil say that the National Coalition also borrowed, and that is correct.  We borrowed when one would be expected to borrow, during the difficulties of a recession.</P>
    <P>If a farmer suffers considerable loss of stock and is not covered by insurance or if a business man has his premises burnt down and is not adequately covered by insurance they either go out of business or borrow. If the farmer borrows to replace his stock and when he starts sending milk to the creamery the creamery cheques come in he starts to pay back the money he has borrowed.  He does not start borrowing again on a greater scale to pay for his current expenses. That is what the Government are doing.  The economy was sound when they took office and now they are borrowing massive sums of money. Their decision to borrow is not an economic one.  It is a political one which they got involved in in the time leading up to the general election. They decided then to have a major gamble.  They decided to make promises which they could only fulfil by massive borrowing.</P>
    <P>The first part of that strategy worked.  The people accepted their promises and returned them to power. They had to fulfil these promises in order to have any credibility.  They are now involved in the second part of their gamble, borrowing the money to fulfil those promises.  I believe the budget is accepted throughout the country as a huge gamble, I do not think that even Fianna Fáil deny that it is a gamble but they say that it is worth while and that it will come off. I hope for the sake of the country that it will.  The Minister for Finance is embarked on a course which on this occasion is being ridden by a novice steeplechase jockey, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. <Col N="974" /> I hope for the sake of the country that the two of them get over the course. They are relying on an inexperienced apprentice jockey.  I do not think he even has the advantage of being able to claim the 7 lb or whatever such jockeys claim.  I hope they get round the course and that they do not crash at one of the fences before this race is over.</P>
    <P>The budget, being a gamble, will create uncertainty.  I believe there is a huge question mark hanging over the budget at the moment.  If it is to work it will have to encourage shrewd hard-headed businessmen of the private sector to invest a lot of money and perhaps borrow a lot and put it to work.  Is that likely to happen in a state of uncertainty?  Are hard-headed businessmen, while wondering if the budget will work and if in fact the money that is being created will be spent in Ireland or somewhere else, likely to embark on investing in this state of uncertainty? I doubt it.  That is the first difficulty that has to be got over.</P>
    <P>The next condition for the success of the budget is that all the money being released by taxation reliefs will be spent at home.  I hope it will.  We are a very patriotic nation on matters truly national.  We are prepared to fight, suffer in battle and that sort of thing.  When it comes to what the Taoiseach recently spoke about as practical patriotism and which I referred to as economic patriotism, are we as patriotic?  I am afraid we are not. I believe more money is being spent in the country at the moment on imported goods than for many years.  I suppose our entry into Europe and the dismantling of duties and tariffs is responsible for a lot of this.  More goods manufactured in the EEC and outside it are being bought here now than at any time before.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to convince business people that the economy is stable, that they are likely to have a few good years ahead, before they will invest. It is also necessary to encourage the consuming public to purchase Irish.  I believe that a state of uncertainty created by the massive borrowing that has taken place is not a good climate <Col N="975" /> for investment.  I wonder if that gamble will come off.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters in the budget I would like to refer to. When I was a Minister in the previous Government I stood in for the Minister for Finance on a few occasions on some of the capital taxation measures. The Minister for Finance now proposes to abolish wealth tax.  Is it generally realised that the imposition of wealth tax was part of a package? That is a word which is dear to Fianna Fáil.  Is it generally realised that before the National Coalition Government assumed office death duties were payable and that this tax was a very severe burden on men with families who died and left substantial assets or even those who had not substantial assets?</P>
    <P>When we came into power a man who left £7,500 worth of property, whether fixed or movable, whether in the bank or in shares, was liable for death duties, at 1 per cent or 2 per cent; I will not tie myself to figures. But I know that the rate of death duty soared up to 51 per cent, that a man leaving approximately £200,000 was relieved of half of that amount by the Revenue Commissioners for death duty.</P>
    <P>In this morning's papers I was reading of the death of Lord Wicklow.  In the course of comments on his life and career it is apparent that he at one time was faced with a huge problem of death duties and that it probably played a big part in the sale of Shelton Abbey.  I was sorry to read of his death. I could not help relating the statement in regard to his death duty problems with the discussion here today.</P>
    <P>Before the National Coalition assumed office many family men were frightened out of their very existence about death duties.  They knew that if they died inroads would be made into their assets and that the Revenue Commissioners would claim anything from 1 per cent to 51 per cent.  Before the 1973 General Election Fine Gael promised that if returned to power we would abolish death duties and substitute therefor an annual payment on the rich, on those who could afford it. <Col N="976" /> That is what we did.</P>
    <P>I believe that the number of people caught for wealth tax was minimal.  I do not believe it frightened any worth-while investors out of the country.  The Minister for Finance, when speaking on this subject, gets away as quickly as possible from the number of people it frightened from the country.  He makes a passing reference to that and then continues to say: of course, there is no telling how many people it might have stopped coming in.  On one of the Capital Taxation Bills about which we were speaking here we had a long discussion with the present Minister for Finance.  The only damage done by the Capital Taxation Bills was that wrong information was given to American businessmen by the present Minister for Finance when asked in his capacity as spokesman for the Opposition.  The records are there to illustrate this because the discussion went on <i>ad nauseam</i> across the House.  He was asked for some information on the effect of these wealth taxes, he gave wrong information&mdash;I am not saying deliberately&mdash;and that probably frightened off a lot of people.</P>
    <P>I read in the paper the other day of a stud farm which had been sold.  The agent dealing with it seemed to think that the abolition of wealth tax had made his job a lot easier, that it had attracted a lot of interest in the sale. Let us examine the burden on stud farms for a moment.  First of all, the National Coalition abolished death duties, and the owners of stud farms die just as does everybody else.  Indeed, their work could be said to be more dangerous than some other people's. We relieved them of death duties which on the value of those farms could be very substantial.  I understand that owners of stud farms do not pay income tax on their income therefrom. In so far as wealth tax is concerned the threshold is £100,000.  They have relief to the extent of half the value of the farm, or £100,000, whichever is the lesser, with certain further reliefs in the case of big farms.  The bloodstock&mdash;which could be quite the more valuable part of it&mdash;is completely exempt from wealth tax.  The house on the farm is exempt from wealth tax as are the contents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> Can anybody in a reasonable frame of mind suggest there is anything wrong in asking people not liable to death duties, who are exempt from income tax, whose principal asset, bloodstock, is exempt from wealth tax, whose house and contents are exempt from wealth tax, to pay death duties at 1 per cent, or whatever it is, on the reduced value of the land?  Do they want to be treated as people living in the Gaeltacht and be paid for living here because that is the gist of this sort of argument.</P>
    <P>Wealth tax is an emotive thing.  But I believe that if the people affected were given a choice between death duties on the one hand and wealth tax on the other they would certainly come down in favour of wealth tax. As has been said by Deputy Peter Barry, our spokesman on finance, if the Minister for Finance wanted to make somebody a present of £10 million he could have done it more effectively and spent it better in a number of ways.  Had he wanted to confine it to the well-off people he could have spent it better in many ways.  But assuming he says &ldquo;I want to look after the well-off people&rdquo;, then he could have spent it well by reducing the maximum rate of income tax from 60p in the £ to 50p in the £ which surely would have attracted entrepreneurs, skilled executives, people with knowledge and know-how here. The former Minister for Finance reduced the maximum rate of income tax from between 77p and 80p in the £ to 60p in the £.  We inherited a maximum rate of income tax from Fianna Fáil of 80p in the £ and, when we left, the maximum rate was 60p. If the Minister for Finance wants to look after the rich and well-off he would have done far more for the country by reducing the maximum rate of tax from 60p to 50p and let the people who are caught in the wealth tax net continue to pay a small amount.</P>
    <P>The thresholds for wealth tax were fixed three years ago at £100,000 and they were not affected by inflation. The values settled three years ago stood for three years.  An undertaking was given by the then Minister, Deputy Richie Ryan, and myself when <Col N="978" /> I stood in for him, that those thresholds would be revised upwards this year to have regard to inflation.  I do not think that that would have been any hardship on these people in lieu of death duties.  I do not want that to be forgotten.  I heard people speaking at seminars about capital taxation and, although they were as old as I am, you would think they never heard of death duties, that they never existed. They were gone, but get rid of everything else as well.  That was their attitude. This was the bargain.  The promise we made was that death duties would go within the family and a tax on the wealthy would be substituted.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about farming taxation.  I will be told there is not a word in the manifesto about farmers' tax and that the Fianna Fáil Party did not promise to get rid of it. In a general election Fianna Fáil are able operators.  There is the manifesto for public consumption and the hard canvass from door to door for private consumption.  Although there are not big farmers in my constituency, people who would ordinarily be affected by income tax, they were terrified out of their existence by the hard canvass by the Fianna Fáil canvassers who said: &ldquo;The threshold will come down and, if Fianna Fáil get back into office, it will be abolished&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach or his Ministers may not know about that, just as the Taoiseach did not know of the canvass of the Garda wives all over the country that if Fianna Fáil got back into power Garvey would go&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I do not intend to do so. I am just giving an example of the hard canvass.  The hard canvass about farmers' income tax was that if Fianna Fáil got back into power there would <Col N="979" /> be no more farmers' income tax.  The Minister for State may smile, but he knows as well as I do that that was the canvass all over the country.  Let us look at what has happened.  The threshold has come down from £75 valuation to £60 valuation and the multiplier has gone up from 65 to 90.  That is fair enough, or at least it is clear. When I say it is fair enough, I mean it is a reneging on the promises and the canvass by Fianna Fáil in the election campaign.  It is a direct going back on what they said.  I do not know how some of those canvassers will face the people they codded into working for them in the election.</P>
      <P>There is more than that.  There is some reference in the manifesto to farmers' taxation, rates being allowed as an instalment of income tax, and an option given as between accounts and a multiplier.  In the manifesto there is no word about agricultural grants.  Before the budget was introduced, the Minister for Finance collected £7 million by abolishing agricultural grants on all agricultural valuations over £75 and there is no question of a multiplier or accounts. There is no question of averaging. There is no question of whether the farmer is making money or not.  This year £7 million will be collected from all farmers with a valuation of over £75 and that is for sure, regardless of income, capacity to pay, or whether the farmer is making money.  That is not the end of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While they were at it they said they would get the bad news over.  They looked forward to 1 January next year and bang goes the agricultural grant on all valuations over £60.  I have not worked out the mathematics of what the abolition of the agricultural grant on valuations between £75 and £60 will cost.  Over £75, it will cost £7 million.  On the basis of there being far more farmers between £60 and £75 valuation, the amount involved will be very substantial.  I believe it will be more than £7 million.  Maybe I am wrong and it may be considerably more.  That is an act of deception practised on the farmers.  The Minister for State and Deputy Callanan <Col N="980" /> know many farmers with a valuation of £65 who are married and have a number of children, who are employing a man and paying contractors, and have borrowed money and will not be liable for any income tax.  Come next year, up will go the rates by £300 or £400.  They will not be asked whether they are making money.  They will be into the net.  Every farmer with a valuation of £60, whether or not he is making money, whether he elects for the accounts system or the national system, on 1 January next will pay £300 or £400 more rates than this year.  Fianna Fáil said they would treat their rates as an instalment of their income tax.  They certainly are.  Income tax is based on income.  Rates are not based on income, but this is income tax without regard to income; this is income tax without regard to capacity to pay, without regard to the income of the farmer.  I believe that when this sinks in for the fellows over £75 valuation this year and those over £60 valuation next year, there will be a very different tune.</P>
    <P>In regard to taxation, I believe the budget is anti-social.  The married man who has no family gets the same tax relief in this budget as a married man who has ten young children.  There is no extra relief in this year's budget for the family man.  The married allowance has been doubled, yes, but there is no extra allowance for children&mdash; none whatever.  There is no allowance anywhere in the budget, either under the social welfare provisions or under the income tax provisions, for the family man.  None&mdash;again evidence of a political approach, again getting back to the manifesto.  The manifesto had to be simple.  It was simple.  It is very easy to say the married allowance can be increased; the tax goes off cars; this, that and the other thing. I say it is anti-social in regard to its approach to the married man with a family.</P>
    <P>I should like to say in regard to the package that the well-off man in 1978 will do fairly well in this budget and, again, the Government have succeeded in putting this across.  I propose to deal very briefly with the package, <Col N="981" /> which consists of car tax, rates and income tax.  A man in the £8,000-£10,000 bracket can hope to get out of those three items&mdash;and I want to be fairly accurate&mdash;between £600 and £800, and some of them more.  I will take a reasonable case.  Take a man living in a house with a valuation of £30 and, for simplicity, take the rate at £10 in the £.  There is £300 in one act.  That man will have two cars and he may have three.  He will certainly have two and take that as £150 in respect of the two cars.  That makes £450.  The income tax provisions in respect of that man are some place around £300, if he is on the maximum rate of tax, as he will be.  That makes £750.</P>
    <P>The man who is trying to exist in a council house on £70 a week will be living in a house with a poor law valuation in rural Ireland of £5-£7. Make a present and say it is £7.  He will get £70.  If he has a family he will not be liable for income tax. Therefore, he gets nothing there.  He probably will not have a motor car, because he cannot afford it.  If living in a town, he will get £70, in a council house, in Cavan, and I will get £700 living a mile-and-a-half out the road. Is that equitable?  It is good electioneering because it is simple to put it across.  I do not think it is fair, and I defy contradiction on that.  That is part of that package.</P>
    <P>When we came into power&mdash;I could not get the figures that I wanted to get in regard to this one point&mdash;we increased social welfare dramatically, to use a current headliner.  We increased it massively, and the means test for the old age pension at the time was 5s.  If you had 5s a week you did not get the full old age pension and you had to wait to 70 years of age to get it.  When we left, the 5s had gone up to £12 or £14 as a means test and the age had come down to 66. Right across the board the increases we gave in 1973 were massive.  They had to be, because Fianna Fáil had neglected shamefully and disgracefully the social welfare classes for 16 years previously.  Now we have the social welfare classes getting a 10 per cent increase in this budget.  It means one <Col N="982" /> of two things: that Fianna Fáil admit that we did the social welfare people very well; or that they believe that 10 per cent is enough for them, whereas the fellow on £8,000-£10,000 will get £750.</P>
    <P>I believe in derating but I do not see why anybody who has an income of £10,000-£15,000 should not pay some rates.  I believe that a man who has to drive to his work in his car should get consideration but I do not see why a man should have two or three cars around the house, all tax free at public expense, and I make no apology for saying that.  I believe that in regard to rates&mdash;yes&mdash;£10 to £15 valuation if you like.  I cannot see why somebody living in a mansion with a poor law valuation of £100 should be completely rate free in these times when we have to borrow £821 million abroad to pay for it.  I do not make any apology to anybody for saying that, because that is one of the things for which we are borrowing&mdash;to pay for two or three cars around one house and to pay for rates on a poor law valuation of £50 or £100 and to abolish wealth tax at the same time.  Are we gone mad?  I think we are.  Fianna Fáil have got themselves so involved in this manifesto and the promises that they have lost a sense of reason.  If there was enough money in the country, if we had mines all over and oil was flowing at several places on the shore that would be all right, but does anybody think it is sensible to borrow £821 million abroad to abolish wealth tax, which was put on in place of death duties, to derate houses regardless of the income of the people living in them and regardless of the valuation of the houses, and to remove the tax on motor cars regardless of how many cars are around the house or what they are being used for?  I do not think it is.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to note the approach of the budget to tourism.  In my very short stay in the Department of Transport and Power I learned that tourism was one of our best earners. We have the climate, we have the unspoiled environment, we have a friendly people, and we have the good name abroad.  Tourism was doing very well in 1969.  By 1972 it had reached <Col N="983" /> an all-time low.  In 1976 it established a record for recent times.  The year 1976 was the best tourist year since 1969 and 1977 was better still.  I am very disappointed to see that the total increase given by this budget to tourism is only 11 per cent.  Last year we provided over £12 million and this budget provides over £13 million.  The Minister of State, who comes from a tourist area, is taking note of this, and I am glad that he is.</P>
    <P>In the 1977 budget a sum of £1,650,000 was provided for development of the tourist industry.  This year a sum of £1,485,000 is being provided. The cutback in this case is a disgrace. Money invested in the tourist industry will achieve very good returns, but it appears that this Government are not interested in helping the industry.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have indicated that so far as local authority housing is concerned there will be a cutback.  There is a ring of a previous White Paper in this.  When Fianna Fáil were in office on a previous occasion they produced a White Paper which said that there would have to be a cutback in social spending.  In the latest White Paper they deal specifically with housing and they say that less money will be needed for local authority housing.  This means they will provide less money.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I would advise the Minister to read the White Paper.  The indications are that the private builder seems to be concentrating on building the more expensive houses.  As a result there will be more local authority houses required rather than less. I do not know how a married man earning from £50 to £70 per week can afford to buy a house.  I warn the Government that any attempt to implement <Col N="984" /> their anti-social policy in the White Paper, any attempt to cut back on housing, will meet with strong opposition from us and will get plenty of publicity from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to deal with any other aspects of the budget because of the limited time at my disposal.  Let me conclude on the note on which I started.  This is a major gamble.  I sincerely hope that the racehorse, the Minister for Finance, ridden by a very inexperienced, academic, apprentice jockey, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, will get round the course, because if he does not it will be bad for the country. Even if he does get round the course the bill will have to be paid next year and in the following years.  Deputy Leyden in his contribution referred to the manifesto as &ldquo;an historic document&rdquo;. My God, it will be an historic document!</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made some comments on what Deputy Leyden said in his speech.  He also referred to a race.  All I can say to the Deputy is, if we are not in the race where are we?  There is no doubt that there is an element of risk in the budget. Do we stay static?  Will we allow the present figure of 100,000 unemployed to increase very considerably each year with the addition of school leavers and others who may lose their jobs?  At one time the late Seán Lemass was called a gambler.  Perhaps he took risks that I would not take. It is obvious that if one does not take part in the race one cannot win it. That is my comment on Deputy Fitzpatrick's reference to the jockey and to the race.  We are in the race and I think we are doing a good job.  I shall have some criticisms to make of the budget, some of them on the lines mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick, and I shall not be afraid to make known my criticisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget is orientated towards providing employment and giving incentives to people to invest in the country.  Deputy Michael O'Leary said that 84 Fianna Fáil Deputies cheered at the announcement in the budget that the wealth tax was being removed.  I did not cheer and I am one of the 84 <Col N="985" /> Deputies.  When a statement is made in this House it should be in accordance with the facts.  I believed in removing the wealth tax from people who were prepared to put money into the country to give employment.  I say this to the wealthy, and I am referring also to the banks; if they do not support the programme put forward by the Government, namely, to invest their money here to provide employment, they will be the people who will suffer. On other occasions I have said that if the young people lose confidence in this House and in the Government, if they turn revolutionary and violent, the wealthy people and the banks will be the sufferers.  The Government are taking risks in the budget and it will be a tragedy if the wealthy people do not respond.  Fianna Fáil will be put out of office; that does not matter; but the country itself will suffer.  The wealthy people are definitely getting opportunities in the budget in order to entice them to invest their money and to create employment.  That is what the budget is about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick quoted figures in connection with the benefits the wealthy man will get by way of tax relief in comparison with the person on a low income.  I agree with much of what the Deputy said.  The Labour Party have gone to town on this matter. I challenge that party, the trade unions or anyone else to tell me what is the difference between the reliefs granted in the budget and the wage agreement that is being negotiated.  If agreement is reached on a figure of 6 per cent, a man earning £50 per week will get £3 while a man earning £200 per week will get £12.  Where is the social conscience in that?  Nobody has attempted to answer that question.  Recently Deputy Bermingham got annoyed with me when this point was raised.  I think he has a social conscience and he agrees with me, but he was sore that his party does not agree with what I have said.</P>
    <P>That is the point.  All the social consciences on that side are all percentage increases, as far as I can see.  I cannot understand it unless it is designed, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, so that people can have two cars and money to <Col N="986" /> buy more brandy.  What does the man get £12 for if it is not for the same purpose as the man who gets £50, namely, to meet increases in the cost of living?  Is not the whole idea to give people a higher standard of living?  If a man is doing a job which calls for a salary of £10,000 a year then by all means pay him £10,000 a year but, when it comes to giving increases to meet increases in the cost of living, why should he get more than the man who gets only £50 a week?  Will somebody explain this to me?  Where is the social conscience behind this?  Whatever is given should be given right across the board.  It should not be on a percentage basis.  Some have argued that the budget is orientated in the wrong direction, but the budget is doing exactly what the socialists on the Opposition benches have been doing for years.  What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.  It is not my sauce.  I can tell you that.  I am as socially minded as anybody here.</P>
    <P>I shall have some criticisms to make of the budget, and some will be on the same lines as those of Deputy Fitzpatrick.  Many of the things in the manifesto should have been implemented long ago.  Time and again I have raised the question here of building grants.  I raised it with the last Minister for Local Government, for whom I have a great respect, but apparently I did not get through to him.  The grants were ridiculous.  Now in the budget an incentive is given to people to build their own houses.  I doubt if private enterprise will respond fully and I agree with some speakers in the Labour Party that the State will have to play a bigger role in providing employment.  There are over 100 000 unemployed and approximately 30,000 school leavers every year.  In five years time there will be 150,000 unemployed school leavers plus the 100,000 if a great many more jobs are not provided.</P>
    <P>I think that the situation could be improved by consulting local communities. I have had some experience in this.  When the co-operatives were not limited liability companies they failed.  Years ago when we tried to revive the movement we spent nights <Col N="987" /> talking to people trying to convince them of the advantages and eventually, after a great deal of hard work, the idea caught on.  It was a community effort by the local people.  I believe the team set up by the IDA to promote industry should get down to community level.  It is all very well to bring in large industries but they should also concentrate on local community effort to see what can be done at community level to provide employment. I know the work we did 20 to 25 years ago in the west.  There were no grants then.  If people know what is wanted they will co-operate.  I was associated with Father McDyer in Glencolumbkille and he would not take no for an answer.  He got industries going in a small backward parish in Donegal.  If the IDA would consult with local communities I am convinced that a great deal of employment could be created.  I would not be too worried about having to spend a few pounds.  Big industries coming in here get big grants and some are only too ready to pack it in when things are not going the way they think they should be going.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden was parochial.  I will not be parochial, but I come from a rural area and in that area there are towns on the brink of the midland region desperately in need of industry. I refer to Loughrea and Gort.  I would like something to be done about these towns.  That is the only bit of parochialism on my part.</P>
    <P>The lower income groups did not come all that well out of the budget, and I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick here.  There should be a bigger percentage increase.  Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned the £14.  Inflation has changed many things since 1972 when £6 a week was set as the income for a part pension for a single man. Inflation went wild in the last three or four years and it is still £6 for a single man.  With that kind of money he cannot get the full old age pension and, if he has £14, he will get no pension at all.  A man and his wife with over £12 a week do not get the full pension and, over £28, they get no pension at all.  The figure should be <Col N="988" /> £10 for a single man or woman and £40 for a married couple.  Talking about £6 in this day and age is all wrong, and I would ask the Minister to have a look at this.  I am delighted that single women will get unemployment assistance.  It was unfair that there should have been this discrimination. I had a question down about free transport for widows and I would like the Minister to say something about that when he replies.  I think children's allowances should have been increased and I am disappointed that they were not.</P>
    <P>I have some other criticisms to offer.  If a person is in a party his job is to work for his party.  I have said time and time again that Members of political parties should vote for their parties but they should have the guts to give their opinions.  I did that when I was on the other side of the House and I intend to do it while I am here, so any comments I have to make on the budget, favourable or otherwise, will be made.  Taking a broad view of the budget, I believe it implements our manifesto in order to creat employment.  That is what it is there for and that is what we hope it will do.</P>
    <P>The most important point referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick was the Buy Irish campaign.  I agree with him that we are very patriotic in many ways but the important thing is to put your money where the jobs are.  I do not want anybody to buy inferior goods, but the goods that we are producing at present are as good as those being produced anywhere else.  It should be the aim of everybody who wants to get a job for his son or daughter to buy Irish goods.  We should show a good example ourselves by asking for Irish goods.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to agriculture, which is my hobby.  I am also interested in industry but I was reared on a small farm and am therefore more interested in farming.  Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to farm taxation and I agree with much of what he said in that respect. He is wrong in that we never said that the farmers would not be taxed.  The last Minister for Finance wanted to get £30 million from the farmers and <Col N="989" /> he got £14 million.  The present Minister wants to get £24 million but that £24 million is really £31 million because he will get £7 million in rates from those whose valuations are over £75.  The danger in the valuation being reduced and the multiplier being increased is that the big farmer who is borrowing money for development will get an allowance on his rates, an allowance for his contractors' fees, as a result of the provisions in the manifesto, but when all the deductions have been made he may not have to pay too much tax.  In my area some land is valued at an old half-crown an acre and there is land beside the Shannon which is flooded most of the time and which is valued at £1.50 per statute acre.  In 1979, the man with a valuation of £60 will not get rates relief.  If that man has a family he is not likely to be in a taxable bracket and he will not get back what he pays in rates.  If the rates valuation is lowered too much you would be collecting from the man with a lower valuation what the man with the higher valuation should pay.  It is wrong for people to say that the farmers will only pay £24 million, because the £7 million in rates should be added to it.  The small farmer is worried that the valuations will be lowered.</P>
    <P>A valid point has been made in regard to the optional and notional systems of accounts.  If the national system is to be carried out for three years, a man should have some idea of what the multiplier will be for three years.  If the multiplier is increased from £9 to £120 in the next three years, a man cannot go back to his original option.  Therefore, some indication should be given of what the multiplier will be in the next three years.</P>
    <P>There are not many farmers in the tax bracket in my area.  No man with a family and 40 acres of land has a snowball's chance of coming near a taxable income.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem we have at present is that 4 per cent of our farmers are in the commercial category, 16 per cent in the development category and 80 per cent in the transitional category.  We hope that there <Col N="990" /> will be only two categories of farmers from now on, commercial and development farmers.  Any farmer who is prepared to work to a plan with his adviser, no matter what his acreage, should be given the full grants.  We should increase the number of agricultural advisers to increase the plan. The great amount of paper work at present means that the instructors are doing office work.  Every farmer who is prepared to work to a plan should be given the full grants which are presently being given to development farmers.  If the EEC directive cannot be changed, we must have a scheme of some sort to save 80 per cent of our farmers from going by the board. If the directive is carried out, the transitional farmers can only be subsidised for five years.  We would be doing well if we could reduce the figure to 50 per cent in the next five years, which would mean a further 30 per cent in the development category.  I can assure everybody that I will be bloody loud about this to see that something is done for small farmers.</P>
    <P>On the question of social welfare for farmers I should like to point out that the farmer with a valuation of more than £15 will not get any increase. Farmers with valuations of between £15 and £20 are small farmers but they are not getting an increase.  I am not advocating social welfare for farmers, but they should be given an incentive instead.  That is what farmers want. The directives should be changed so that these farmers are given an incentive instead of social welfare to develop their holdings.  It is equivalent to giving a man a job.  If a businessman is given an incentive by way of a grant of £15 or £20 to employ a man the State benefits because people are taken off the dole queues.  That is why I am suggesting that the same thing should apply to farmers who do not want social welfare but want incentives to develop their holdings.  Farmers do not want to be living on the State but they want what they are justly entitled to, that they be given the same incentives to develop their holdings as farmers who are classified as development farmers.  The directives must be changed, or if not we must introduce our own national pre-development <Col N="991" /> scheme.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I drew the attention of the former Minister for Health to the question of relatives not being given an allowance for looking after their own people with the exception of cases where only the invalid and the person looking after him or her were residing in the house.  I would take a risk and give a decent allowance to people who keep their relatives at home where they should and want to be kept.  I would do so because it would save the State money.  It costs a substantial amount of money to keep old people in institutions.  The Minister for Health should look into this matter.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I was glad to hear the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Hussey, say that a substantial amount of money would be coming from the EEC towards drainage schemes in the west.  There is a scarcity of suitable land in the west and a lot of land could be improved by proper drainage.  I hope some of this EEC money will be used to carry out drainage work in my constituency because hundreds of acres of land could be improved.  I accept that some of the land adjacent to the Suck and the Shannon cannot be drained, but a lot of work could be done without interfering with those rivers.  The Minister of State at that Department also mentioned that the scheme for severely handicapped areas would be reviewed in Brussels. Severely handicapped areas are based on district electoral divisions, and unless more than 50 per cent of a DED is severely handicapped that area does not qualify.  A DED can consist of up to 1,200 acres and if more than half of that area is not severely handicapped the area is not considered to be severely handicapped irrespective of how poor the land is.  I am aware that entire counties have been included in this scheme.  I do not begrudge them that, but I travelled through those counties and I know there are many areas of good land there.  I worked in Donegal and Mayo and I know the condition of the land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> In my view the best way to operate this scheme would be per farm.  I understand that the EEC would not accept that and, therefore, I suggest the scheme operate on the basis of townlands.  In a district electoral divisions of 1,000 acres there could be 400 acres of miserable bog land but because those living on that land are in good company they will not qualify under that scheme.  The EEC recognise that our 12 western counties are disadvantaged areas, and for that reason I cannot see why those counties are not recognised as being severely handicapped.  I would like to have seen improvements in this regard contained in the budget, because if small farmers are given a reasonable chance they will prove their worth.</P>
    <P>I understand that the question of land settlement is being considered by a commission at present and that a report is awaited on the whole question of land structure.  That report should be speeded up, because a lot of land is being sold in anticipation of some control.  We should be told when we can expect this report, because this is an urgent matter.  If the small farmers in the west are to survive land structure and drainage are very important.  We cannot afford to wait another 12 months for a report to be presented on land structure.  I expect to have a lot to say about land structure, because I have heard so much about local committees being set up to decide on who would be appointed to a panel dealing with the sale of land and so on.  I would not go on such a panel because I would be afraid of the outcome. Although the Land Commission have a lot of faults at least they are not involved locally.  It would be wrong that the advisory service be asked to decide who should get land because those who operate that service are the friends of all farmers.</P>
    <P>At present small farmers are waiting to see what will happen, they are sitting on the ditch hopeful because there is a lot of confidence in the Government. I have made comments that are not favourable as far as the budget is concerned but I do not believe in only making statements that are favourable. A person who is politically neutral <Col N="993" /> would switch off his radio if Deputy Colley and Deputy Barry discussed the budget because one would be contradicting the other, but such a person wants to hear independent comments from Deputies from both sides.  I am fed up with Members lacerating Members on the other side when they speak here.  The people expect that of politicians. When I was on the other side of the House I always tried to give an objective view of anything which came before the House.  I am giving this as an objective view of the budget.  My criticisms are genuine.  I hope the budget will encourage the private sector to give the jobs which are necessary.  I would like the community to be involved and I would like the State to be more involved, because I believe that everybody should be involved if we are to create employment.</P>
    <P>I would like the speakers on the other side to be like I am and if there is something good in the budget to say what it is and to lacerate what is bad in it.  I ask them what is the alternative to the policy of Fianna Fáil?  Are we to sit still and say that the economy is improving slightly?  That is not good enough.  We must take risks.  The budget is taking risks.  I feel the people have confidence in the Government and in the policies put forward by them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said we were in a race with an inexperienced jockey. I understand the jockey is Professor Martin O'Donoghue, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the horse is Deputy George Colley, the Minister for Finance.  If both Ministers do not go into the race what do we do?  We do not take part in the race, we stay as we are, we let unemployment build up around us and we do not move forward.  They are in the race and I believe the jockey is fairly good.  I hope they win it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said we were in a gambler's race.  It was said time and time again of the late Seán Lemass that he was a gambler, but nobody did more for industrial development than he did.  One cannot gamble blindly; one must have a policy.  The policies which Fianna Fáil are gambling on are well thought out ones.  This can <Col N="994" /> work with the goodwill of the people who have the money and are prepared to invest it to create employment as well as the goodwill of the workers who are prepared to accept a reasonable increase in their wages.  We want to be sure that our youth will get employment.</P>
    <P>I have been very critical about some parts of the budget.  It is good for any Deputy to be critical and to express his opinions.  At the same time I believe the budget is for one purpose. If there are certain things which I would prefer to see something done about I am prepared to wait, but I am giving notice that I will be very vocal in the future about some of the things I have mentioned in connection with the future of the small farmers and certain social welfare matters I mentioned.  I am sorry that there is nobody present on the Labour Party benches because I would like to ask them to answer my question about who has a social conscience.  They told me that Fianna Fáil had no social conscience.  My conscience is very clear in regard to percentage increases. Nobody from the Labour Party benches has come in here to justify 6 per cent giving £3 to a £50 man and £12 to a £200 man and at the same time complain about the budget. It is hypocrisy to complain about the budget being orientated towards the moneyed people.  I admit it is to get them to invest their money and create employment.  If you give an increase on a percentage basis the man higher up the ladder gets most and the man down lower gets least.  I never agree with percentage increases.</P>
    <P>The people with money who are getting concessions in the budget are getting them to invest their money and create employment.  I appeal to the banks, some of which are making £50 million, that they should see that the money is invested to create employment. Job creation is the idea behind the budget.  If this budget, which has been criticised so much, does not succeed neither Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael nor any other party will be the losers. It is the people with money in the country who are getting the chance to create employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> The Opposition have been talking about wealth tax.  If the people with money do not help to create employment I will press my party to tax them very heavily.  The youth of the country will not stand idly by any longer and see wealth accumulate and men decay. If that wealth is not put to good use we could have an educated violent queue in the country.  The people with money should realise that they have got concessions and have got incentives to employ people, and should decide to do that.  I like to hear criticism from any side of the House about the budget.  I have been very critical about many parts of the budget but I am 100 per cent behind the general principle of it to create employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pleasure for me to follow such a respected Member of the House as Deputy Callanan, whose contribution was intelligent and non-partisan.  I wish such an approach could be adopted by all Members of the House.</P>
      <P>I want to say a few words about the national pay agreement.  As my party spokesman on Labour matters I have repeatedly stressed in several speeches over the past few months the need in the national interest for a moderate national pay agreement.  My party urge all concerned to reach a national pay agreement which will give the work force a fair share of the economic growth to which they have substantially contributed by pay restraint in the past, and at the same time that the pay agreement will be of such a nature as to contribute substantially to further economic growth in the years ahead. It would be an enlightened approach if the trade unions and work force generally agreed to a moderate agreement thereby enhancing the possibility of more job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is becoming abundantly clear that the major issue confronting the country &mdash;and indeed the whole of the western world&mdash;is the creation of jobs.  I should like to talk a little more about the national pay agreement.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development, the Minister for Finance, the <Col N="996" /> Minister for Labour and the Taoiseach spoke several times between the election and Christmas of a 10 per cent to 12 per cent increase in pay.  I agree that 12 per cent is about the right figure.  Of course, that includes genuine tax cuts together with increases to be made by employers.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development tried to drag in on a number of occasions as part of those tax cuts the abolition of car tax and domestic rates.  I do not think anybody should accept, nor do I think the Minister seriously thinks anybody should, that the abolition of car tax and domestic rates should be considered part of the pay increases under the national pay agreement.  Whether or not there is a national pay agreement, car tax and rates have gone and this or any other Government would not dare to reimpose them.  They are best left aside from the national pay agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a plea for moderation.  They should not be connected with the national pay agreement because the latter applies mainly to organised labour.  Organised labour in general benefits much less from the abolition of car tax and domestic rates than do the wealthier classes&mdash;the multi-car family, the person living in a big mansion whose rates were perhaps £3,000 or £4,000 a year.  They benefit more than does the worker in a local authority house whose rates bill came to £50 a year, who received a reduction of £1 a week in his rent on 1 January increased subsequently from 1 February by 50p.  That was the clawback on the rates reduction to local authority tenants.  Therefore, for that reason it should not be considered in the context of the national pay agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income tax concessions announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget are real tax cuts and I believe are being taken into account in the national pay agreement talks, as witnessed by the response of the trade union movement by reducing their pay claim to 8 per cent.  This <Col N="997" /> party welcomes that response to the budget.  It is an enlightened one and is in the interests of the workers as a whole.  It is somewhat above the 5 per cent limit to which the Fianna Fáil Party committed themselves in their manifesto and which the Government have been parading for some time.  I should like to see agreement reached on a figure as low as 5 per cent if further tax cuts were forthcoming.  I said in several speeches, some of which were reported in the papers, that the largest possible part of the 12 per cent &mdash;which I agree is approximately the right figure, slightly above the rate of inflation in the past year&mdash;should be borne by the Exchequer in tax cuts. The Exchequer has declared it is standing by the improvement in tax allowances and the trade union movement has responded by a reduction of 4 per cent in its claim.  I note that the employers and unions are today meeting the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to discuss further the present stage of the national pay agreement. The unions have declared that 8 per cent is their rock-bottom limit.  I would make this appeal&mdash;and I hope it will be appreciated as a non-partisan one in the interests of the country&mdash; that the unions might agree to a further reduction of that 8 per cent, perhaps a half per cent or one per cent, if they can succeed in getting employers to commit themselves to some percentage increase in private sector employment. That would constitute a major contribution to our economic recovery, with all workers being better off in the end.</P>
    <P>It is right to put on record this party's views on the national pay agreement and its importance to our economic future.  It is correct also that we pay tribute to the restraint shown by the trade union movement and the work force generally in having negotiated and accepted a very moderate pay agreement which has contributed in no small way to the huge jump in productivity, in input and exports.  I am afraid the trade union movement might be somewhat despondent because, while that restraint did produce the economic upsurge to which I have <Col N="998" /> referred, it did not produce more jobs in the private sector; in fact there was some decrease in established manufacturing industry.  That is no encouragement to the trade union movement today and holds out no hope that another moderate pay agreement would produce more private sector jobs.  That is why I make the suggestion that perhaps a smaller increase than 8 per cent might be agreed&mdash;perhaps 7 per cent or 7½ per cent&mdash;on the condition that by the end of the year a certain percentage increase would be achieved in private sector employment.  It is important that I make our party's position clear in view of the distortions which some Deputies and one Minister sought to make of our Leader's speech, in which he was quoted as saying that the budget would infuriate and in no way help the national pay agreement.  As Deputy Callanan said, this budget favours and is all for the rich.</P>
    <P>I have the honour to represent an entirely working class area, almost exclusively made up of local authority dwellings.  There, apart from the huge number of unemployed, there are a great many on such small incomes and with such large families that they do not pay income tax.  These people benefit very little from the abolition of domestic rates and they did not benefit at all from the abolition of car tax or from any reliefs given in income tax.  I agree that there are people much worse off than them and I am disappointed that in his income tax concessions the Minister did not introduce a system of tax credits under which a person who does not earn enough to pay income tax would be given an allowance in respect of every £ he earns under the taxable limit.  That would be one way to provide for the needy and it would mitigate against the terribly conservative nature of the budget.</P>
    <P>The people of whom I have been speaking will benefit very little from the national pay agreement because getting the minimum increase will not affect lower paid workers very much. The gap between them and the better off sections of the community has been widened dramatically since this Government <Col N="999" /> came back to power, and this budget has not given any confidence to workers that they would get a fair deal eventually while this Government are in power.  This is a Government of the wealthy.</P>
    <P>Although I say that, I wish to emphasise that we want income moderation, because anything else would be detrimental to the welfare of the economy.  My main interest is in job creation, and when I speak on it I do not want to be party political.  I will look at the budget's effects in the job creation area.  It would be wrong not to recognise that most of the provisions in the budget arise from the promises in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, and to my mind it is essential that a party should seek to fulfil promises that helped to bring them to power. Otherwise cynicism would prevail.</P>
    <P>What must be questioned, however, is the wisdom of making lavish promises at election times.  It has been said that the Taoiseach and his Cabinet deeply regret the promises they made, first because many of the promises were not in the best national interests and second, if the Government had had a free hand, some of the promises were ones they would not have pursued.  The extent of Fianna Fáil's victory suggests that power, without such an embarrassingly large majority, could have been achieved without some of the promises.</P>
    <P>It became clear long ago that Fianna Fáil in Opposition would sell their mothers to get back to power, and to that extent there is not the same determination among these benches&mdash; we would not sell our mothers.  Differences among Deputies at the moment are very slender because all Deputies want job creation to progress.  Many figures have been bandied about in this respect.  Late last year the Economic and Social Research Institute published a paper stating that up to 2,000 jobs per year would achieve full employment by 1986.  Before Christmas I came across a Department of Finance paper published in 1968.  It was entitled &ldquo;Towards Full Employment by 1978&rdquo;.  The same sort of arguments <Col N="1000" /> and figures were produced then.  We have achieved nothing like the figures suggested.  Indeed we have gone into reverse in this regard.  In one such document full employment has been described variously as allowing for a 4 per cent or a 5 per cent unemployment level, although the NIEC some time ago said that full employment would allow only a 2 per cent level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>There is also make believe about this figure of 28,000.  Speaker after speaker, Ministers included, seem to think they can talk that figure down. It appears as 28,000, 25,000, 20,000.  I even saw it at 15,000 or 10,000, as if you could talk the problem away and talk the requirements down.  The fact is that the figure is much higher.</P>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute projections contain the serious error of defining full employment as 5 per cent unemployment.  They contain two major omissions.  First, they make no allowance for the trend in recent years of a rapidly increasing participation rate for women workers. I have extracted from the EEC labour survey of 1975, and from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, the fact that the participation rate for Irish women between the ages of 25 and 55 years is half the participation rate of women in the rest of the EEC.  That means women in the rest of the EEC are more than twice as likely to work than women here.</P>
    <P>The ESRI projections, which are used by the Government and others, deliberately ignore, and say they ignore, the increasing trends of participation by women in the past five years. Instead they choose the previous five years, which is a mistake.  The fact is that a proportion of married women not currently on the unemployment register will seek jobs out of every 1,000 jobs we create.  The more jobs become available, the more women will seek them and, therefore, the more jobs we will need.  There is no doubt that, if you look at the trend over the past 15 years in the rest of Europe, the participation rate of women has zoomed upwards.  That started to happen here in the past five years.  Projecting <Col N="1001" /> that trend onwards, by 1986 women will be working here at the EEC rate of participation.</P>
    <P>As I said already, we are just below half the rest of the EEC rate.  If that rate continues to increase, and if we are to catch up&mdash;and I am not suggesting we should aim to catch up; but I believe this will happen as a normal, cultural, social and economic happening&mdash;women will seek jobs more and more as they become available. We have to provide for that.  We can almost anticipate by 1986 a desired female participation rate perhaps as much as three times and certainly as much as two-and-a-half times higher than the present female participation rate in economic activity.  That is a major omission in the ESRI projection.</P>
    <P>The second major omission is this. It does not take into account the fact that, as a country, we produce per head only half what our German, French, Dutch, Belgian and even Italian competitors do.  It takes two Irishmen to produce what one European man produces, and possibly two Irishmen to produce what one European woman produces.  That is a fact to which we as a country have to face up.  It is another unpalatable fact.  If we were sensible we would accept in our projections that we have to be competitive if in the long term we are to survive and prosper.  We have to be as productive as our neighbours in Europe.  They are our main competitors. There is no use in our basing our economic future on producing half as much per head as the others. We have to produce the same and we must aim to produce the same.</P>
    <P>No matter what is provided in this budget, no matter what incentives are in the budget&mdash;and there are some incentives&mdash;no matter what clauses are in the national wage agreement&mdash;and I believe there should be clauses about private sector employment&mdash;the fact is that private enterprise has to operate on the basis of the profit motive.  They have to compete to survive.  Private enterprise will continue irreversibly to seek to produce as much as possible with as few people as possible, because that is the natural and logical follow <Col N="1002" /> up to the profit motive.  They have to be as competitive as their competitors.</P>
    <P>If we are to attract foreign investment on the scale required we have to be able to show that we can produce, man for man and woman for woman, as much as our competitors.  Otherwise we are living in a fool's paradise and our economic base is a false bottom which is liable to collapse eventually. That fact is not included in the gloomy projections of job creation requirements of 28,000 per year between now and 1986.  We have twice as many people at work today as are really needed to do what they are doing, and that does not cover the agricultural sector where, again, we compare very unfavourably with our Danish competitors. We have twice as many people working as is necessary according to European standards.  That means that if we are sensible and intelligent we include in our projections the need to create real jobs for half the present workforce, together with many more married women working, together with a realistic full employment figure.</P>
    <P>Why I dispute the 5 per cent unemployment figure is that historically this country has had high unemployment. We have never had anything like full employment.  We have never been able to put anything like all our people to work.  Consequently&mdash;and I know this as a person who has come up from the shop floor, a person who, you might say, comes from a long line of labouring people&mdash;the attitude is that you protect your job and make it better for the next person.  That means you create as many jobs as possible.  You exercise as many restrictive practices as possible in order to protect and create jobs because of this terrible problem we have always had as a nation of huge unemployment and huge emigration.</P>
    <P>Now that emigration as a choice has almost gone, I hope never to return, we are forced to face up to a serious job creation problem.  I am pleading that account be taken of the other factors involved: extreme underproductivity, extreme under-participation of women.  If these factors are taken into account and if we go for true full employment&mdash;and I agree <Col N="1003" /> with the NIEC estimate of ten years ago&mdash;then we are talking in terms of creating over 50,000 jobs per year.</P>
    <P>To every economist in this country I would pose this question: please assess annual job creation need between now and 1986 taking into account (1) our present school-going population; (2) average annual retirements and natural wastage; (3) no net emigration; (4) a European level of female participation in economic activity; (5) European levels of productivity; (6) true full employment; (7) redundancies and (8) drift from the land.  They are the factors that have to be taken into account.  I would wager that no economist would come up with a job creation figure of less than 50,000 per annum, because that is the true dimension of our problem.  If we were to accept this loose 5 per cent we would be fooling ourselves, because a lot of our problems are caused by a lackadaisical attitude which shows in other areas, for instance, in sloppiness, in unhygienic cafés, in dirty towns. This comes from the fact that we have two men doing work where one woman would do.  This has an enormously bad influence.</P>
    <P>To talk about 5 per cent is taking a figure which looks like full employment but it is not and which will not solve the problem.  We must face the necessary solutions.  I do not think private enterprise is capable of providing a solution.  That is where the budget is terribly wrong.  It is an ideological conservative budget, probably the first ever such budget the country has known.  A new ideology has crept into Irish politics.  Fianna Fáil have become the conservative party of Ireland.  The Taoiseach could be said to be to the right of Margaret Thatcher.  Private enterprise is depended on by the budget but private enterprise cannot hope to solve the problem, because as I have already pointed out private enterprise has already more people than it needs.</P>
    <P>Where does that leave us?  The budget asks private enterprise to increase employment by 3 per cent.  We are making work in the public service. The approach is to create jobs which <Col N="1004" /> are not real jobs.  It will look good. People will be paid to do nothing. The figures look better than to have them on the dole, but this does not contribute in any way to a solution of our problem and is ignoring the true extent of the problem.  I support the idea of private enterprise and I recognise the need for private enterprise.  Radical solutions are required.  The Government must think in terms of massive public enterprise.  The problem about public enterprise is that it has a terribly bad name.  Unfortunately, when thinking of semi-State or State bodies one thinks of CIE losing perhaps £40 million a year.  This week I asked the Minister if he would not consider presenting the Government annual subvention to CIE in a different manner. It is given as a subvention to commercial loss.  CIE is a social service.  Most public services are social services.  It saps the morale of the personnel in CIE to have to work under this sense of commercial loss when there is no hope of anything else, when they are providing services which are purely social services.  The results should not appear as a financial loss.  It should be handled differently.  The morale of management and workers would be greatly improved and the name of semi-State companies would be greatly enhanced, if there were a different approach.  That is one of the main reasons why semi-State companies have a bad reputation.  Low morale in CIE causes strain and bad public relations and results in strikes which further diminish their reputation. When thinking of semi-State companies one does not think of Bord Bainne, the Irish Sugar Company, Bord Fáilte, the ESB.  Many State companies do a very good job and we have a lot to be proud of and thankful for.</P>
    <P>There is nothing inherently wrong with State enterprise.  There would be if State enterprise were replacing private enterprise.  I would take objection to that.  But, where private enterprise cannot cope, it is incumbent on the State to move in.  The State has done so in some areas, in what could be called essential areas.  I am advocating a new departure, a new dimension <Col N="1005" /> of State participation.  The time has come for the State to involve itself in manufacturing ventures.  That is the only way in which we can tackle the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The budget and the actions of the Government in the last six months have been so ideologically conservative, so much in the wrong direction, as to be unbelievable.  The budget abolishes the wealth tax.  I do not care whether it does or not.  There was not much coming in from this tax although I think it is iniquitous that very wealthy people should now be able to get away without paying one penny tax while a widow on a widow's pension who happens to have a few shillings extra from some other source will have to pay income tax, like my own mother does.  A wealthy person might have paid £5,000, £6,000 or £8,000 in rates on a large mansion.  That is gone.</P>
    <P>Such people benefit by the budget considerably more than poor people living in council cottages, because they were already so poor they did not have to pay rates and they certainly did not have to pay tax on several cars.  They do not have to pay wealth tax now and they can live off their capital gains. They are contributing nothing to the State and yet ordinary people in the PAYE sector have to pay 87 per cent of all income tax.  There will be a revolution eventually if that percentage is not radically reduced.  To do that means getting others to pay, but this budget goes in the reverse direction. The farmers will pay less income tax than was budgeted for last year and there is no wealth tax.  Everybody, with the exception of the PAYE sector, is getting away with murder.</P>
    <P>On the matter of rates, I agree that many young people found the charge penal but the matter could have been handled so that everybody got equal benefit.  For instance, the first £30 household valuation could have been remitted so that all would benefit to that amount.  In the case of a person with a higher valuation he could pay on the excess amount.  That would be fair because it is obvious that anyone with a house in excess of that valuation owns a very sizeable property. It would be an equitable way of <Col N="1006" /> giving relief across the board.  The poorer section and the young married couples would get as much relief as some of the gentry throughout the country who benefit now to the tune of many thousands of pounds each year.  For them the rates are gone and the tax is gone.</P>
    <P>Prior to the official budget we had a few mini-budgets.  The Government abolished subsidies on cheese, butter and on town gas.  Again, the poor people were clobbered.  The budget did not lower the age for old age pension benefits, and this is wrong certainly in the context of job creation.  There was no increase in children's allowance even though, as was pointed out several times in this House, this is the only direct income of many women. As Deputy FitzGerald said, and he is unquestionably right, this was an antisocial budget.</P>
    <P>I would accept the measures in the short term if real jobs were created in the long term.  I am not referring to &ldquo;make work&rdquo; jobs, getting more people to do the same amount of work, thus making us even less competitive than we are at the moment as compared with countries in Europe.  The Minister for Labour introduced what he called the employment action team. He issued a statement last August about this matter and said that the emphasis was on action, but seven months later we find that not one job has materialised as a result of that measure.  There is a rumour in the Press that they have come forward with a suggestion of 800 jobs dealing with physical fitness courses.  The Minister told Deputy Kenny recently in a written reply that the matter had been referred to the Department of Health for consideration.  That is the only suggestion they have come up with.</P>
    <P>They are also talking about work experience programmes.  What does that mean?  People want work; the experience will come if they get work. The great employment action team have done nothing and I think they should be disbanded.  The whole business is just a charade.  There are about 30 people involved and nine Departments are represented but nothing has come of it.  I cannot think of anything <Col N="1007" /> more cumbersome.  It is clear from statements by the Minister and from answers to questions here that they are looking for ways and means of making up jobs.  They are living in a make-believe world, as are the Government. They are making jobs in the public service that are not necessary and they are asking private enterprise to adopt the same course.  It is all false and wrong and they are deluding themselves.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Government will realise that they must reverse their policy, that they cannot expect private enterprise&mdash;which is only half as productive as its competitors abroad&mdash;to create jobs that do not exist.  We must look at the possibility of a public manufacturing enterprise.  Every day as I travel to and from this House I find myself in traffic jams.  All the cars are manufactured abroad.  I realise that private enterprise could not operate in this area.  If we were to produce cars the unit costs would be much higher but if the State had regard both to the units costs and the social benefits I am sure it could come into the realm of competitiveness.  The same applies to other types of machinery. Even with regard to coat-hangers, one sees printed on them &ldquo;Déanta san tSualann&rdquo; or &ldquo;Déanta san tSeapain&rdquo;. Machinery, fridges, and washing machines could be made here.  Private enterprise could not do it because the scale would not be big enough, it would not be economic and the unit costs would be too high, but if the social cost were examined I think it could be within the competence of the State.  It would stand up to any cost/ benefit analysis so far as the State is concerned.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation are building houses in the inner city.  The cost of each unit is £26,000, about double the cost of a house in the outer suburbs. People may say it is not economical to build in the inner city, but one must take account of the services already available, such as schools, shops, buses, churches and the tradition of a settled community.  It is intelligent to build houses in the inner city even though the cost is twice as high as <Col N="1008" /> building elsewhere.  On the same basis I am arguing that we have to look in a thorough and businesslike way to providing many of the items that up to now we have imported.</P>
    <P>Unless there is a complete reversal of the Government's direction we will have an alarming swing to the right. This must be due to the influence of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, the new economic wizard, who has pushed men who showed themselves in the past to be socially conscious and concerned for the poor.  I am referring to men such as the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, who is concerned for the poor and the less well off.  Since last June they have adopted a strategy and a series of decisions that can only be described as right-wing ideological decisions.</P>
    <P>I do not think, even if we go into the manufacturing enterprise to which I referred, we could create in the immediate term the kind of jobs we need. There are other areas that need attention. Perhaps they need a strong and firm line from the Government and no Government are better placed to take decisions than the present Government with their unparalleled majority. We know that in Connacht there are 1,000,000 unproductive acres.  Connacht is the smallest of our four provinces. We all know how unproductive we are as an agricultural country compared with Denmark.  We all know half the world is starving.</P>
    <P>I have some little advantage here in that, though my family has lived for many generations in Dublin, I am married to a farmer's daughter.  In the last number of years I have got to know something of the problems and ills of farming.  Every year we have either gluts and surpluses or else shortages.  Only last night I was reading about what should be done with the milk surplus.  In a year or two there will be grants designed to produce more milk.  I cannot understand this.  We had the beef mountain followed by a beef shortage.  At the moment we have a potato mountain. A year ago we had a shortage of potatoes. There are all these swings in <Col N="1009" /> supply.  In no area does the nation stand to benefit more than it does in agriculture by more intensive farming, better planning and proper control of production.  It is a very big area.  The whole question of owning and husbanding the land is a very emotive one, for good historical reasons, but we cannot afford to let acres which could be made productive lie barren.  We must look at the whole area of agricultural production.</P>
    <P>I do not like the word &ldquo;radical&rdquo;. People talk about &ldquo;radical&rdquo; solutions when they mean nothing of the kind. Certainly radical solutions are needed to solve one of the big problems in the agricultural area.  I have never been emotive about taxing farmers but those who can afford to pay tax should pay their fair share.  I have an uncle who is a very wealthy farmer.  Up to recently he did not pay any tax while his sister, my mother, was taxed on her widow's pension.  That can hardly be described as fair.  At the same time I know farmers plough their money back into the land.  There are many wealthy people, self-employed and professional, getting away with absolute murder.  I would like to see a tax system for farmers which would not stifle production or act as a disincentive. The notional system helps to avoid that.  If I could devise it, I would have a tax on unproductive land.  It would probably need the wisdom of Solomon to design such a tax, but that is what I would do, because we have abundant wealth in our green fields if only we use them properly.  We could produce three times what we are producing and sell many times more than we are selling to the starving world.</P>
    <P>I am spokesman for Labour on this side of the House and I am determined to the utmost of my ability to prevent industrial relations and job creation becoming part of a political issue.  The matter is far too serious to be made a political issue.  I trust the present Minister for Labour will take note of that. Recently I asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development if the Government were considering as part of their economic and social plans such things as a higher school leaving age, possibly an earlier retirement age <Col N="1010" />&mdash;something that is not helped by the budget since this year there is no reduction in the qualifying age&mdash;possibly a shorter working week and possibly compulsory national service.  It goes against the grain for me to suggest the latter but I am appalled by the vulnerability of the country where defence is concerned.  If tomorrow the British withdrew from Northern Ireland&mdash;this is something the Taoiseach spoke about recently&mdash;we could not do a sausage about it because our troops would get no further than Newry.  We are in a most vulnerable position defencewise.  Many people visit my clinics and every time a soldier comes in, even though he is in mufti, I know immediately he is a soldier.  He is smart and intelligent.  He knows what he wants.  He knows how to express himself. National service would be one way of giving some outlet for energies. It would provide a valuable training for our abandoned youth.  I hope this budget will provide some real jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested in Deputy Callanan describing the budget as a calculated gamble because I come from an area where gambling is more of a virtue than a vice.  Possibly my thinking on the budget will be influenced by that.  I was interested to hear Deputy Mitchell trying to clarify what his Leader said with regard to the wage agreement.  I was amazed at the attitude of both Opposition Leaders when, to my way of thinking at any rate, they seem to be saying: &ldquo;It looks as if Fianna Fáil are going to pull it off this time.  What can we do to wreck things?&rdquo;  The attitude of the Leader of Fine Gael in saying that the budget was designed to infuriate the unions, that a national wage agreement was not possible, was a way of saying: &ldquo;If Fianna Fáil have produced the goods in the budget and if a national wage agreement of 5 per cent or near to it is possible, this might get the country moving again.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell has adopted a responsible attitude towards the national wage agreement, and I compliment him on it, but I cannot agree with what his Leader said regarding <Col N="1011" /> the wage agreement.  Many ardent supporters of his party in my constituency, who would never vote for me or any member of my party, were perturbed by his attitude when he replied to the budget last Thursday&mdash;that his attitude was not in the national interest.</P>
    <P>A short time ago we published a plan which stated that the budget introduced on 1 February would be the first phase in implementing that plan. In that document we set out clearly what we hoped to do during our term of office.  I have spoken previously on the Industrial Development Bill and I have referred, as Deputy Mitchell has, to our unemployment problem.  A previous speaker said that if we are not able to create the jobs that are needed in the next six years there will be no need for any political parties in this House.  In my first speech I concluded by saying that there will be no one left to share the spoils unless this Government are able to create the necessary number of jobs.  I have said it before and I agree with everyone who has said that job creation is above party politics.  If the Government fail to tackle unemployment there may be thousands of young people on the steps of Leinster House and they will ask Deputies Mitchell, Callanan and myself if we have ever done anything for them.  It is inevitable that democracy as we know it today could not withstand such pressures. The creation of employment for young people is so urgent that each party should endeavour to pull its weight. That is why I could not understand the attitudes of Deputies FitzGerald and Cluskey when they spoke on the budget.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial on the budget of 2 February which reads:</P>
    <P>Courageous enough, for example, to make their first Budget a tough one.  There will be time over the next few years to sweeten up the electors for the return campaign; but, of course, Fianna Fáil was tied down to the terms of their manifesto. That is why they got in.  Now, the disadvantages of their tactics must be obvious even to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> They cannot, they say, break their promises.  If the electorate thought that they were really going to move this country, they might accept a temporary postponement of some of the rosy promises.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the writer of that article wants us to do.  I think the budget was courageous and radical.  We have taken a calculated gamble in one direction.  If Fianna Fáil had wished to play the normal political game they would have brought in an easy budget and sweetened up the electorate at a later stage for the return bout.  Our commitment to the problem of unemployment is shown in the budget by the calculated risks we have taken, and we have taken this step in our first budget instead of waiting until next year or the year after.  Perhaps the writer of the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> wanted us to go in the other direction and produce a tough budget.  A tough budget would mean taking more money out of the economy, more taxation, which would leave less money in the hands of the individual and would result in dampening the economy and reducing employment.</P>
    <P>The question of job creation has been bandied about with figures ranging from 16,000 to 50,000, but the bible in regard to job creation is the ESRI report prepared by Dr. Walsh. In his latest report he regards full employment as 96 per cent employment and 4 per cent unemployment.  That figure of 4 per cent is twice the accepted rate of 1968.  In 1968, we accepted 2 per cent and now we are agreeing on 4 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has gone up to 5 per cent in the latest report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It highlights the fact that we seem to be going backwards. In his November report Dr. Walsh explained the reason for the increase to 4 per cent.  He said we must recognise that participation levels have fallen.  What he means is that the experts are beginning to accept that only a certain number of people will work at any one time.  He said that the money received by people who are not working has influenced 4 per cent of <Col N="1013" /> the population not to work at all.  I refer to that because Dr. Walsh's projections for the next ten years are the figures which we are all taking about. If we want to create 20,000 to 30,000 jobs per year, there is some justification in what Deputy Mitchell says about our productivity and the real level of employment.  Thirty thousand jobs is twice the number that any Government were able to create at any time in the past.  The highest number of jobs we were able to create in the sixties was between 11,000 and 13,000. In 1978, when we are a full member of the EEC with all the complications that brings with it, we must create twice that number of jobs, which gives an idea of the enormity of our problem. As I said, we have taken a gamble and have banked heavily on private enterprise.  If the jobs are not created we will have to have another look at the situation and think more about public enterprise.  It will probably be considered heresy for an accountant like myself to suggest that we should have anything to do with public enterprise.</P>
      <P>This budget contains exactly what I advocated during the election campaign: that we should give more incentive to work, leave more money in the hands of the individual and give him more control over his disposable income. I felt we should get the country moving in that direction, and that is what the budget does.</P>
      <P>Before the election I spoke about borrowing and said we should adopt such a course.  I also suggested that taxation should be reduced, the individual be encouraged and that we should bank on the private sector.  If the private sector do not produce the goods&mdash;I have every confidence in the private sector that they will produce the goods&mdash;another day will come when we will have to tackle the problem. Fianna Fáil have shown that they are not afraid to tackle any section of the community, and if the private sector fail in this regard we will have to tell those involved that as they failed we must adopt a different approach.</P>

    <P>There are many incentives for employers in the budget and I appeal <Col N="1014" /> to them all to carry out investigations to see if it is possible for them to take on additional workers.  They should remember that they qualify for a grant of £14 per week if they take on a school leaver and that we have liberalised the terms of the employment incentive scheme by raising the amount to be paid to an employer who takes a person off the live register to £20.  We are also giving £5 right across the board in labour intensive industries and a tremendous relief to firms who employ extra workers as far as corporation tax is concerned.  Any firm that increases its labour force by 3 per cent per annum will only have to pay 25 per cent corporation tax, a phenomenal thing for the private sector.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with taxation all my working life I can say that such a provision is an indication to the private sector that the Government want the jobs created.  The Government will also continue with stock relief and other tax incentives.  It is important that private industry bear in mind that the Government has given them this great opportunity.  They should not let the Government down in this regard.</P>
    <P>Many commentators have referred to the high borrowing requirement in the budget, but I see nothing wrong with a business or government, borrowing. It depends on the purposes for which one intends borrowing.  We told the people before the election why we were going to borrow £X million, that it was to prime the pump.  It is the same as a business man approaching his financiers to borrow £10,000 to start a business.  Before he does so he estimates that out of the profits he will make in his first years of operation he will be able to repay it.  That is what the Government have done.  They have borrowed with the intention of creating extra jobs and from the taxation that will accrue from those extra workers and the saving in social welfare by reducing the number of people on the live register they will be in a position to repay the debt.</P>
    <P>The Government hope to create an additional 22,000 jobs.  I am a little concerned about some of the jobs the Government hope to create.  For instance, <Col N="1015" /> they hope to create 6,000 jobs in the public sector.  It is recognised by economists that one needs four jobs in the private sector to fund one job in the public sector.  By creating 6,000 jobs in the public sector the Government are hoping to have 24,000 jobs created in the private sector to fund that amount.  That is not provided for in this budget, but the Minister must be hoping that in a future budget public sector employment will have less of a role to play than the private sector.  I am always nervous about creating large bureaucracies which tend to feed on themselves and create more jobs for themselves.  The bigger the civil service gets the less likely we are to get any answers and the more difficult it is for radical or good ideas to go from the bottom to the top.  It is wrong to create big bureaucracies.  In directing the economy we must make up our minds whether we want capitalism or socialism.  In my view private enterprise is the best way to move the economy, and the budget gives that sector a chance, but what is wrong here and in Britain is that the amount of money taken out of the private sector to fund civil servants and public enterprise is too great with the result that the private sector is being stifled.  I would not like to see the public sector continue to increase, and I hope that the provision in the budget is a once-off operation to get people back to work and that we will create jobs in the private sector from now on.</P>
    <P>I hope the prospects of an agreement in the national pay talks are near. In our election manifesto we hoped for a 5 per cent pay increase which, in line with the tax cuts given in the budget, would mean an increase of 11 per cent for a married man with two children. I hope the wage agreement will be near 5 per cent because the Government have indicated their attitude to any increase above that figure.  I was pleased to see that the trade union movement have taken a responsible attitude to the tax concessions in the Budget and I hope a pay agreement is concluded shortly.</P>
    <P>Another Member referred to the fact that the National Coalition removed <Col N="1016" /> estate duty, but it should be remembered that they replaced that duty with three additional taxes&mdash;wealth tax, capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax.  The people indicated to the National Coalition that they did not like those taxes in the last election.  I have always said that I would be against a wealth tax whether it was introduced by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the Labour Party.  I admire Deputy Donegan who opposed that tax in principle when in Government.  It was a destructive tax which was introduced at the wrong time.  We should have been trying to create jobs at that time and not making people afraid to invest their money here.  If a person had £1.1 million he would pay roughly £10,000 in wealth tax and if it takes £3,650 to create a job&mdash;that is the figure used by the IDA&mdash;then that £1.1 million if invested in a factory could create 350 jobs.</P>
    <P>If you take the earnings of that industry to be £50 per worker per week the net loss to that industry would be £875,000 a year.  If you take the multiplier that that money would bring to the economy at 3, making £2.6 million indirectly lost, you come to a net loss to the economy of £3.5 million. The Government collected £10,000 wealth tax from that industry.  That is a wrong way of doing things.  It created an aura that the previous Government were more geared towards getting in extra taxation, such as wealth tax, capital gains tax, farmer taxation and co-op taxation.  The Minister for Finance in each budget he introduced, except the last one, referred to tax evasions and said that he was going to do all sorts of things.  I sympathise with him in his efforts to try to create a more equitable tax code.  That created the impression in Ireland and abroad that the Government were out for screwing the private sector.  Since we have to rely on the private sector to invest money the image that was created by the previous Government did not help us during the recession period.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition said in his speech on the budget that it was a disgrace that wealth tax was gone.  I have no hesitation in saying that I am <Col N="1017" /> very glad wealth tax has been removed from the statute book.  We did what we said we would do in opposition regarding capital gains tax, that is limit it to short term gains.  The farming community expressed concern about wealth tax and capital gains tax.  The transfer of a farm, with the inflationary price land is fetching, from a farmer to his son would attract capital gains tax.  Even though no such gain would be realised there would be a notional gain computed from 6 April 1974 to date of transfer.  In that period the price of land has gone from £1,000 an acre to £3,000.  The Act brought people into the capital gains tax net who I am sure it was never intended to bring in. Farmers who wished to transfer their farms to their sons were very concerned about this.</P>
    <P>We never opposed capital acquisitions tax in principle when we were in opposition but we said the thresholds were too low.  We have set about revising them.  We opposed the three capital taxations when in Opposition because we believed they were wrong. We have done something about them now that we are in Government.  Many people, particularly farmers, were worried about capital taxation.  We have shown them our good faith in this regard.</P>
    <P>My constituency of Kildare is a farming one.  The Government have set about bringing in an equitable taxation for farmers.  It must be remembered that if we are to discourage the production of the farming community we will not realise the enormous potential in that industry.  In a recent report it was estimated that if a 5 per cent growth rate could be achieved we would get an extra 77,000 jobs through farming, 38,500 created directly and another 38,500 created indirectly.  If, through a taxation system, we stifle that production and do not encourage farmers to work a little bit harder and do a little bit extra we are putting the cart before the horse and we will not be able to create that number of jobs.</P>
    <P>We must give incentives to work in all spheres, particularly in farming. Farmers have a greater control over their output than other sections in the <Col N="1018" /> community.  The industrial worker has to do X amount in his job but the farmer has more flexibility.  It must also be recognised that there is a special hardship attached to farming.  The taxation system must give recognition to this.  There is also uncertainty in farming. Crops may fail, markets may go down.  In the past eight years we have seen swings of one way or another, farmers have done well this year and badly other years, certain crops have done well and in others the market has fallen asunder.</P>
    <P>We are competing against agricultural economies which have had a decade of uninterrupted progress.  It is only if we impose a system of taxation which will discourage farmers from doing a little bit extra that we will not be able to compete with those countries.  Dublin people should realise that there is nothing very special about the farmer having to get up in the middle of the night, having to go out to his cowshed to see his cow calving and perhaps work up to 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock each night in bad weather and all the other disadvantages that come with farming.  I believe the industrial worker recognises that farming has a special position and that farmers have to have some concessions when it comes to taxation when we take into account their role in society.</P>
    <P>Those are my general principles regarding the background to farmer taxation. I believe the proposals in the budget go a long way towards meeting those objectives.  The multiplier has been increased to 90 and the threshold has been lowered to £60.  I believe farmers recognise they are getting a good deal.  Clients of mine have indicated that they know they are getting a good deal.  We can easily see, in global figures without going into specific instances, that last year we expected to get £35 million from 15,500 farmers. An additional 7,000 farmers have been brought into the tax net, making 22,500 and all the Government expect to get is £24 million, which means a reduction from an average of £2,200 per farmer to about £1,100 per farmer. The tax net has been spread more evently.  I believe that farmers are now getting used to paying tax and are <Col N="1019" /> willing to contribute their share of the national income.</P>
    <P>The Government have allowed, as they promised in their manifesto, rates as a payment of tax.  This will mean a big saving for most farmers.  There is a certain anomaly in the case of farmers whose rates will be greater than their proposed tax bill.  We have not seen the Finance Bill yet but perhaps the Minister could consider some easing in this regard or some sum of money which the farmer would not have to give back.  If it could revert back to the previous year it would be a help.  If, for example, a farmer's rates came to £600 and his tax bill came to only £200 he would not pay any income tax in that year.  Unless a special provision is brought into the Finance Bill that £400 credit will go to waste. I hope the Minister in the Finance Bill will bring in a section that will give farmers credit in situations like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy the present storage capacity for oil within the country; and how long this country could last on the utilisation of such storage in the event of an oil embargo on this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. R. Burke) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. R. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The storage capacity maintained by oil companies and large oil consumers within the country amounts to 1.4 million metric tonnes. In addition, the Gulf Oil transhipment terminal at Bantry Bay has a storage capacity of 1 million metric tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not of course feasible to keep storage tanks filled to capacity at all times and the stock held here at any one time is estimated to be in the <Col N="1020" /> region of 93 days supply, when operational capacity for the companies operating in the Irish oil market and unfilled capacity in the Bantry Bay terminal are taken into account.  In addition some stocks are held on our account in other EEC countries.</P>
    <P>The length the country's reserve stocks would last in the event of an oil embargo on this country would depend to a large extent on the nature and extent of such embargo.  It would also depend on the extent of demand restraint or rationing imposed by us. The Deputy is no doubt aware that this country, as a member of the International Energy Agency, would participate in an oil sharing system which would be activated when supplies to any one country or to all countries in the agency fell by 7 per cent.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he will instruct the ESB to exercise an important social role by not charging voluntary community groups in already deprived urban areas a connection fee for electricity installation in their community office or centre; and if he considers that the great social good thus achieved would far outweigh the negligible loss of funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB are precluded by the statute under which they were established from giving preferential treatment to any customer or class of consumer and no special arrangement can therefore be made for community groups.</P>

      <P>The Minister's answer is not in accordance with fact.  Are there not exceptions in respect of elderly people, and in regard to rural electrification?  Would the Minister not agree that the amount of good that could be done warrants the giving to the ESB of a small subsidy in order to enable them to do this?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister have a look at a letter which the chairman of the ESB has sent to Dublin Corporation indicating that the door would not be closed if the Government were willing to take an interest in it?  Would the Minister use his good offices, particularly with regard to inner city areas?  The amount of money involved would be very small but it would help the local communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Rurke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I said was that the normal mechanisms relating to applications for planning permission will of course apply.  The Deputy will be aware that there is an outline planning application before Wexford County Council in respect of Carnsore Point.  On a decision being made by the council, say in favour of the application, it is to be assumed there will be a number of third party appeals.  If the decision is against the ESB, it can be assumed the ESB will appeal.  The door will then be open for an oral public hearing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not saying that the only dimension to this is that of planning application. Does he not realise that the main question is whether the State will commit itself to building this thing, if and when it gets planning permission? What I want to know from the Minister is whether he was saying, when he told the House that there are no plans for a public inquiry, that there will not be any such public inquiry before a final decision has been made? We need not discuss the planning application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to extract a straight answer.  Let us leave the planning application out of it.  Does the Minister's reply amount to this, that before the Government take a decision on spending £¼ billion on building a nuclear station there will not be any public inquiry or further debate on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be inappropriate for us to initiate any public inquiry while the mechanism of the Planning Act is going through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Why would it be inappropriate? The two are not related.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They are clearly related in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question did not refer to Carnsore Point.  It asked if the Minister would undertake a public inquiry into all aspects of the nuclear power station.  There are two matters at issue.  One is the suitability of any chosen site and the other is the nature of the energy to be provided, and <Col N="1028" /> there is no mechanism other than a public inquiry under which the energy pros and cons can be debated.  We are simply trying to find out whether the Government, irrespective of the site that ultimately may be chosen, will have a public inquiry into the pros and cons of the creation of a particular type of energy prior to committing the country to expenditure of £¼ billion. That is the simple question to which we are expecting a simple reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have had a reply: that the situation in regard to an inquiry relates to Carnsore Point and that the application before Wexford County Council is in relation to that site.  When the council decide on the application, presumably there will be an oral hearing at which the matter will be fully debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the question and there is no reference to Carnsore Point or to Wexford.  It states specifically:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he will undertake a public inquiry into all aspects of the proposed nuclear power station prior to his taking the final decision on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only proposal the ESB have at the moment. It is tied up under the Planning Act mechanism and it would be clearly inappropriate for the Government to interfere before the decision has been announced by Wexford County Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he will state, in the context of the Government's consideration of a decision relating to a nuclear-powered plant for this country, the arrangements that have been considered with regard to the disposal of radioactive wastes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of Government approval for the inclusion of a nuclear power station in the ESB generation plant programme, the ESB will be under an obligation to satisfy the requirements of the Nuclear Energy Board regarding the safe disposal of radioactive waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it likely we will have a decision in the immediate future?  Has consideration been given to the fundamentally important question from the health point of view of the disposal of radioactive waste, and would the Minister say the kind of consideration that has been given to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A Government decision on this is imminent.  Various inquiries have been made and a decision will be given in the near future. Obviously the question of radioactive waste has arisen and some thought has been given to it.  The NEB might require that the fuel contractor would take back the spent fuel from the reactor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If the decision is imminent, obviously consideration has been given to the disposal of waste. But do I interpret correctly the Miniser as saying that it is possible the Government might pass off the responsibility for insuring public safety in some way to the contractor?  Does the Minister agree that in the Irish <Col N="1030" /> Sea there is at present only Windscale, that that might be the area at which the Government might want to dispose of the waste, and would he accept that as satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the suggestion about Windscale.  Under an order made by the then Minister for Transport and Power, under the provisions of section 6 of the Nuclear Energy Act, 1971, which order came into effect in July 1977 the custody, use, disposal and so forth of fuel or such other radioactive substance or devices, including radioactive waste products, are prohibited save under licence issued by the Nuclear Energy Board as an agent for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not answer my question.  I only asked for information in regard to the disposal of waste.  Is it not fair to assume that the Minister has a fairly solid idea of where the waste would be dumped?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave one example of the sort of thinking going on.  Any other decisions will be by the NEB and we can assume they will look after the interests of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to the statement made by the Minister for Labour in the course of the adjournment debate on this matter on 2 February.  A feature of this matter is that it is a commercial dispute between two independent entities who had entered into a contract with each other.  This dispute has been referred to arbitration because the parties concerned did not find it possible to resolve it otherwise. I have made it clear that if the parties feel that some other solution is possible, I would be prepared to do what I can to help them to reach agreement.  However, I am not in a position to impose a settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the employment aspect is concerned I am informed that CIE are prepared, if the Van Hool McArdle enterprise closes permanently, to offer employment not only to the workers whom they have an obligation to take back but also to as many of the remaining workers as offer their <Col N="1042" /> services to the company and are found to be suitable.  I understand that CIE are negotiating with other interests for the establishment of a bus-building enterprise in Dublin and the question of renationalisation may not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

There are various questions that have to be answered and possible changes in legislation.  None of these matters has been decided yet.  The committee have not yet reported to me and I expect the first report some time next week.

I have set up a departmental committee comprising military personnel and civil servants from the Department of Defence to make recommendations as to what changes will be necessary and how best we can implement this commitment. The decisions of the Government will be based on the recommendations arising from the report of the committee.  I expect to have this report next week and I would ask Deputies to bear with me until I have the report and have examined it and have made some announcements as to the direction in which I am going.  Then I will be very happy to answer questions and at that point I will be asking the support of all Deputies in encouraging the good women of Ireland to join our forces.  This will not arise until possibly, the autumn.  If my plan of campaign goes as I hope it will, I expect in the autumn to be able to recruit women into the Army.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the present position of the various members of the Garda Technical Bureau who were involved in the so-called &ldquo;Fingerprints Affair&rdquo;; and if he will make a statement on the case generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to make any more than an interim statement at this stage.  However, as <Col N="1052" /> the statement is a fairly lengthy one I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to circulate a copy of it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The following is the statement:</P>
      <P>Towards the end of 1976 and in early 1977 there had been allegations of mistakes in fingerprint identification in certain cases.  A full investigation of those allegations and of other related matters was conducted by a senior Garda officer and he submitted his report to his own authorities towards the end of May.  It is relevant to bear in mind that the report dealt with what was a complex situation and involved a review of highly technical material.  It was, therefore, a detailed document which, including appendices, ran to some hundreds of pages.</P>
      <P>The arrangement made by my predecessor which was in accordance with normal practice in relation to any investigation in the Garda Síochána in which the Minister for Justice would have an interest, was that the report, when completed, would be considered in the first instance by the Commissioner and then submitted to him, the Minister, with the Commissioner's observations.  It was in fact so submitted, with observations, on 18 July, that is, roughly a fortnight after the change of Government.  Owing to the size and complexity of the report, an advance copy, without of course any comments, had been given informally some time earlier to my Department so that a study of it could commence in the Department as early as possible in order to minimise the time that would be required afterwards for analysis in the Department and consideration by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the beginning of August, allegations of an entirely new character, namely, that criminal offences had been committed by a member or members of the Technical Bureau, were made to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Once that happened and until that matter is disposed of, other aspects have had to be left for later consideration.  I mention this for several reasons but mainly to refute suggestions that I as Minister had the report before me and was <Col N="1053" /> doing nothing about it.  There is of course one exception to the statement that, once the allegations of criminal actions had been made, other aspects have had to be left over.  That does not apply to the taking of measures designed to strengthen safeguards against any possibility of a mistake in identification being made in any current or future case.  I am assured that such measures have in fact been taken.</P>
    <P>Returning to the matter of the allegations, I understand that the Director of Public Prosecutions, having made certain necessary preliminary enquiries which took some months to complete, then referred all the papers to the Garda authorities for investigation of the allegations that had been made to him.  I am informed that the necessary report is being prepared as quickly as possible.  Until it is submitted and the Director gives his decision on the allegations that criminal offences were committed, any further action or comment must be deferred.  Furthermore, because the issues are, as I have already indicated, complex ones, it is to be expected that it will take some time to reach decisions on other aspects of the matter even when the allegations of crime have been disposed of one way or the other.</P>
    <P>However, without commenting in any way on the issues involved, which of course I am not at present free to do, I would like, on a question of fact, to take this opportunity to place on record that there is no basis for suggestions that have been published to the effect that the Director of Public Prosecutions had found that the earlier Garda investigation was not properly or adequately carried out and that he therefore had to order a new and fuller investigation.  I have the consent of the Director to say that he has not seen the earlier report at all and that he has at all material times made it clear to the Garda authorities that he would not consider it either useful or appropriate that it should be submitted to him before he has considered the investigation file relating to the allegations of criminal actions.</P>
    <P>As regards the present position of <Col N="1054" /> various members of the Bureau, which is raised in the Deputy's question, this is, I am afraid, one of the matters about which different views have been expressed in the sense that there have been differences of view as to whether particular assignments did or did not involve a transfer from one section to another or an assignment to work that needed a lesser degree of skill. Even if it were proper for me to make a public statement about purely internal organisational matters of this kind, I could not do so at present as the position is, so to speak, &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; until the question of allegations of criminal action has been disposed of. I can say, however, that nobody has been either downgraded or transferred out of the Bureau so in that sense the position of all concerned remains as it has been.</P>

    <Title>Financial Statement, 1978: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P> That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Financial Statement made by the Minister for Finance on 1 February 1978.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(The Taoiseach.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this debate adjourned for Question Time I was speaking about farm taxation proposals. I said that rates credit which is now to be allowed as an instalment of tax was a considerable concession to farmers, but I ask the Minister to incorporate in his Finance Bill a provision whereby farmers whose rates will be greater than their tax burden will be allowed the additional rates to be carried forward against the following year's tax.  For example if a farmer's rates bill is £600 and his calculated tax is £200 he would pay no tax in that year; he would have only to pay rates on £600.  But there would be £400 there and I ask the Minister to <Col N="1065" /> incorporate a provision in the Finance Bill which would allow this to be carried forward to the following year.</P>
      <P>We have also restored under the notional system, if a farmer opts for it, contractor's charges and also wages. The Minister said in his statement that he is going to agree with farming organisations on a system of averaging profits because of the cyclical nature of farming.  He has also said that he will allow one payment day for payment of tax by farmers.</P>
      <P>Some anomalies in the farmer taxation code would more properly be dealt with on the Committee Stage of a Finance Bill, but I would like to underline one of them.  It is the matters that arise out of the difference between a farmer who carries on another trade or profession and people whose income is from sources other than farming. Under present legislation, which has existed since the enactment of the Finance Act, 1974, it is possible that a farmer who has income other than from his farm does not pay tax on the profits of his farm.  But the allowances which he has to offset against his other income are reduced in one of three ways, and the Revenue Commissioners would give the best option available to him.  Therefore anyone owning land of valuation greater than £20 and with other income may have his tax allowances to be set against his other income reduced by halving his allowances. His allowances may be reduced by 80 times the difference between £20 and his rateable valuation and subtracting that figure from his taxfree allowances, or his allowances may be reduced by the amount of his farm profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This gives rise to an anomaly for people who might have a small amount of land, say £10 valuation, and a small business like a little shop, for instance. Such people would pay tax on the profits of the farm and on the profits of their business.  A person with £10 valuation and a small shop will pay a lot more in tax than a person with £59 valuation who is also, say, a Minister of State or in some employment. I ask the Minister to incorporate in the Bill a provision whereby people who have another trade or profession <Col N="1066" /> and who have land of under £20 valuation will be put in the same position as people who have other income and greater than £20 valuation.  If I speak on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill I intend to raise this matter again.</P>
    <P>Certain newspapers seem to try to create the impression that there should be division between the farming community and the working community, and this does no service to the long-term interests of the State.  I know from meeting farmers and members of the IFA that they are quite perturbed that there seems to be a campaign carried on by certain newspapers to imply that there should be friction between the farming population and people on PAYE.  If we wish to create the jobs which we all hope to get for our young people we must all pull together.  The farmers are willing to pay their fair share of tax, and this budget goes a long way towards satisfying their demands and future budgets might increase the multiplier or lower the threshold.  However, once farmers have come into the tax net&mdash; and I know some farmers who have been in it since 1974&mdash;they have found that the system is not too bad, they have got used to it, and they are willing to pay their fair share of taxation.</P>
    <P>We have removed tax from agricultural co-operatives but we are not going to exempt sales into intervention. Representations were made to me by meat factories that sales into intervention should qualify for export sales relief.  While there is some justification for their argument that if people selling to Bord Bainne are regarded as exporters then people selling into intervention should also be recognised in this way.  I am not convinced that this would be in the long-term interest of the factories and of the meat-processing industry.  The working of the intervention system has made some factories very lazy.  If we all come to Leinster House day in and day out and sit down in the bar and do nothing for our constituents and contribute nothing to the House we know we will get our come-uppance at the next election.  A factory which has not to compete in <Col N="1067" /> the open market or strive to get new markets and can sell all its products into intervention will have no interest in expanding the industry.  Meat factories should be looking at processing because in this field a great number of jobs could be created.  If we help to make factories lazy by giving them a system of selling into intervention which causes them no difficulty, we are not doing them a service.</P>
    <P>While I agree that some factories which sold into intervention in 1974 should be allowed tax reliefs on those sales, I agree that the Minister should not exempt those sales entirely from taxation.  He probably looks at it from another angle.  My angle is that, for the long term benefit of the agricultural industry, it is better to have factories striving on the open market to get new markets and to go into processing, and not have the fall back position of being able to sell into intervention. It would be far more attractive if intervention were not tax free. It provides an incentive for them to do a little better.</P>
    <P>The farm modernisation scheme has been referred to.  There is something drastically wrong with the scheme as only a small percentage of farmers can qualify for development status.  I would ask the Minister for Agriculture to try to have changes made in the directive at EEC level.</P>
    <P>I referred to the urban-rural rift.  If more farmers are incorporated into the tax scheme, and it can be seen that they are contributing their fair share of the national income, and contributing to revenue, the urban and rural dweller will be able to say: &ldquo;We are all producing our accounts: we are paying what we should be paying&rdquo;: the threshold might be dropped a little further and all farmers might pay on the accounts system.  The urban dwellers would then be able to see that farmers submit accounts and know what money they are making.  There is a great deal of make believe about the vast profits in agriculture.  Many people do not know what goes on beyond Newlands Cross.  A lot of hard work goes on. When all farmers with valuations of <Col N="1068" /> over £50 or £60 are sending in accounts and what they are actually making can be proved, many myths will be dispelled.</P>
    <P>We all know some farmers are doing very well.  We also know some industrialists are doing very well.  In our society there are very wealthy people, but there are very poor people also. The same is true of agriculture.  People in Dublin may get the impression that the odd farmer they see driving a Mercedes is an indication of how well off the farming population are. Nothing is further from the truth.  In that regard I see a system of farmer taxation as a good thing.  The sooner more farmers are on the accounts method the better.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister did not raise thresholds on interest allowable from £2,000 to a much higher figure.  The allowability level of £2,000 was introduced in the budget of 1973 when there was no capital gains tax in operation.  The idea behind that level at that time was to prevent a very lucrative evasion method under which people could avoid paying a lot of income tax on their current income and make a capital gain.  This was well known in the accountancy profession and the Minister was justified in introducing that threshold at that time. Since then a capital gains tax has been brought into existence and the threshold still remains at £2,000.  The Minister could have gone a step further than he did in the budget and raised that level to a more realistic figure, say £4,000 at least.  He raised the limit for interest on borrowed money to purchase shares in a private trading company. He should have gone further and allowed it for all income tax payers. When the Finance Bill is introduced he might consider that.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see the turnover tax threshold increased by 50 per cent for small businesses.  A small shop-keeper has to spend at least three nights a week writing up invoices for the Value Added Tax return at the end of two months.  The turnover limit at the moment is only £2,000 for a grocer, a butcher, or a publican.  In a grocery business there is an interminable number of invoices because it involves so <Col N="1069" /> many small items.  The amount of VAT collected at the end of two months on a turnover of £20,000 in a grocer's shop could be as low as £20 because of the 0 per cent on grocery items.  A lot of effort and time goes into this on the part of the businessman, and also by the Revenue Commissioners in checking and making assessments.  That has been increased to £18,000 for most retail businesses and in other service industries it will go up to about £450 for two months.  I should like to see these figures increased even further. I can speak from vast experience in this field, and I know the amount of money collected is very small, and the cost of book-keeping and record keeping far outweights the amount of money collected.  I am glad the Minister has given this increase and that there will be a simpler method of calculating Value Added Tax at the end of a two month period.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also tried to alleviate the iniquitous benefit in kind legislation which was in operation for the past two years.  Before the former Minister, Deputy Ryan, introduced a new system of assessing benefits in kind, you had to prove to the inspector of taxes the amount of benefit in kind you got from the use of a company car.  In a budget introduced by the former Government it was provided that it would be 15 per cent of the value of the car or a minimum of £300.  For many company representatives this was a gross hardship because on that system of calculation the benefit in kind on which they were taxed was far greater than the benefit in kind they actually enjoyed.  I am glad the Minister has reduced that.</P>
    <P>I would ask him to do something about travelling allowances for people at work.  There is a big anomaly in the income tax legislation in this field. A person who has a business of his own is allowed travelling expenses if they are proven to be wholly and exclusively for the purpose of that trade. For a person in employment the relevant rule is that it must be wholly and exclusively and necessarily in the conduct of the business.  There have been various tax cases on this and the <Col N="1070" /> definitive one is one in which a teacher was involved who had a horse and cart.  It was proved that, although he could not get to work unless he provided the horse and cart, he did not need a horse and cart in the performance of his duties.  That is a 1925 tax case.  It is the definitive case and that is why people in employment are not given travelling allowances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just about to refer to that.  In the last couple of years the price of petrol has gone up enormously.  People in towns in Kildare, my own constituency, who commute to and from Dublin each day are spending £15 to £20 per week on travel and they are not allowed it as a tax expense.  I would ask the Minister to update the legislation and put the criteria for getting travelling allowances for travel for the performance of duty on the same level as those applied to people using a car wholly and exclusively for the purposes of their business.  Perhaps something could be provided in the next Finance Bill to go some way towards alleviating that hardship.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by referring to certain aspects which I see as dangers in the budget.  As I said before, there are increased tax allowances, and so on, and the eventual outcome will be that there will be more disposable income in the hands of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The propensity to import is quite high.  If there is more money in the hands of individuals a greater amount of money is likely to be spent on imports.  This would create a balance of payments problem and would also mean loss of jobs because if more foreign goods are bought factories here will close.  I would appeal to the Irish people to be more careful in future when they are spending their money. There is a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  We have had &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaigns before. The danger of increased imports will have to be got across to the people more forcibly if it is not to become a reality and result in loss of jobs. I would appeal for greater effort in the <Col N="1071" />&ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign in the hope that it will reduce the propensity to import.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Another danger is that we are giving greater incentives to industry by reducing taxes <i>et cetera</i>, which will mean increased profits.  The idea in making these concessions is the creation of jobs.  If profits are retained by industrialists for other purposes or used by entreprenuers for their own purposes and not in the creation of jobs, the purpose of the budget will be frustrated.  As I have said before, we have given the private sector a chance this time to do what they can and I believe that is the correct approach and one which I have advocated for a long number of years, but I am sufficiently realistic to realise that if the private sector does not respond, another day and another budget will come when we will have to adopt a different line of thinking.  I would say to the private sector: &ldquo;This is your opportunity.  If you do not avail of it, it may be your last chance and it might be the end of private enterprise to a great extent.&rdquo;  We have gambled on the private sector.  That is the reason I said the budget was a courageous one.  We could have introduced a quite different budget and then have the next one a bit easier and then an election would take place but this would not create jobs.  We have taken a chance in one direction. We have banked on the private sector. I agree with the people who have said that.  I believe it is right and I have advocated that for a long number of years.  If the private sector does not take up the challenge and respond, we will have to look at alternative methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Government on having the courage to <Col N="1072" /> bring in such a budget, and it is in the interests of all parties in this House and of every Deputy that it should work.  If it does not work and we are not able to create jobs within the next ten years, on another occasion the people of Ireland will not care about Deputy McCreevy or anybody else because they will say we have failed. It is up to this generation of Irish people to try to create jobs for a better future.  If we do not, we will all be the losers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Quinn's courtesy in appreciating the problems of a rural Deputy.  As a rural Deputy I am rather amazed at the justifications and the excuses being offered by Government speakers in relation to the extension of farmers' tax.  I well remember the furore they created both in the House and outside, in the past, in relation to farmers' tax.  I well remember the promises that were made to the farmers on the question of relief from tax.  What have we in the budget?  We have a budget which singles out the farming community as being the sole sector to pay extra money to the Exchequer.  It reminds me of an old sign on a pub at Sam's Cross, where Michael Collins was born, which had on it, &ldquo;The Government rules for all.  The priest prays for all. The soldier fights for all.  The farmer pays for all.&rdquo;  To a certain extent this budget fits the sentiment expressed in that sign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing in this budget or in the steps taken prior to its introduction can hide the fact that the promises made to the farmers have not been kept.  Last June, before the election, Fianna Fáil went to the country believing that agriculture can and should provide the main thrust for the recovery of the national economy and set down in detail how this was going to be achieved.  In no way was it suggested that this was going to be <Col N="1073" /> achieved by taking extra money from the farmer's pocket.  In no way was this going to be achieved by the removal of the cheese subsidy, a budgetary measure, in fact, slipped in before the budget, contrary, in fact, to a specific promise to have the said subsidy increased&mdash;another broken promise, one of many.  In no way was that going to be achieved by the removal of the fertiliser subsidy or by the removal in large part of the agricultural grant.</P>
    <P>Again, in the budget we had the increase in the multiplier, the reduction in the valuation threshold, and all these measures, both before the budget and in the budget itself, singled out this sector of the community to whom so much has been promised and who ended up losing and paying so much. The rights and wrongs of farmer taxation I do not intend to go into at this stage, but it does seem to me that what is wrong is that so many promises should have been made and so many promises were not kept.</P>
    <P>I have to point out in this context, as I pointed out in other contexts in this House, that it is our job to highlight the breaking of promises but, over and above bringing the Government to the bar of the court to answer to the people, as it were, in regard to the broken promises, I am concerned at the growing list of such broken promises.  If this continues, the attitude of the entire electorate to the whole political process will become totally cynical.  I would urge the Government at this stage, in all the aspects of its manifesto, to ensure as far as possible that these promises are kept.  I say this genuinely, in the interests of democracy and, above all, taking into account the complete list of broken promises to date and the others that seem to be in the offing.  I would ask the Government not to subject the electorate to such codding and humbugging in future because, in time, if this is permitted to continue, the electorate can only react, by adopting a totally cynical attitude to the political process.</P>
    <P>I was dealing with the question of farming before I sidetracked myself. Here, again, I have to highlight another aspect which is possibly of even greater importance to the farming <Col N="1074" /> community.  I refer to the attitude of the Government, of the Minister for Agriculture and others on the Government side in relation to the farm price review.  We have the taking away of moneys from the farmers through increased taxation, but what is even more important is that there seems to be an effort by the Government to condition the farmers into expecting no increase or only a nominal increase in the farm price review.  The Chair may ask how can this be relevant to the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should await the Estimate.  It does not arise on the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not dwell on it except to say that it is important to the farmers.  If they have not an extra income how can they pay extra taxes? I am very concerned about this matter. I find it difficult to fathom the mind of the Government on the budget.  Why expect the farmers to pay more while at the same time conditioning them to accept less?</P>
      <P>The other major aspect is in relation to the attitude of the Government in the social welfare area.  The record of the National Coalition in this matter and their concern for the weaker sections speaks for itself.  During the term of office of the National Coalition we had social welfare payments for new categories, there were innovations in relation to certain sectors of the under-privileged and there were increases in the annual budgets that were far in excess of the cost of living.  Let us contrast that with the concern, if I might call it that, of the Government.</P>
      <P>Last June they displayed considerable concern and here I go back again to the list of broken promises.  In the Fianna Fáil manifesto there were lists of items to indicate their concern under the heading of &ldquo;Social Security&rdquo;. What does their record, as evidenced in the budget, prove?  It proves that Fianna Fáil can rightly call themselves the party of the rich, the party of the wealthy.  Probably it is too much to expect a too developed social conscience in such a party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the budget there were no innovations of any kind.  In fact, a specific <Col N="1075" /> commitment was broken without an apology.  One of the promises made by Fianna Fáil was to maintain social welfare benefits at least in line with the cost of living but this was not done in relation to the general body of social welfare recipients, in contrast to the actions of the National Coalition Government who ensured that the benefits exceeded any increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>One of the worst aspects was to neglect to increase children's allowances. Many of the members of the Government are family men and, although they do not show any obvious signs of being under-privileged or distressed, surely they most appreciate the importance of children's allowances in the family budget among the poorer sections.  I am not trying to score political points.  I am trying to tickle the collective conscience of Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Tickle away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We can only try.  In the poorer households children's allowances have an importance far beyond what Fianna Fáil obviously thought.  There are many households where the sole income available for the mother and children nearly boils down to the children's allowances. There are many reasons for this. Fianna Fáil may ask the man of the house why he is spending all the money on drink, dogs and so on.  I am all in favour of that and I will support Fianna Fáil if they want to do something about it, but what can one say to the woman and six children in the house?  The Government must go beyond the simple answer of stressing to the man of the house the need to provide for his wife and family.  It is the genuine basic responsibility of the man of the house, or of the woman, although I appreciate that when there are six children in a household it can lead to problems from the point of view of the woman working.  Fianna Fáil will have to accept the practical situation that this is not how it works out in many cases.  If they accept that&mdash;and they would be blind not to accept it &mdash;there is a duty and a responsibility <Col N="1076" /> on the State to ensure that in such situations the weaker sections, the women and children, do not suffer.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that Fianna Fáil do not realise this, or if they do realise it they are not concerned.  In those circumstances I must be highly critical of the fact that no increase was given in the children's allowances.  Even at this stage I suggest to the Minister that he rethinks the matter.  Let him travel through many parts of Ireland, and particularly the poorer sections of Dublin, and see the result of his action.  It is very easy to say that we are giving children's allowances, that we are just not increasing them.  However, the Minister&mdash;and even more important the people concerned&mdash; know that the purchasing power of the allowances is not as good now and in real terms there is a reduction in the income of many households that can least afford it.</P>
      <P>One could contrast that situation with the 5,000 wealthy houses in which the Minister considered there was want and need, averaging out at about £2,000 per household per annum.  I do not intend to go into the merits or demerits of this tax at this stage.  The contrast is obvious.</P>
      <P>In general, I can only describe the social provisions as a disgrace to any Christian nation.  They indicate a totatally uncaring attitude.  There is, in fact, no social conscience in Fianna Fáil and, as an Opposition Member, I can only try to prick whatever conscience may exist in Fianna Fáil in the direction of some semblance of care for the weaker sections of our community.</P>
      <P>With regard to the wage agreement, the wage agreement is not, of course, part of the budget but it is to a certain extent, to quite a large extent really, related to the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it both ways. Certain criticisms were made of my Leader when he commented on the effect the deficiencies in the budget would have on the wage negotiations. This is a delicate area and I do not intend to go into detail except to say <Col N="1077" /> that such criticisms on the part of Fianna Fáil show an acceptance by Fianna Fáil that they realise the budget is not going to help the wage agreement very much.  I and my Party sincerely hope the budget will not do irreparable harm to the wage agreement. It is in the national interest that a wage agreement should be concluded. The point I want to make in the context of the criticism of my Leader is that his commenting on the budget certainly did not do any harm to the wage negotiations and if those negotiations were harmed, then they were harmed by the provisions in the budget itself, and it is less than justice to trade union leaders to suggest that they are not capable of fully analysing the budget and its effects and could be influenced in any way by an analysis of the budget by any member of the Opposition or, indeed, of the Government for that matter.</P>
      <P>I have one specific suggestion to make about the social provisions.  It is time we considered the indexation of social welfare payments to the cost of living.  I understand the British Finance Act of 1976 provided for such indexation. This is the minimum that should be offered to those sections of our community in receipt of social welfare.</P>
      <P>It was promised that social welfare increases would be in line with the cost of living, as it was promised that aid to the Third World would be increased and ground rents abolished. All these promises have been broken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Manifesto was interpreted by many young people as holding out hope to them.  The position in the past was somewhat difficult because of the international recession. The National Coalition weathered that storm and brought the ship of State slowly but surely back on to an even keel.  It was only natural that young people should have grasped at the extravagant promises made to do better for them particularly in the line of employment.  Great damage can be done to democracy by broken promises, but the greatest damage of all is caused by broken promises to young people because they are the more idealistic section of the community and the cynical breaking of promises to them <Col N="1078" /> can correspondingly have a greater effect.  They were promised £20 million to provide jobs.  What have they got? They have got just £5 million.  That figure could have been brought up to the £20 million promised had the wealth tax been retained.  Surely it is most important in the interests of the future of this State that promises made to the young, particularly in the line of jobs, should be kept.  Here, again, we have an indication of Fianna Fáil's concern for the rich and the wealthy in contrast to their lack of concern for the provision of jobs for the young people in our community.</P>
    <P>On the economic front, as a non-economist, I must voice my concern at the level of borrowing envisaged in this budget.  Everyone knows that sensible business or, indeed, sensible housekeeping calls for a balanced budget except in exceptional circumstances. What is the position on the national scene?  Many were greatful that there was no increase in tax on either tobacco or the pint.  How was this achieved?  It was achieved by providing for a level of borrowing unprecedented in the history of the State.  At a time when the international recession was over and when the National Coalition Government had brought the ship of State back on to an even keel, we find a borrowing requirement of £821 million.  This figure will probably be exceeded because it is based on a national wage agreement of 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, any increase on that figure will require a further £8 million borrowing for every further 1 per cent increase.  It is significant that on the day following the budget the Minister for Finance indicated that the limit of 5 per cent would not have to be adhered to.  In fact, this figure has already been breached with the consent and approval of the Government. I mention this in the context of the amount of borrowing that will be required, and it will considerably exceed £821 million.</P>
    <P>It has been accepted at all times that borrowing for capital purposes is sensible but of that enormous sum more than half is related to paying the ordinary day-to-day bills of this State for the year 1978&mdash;current borrowing. It is difficult to see how this <Col N="1079" /> can be justified.  There are many people who are wondering how in the name of goodness this money is ever going to be repaid.  Somebody with whom I was discussing the budget quoted to me the example of Mr. Micawber. The example was that for somebody with an income of a shilling, an expenditure of a shilling and a halfpenny would result in misery for that person, whereas an income of a shilling, and an expenditure of 11½ would result in happiness for that person.  Fianna Fáil have attempted to diffuse a false aura of happiness around the country, in particular, happiness with their own party&mdash;on borrowed money which will have to be repaid over many years to come.</P>
    <P>In general terms I have to criticise this budget on its general economic strategy, particularly in the areas I have referred to.  When a budget is being considered each year one normally looks for a label for it.  One can look among the choices of the irresponsible dishonesty and broken promises of Fianna Fáil.  We can look to the problems of the farmers, particularly in the area of broken promises. We can look to the lack of concern for social welfare recipients and the general anti-social aspect in the outlook of Fianna Fáil, as is clear from this budget.  There are many labels one can put on it but the figure of borrowing is so huge that one can only end up by putting a label on it as the &ldquo;Never-Never&rdquo; budget.  No private individual or company ever succeeded by borrowing too much money on the &ldquo;never-never&rdquo;.  This Government cannot succeed in running the economy of this State on the &ldquo;never-never&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my pleasure to speak in support of this magnificent budget. As has been said many times during the last few days, this budget is based on the manifesto produced by our party prior to the election.  That manifesto was cohesive in its scope.  It was meticulously planned and it took cognisance and note of both the needs and the abilities of our people.  This was in total contrast to the clutching at straws and the various shibboleths that were <Col N="1080" /> thrown around at election time by the Coalition: references to Dutch auctions, references to various things that they thought they might do but proved themselves incapable of doing over the last four years.  They were looking for another chance to do what they had not done.  The difference in the approach was reflected in the spontaneous reaction of the electorate to the manifesto.</P>
      <P>As I said, this budget was based on the manifesto and the foundations which it laid will be built on and expanded for the benefit of everybody. The support we got was obviously in anticipation of the manifesto being implemented, and that has been the case to a large extent.  It was imaginative, courageous and pragmatic.  It has given an opportunity to all the people to express themselves and to enable them to do what they want.  In other words, at different levels of society it is giving virtually everyone a chance to express himself, to live the type of life that he wants to live.  In a nutshell, this budget is keeping faith with the people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is a massive amount of money involved in this budget for a small country with a population of less than four million.  We are talking in terms of £2,300 million, a sophisticated and deeply thought out plan for the benefit of everybody.  To administer such a plan needs sophisticated machinery to make sure that the ideas embodied in it get to the grassroots where they are wanted.  We in Fianna Fáil are very conscious that the men who actually do the thinking have a great responsibility to those of us in the back benches.  As a new backbencher, I am very happy to be able to operate in a milieu where I have access to Ministers, where problems are handled sympathetically and quickly.  The budget proposals are a great help to people like me who have to make sure that the real needs of the people are known and acted on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The machinery which this vast amount of money will have to be processed through is obviously the banking system.  Our banking system is one of the more sophisticated <Col N="1081" /> machines which have expanded under various Fianna Fáil administrations into a wide-ranging and sophisticated system of handling money both here and abroad.  In recent years this banking conglomerate has made substantial profits.  These profits were largely made on the efforts, abilities and the hard work of the common people, profits which have to a large extent been channelled back for the benefit of the business community and the workers.  Many of these banks have commercial subsidiaries carrying on the business of hire purchase and business of a more commercial nature than the normal banking business. When this budget says it is giving an opportunity to our people to progress, I should like to point out that there is an onus on such institutions to behave themselves in a businesslike and responsible way towards the community at large.  To a certain extent, I would question the attitude of many branches of the various banks in channelling a large proportion of business borrowers to the more expensive type of credit rather than giving businessmen, particularly small businessmen, the objective benefit of their business expertise and saying that it might be possible to do it a little less expensively another way rather than the most profitable way for these institutions themselves.</P>
    <P>Any business in this field has a duty to ensure that the person to whom they lend money is loaned it in the most efficient and least expensive way rather than from the narrow point of view of profits only.  I suggest that this is a symptom of perhaps narrow parochialism on the part of the banks.  In this case over the last few years they have had financial constraints put on them, necessary in some cases.  Some of those were thought up by financial gurus who in many cases have not had experience of having to make money themselves.  I am referring specifically to the change over a few years ago from the running overdraft to term loans and the annual liquidation of overdrafts.  At the time I have no doubt it was very necessary.  The running overdraft or the perpetuating overdraft led to large amounts of money being on call which were not effectively used. <Col N="1082" /> There is no doubt that some form of discipline had to be imposed on the system.  Because a businessman had only two options open to him&mdash;he either had a term loan or an over-draft which had to be liquidated year by year&mdash;the smaller man was caught. He did not realise that the 30 days' requirement does not necessarily have to be consecutive.  Constraint was put on farmers in particular because they were not able to deal with the cyclical nature of their business in as flexible a manner as they were accustomed to doing on a running overdraft.</P>
    <P>Flexibility is necessary in any expansionary budget and, undoubtedly, this is an expansionary budget.  I would question however whether this type of constraint is right for the present circumstances.  The profits of the banks were just as great under the running overdraft system as they are under the term-loan system and, there-fore, it should be examined objectively again.  Term-loans are fine and they serve a constructive and useful purpose. Perhaps in certain circumstances the liquidation for a certain specific period of time of an overdraft also might serve a useful purpose but I suggest that the running overdraft, which has been totally banned, is worthy of reconsideration.</P>
    <P>It is fine to use, as has been exhorted, our own money at home and it is wonderful that there are substantial funds generated by our own people for the use of the community at large. But is this enough?  To a large extent the banks are fulfilling their function of attracting outside capital just as the IDA are working very hard to attract outside industrialists.  This is an idea which should be encouraged.  I see nothing wrong with a domestic bank attempting to find cheap foreign capital for the benefit and expansion of industry and living standards here. I wonder is it possible in this field to either encourage or create conditions whereby our banking system can attract in capital at a lower rate from abroad.  In this context I would question also one omission, as I see it, from a constructive budget: I respectfully suggest that the retention of the statutory £70 interest declaration is an inhibition against the <Col N="1083" /> possible acquisition of foreign capital. We cannot expect foreign industrialists to come here and have confidentiality until they are in production and a foreign investor of funds not to have the same type of confidentiality.  It is unrealistic to say that we want to use a foreigner's money in Ireland and that we have a sophisticated banking system which will give a foreigner full cover and security, if on the other hand we say that if such a person earns more than £70 in interest he must declare that to the inspector of taxes.  In those circumstances this provision might with benefit be abolished.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed and surprised that the Opposition criticised the retention of the concessions that were very imaginatively given to artists and authors.  That has attracted to our island many people of international repute and they have brought substantial capital to this country in the form of creative ability and their output. This has been of great benefit to the country.  One thing forgotten by those who are ignorant enough to criticise this concession is that these people live our lives and pay local taxes.  Very often they give local employment and do great work to promote the image and well-being of this country abroad.  I am happy to say that these people by and large have received a great welcome here.  They have been of immense benefit to us in many ways and are a positive encouragement for progress in many different fields.  It is not unusual to see an author or an artist giving a good image of this country abroad.  Those who criticise this aspect are wrong. I should like to comment on our semi-State bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise if I digressed slightly.  The budget specifically referred to the role of the semi-State bodies in the creation of employment. In some cases they have commercial restraints put on them.  If those commercial restraints were modified somewhat I believe semi-State bodies would, within the spirit of the budget, be better equipped to discharge their basic duty to provide employment and wealth for the people.</P>
      <P>If I may without going outside the confines of the budget debate, I should like to refer to the operation of Aer Lingus and in particular to their job creation activities in expanding their hotel chain.  They have done this very successfully and under two headings have been a great help to the Minister for Finance.  On the one hand, the profits they have generated abroad have enabled our budgetary concessions to be financed to a certain extent by the entrepreneurial ability that came to the fore in that hotel chain. In some cases this extends right across America I suggest that from a budgetary point of view and a financial point of view this type of thing is very important and should be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Shipping, in providing employment for Irish seamen, are another <Col N="1085" /> important semi-State body.  They have two contributions to make.  From an entrepreneurial point of view they have a management structure which is very successful and giving an outlet to employees at the highest level.  Those men have created a conglomerate which last year made a profit of £2 million.  I see no reason why that, if it were given its head, could not be £20 million or even £200 million.</P>

      <P>In this context the ability of those various organisations which were set up has undoubtedly built up an international feeling of goodwill and a knowledge that we have the ability to get things done on large and small scales.  The Minister for Finance must reap the benefit from those operations in many different ways.  Entrepreneurial ability is of just as much importance as the ability of a farmer, a fisherman or anybody else who is producing wealth for the country and should be given its head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first Coalition Government knocked that on the head and stopped it, particularly in relation to Aer Lingus.  An earlier budget under the late Seán Lemass created a condition where Irish airplanes were flying right <Col N="1086" /> across the west coast of America.  They had landing rights and terminal rights in New York which were stopped. Even in this budget this must have an adverse effect because that outlet of an Irish national carrier to the west coast of America has gone.</P>
    <P>We are often told that the right to work is supposed to be there for everybody. It is a slogan which is bandied about and is a target which the budget goes to great lengths to make possible. The right to work carries obligations with it.  There are social obligations attached to that.  In the budget, coupled in an imaginative way with the ideal that the right to work should be given to everybody, are our social obligations.  This is being tackled by substantial pension increases and other benefit increases, some of an innovative nature.</P>
    <P>We should mention, in this context, that while a person has a right to work there are situations, which are not referred to often enough, where occasionally a person is out of work because his social welfare benefit is only marginally greater than the income he would be capable of earning if he were working.  It is not unknown for people on the dole deliberately to increase their incomes by part-time employment or self-employment.  If they are deliberately on the dole and they indulge in this they can only be called social parasites because they are materially damaging every other citizen.  There is nothing praiseworthy in a person deliberately&mdash;I stress the word deliberately&mdash;being on the dole and at the same time doing nixers and being a parasite on the State.</P>
    <P>Those people are no different from a bank which deliberately channels a small businessman into a more expensive credit situation.  I respectfully suggest that this is within the context of the budget because if resources are wasted the budget cannot have its proper effect.  If a man is stealing from the State in taking something that he does not need to have and a bank is stealing from a client in channelling him into a more expensive credit situation they should both be condemned. This situation is in total contrast to the vast body of workers in the country <Col N="1087" /> who are the basis of the implementation of the budget.</P>
    <P>The productivity of the worker is the most important thing to the success of the budget.  His productivity in healthy circumstances&mdash;thank God most of our businesses are in a healthy state&mdash;is better than his counterpart across the water and is nearly as good as most of the more advanced economies of Europe.  The Irish worker 99 per cent of the time is undoubtedly a credit to the country and is the basis on which any Government can plan a sound and decent economic advance.</P>
    <P>There is a strong social slant in the budget.  It is reflected in the way in which the various ladders are in existence whereby people can progress along the economic path.  It is possible, within the policies of this and other Fianna Fáil budgets, for workers to train for a better job.  It is possible for them to exploit an idea within their jobs or start small businesses of their own.  It is possible for a working man to buy his own house and it is possible for him to expand an existing business.  Budgets such as this create conditions where the individual can create wealth for himself and for the country.  This is the essence of progressive planning.  It is not doctrinaire. It is human and takes into account the ability and desires of the vast majority of people on this island.  The working man buying and furnishing his house is as surely creating wealth as the entrepreneur expanding a factory, as the fisherman buying a bigger boat, as the businessman buying more machinery, as the shopkeeper expanding his shop.</P>
    <P>Let nobody say that because a man is living in a council house and buying it out that that man is not worthy of respect or that that is a poor house. I was very disappointed to hear a short time ago here that there are only 5,000 wealthy houses in this country. I discount that totally.  Any house, irrespective of its standing in wealth, is a wealthy house if that house houses a decent, loving family, able to take advantage of financial opportunities presented by a budget such as this. Then it creates wealth for itself and the country.</P>
    <P>In that context I should like to see a <Col N="1088" /> budget in the near future being able to create the conditions which existed in this country not so very long ago in regard to house purchase.  Under previous Fianna Fáil Governments and imaginative budgets it was possible for a houseowner to get a grant from his county council or Department of Local Government and use that grant as a down payment on a house, immediately starting repayments on his house.  Under the administration of the last four years this did not happen. For doctrinaire reasons there was a narrow concept of house-building which took away from a large proportion of our population the ability to choose the type of house they wanted for themselves.  To a certain extent this budget reverts to the situation in which there is again this choice open to somebody who wants to buy his own house.  In this context is it not peculiar that a £10,000 or £12,000 car can be bought for virtually no deposit and is written off over a period of five to six years whereas a house, which will last for one, two or three generations&mdash;or a Fianna Fáil-produced house which would certainly last six or seven generations&mdash;has got to have a substantial deposit paid before somebody can move in?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget objective should be to create the conditions under which a house purchaser would be able to go along and move into a house merely by starting his repayments immediately.  I would respectfully suggest that perhaps that is not possible under the present budget but is something to which we should aspire in future years in our budgetary policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context of wealth, we often hear the catch-cry that wealth must be redistributed.  To a large extent this catch-cry is nothing but an empty doctrinaire shibboleth meaning nothing. It is in stark contrast to the practical socialism of Fianna Fáil aims to create wealth for all.  Budgets such as this give an opportunity to everybody to create their own wealth and give <Col N="1089" /> people an opportunity of expressing themselves and their desires for a better life.</P>
    <P>A budget must be as wide-ranging as possible.  This one certainly affords the opportunity to a very wide section of our community to create wealth not alone for the benefit of the individual but for the community at large.  The creation of wealth for the benefit of the community at large is done in a progressive way in that, when factories expand under budgetary prompting, when a better fishing boat is bought, again under budgetary prompting, a situation is created in which more tax is paid, in which people earn more money and more money is turned over within the State.  It is in this way that we must progress rather than through the silly notion that if the man with the big house were thrown out of it, it would be taken down brick by brick and given to somebody around the corner, when he might have 13 bricks instead of 12.  That catch-cry is totally empty and totally foreign to anything of a <Col N="1090" /> practical socialist nature that we in Fianna Fáil might expound for the benefit of our people at large.</P>
    <P>In this budget we have many programmes for those sections of our people who are unable adequately to help themselves.  They cannot be helped merely by redistributing wealth.  They can be helped only if we can create more wealth for everybody.  The late John F. Kennedy aptly summarised this when he made the reference to a rising tide lifting all the boats.  This budget is undoubtedly helping this tide to rise.  It has been suggested by some speakers on the opposite side of the House that that phrase did not apply to certain sections of our community because they had no boat in which to ride the rising tide.  Anybody four years in Government making that assertion surely is condemning the total inability of that Government for the last four years.</P>

Although the book is out of date in a number of respects and is in course of updating, it will give Deputies a good general indication of the rules and regulations obtaining in the Department.</P>
      <P>As regards the amendment of staff rules and regulations, I would refer the Deputy to the written reply I gave on 1 February 1978 in which I state that I had arranged for a comprehensive review of staff rules and regulations to be undertaken by the Department and that the staff organisations had been invited to give their views on changes they would wish to have considered.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the current industrial actions are not due in any way to staff rules and regulations.</P>

      <P>Expenses payable to witnesses for the State in court proceedings fall into three categories, depending on whether the persons concerned are professional witnesses, expert witnesses, or lay witnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Professional witnesses are persons who become involved in a professional capacity prior to the hearing and who give evidence on matters of a professional nature.  Expert witnesses are witnesses who, because of their special status or qualifications, are called upon by the State to give evidence in serious cases.  Lay witnesses are persons who <Col N="1061" /> give evidence as to the facts or circumstances of a case.</P>
    <P>A scale of expenses payable to professional witnesses has been established and it is altered from time to time in the light of representations.  The expenses of an expert witness are determined by negotiation with the person concerned.</P>
    <P>In the case of lay witnesses a scale of expenses has been established on the principle that they should be sufficient to save the poorer witness from loss.  Moreover any salary or wage earner may, on production of an appropriate certificate from his employer, be recouped any permanent loss of salary or wages that he may have incurred by attending court as a witness. I am at present reviewing the scale of expenses payable to lay witnesses.</P>

    <P>NOTES: (1)  The figures given above relate to numbers employed, permanent and temporary as distinct from actual established posts.  The estimate of numbers expected to be employed on 1 January 1979, are of necessity very tentative, as these can be affected by various unforeseen factors, for example, unexpected vacancies and the creation of new posts, and so on.</P>
    <P>(2)  The figures in respect of the Department includes staff servicing An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>(3)  The figures in respect of the numbers employed by local authorities are based on annual returns, related to the last day of the calendar year, in so far as received in my Department and on estimates based on existing trends.</P>
    <P>(4)  Indirect employment has been construed to mean employment on a contractual (including consultancy) basis.  No figures for such employment are available in the Department in the case of local authorities.  It is not possible to give figures for &ldquo;spin-off&rdquo; employment in relation to the &ldquo;direct employment&rdquo; figures given in the reply.</P>
    <P>(5)  Generally in the case of the &ldquo;agencies&rdquo;, the figures shown are those supplied by these bodies.</P>
