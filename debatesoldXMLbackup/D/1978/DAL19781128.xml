      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to paragraphs 5.15 to 5.19 of the Green Paper on Development for Full Employment. Arising from the proposals in the Green Paper, I informed building societies in August last of the Government's decision that at least 60 per cent of the total funds available to them for mortgages should be allocated in providing loans not exceeding £13,000 each and that at least a further 20 per cent of available funds should be allocated in providing loans of between £13,000 and £16,000.  I also informed the societies that certificates of reasonable value should be furnished by all applicants for loans not exceeding £16,000 for the purchase of new houses. The prices of all grant-type new houses and flats provided for sale are also subject to scrutiny by my Department under the certificate of reasonable value system.  Accordingly, most new houses and flats are now subject to these controls. The societies are also required to maintain the apportionment of loans as between new and previously occupied houses at current levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the most recent 12 month period for which figures are available, the average price of houses for which certificates <Col N="4" /> issued increased by only two-thirds of the average increase for all new houses.  In addition, the Quarterly Bul-letin of Housing Statistics which will be published shortly by my Department will indicate that the overall average gross price of new houses for which loans were approved by the principal lending agencies in the quarter ended 30 September 1978 increased by 3.4 per cent during the quarter compared to a corresponding increase of 8.4 per cent in the preceding quarter.  I am hopeful that the measures announced last August will continue to have a moderating effect on the rising prices of new houses.</P>
    <P>I am keeping the general question of house price increases under continuous review in my Department.  I think that there is scope for tightening up the CRV system and I am considering what action I can take in the context of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1977, which is now being prepared in my Department.  It would be impractical to control the sale prices of previously-occupied houses.</P>
    <P>In so far as the cost of building land is concerned, I would refer the Deputies to my reply to Questions Nos. 338, 346 and 363 of 11 October 1978.  Since July 1977 I have increased very substantially the capital available for sanitary services with a view to increasing the supply of serviced land.  I also increased recently the subsidisable cost limit on each developed site provided by local authorities from £900 to £1,500 so as to encourage the provision of modestly-priced private houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in the year from June 1977 to June 1978 prices have risen by as much as 32½ or 33 per cent?  Is it not also a fact that the prac-tice of gazumping in one way or another is widespread and that there must be some way in which statutory control of this practice can be established?  The measures taken by the Minister so far have not been effective?  Would the Minister not agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the certificate of reasonable value, is it possible for the Minister to fix prices, to establish the price of the house?  Is it possible to do that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not, because many factors have to be taken into consideration in the issuing of a certificate of reasonable value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the price of housing, as has been admitted, has increased by 33 per cent and that the price of both material and labour has increased by only 7 per cent, what accounts for the 26 per cent increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Factors which have directly affected house price increases over the past year or so include growth in demand for private houses fuelled up to recently by increased availability of mortgage finance, escalation in the cost of serviced land, scarcity of skilled labour accentuated by an unprecedented increase in house improvement works, the tendency for builders to incorporate kitchen equipment and built-in furniture and to build a better type, better quality house, a certain degree of trading up in the market, the fact that between early 1974 and mid-1977 the rate of increase in house prices lagged well behind the rate of increase in wholesale prices generally&mdash;that leeway has now been made up&mdash;and increases in disposable incomes.  All these factors contributed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the deluge of statistics and goodwill in the Minister's reply, is it not a fact that the prices of new houses increased in the order of 25 per cent more than building costs during the period to which the Minister referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That question has been answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The question also refers to the price of building land and we did not hear anything in the Minister's reply about that.  Is the Minister aware that prices for new houses for which loans were approved by building societies in the 12-month period to which he refers increased by 44.1 per cent, that prices for new houses for which loans were approved by insurance companies rose by 37 per cent and that prices for houses for which loans were approved by the associated banks rose 37 per cent?  How can the Minister justify pretending to tell us that there is a satisfactory position regarding house prices at present in the light of those facts?  Secondly, would he comment on the situation now prevalent regarding the price of building land when in the Dublin area building land sold in recent weeks for £120,000 an acre?</P>

      <P>I said in my original reply that as regards the cost of building land I would refer the Deputies to my reply to Questions Nos. 338, 346 and 363 of 11 October 1978.  Since July 1977 I have increased substantially the capital available for sanitary services with a view to increasing the supply of <Col N="7" /> serviced land.  Recently I increased also the subsidy cost limit on each developed site provided by local authorities from £900 to £1,500 in order to encourage the provision of modestly priced private houses.  In addition, the Kenny Report is under active consideration by the Government.  This report was commissioned by the previous Fianna Fáil administration but the Coalition Government did nothing about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State gave a very lengthy reply to a couple of two-line questions.  In his reply he stated that part of the reason for the excessive in-crease in the price of houses over the building increase was due to extra demand. In view of his own statement, will the Minister state if it is still the Government's policy with regard to people who have applied for local authority housing and who are on the housing list to try to push them out of the local authority housing sector and into the private sector, thereby increasing the demand?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of a report published by the Economic and Social Research Institute showing that under Fianna Fáil there has been no increase in the volume of house building and that any money provided has gone into higher prices for houses and, as the Minister's reply divulges when read carefully, into higher profits for builders?</P>

    <P>9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if, in view of the failure of private enterprise to meet the housing needs of the middle income group, he will extend the financial resources available for local authority housing, and bring the eligibility rates up to a more realistic level in accordance with the recent rapid changes in the value of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the financial resources available for local authority housing, I am satisfied that the public capital programme provision of £80.77 million in 1978 is more than adequate to maintain a satisfactory level of activity on the local authority housing construction programme, commensurate with current housing needs.  Loan charges on this programme are met in full by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The level of activity on the programme in 1979 will be determined in due course by the Government's decisions on the 1979 public capital programme allocations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the local authority house purchase loans scheme is concerned, the Government, since they assumed office, have twice increased the amount of the maximum loan.  The loan limit was increased from £4,500 to £7,000 and the yearly income limit from £2,350 to £3,500 with effect from 26 May 1977. The loan limit was again increased to £9,000 with effect from 1 September 1978.  Provision of £40.7 million was made in the capital budget for 1978 to meet the increased expenditure on house <Col N="9" /> purchase loans.  This compares with an expenditure of approximately £17 million in 1977.  The commitment to keep the income and loan limits under review has been and will continue to be met.</P>
    <P>In so far as the overall house purchase position is concerned, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the fact that the number of house purchase loans approved by the principal lending agencies in the first six months of 1978 increased by 25 per cent over the number approved in the same periods of 1977 and 1976.  I do not consider that this can be regarded as a sign of failure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that according to the Green Paper there will be a cut in capital expenditure for housing, not an increase?  Further, is it not true that inflation has driven a coach and four through all the grants which the Minister has pointed out have been increased? The £1,000 grant is not worth as much as when it was first granted by Fianna Fáil.  In the circumstances, will the Minister not increase the eligibility limit in order to bring it into line with the inflation rate and also change the attitude towards the £1,000 grant which is a negligible figure in the cost of a house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that inflation has had a certain impact on the cost of houses and on the allocation of money for housing.  We must bear in mind that the increase in the public capital programme for housing was substantial as compared with the 1977 level. We must not forget that were it not for the £1,000 grant the position would be far more serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a figure of £80 million.  Is it not the position that the local authorities asked for £100 million and that in a circular dated 31 August 1978 the Minister declined to give that amount?  In view of that publicised information, is the Minister happy with the capacity of the local authorities to meet their housing needs in the coming year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware, the local authorities are reasonably satisfied with their capital allocation for <Col N="10" /> 1978.  It is a substantial increase over the figure for 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions to ask the Minister.  First, is not the most vital question here the total public capital expenditure on housing as a percentage of total public expenditure? In that context, is the Minister aware that the percentage of total capital expenditure on housing since 1976 has been in continuous decline from 11.89 per cent in 1976 to 10.89 in 1977 and to 10.55 per cent this year?  Despite the inflated cash figures mentioned by the Minister, local authorities have less money now to spend as a percentage of total capital expenditure than previous years.  Is that not the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with what the Deputy has said.  The question spoke of &ldquo;the failure of private enterprise to meet the housing needs of the middle income group&rdquo;.  The Government are meeting the needs of this group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept the figures I gave?  I can assure him they are accurate.  The question spoke of bringing the eligibility rates to a more realistic level.  Is the Minister aware of the growing concern of people who are endeavouring to get loans from local authorities?  They are in an impossible situation because the income limits are so low that the amount of loan they get is almost irrelevant to the price of a house.  The number of people who will benefit from such loans in decreasing. Will the Minister indicate what response he will make in that area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>

The loan limit was again increased to £9,000 with effect from 1 September 1978.  The eligibility limit and the amount of loan are being kept under review.</P>

If the Minister makes the assumption that they are reasonably satisfied <Col N="12" /> because they are building a number of local authority houses could he explain why it is that the senior Minister in the Department of the Environment expressed grave disappointment at the number of local authority house completions this year?

    <P>(2)  The houses concerned are not necessarily comparable from quarter to quarter or from area to area; this applies particularly in areas where the number of loans approved in a quarter may be relatively small and the average prices influenced significantly by individual housing schemes. Further, the average price may be influenced from quarter to quarter by changes in the distribution of loan approvals among the agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the certificate of reasonable value system is operated in a fair and equitable manner and that a reasonable balance is maintained between the interests of builders and house purchasers.  I am aware that, from time to time, certain aspects of the system have been the subject of criticism from various quarters&mdash;some of which suggest that the controls are not strict enough and are being evaded while others allege that they are too strict.  I am reviewing the system in the context of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1977, and will consider including provisions in the matter.</P>

    <Col N="15" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if he has seen in the <i>Quarterly Economic Review</i> of the ESRI the suggestion that the administration of the certificate of reasonable value system is causing a number of builders to build in what is described as the luxury market and who are not, therefore, providing housing in the area for which the Government have earmarked a percentage of building societies' resources?  Has the Minister seen that reference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen it but I assume that what the Deputy says is correct.  As far as I am aware the position is that builders are reasonably satisfied with the system.  It has been and is working reasonably well.  So far this year the system has resulted in a saving of approximately £750,000 to house purchasers.  I am satisfied with the way it is being operated.  As I indicated in my reply, I am reviewing the system in the context of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1977, which will be circulated during the Christmas recess, or immediately afterwards, when the House will have an opportunity of discussing this whole issue during the debate on that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has not seen what is perhaps an extraordinarily relevant article for somebody with his direct responsibilities, could he state whether, in his personal view, as Minister directly involved, the certificate of reasonable value system, with all its attendant difficulties&mdash;in the view of this administration&mdash;has caused a number of private enterprise builders to build in the luxury market in order to avoid administration under the CRV system?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so, particularly since the Government action of August this year when they decided that building society loans should be apportioned on the following basis: at least 60 per cent of the total value of funds available for mortgages should be allocated in providing mortgages for house purchasers whose mortgage requirements did not exceed £13,000; that at least a further 20 per cent of the funds <Col N="16" /> should be allocated in providing mortgages for house purchasers whose mortgage requirements were in excess of £13,000 and not exceeding £16,000 and&mdash;very important&mdash;that a certificate of reasonable value be furnished by all applicants for mortgages not exceeding £16,000 for the purchase of new houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the recent Central Bank Report which indicated clearly that house prices had gone up in the order of 23 per cent to 25 per cent over house-building costs, does the Minister consider that the time to review the usefulness of the CRV itself is at hand in so far as it is of any value to would-be house purchasers at all? Secondly, is the Minister aware of allegations that a small minority of builders have abused the CRV system by obtaining a CRV and subsequently inflating the cost of the house by adding very large sums for such alleged extras as central heating, fitted wardrobes and that type of thing?  Is the Minister aware that this allegation has been made and that names have been mentioned in certain contexts about the allegation? Further, if the Minister is aware of this what is he going to do about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, and I accept the Minister's word, would he explain why the housing circular sent out on 31 August this year states specifically that applicants for local authority houses will be reviewed <i>via-à-vis</i> their PAYE certificates&mdash;that applicants for housing in the normal traditional way will be asked to produce PAYE certificates? Would the Minister like to comment on that, if it is not the intention of the Department to change the system of allocation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not be aware of it, but it is open to local housing authorities to propose changes as they see fit in the method of allocating houses, subject to the provisions of section 60 of the 1966 Housing Act.  During the years amendments have been proposed by housing authorities for approval by the Minister.  Section 60 lays down schemes of allocations proposed by housing authorities and approved by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an evasive reply.  I asked the Minister in the written question and in my first supplementary if it is the Department's proposal to introduce some kind of a request for a PAYE certificate of income in respect of anybody who applies for a local authority house. His first answer was &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and his supplementary gave me a description of the procedure and stated that local authorities may amend their letting priority schemes.  As far as I am aware, no local authority has proposed such an alteration.  The only proposal to do so has come from the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that <Col N="20" /> local authorities must satisfy themselves before they re-house persons that those persons are not in a position to re-house themselves out of their own resources. Then it is only reasonable to assume that local authorities must inquire into an applicant's income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is routine procedure for housing authorities to examine applications of persons seeking re-housing, and that includes their incomes. If local authorities decide that the best way they can do it in respect of wage or salary earners is to get their PAYE certificates, they are correct in doing so.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said the Government have not proposed to change the method of letting houses. Can we take it therefore that the reference in the Government's Green Paper to the increasing scrutiny with which local authority housing applicants would be met does not mean a change in the allocation methods, or has that option been closed down?</P>

      <P>The national differential rents scheme for local authority dwellings provides for an annual review of the terms of the scheme and an annual general review of incomes for the purpose of reassessing rents.  A preliminary review of the terms of the scheme is being carried out in my Department and any proposed alterations or modifications of the terms of the scheme arising from that review will have regard to the increased cost to local <Col N="22" /> authorities of managing and maintaining their housing estates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>) asked the Minister for the Environment the policy of his Department regarding the sanction of the cost of installing electric light in houses, known as prefabs, provided for old persons by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to approve the charging, to the appropriate loan, of a reasonable cost of providing a supply of electricity to special prefabricated dwellings provided by local authorities for elderly persons. Where the cost is exceptionally high, it is usual for the authority to seek a specific approval.  Any such exceptional case made is considered by me as sympathetically as possible.  In general, authorities are encouraged to site these special dwellings so that all essential services can be provided at a reasonable cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Is the Minister aware that <Col N="23" /> his Department have frequently refused to sanction the installation of electric light in these wooden buildings on the grounds that the cost would be exces-sive? Is he also aware that many of these prefabricated wooden buildings which have been provided for elderly people have been left without electric light and that these elderly people in these wooden buildings are forced to rely on an open flame, such as candles or oil lamps, and does he agree these are positively dangerous and that the practice should be stopped immediately?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about this matter.  Cases have arisen where the cost of electricity installation is exceptionally high and authorities normally seek approval for the higher charges.  Sanction is usually given, although in certain cases an authority may be requested to reconsider the provision of dwelling units on particular sites because of the high cost of services due to the location of the site.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that local authorities who are providing demountables, as they are called in Donegal, should be obliged to provide electricity services in the same way that water and sewerage services are provided.  There are, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, an alarming number of these buildings occupied by people who are at greatest risk, using candles, oil lamps and gas appliances?</P>

      <P>Yes.  One of the con-ditions of payment of the £1,000 grant is that the dwelling must meet the Department's structural requirements which includes proper foundations.  The materials used in the manufacture of mobile homes do not normally comply with grant requirements.  In any event, such homes are used without foundations and can be moved from site to site.  There is no change in the Department's requirements in this regard as mobile homes did not qualify for grants under the old schemes.</P>

      <P>The capacity of local authorities to carry out such work is among the aspects of the fire service covered in the general reviews of the service which I have asked local authorities to undertake.

      <P>Ireland is keeping in close touch with recent developments at EEC level which include the adoption of a Council resolution of 26 June 1978 providing for an action programme under six main headings.  The programme provides for a study of the need for measures to enhance the co-operation and effectiveness of emergency schemes in member states.  The resolution envisages the availability of specially trained groups with equipment which would be immediately available.  Any developments in this area would be a matter of special interest to this country. Other main headings covered by the action programme envisaged by the EEC include the computerisation of data on tankers and off-shore structures, the development of an improved insurance code for tankers and the design and development of special clean-up vessels, as well as a research programme on chemical and mechanical means of combating oil pollution at sea.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, there are at present no legal powers which would enable tolls to be charged on public roads or bridges.  I announced publicly on 10 August last that the Government have approved proposals prepared by me for the drafting of legislation to enable such developments to take place.

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to extend, for the purpose of tapering rates, the period of ownership of a surviving spouse on the disposal by that spouse of assets acquired on the death of the first spouse.  The intention is that the surviving spouse will benefit by the extension of his or her period of ownership to include the deceased's period of ownership extending from the date of acquisition of the assets to the date of death.  The provisions of section 6 of the Bill are not being changed, so that the survivor will be treated as having acquired the assets on the deceased's death at their market value at the date of death, not at the deceased's cost of acquisition because this would, in general, be less favourable to the surviving spouse.  In effect therefore the proposed amendment will affect only the rate of tax and not the amount of the gain on the disposal by the surviving spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point that I wished to refer to was in connection with a proposal by Deputy P. Barry that section 27 relief should be extended to assets which are added to <Col N="77" /> qualifying assets but fail to qualify for relief because they have been owned for less than 10 years.  The Deputy may remember he talked about a farm with land added to it within less than 10 years before the death.  The purpose of section 27 is to enable a parent who owns the family farm or family business to pass it on to a child of his without having to provide for a liability to capital gains tax on the disposal at a time when, as is usually the case in such transfers, no cash consideration passes from the child to the parent.</P>
    <P>The intention of the section is to cover the normal case of the parent who has devoted his working life to the farm or business up to the age of 55 years or over and who wishes to shed his responsibilities and pass the farm or business over to the next generation.  It was felt that the capital gains tax should not be seen to discourage this type of transfer. It would be expected that normally the parent would have owned the assets for the whole or greater part of his working life.  But the section had to provide for a minimum qualifying period of ownership.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry is concerned with the case where a relatively small part of the business assets fails to qualify for relief because it was acquired less than 10 years prior to the time of disposal.  He pointed out that the small addition could add disproportionately to the value of the asset.  He instanced the case of a small farm where the acquisition of additional acreage made it, say, an economic holding.  It should be mentioned that the enhancing effect of the addition is treated as spread evenly over the whole farm so that the relief will apply proportionately to the enhancement of value.</P>
    <P>For example if the addition of 10 acres to a 40-acre farm had the effect of doubling its value, the relief would be applied on the basis that 40/50ths of the farm was a qualifying asset.  Bearing this in mind, and having regard to the fact that the 10 acres were held for less than 10 years, it does not seem unreasonable that he should have to pay some tax on the disposal.  If the part acquired within the 10 years was acquired in replacement <Col N="78" /> of trading assets that had been disposed of there is of course no problem because the combined period of ownership of the old and new assets is counted for the purpose of the 10 year test.</P>
    <P>It is only therefore where the part which does not qualify is an addition to the business assets that a problem arises. The 10 year limit provided for appears to be quite generous.  There seems to be no good reason for departing from it even where only a small part of the assets disposed of is involved.  The individual who finds himself in the position mentioned by Deputy Barry can avoid paying tax by transferring the assets that qualify but holding the newly acquired assets until the 10 year test is satisfied.  If he transfers the assets which were held for over 10 years, thus qualifying for relief, and dies within 10 years of acquiring the additional assets, there will be no charge to tax on his death on the passing of the additional assets to the child.  The difficulty with trying to legislate for such cases is that it would open the door to avoidance which would be difficult to prevent because it would enable the parent to purchase assets in the knowledge that if a gain materialised he could avoid tax by transferring the assets to his child whereas if losses accrue he could himself realise the assets for set off against chargeable gains on assets that are not qualifying assets.</P>
    <P>On the whole it seems not unreasonable that tax should if exigible or chargeable be paid on any assets that have been held for less than 10 years and which therefore do not come within the intention of the section which is clearly to relieve gains on assets held over a long period when they are disposed of on retirement.  It would appear also to me that the concessions sought could not inequitably be confined to land but would have to apply to business assets generally.  I undertook, when Deputy Barry raised this, to look at the matter further and, if I thought it appropriate, to bring in amendment, but since I am not bringing in an amendment I thought, in fairness to Deputy Barry, that I should indicate the results of my having looked at it and my thinking on it having done so.</P>

      <P>We welcome amendment No. 1.  It is eminently fair that a husband and wife should be treated as the one unit in the matter of assets like this.  The surviving spouse should not be treated, on the date of the death of one of the partners as being a new owner. The situation moves on from there so that if the surviving spouse sells within the first five years he or she becomes liable for a tax rate of 35 per cent. Therefore we welcome this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the point of explanation given by the Minister on the point I raised I do not accept what he said.  I thought I had made it clear on the last occasion in the example I gave that if one piece of land, say 10 acres, had been sold just as one unit of land to some other owner it would not have achieved the same increase in value that it would achieve if it was added to a significantly bigger parcel of land.  It is true probably, as the Minister said, that the larger parcel of land to which it is added will also be enhanced in value over the period, not to the same extent by any means as the smaller piece of land by being part of a 60 or 70-acre farm rather than a 10-acre holding in the meantime and it is to avoid that situation.  In relation to any tax that is introduced one could argue the necessity for not being flexible and generous in its application because the Minister concerned wanted to eliminate avoidance.  I am not sure if that is a very fair argument to use because I believe that a tax should be just and it should be seen to be just. Take the case of a businessman who has a fairly extensive business of, say, 2,000 square feet and there is a yard or a small shed belonging to a neighbour which he then purchases so enlarging his total holding.  That piece of property by being part of the larger business is very much more valuable than if it had been sold to the neighbour at the other side purely as a coal shed or some sort of extension to his house.  It is very much more valuable now as part of the business than it would be on its own or if it had been sold through the other neighbour.  That is <Col N="80" /> really, for that one piece of property or parcel of land, an exaggerated value over a relatively short period of time which would mean that the business, when the owner dies and passes it on to one of his children, would then be subject to a rate of tax which would not normally be applicable to it if it was on its own or sold to the neighbour next door.  Therefore, I am disappointed that the Minister could not see his way to find some relatively easy means of catering for this problem which is perhaps not quite so applicable in towns or cities in regard to property but certainly applies in rural Ireland as regards land.  However, we welcome the amendment introduced by the Minister but we do not think it goes far enough.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister elaborate a little more on the exact impact of his amendment?  Does it mean that there will be no capital gains tax due on a transfer from a husband to a wife on the death of a husband?  We are all aware that capital acquisitions tax is paid on such an event and it seems inequitable that both capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax should be cumulatively payable on the same event. If the result of the Minister's amendment is to create a situation where in the event of a husband dying and transferring to his wife or a wife dying and transferring to her husband that the only tax which will remain payable in the event of their having property of the relevant size is capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax will not be payable, that is a fair result and the amendment is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of us agree in the case of interfamily transfers of this sort, where assets are not realised other than where they have to be realised as a result of an unduly heavy taxation, but where there is no intention of realising assets at that time, as there would not be in the case of a death because nobody intends to die at any particular time and any realisation which results directly as a result of death is not an intended realisation that it would not be fair that capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax should be <Col N="81" /> leviable on such an unintended realisation as would arise from the death of one spouse or the other.  In so far as this amendment would prevent this double taxation occurring this side of the House welcome the Minister's amendment.  I feel that it does not go far enough and that it should extend to all immediate family transfers.  We will have an opportunity of arguing that issue on our amendment.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that point because it would assist us in the debate on the next amendment as well as clarifying what his amendment means.</P>

      <P>The position is that capital gains tax does not arise on a death.  Therefore, in the case referred to by Deputy Bruton there is no liability for capital gains tax.  This amendment seeks to deal with a situation where the surviving spouse disposes of the property.  The purpose is that in such cases, on acceptance of this amendment, the surviving spouse on disposal of the property will get for the purpose of the tapering rates, the benefit not only of his or her period of ownership but also the deceased spouse's period of ownership.  In effect, you combine the period of ownership of the two spouses in determining the tapering rate when the surviving spouse is disposing of the property.  The death of the spouse who died previously does not arise in this case in so far as capital gains tax does not arise on that death.  I hope that makes the position clear to Deputy Bruton.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> In page 5, subsection (8), line 11, after &ldquo;of section 3 (2)&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and, where the asset was acquired by the person on the death of his spouse or lineal ancestor so that his period of ownership would, apart from this subsection, be treated as having commenced on the date of that death, his period of ownership shall be deemed to be extended to include his spouse's or lineal ancestor's period of continuous ownership ending on that date&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is an extension of the Minister's amendment which we have just agreed to.  If the Minister accepts the justice of the spouse being relieved of a liability for tax if he or she sells within the 21-year period of the tapering rates of taxes, then he should accept the extension that is envisaged under our amendment.</P>
    <P>Let us take a simple example of a widower living with his son or daughter, an only child, who will inherit the entire property on the death of the parent.  If the property has been in the family for two generations, more than 21 years, there is liability for tax when the father dies at the moment and if the survivor, who is not the spouse, sells that property within 21 years of the tapering rate.  In the case of the wife or the husband there is no liability under the Minister's amendment.  This relief should be extended to the children or the direct descendants, not nieces, nephews, brothers or sisters but to the children or their children, as the case may be, the lineal descendants of the person who is deceased if they choose to sell the property within 21 years at whatever rate is envisaged.  We are moving this amendment to extend to the children and the grandchildren, the lineal descendants, of the deceased person the same rights as are given to the spouse under the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies know, in the capital gains tax code special treatment is accorded to the spouse which is not accorded to children or grandchildren already but it relates largely to gifts <i>inter vivos.</i>  The amendment just accepted, taking account of the tapering rates which are introduced in this Bill, is extending it not just to gifts <i>inter vivos</i> but to property which has been inherited by the spouse from the surviving spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it refers only to deaths of spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It refers to property which has been inherited by a surviving spouse from a deceased spouse.  That is the effect of the amendment we have just dealt with and it gives the maximum benefit possible under the tapering rates in such case.  What is proposed here goes much further.  It is not unreasonable, and it is equitable, to look at the combined successive periods of ownership of assets by a married couple particularly because in many cases they may be required to enable the surviving spouse to maintain as far as possible his or her established standard of living.  To put it more bluntly, and this has been put to me in representations, there are cases, and perhaps they are as not as infrequent as we would like them to be, where a surviving spouse, particularly a widow, finds it necessary to sell off the property inherited from the husband merely to survive.  To apply capital gains tax in such cases would produce inequity.  In <Col N="84" /> that case it seems reasonable that we should give the relief we have just given.</P>
      <P>The same argument cannot be applied in relation to a son or daughter who will normally have a source of income divorced from the family assets.  Where the son or daughter succeeds on a death, he or she will normally be young enough to qualify by virtue of his or her own period of ownership for tapering rates or for complete exemption from capital gains tax, if and when he comes to dispose of the assets received on the parent's death.  This is the most likely situation particularly in regard to land or a business.</P>
      <P>If the assets have to be disposed of by a child after a death to provide for a number of next of kin, which can happen, such a disposal will usually take place within a relatively short period after death.  Only the relatively small gain since the death will, under section 6 of the Bill, which provides for a base cost equal to market value at date of death, fall to be taxed.  This is one of the changes introduced in this Bill.</P>
      <P>In addition, indexation will apply where it is appropriate to compensate for the inflationary element in the gain. A general provision relieving disposals by children of assets acquired on a parent's death by aggregating the parent's period of ownership would, I suggest, be an unnecessarily wide relief to cater for the few, if any, cases in which any hardship would arise on such a disposal by a child to provide for claims against the parent's estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I should stress that what we are talking about here is a child or grandchild, who, having inherited property, decides to dispose of it.  That is what we are talking about, not just their inheritance.  The same applies in the case of a farm or business where the child or grandchild continues to run the farm or business, but having inherited it, they decide to dispose of it.  Such a decision can be made for very good reasons, such as, as I said, where they have to pay money to others of the next of kin and they have to raise money for this purpose.  Where the property is disposed of, having held it for some time and <Col N="85" /> deciding that there was a good gain to be made from selling it, on the face of it there does not seem to be any case for such persons not having to pay capital gains tax.  That is in effect what we are being asked to do.  It may be said that the amendment does not go quite that far, but it could.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw Deputies' attention to the situation that can arise under this proposed amendment.  Let us suppose a grandfather owned assets for 21 years and left them to his son.  The son would inherit the 21-year period of ownership.  If he died ten years later and left the assets to his own son, the grandchild would inherit a 31-year period of ownership from his father. Thus, through a chain of deaths, capital gains tax is effectively neutralised and simply would not be payable in respect of a disposal of those assets.</P>
    <P>The fact that a husband and wife are normally much the same age limits the effect that the previous amendment would have on the yield from the tax. The surviving spouse gets the benefit of the combined period of ownership of the deceased spouse but cannot pass this on to the child under the amendment we have dealt with.  In the cases I have described this amendment would effectively exempt from capital gains tax a disposal of assets at, in some cases, an enormous gain, by children or grandchildren who had inherited them from their grandparents.  I do not think there is an adequate case for a relief of this kind.  There is an adequate case for it in the case of spouses, as I tried to indicate, but to extend it this way is going much too far.  Nothing I have heard in references to this on Committee Stage or in what Deputy Peter Barry said in proposing this amendment, convinces me that there is any genuine case for this special exemption from capital gains tax in the case of children or grandchildren inheriting property, be it land, a business or whatever where in some cases there can be a very substantial gain.  It is not clear to me why the Deputies opposite argue that in such cases there should be no liability, or a very limited liability, to capital gains tax.  It seems to me that the case for this <Col N="86" /> is far from proved.  The extension to the spouse is justifiable for the reasons I have given, but the extension to the child or grandchild goes much further and is not justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister has not seen his way to accepting this amendment.  I would like to give him an example where the need for this amendment could arise, and I am sure on reflection he will be sympathetic to it.  I am thinking particularly of a farm which is a continuing business.  It is not an asset one buys and sells in the market place like stocks and shares in a company. The asset is the one unique means of livelihood of the family.  Assuming we are talking about a farm, I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the increasing likelihood that in the event of a father dying and leaving the farm to some of his children, the capital acquisitions tax payable will be so high that the only way it could be paid would be for some of the farm to be sold.</P>
      <P>It would not have to be sold immediately because the exact capital acquisitions tax liability would not be known immediately.  There would be a series of negotiations between the inheriting person and the Revenue Commissioners regarding the valuation of the property and on the question of what rates should apply and so on.  However, after two or three years or even four years, because these matters can be protracted, it might become very clear that the only way to preserve the farm and pay the capital acquisitions tax would be to sell part of the property. This would be the case in particular if there was an outstanding debt at the bank which would prevent the person concerned raising further money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The likelihood of this type of situatoon arising has been increased greatly by the failure of the Minister in the 1978 Finance Act to raise the thresholds for capital acquisitions tax in respect of precisely the sort of situation envisaged here.  The Minister raised the threshold in respect of transfers to a nephew or to a brother or sister but he choose deliberately not to raise the threshold in <Col N="87" /> respect of transfers from father or mother to a son or daughter.  No ac-count was taken of the fact that property values between the time of the 1975 Finance Act, when the capital acquisitions tax was introduced, and the 1978 Finance Act had doubled or even trebled in some cases.  Further, there is no provision for indexation in respect of capital acquisitions tax.  There may be such provision in respect of capital gains tax but this tax is more applicable to the speculator, to the person buying or selling property, a practice that is much more characteristic of a businessman than of a farmer operating a family farm on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>Therefore, concessions in the area of capital gains tax are of no value to farmers.  They do not intend selling their properties.  They will sell only if they are forced to do so.  The Minister's failure to take account of inflation in relation to capital acquisitions tax while being generous in that regard in respect of capital gains tax indicates the type of activity with which he has most sympathy. But that is another day's battle.  What I am seeking to establish clearly is that, because of the failure to adjust the thresholds in respect of capital acquisitions tax, it is increasingly likely that if a farm of 100 acres or even one of 70 acres is transferred from father to son, capital acquisitions tax will have to be paid.</P>

      <P>Because of the failure to adjust the threshold it is likely that in many cases people will be forced to sell <Col N="88" /> parts of their farms in order to pay the capital acquisitions tax.  It is very unfair, too, that people should be asked to pay capital gains tax in respect of a property from the time of the death of the father and the sale of the property.  The Minister should be satisfied with getting capital acquisitions tax without looking for capital gains tax also on whatever gain may have accrued during the period.</P>
      <P>Our amendment meets fairly well the type of situation we are describing.  It does not extend to transfers to brothers, sisters, nephews or nieces or to more distant transfers.  The Minister has pointed out that the provision would apply also to grandchildren because of the use of the words &ldquo;lineal ancestor&rdquo;.  While I am not authorised to speak for Deputy Barry I should be happy to forget about the grandfather-to-grandchild transfer which is usually a windfall situation.  I would have no objection to our amendment being changed to that extent.  Subject to that rider the case for our amendment is strong and I trust the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <P>We are pleased with what has been granted in respect of a transfer from a husband to a wife because without this concession there could be a situation almost as iniquitous as was the death duty system.  Having regard to the small amount of revenue involved I expect that the Minister will see his way to accepting the amendment. What we are discussing is not an everyday-type of situation.  If a farm is passed on to a son or daughter they will generally preserve it even if they must borrow to do so and a sale will occur only in a very rare instance such as in the event of there not being a will.  In such circumstances a young man who has stayed at home to work on the family farm would find himself in the situation of his brothers and sisters having as much right to the farm as he had although they might not have contributed anything to the estate.  In that sort of situation the victim of the circumstances would probably have to sell the farm and in addition would have to pay capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suspect that there is much more revenue involved in what the Minister has conceded already than would be involved in meeting our case.  We should have much fairer legislation, especially in view of inflationary trends.  The price of land has gone out of all proportion to its real value in so far as making money is concerned.  Inflation has really taken hold with regard to land and because of that and the fact that it would be committed <Col N="90" /> to acquisition tax at any rate, I hope that the Minister will see his way to helping to further the interest of families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am in full agreement with the system of capital gains tax.  Until capital gains tax was introduced a person could manipulate the buying and selling of property in such a way that he would have a substantial income but would not be liable for any tax, income tax or otherwise.  That was an outrage, especially since the PAYE system of tax-ation was introduced here.  It was a disgrace which needed to be cleared up. The Minister let his attitude to capital gains tax be known as a desire to get after the man who made &ldquo;the quick buck&rdquo;.  That was the phrase used by the Minister and his party on several occasions.</P>
      <P>However, it is not reasonable that in a transaction between one spouse and another where one spouse acquires a property on the death of the other spouse, the receiving spouse should be treated as having purchased the property on the date of the death of the other.  The Minister in his amendment has so said and has accepted that principle.  The ownership of the spouse who receives the property will go back and include the period during which his or her predecessor owned the property.  That is as it should be.  However, unless this amendment is accepted, a child acquiring from a parent will be deemed to have acquired the property for the first time on the death of a parent and time will run against him, so to speak, from that date. If he sells the property in a year or two years he will be liable for the full 30 per cent or whatever it is, and time will start to run in his favour only from the date of death of the parent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): That amount of £150,000 used to be a frightening figure, one which people could not really com-prehend. You hear people talking about £150,000 now as if it were a mere nothing.  Here we are not necessarily talking about agricultural land all the time.  We are talking about agricultural land on the one hand and about family businesses on the other.  If a child acquires a family business on the death of his father he becomes liable for capital acquisitions tax at £150,000.  As Deputy Bruton has pointed out, that may be the very reason why that child will have to dispose of the family business, or some of it, in maybe one, two or three years.  I understand that there is a sliding scale down to 21 years and if a child has to dispose of the property or some of it in order to defray the capital acquisitions tax he is going to be caught for capital gains tax.  That is not reasonable, fair or equitable.  Furthermore, we are getting outside the whole principle of capital gains if when talking about passing property from a parent to a child we regard the date on which the child gets the property as really the date on which it was acquired.  When we talk about a parent and child we are talking about family ownership.  I agree with Deputy Bruton that to go back to the grandfather and avail of the description of lineal descendant in order to manipulate things so that there would be an unfair advantage is something that could be disregarded.  While I would not be prepared to settle for that I would include the nephew or niece in respect of whom the uncle or aunt is <i>in loco <Col N="92" /> parentis</i>, the child having lived with that relation for over five years.  That case should be dealt with by our amendment.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that the policy behind the capital gains tax was to get at the manipulator, the person who wanted to manipulate his life in such a way that he could enjoy a substantial income without being liable for income tax or any other tax to the State.  That was outrageous. It was intolerable that you could have a manipulator arranging his affairs in such a way that he would enjoy an income ten times that of a PAYE person and pay no tax.  However, capital gains tax was never intended to intrude into transactions from parent to child. The Minister would be doing a good day's work if he accepted this amendment in addition to his own amendment in regard to the spouse.  I am not convinced by the argument put forward by the Minister that there is any real difference between spouse and spouse and parent and child.  It is all a family transaction. It is all part of family property that is going from one member of a family to another immediate member.  The fact that capital acquisitions tax comes into play is another point well worthy of consideration.  It is not right that any person should be caught for capital acquisition tax today and in a few years time be caught on the same property for capital gains.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton, Deputy Hegarty and Deputy Fitzpatrick have made the position quite clear.  We are talking here only about the tax which will have to be paid when a gain is realised on the sale of an asset after the death of the original owner.  I suggest that in 999 cases out of 1,000 when a property passes to a son or to a daughter that property will not be sold.  It will be worked in the same way as the father worked it.  The chance of the property being sold and a gain realised is far more likely in the case of a spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other day Deputy Callanan gave a very good example of what could happen when a farmer dies.  Suppose he married at 20 years of age and his son is on the farm for a year short of the length of time the spouse has been on the farm <Col N="93" /> and the son, for reasons of health or some other reason, decides to sell the farm after three years, he will be liable for tax at the rate of 30 per cent on the gain made in that period.  Now this is the case we are trying to cover in this amendment.  As I said, in 999 cases out of 1,000 the farm will not be sold by the son or the daughter because it will be his or her livelihood and he or she will continue <Col N="94" /> to work it.  It is far more likely that it will be sold in the case of the spouse. Because of the very, very, few cases that will be involved, from the point of view of equity and justice and the recognition of the farm or business as a family unit, the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that there has always been a great deal of confusion between the definitions of &ldquo;benefit year&rdquo; and &ldquo;contribution year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The period for a benefit and contribution year is now being changed and the change in the transition will compound the confusion because the new contribution year will become the old benefit year or <i>vice versa.</i>  Will the Minister clarify that position?  As the benefit and contribution year periods are now being changed I should like to know if there is a situation in which a person who under the old system would have contributed sufficient stamps in his contribution year to be in benefit but due to the change will find himself ineligible for benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I readily agree that the situation is confusing at this point.  The best I can do is explain what the situation will be when the new system is fully operative.  Firstly, the contribution year will be the income tax year and the benefit year will be the suceeding full calendar year.  It will begin, for instance, with the income tax year 1978-79.  That year will end in April 1979 and we will then go on forward to the forthcoming income tax year, 1979-80, which will be the first income tax year in which the new system will operate.  The year 1979-80 will be the first contribution year, the income tax year which will run from April 1979 to April 1980.  That contribution year will end on 5 April 1980 and we will then go forward approximately nine months to the end of 1980.  The first benefit year under the new system will be the calendar year 1981.  The whole new system will become completely operative beginning with the income tax year 1979-80, which will be the basis of benefit in the calendar year 1981.  In the meantime all the various contribution and benefit years will be phased into that new system.  I should like to give the Deputy an assurance that in no circumstances <Col N="96" /> will this changeover deprive anybody of benefit to which he or she would otherwise have been entitled to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My second point relates to subsection (1) of this section, where a definition is given of reckonable earnings. That definition is given subject to regulations.  Would the Minister give us an indication of the type of regulation which may be made to further expand the definition of reckonable earnings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, at first sight, this is somewhat confusing and is something which requires explanation. That subsection sets out to establish a new concept, a new definition of reckonable earnings.  Its purpose is to give that new concept a statutory basis and to relate reckonable earnings to insured employment.  It is to establish that concept of insured persons in insured employment having reckonable earnings. The next step is the manner in which those reckonable earnings will be calculated and that will be done by regulation.  That is why the definition is phrased the way it is.  The first thing is to establish the statutory basis in relation to insurable employment and then to give ourselves power to stipulate the exact measurement of the reckonable earnings by regulation.  Very simply, the regulations will provide that the reckonable earnings will be calculated on the basis of gross earnings less approved superannuation contributions. This definition is intended, firstly, to establish a new statutory concept and, secondly, to give us power to stipulate how those reckonable earnings will be calculated by regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That raises a question which was touched upon on Second Stage.  I know the Minister will say that the proposed rate of 3.2 per cent, which is to be amended to 3.4 per cent for the purpose of the coming year, has been pitched at that level because the portion of social welfare which the insured contributor paid for pension purposes is no longer tax deductible.  Is there not a contradiction now being built into the law by virtue of the passage of this section and the regulations which will be made <Col N="97" /> under it?  Apparently, a person's reckonable earnings upon which the 3.4 per cent will be based will be his gross earnings, less his superannuation contribution. In other words, that superannuation will be allowed against reckonable earnings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The payment which the insured contributor will make on that net figure will not be allowed for taxation purposes.  A person who contributes to a private pension fund will be allowed to take off the payments to that private pension fund before he pays his social welfare contribution while a person who does not enjoy a private fund will not be given a tax allowance on his contributions to the State fund in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say on Second Stage that the rate had been pitched at .5 per cent less than it otherwise would have been because he is not being allowed to claim his social welfare contributions for tax purposes any longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason is there not a contradiction in that the payments into the State social welfare pension fund are not allowable for tax purposes while contributions to a private fund will be allowable before an assessment of reckonable earnings for social welfare contribution purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody will be an insured person, and, therefore, everybody will get the benefit of the new adjustment. Reckonable earnings will be calculated as the Deputy has outlined, gross earnings less superannuation contributions.  The reckonable earnings as so established will then be subject to a pay-related contribution by the employee.  In the normal way that pay-related contribution would be fixed at a certain level on the basis of two to one, two parts being payable by the employer <Col N="98" /> and one by the employee.  Whatever the rate which the one-third would represent will be reduced to allow for the loss of the income tax allowance, so that the insured employee will in fact get the income tax allowance under a different heading.  For technical reasons it cannot be granted to him in his income tax computation but it will be granted in equivalent amount by the reduction of his proportion of the percentage.  When his percentage is arrived at on the basis of one-third of the overall pay-related amount, that one-third will be reduced by .5 of 1 per cent to compensate him for the loss of the income tax allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>From now on, allowing that the rate is being pitched at a different level to take account of this change, a person's contribution to a private pension fund will be tax allowable whereas a person's contribution to the State pension fund will not be tax allowable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>&mdash;and in addition the pension which he or his dependants would receive at the other end in reciprocation for his contributions will not be tax allowable or tax free.  I would have thought it would have been more worth while to endeavour to make the State pension payable free of income tax rather than pitching the rate at any different level for the purpose of ease of collection or deduction purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an entirely different question.  It does not really arise out of this transaction.  We are being scrupulously fair to the insured person in this regard.  For technical administrative reasons his income tax cannot be adjusted to allow for his payment for the pension element in his social welfare contribution.  For purely technical reasons we cannot do that but we are doing exactly the same in another way; we are compensating him exactly.  His income tax will no longer be adjusted to allow for this payment&mdash;the pension element in it&mdash;but his actual pay-related contribution into the fund will be <Col N="99" /> reduced by an equivalent amount which will fully compensate him for what he is losing on his income tax computation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying, and I accept, that the rate is being recast by .5 of 1 per cent because, on account of these undefined technical difficulties, there cannot be a proper assessment of tax liability.  Even if we accept that .5 of 1 per cent is the correct rate&mdash;we must accept that apparently; personally I find it too difficult to work out and the Minister has accepted it&mdash;how can we say that a reduction of .5 per cent of reckonable earnings is equally fair to the man who pays the standard rate of income tax, the man who pays the lower rate and the man paying tax at 50 per cent?  At present anyone contributing would claim and his claim for allowability might take him across the threshold and bring him into the lower net, from 50 per cent down to 35 or 38.5?  How is a standard recasting of the rate by .5 per cent going to benefit equal-ly people on different rates of income tax?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>He will be getting the benefit relating to the standard tax rate. We could not refine it any more than that.  We are dealing with employed insurable persons and the variation in their level of income up to £5,000 at that standard rate will be very minor.  We are not dealing with the whole flat rate contribution as not allowable for income tax purposes: it is only the pension element in that contribution.

While the argument can <Col N="100" /> be made that by having a broad figure right across this spectrum of employed contributors, is the &ldquo;most equal&rdquo; way you can treat everybody, there are certain people, and mainly those in the higher tax brackets, who will not get as much benefit from this reduction in the percentage rate as they got previously from claiming their social welfare pension contributions directly for taxation purposes.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. aa1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1) line 43, to delete &ldquo;£5,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£8,000&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to us that a figure of £8,000 would be much more realistic and a more appropriate ceiling.  It is also an important issue from the point of view of redistribution of income and so on.  Also, the rate of contribution for employees could be reduced if the ceiling is raised.  I should like to know the basis on which the £5,000 limit was fixed.  It is roughly one-and-a-half times the average earnings. The Minister is probably aware <Col N="101" /> that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions want to have the figure of £8,000, which is twice the average male industrial earnings, as a more realistic limit.  In Britain at present the ceiling is £6,000.  Could the Minister say on what the £5,000 figure is based?  Was it to coincide with the health limit and is this a good policy if that is so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it is not being done to coincide with the health limit. This is really the determining maximum. There are overwhelming reasons why the social welfare and health limits should be the same, for technical and administrative reasons.  The purpose is to incorporate the vast majority of employed persons.  It is a well-known rule of thumb in a situation like this that in order to include the vast majority one takes the figure of average industrial earnings and multiplies it by one-and-a-half. That is what I have done here.  In September 1977, the latest date for which information is available, the average weekly earnings of all workers, male and female, in the transportable goods industries was £63.88.  When that figure is multiplied by one-and-a-half it gives a figure of £95.56 or £4,983 per year.  That figure was rounded up to £5,000.  The most recent figure in March 1978 was £66.50 and we will look at that between now and when we make the final regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure in the Bill, both for rates and maximum, will be finally confirmed or amended by regulation made before 6 April next.  In that context we will look at it again on the basis of the latest available figure.  The standard practice, here and elsewhere, in this regard is to bring in the vast majority of employed persons by using the calculation of one-and-a-half times the average weekly industrial earnings and I have done that. Having established that for social welfare, the corollary is to have the same maximum with regard to health contributions. I am not saying that £5,000 will be the final figure but it will be approximately that figure on the basis of one-and-a-half times the average industrial earnings.  The figure of £8,000 would be way out and it would completely <Col N="102" /> distort all our calculations on the social welfare and the health side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the House, on reflection, will agree it is reasonable.  The reason the limit of £5,000 has been set has nothing to do with social welfare.  The Minister has been engaged in negotiations with the consultants and it appears they are determining what will be the social insurance limit, a rather unique situation in the context of the introduction of social insurance legislation.  We must be honest about the matter.  The consultants are not prepared to accept a higher figure and the Minister is not prepared to insist on a higher figure.  That is why the Minister has inserted this social insurance limit.</P>
      <P>There should not be any limit.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions would be quite prepared to accept £8,000.  I think it is a reasonable figure.  Thousands of my constituents have incomes between £5,000 and £8,000, a large proportion have incomes in excess of £8,000 and they would be quite prepared to contribute in the context of this Bill. The Minister should act in an imaginative and open-ended way and increase the limit to £8,000.  It is not adequate to say that when the next CSO's figures for earnings are available in March 1979 the Minister may add another £500.  That kind of promise is not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now a golden opportunity to enlarge the scope of the Bill by adopting a limit of £8,000.  Deputy O'Connell considered this matter carefully and I urge the Minister to accept his amendment. The Minister should be prepared to tell the medical profession that we are dealing with social insurance, not the health services as such.  They should be told that they cannot browbeat him as Minister for Social Welfare by having an <Col N="103" /> income ceiling of £5,000 with regard to social insurance.  The Minister must act as Minister for Social Welfare in this matter, not as Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that if the consultants had told the Minister they would be happy to provide cover for people with an income of £6,000 he would have rushed into this House and made provision for a limit of £6,000.  Instead they have set a maximum of £5,000 which we consider to be entirely inadequate.  Tens of thousands of people will be affected. We are back to the old story of one benefit for one group in the community and another kind of benefit for another group.  In 1978 we should be more imaginative in our approach and less open to health pressures in social insurance legislation.</P>

      <P>I am a little loath to speak on this amendment for a number of reasons.  I am quite convinced that the Minister has every intention between now and next April of changing the upper limit and I have no intention of suggesting a figure that he might use when changing the upper limit to justify introducing that figure.  Of necessity the House is being forced to speak on this amendment in a vacuum.  I only got Deputy O'Connell's amendments since our discussions began this afternoon. His amendment ruled out of order refers to the casting of the rate at a lower rate than 3.2 per cent; it refers to the casting of the rate at 2.5 per cent and refers also to the adjusting of the upper sum from £5,000 to £8,000.  Therefore, while amendment No. a 1 appears to be out of order because it would constitute a charge on State funds, the combination of the recasting of the rate with the raising of the sum might not necessarily have resulted in any reduction in the total take by the State.  I am surprised that the Minister, when replying to Deputy O'Connell, did not explain what would have been the effect of the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one amendment allowed stand was that to increase the upper income <Col N="104" /> limit from £5,000 to £8,000.  It appears to me that that would mean that everybody earning over £5,000 would be paying more than is envisaged in the Bill, because on an income of £5,000 at 3.2 per cent a contributor would be paying £160, whereas a contributor on the upper £8,000 would be contributing £256, almost another £100.  If Deputy O'Connell's first amendment had been allowed stand and taken in conjunction with this amendment it would have meant, at the lower rate of 2.5 per cent, that everybody earning less than £6,400 would be paying less than it is anticipated they will have to contribute under the terms of the Bill as it stands, that everybody earning from £6,400 to £8,000 and upwards would be contributing more than at present.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that what Deputy O'Connell has been endeavouring to do is to suggest a complete recasting of the sources and income strata from which the Social Insurance Fund would be funded.  I would have thought that the Minister, with the assistance of his advisers, would have been able to enlighten the House as to the total, combined effect of having the lower rate levied on all contributors but having the ceiling for income purposes raised from £5,000 to £8,000.  I am not going to make the Minister's job any easier by saying that I think the level should be £5,000, or £4,000 or £8,000.  But the Minister ought to have enlightened the House as to what would have been the total effect on the State take and on the fund, as such, by the acceptance of Deputy O'Connell's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>Obviously Deputy O'Connell's intention was that the change in the rate from 3.2 per cent to 2.5 per cent should have been taken in conjunction with the change in the upper limit of the sum.  One amendment being ruled out of order and the other being allowed stand means that we are discussing what I take to be his proposal in rather a vacuum.  I would have thought it <Col N="105" /> would have been helpful had the Minister been able to explain to the House what would have been the effect of having a lower overall rate but a higher income limit.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell suggested that the reduction in the insured contributor's rate from 3.2 per cent to 2.5 per cent would have meant, on my calculations, that everybody earning less than £6,400 would have been paying less than that involved in the Minister's suggestion. Everybody earning from £6,400 to £8,000 would have been paying 2.5 per cent of their income, which would be more than the maximum at present, which is 3.2 per cent of £5,000.  Similarly everybody earning over £8,000 would have been contributing more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speculate on what Deputy O'Connell has in mind.  All I can say is that my approach is entirely a rational one: I want to pitch the upper limit at a reasonable level.  If it goes too high&mdash;for instance, if it went to £8,000&mdash;and we retained the existing percentage contribution rates, there would be contributors paying £896 per annum, about £17 per week.  Deputy O'Connell's amendment would mean that the contribution in respect of an employed person at the upper level would be £17.23 per week; the employee's proportion of that would be somewhere around £5.70 per week, less the income tax adjustment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we should be making that sort of disruptive leaps forward. What we are trying to do here is to bring in this new system in the smoothest way possible.  I think I used the phrase already &ldquo;in a neutral way&rdquo;; in other words, that the overall level of contribution <Col N="106" /> from the employed population is not increased.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think the level of £5,000 is the right one, and I want to repudiate completely what Deputy Desmond suggested. The consultants have nothing to do with this.  In fact, they are pursuing their claims for salaries in a completely different context at present.  What we are concerned with here, and the standard we have adopted, is the one internationally recognised, namely, to include in your welfare scheme the overwhelming majority of your employed population. You do not take the average weekly industrial earnings; you take that figure and multiply it one-and-a-half times. That is precisely what I have done.  I have given the calculations: 63.88 multiplied by one-and-a-half gives an equivalent of £4,983 a year, rounded up to £5,000.  That is perfectly defensible as a level calculated in accordance with the normal recognised practice in this area here and in other countries&mdash;one-and-a-half times the average weekly industrial earnings.  I am not saying that that will be the figure on which we will settle finally in April next but it will be somewhere around the £5,000 level and will be related to a multiplier of the average weekly industrial earnings.</P>
    <P>This upper limit is settled in a social welfare context and at this stage I think it is just about the right level.  As time goes on and as wage levels change, of course it will be changed; there is nothing static about it.  The Bill provides that the upper limit may be changed every year.  It further provides that that will have to be a positive act: the regulations which will increase the upper limit, the maximum, will have to be put through the House.  In other words, there will not be regulations laid before the House which could be cancelled out by a motion of the House.  After the first year any changes to be made will have to be done positively by way of regulation brought into the House.  If we were to go to £8,000 a year now&mdash;and do not forget you would not be going from £5,000 to £8,000; you would be going from £2,500 to £8,000&mdash;that would be a completely unrealistic change to make at this stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> What we want to do is to bring in this scheme now, switch over to pay-related with the minimum of disruption possible and provide that in each succeeding year we can vary our upper limit and our rates as circumstances dictate.</P>

      <P>This Bill afforded the Minister an unusual opportunity to extend social welfare in Ireland.  We have the most appalling social welfare service in the EEC at present.  We have a situation, which has obtained for years, in which people find themselves ineligible for social welfare pensions at the end of their lives.  Because we have had this upper limit, people who have been eligible have been declared ineligible.  We have never extended the ceiling.  I have met hundreds of people who have paid for social welfare stamps but who at the end of their days have found themselves not eligible for contributory pensions because of the appalling social welfare system here.  Many of these people are depending on non-contributory pensions. It is the most appalling social welfare service in the EEC because of Ministers refusing to extend the ceiling.</P>

      <P>I have said we have an appalling social welfare service.  I know a case of two non-contributory old age pensioners who went to Europe to see relatives.  They fell ill in Europe and could not get benefit because they were not covered by insurance.  The Minister knows about this case.  These people are on a miserable pension but they could not benefit although there are people with ten times their income in Europe who could qualify.  In these matters we cannot isolate health from social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had an opportunity <Col N="108" /> through this Bill to do something about it but he has not availed of it.  Here he had an opportunity, as Deputy Desmond has pointed out, to take an imaginative step.  What about the 115,000 civil servants who will not be covered?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me point out again that the Deputy is talking about social welfare.  As soon as this Bill has been dealt with we will be bringing a Health Contributions Bill before the Dáil and we can then talk about health.  Let us stick to social welfare now.  The sort of situations the Deputy has been talking about cannot recur because every employed person will be insured.  It will be more comprehensive than ever before, ensuring that an employed person will not be outside the net in future.  The limit, whether it be £5,000, £6,000 or £7,000, will not have anything to do with people being covered.  The limit is only a cut-off point at which people should pay.  I am sure the ordinary working man will agree that when a certain point has been reached he will not have to pay.  The fact that a person has £5,000 will not in any circumstances put him outside the services: he will be in but he will have to pay at the £5,000 or more point.</P>

      <P>We are aware of what the Minister has been saying but I have been pointing out this astonishing coincidence that this £5,000 eligibility level applies to the health services also. In this Bill he has introduced a ceiling of £5,000, and this coincidence is of considerable importance.  We are not suggesting for a moment, as the Minister has implied, that the same rate of contribution should apply to those earning between £5,000 and £8,000.  Naturally there should be a rejigging of the rates downwards.  We accept that there could be a substantial element of genuine redistribution in this rejigging of rates. One way or the other, the Minister will be running back to the House on an annual basis.  In England the ceiling is £6,000.</P>

      <P>It would be mitigated if one hit a figure of £8,000 and rejigged down from that.  The total contribution from an employee would be reduced overall with a ceiling of £8,000. I have been in consultation with individual members of the ICTU and they see great logic in having an £8,000 ceiling, far above the British ceiling.  In such circumstances the scaling down would make for a straightforward redistribution. It would give room for a better degree of flexibility.  I am not suggesting that a person on £8,000 should have to pay a 3.8 per cent contribution on a straight basis.  That would make the contribution penal.

      <P>Is the Minister aware &mdash; Deputy O'Malley, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, elaborated this matter today at the IMI &mdash; that earnings have exploded to the extent of an 18 per cent increase this year, above and beyond any national pay agreement?  By the outturn of this year we will be talking about a 20 per cent increase in average industrial earnings.  I know the Minister has said, &ldquo;Wait until next March or April; wait until I get out of the problems I am facing in the budget and then I will talk turkey again to you.&rdquo;  I am saying to the Minister that there are thousands in my constituency who are earning between £5,000 and £8,000 per year and several thousands earning more than £8,000 per year.  They distrust the politicians who have a cut-off of £5,000.  They wish to contribute to social insurance.  I am sick to death of the number of people who come back to me and say, &ldquo;Why in the name of God did we not keep up our voluntary contributions?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly support Deputy O'Connell's amendment.  We should have left it at £8,000 with a scaling-down of contributions, a degree of relativity and a lower base.  We might even draw our baseline at the £4,000 mark.  If we had done this the proposal would have been more effective and we would have been in a position to go back to the medical profession and say, &ldquo;We have brought it up to £8,000.  We are going to have a national health service for people earning up to £8,000.&rdquo;  I appreciate the problem which the Minister faces in this regard.  Many employers would have agreed to the proposition for accounting <Col N="111" /> purposes.  A double-barrelled rate of contribution should have been introduced. I see nothing wrong with the proposition and my gross earnings are about £7,500 per year.  There should be a differential contribution at that level as against somebody earning £5,000.</P>

What we say here is sometimes misinterpreted.  I want to be sure that we are all clear about this matter. Nobody is going to be excluded from social welfare by these limits, whether they are £5,000, £6,000 or £8,000. Everybody will contribute and benefit under the social welfare scheme.  The only effect of the limits is that people will stop paying any percentage above that rate.  The maximum stipulated in this Bill will only be a cut-off point for determining the maximum amount that an insured person will pay.  It will not be a maximum for the purpose of excluding anybody.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 51 and 52, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  Where regulations under this subsection are proposed to be made, a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until <Col N="115" /> a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When the Minister or his successors want to vary either the rates which would be charged to an employee or to an employer, that is 3.2 per cent or 7.5 per cent, or when there is an intention to change the upper ceiling limit of £5,000 specified in paragraph (c) of the amended section 6 of the 1952 Act, then under the provisions of subsection (5) (c) the Minister would be obliged to lay before the House the new regulations in draft form.  If the Minister wanted to change the upper ceiling or the amount to be collected from an employee or an employer he would have to do so by way of draft which would have to be adopted by the House and this would allow the House the opportunity to discuss the proposed changes.  That is to be welcomed and I have consistently advocated that it should be done, rather than the House seeking the opportunity to change regulations which have already been made.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has done that in subsection (5) of the amended section 6, which to complicate matters is section 5 of this Bill, in subsection (4) the Minister gives himself power to change before this Bill comes into effect the rate of 3.2 per cent for the employee or 7.5 per cent for the employer or the upper ceiling of £5,000.  We know that the provisions of the Bill are to take effect at the beginning of next April.  Presumably on the basis that there might be a change in the average industrial earnings figure between now and next April, the Minister is giving himself power to change the upper ceiling.  This could be done by regulation and it does not appear that such a regulation would have to be put before the House or that it would appear in draft form.  It would be rather strange if the House were to debate in a vacuum the rates to be paid or the upper ceiling if by 1 April those rates and the ceiling had been changed upwards by way of regulations under subsection (4) of section 6 of the 1952 Act.  It does not appear as if such regulations would be laid before the House unless <Col N="116" /> subsection (4) is governed by a general section which would require all regulations to be laid before the House. If the Minister wants to change the amount to be taken from the employee or the employer after this Bill is passed but before its provisions come into operation, it is most, important that the draft regulations should be laid before the House so that the House would have another opportunity of considering the matter and finding out what the yield to the State would be and the cost to the employee and the employer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not a great case.  It is quite clear what he has in mind but if we look at the situation as it has been and as it will be in the future I do not think he need persist with this amendment.  Traditionally there has been an annual exercise regarding social welfare.  The budget makes certain changes which are put into legislation and the House gets the opportunity every year of debating the level of benefits and so on.  On this occastion we are making major changes and the House has an opportunity in dealing with this legislation to discuss the percentages, the maxima and so on.  It would be a bit much if following immediately on the discussion of the legislation we had a similar type of discussion on regulations made under the legislation.  That would unnecessarily take up the time of the House.  Anything that has to be said about these matters can be said now as this legislation winds its way through.  Admittedly regulations will be brought forward between now and next April and they will be only for purposes of confirming the various figures and calculations set out in the legislation.  They may vary them slightly but not very much.  This Bill will settle the principles on which the calculations are to be made.  If the regulations depart at all from the legislation, they will do so only to take into account last minute variations, if you like; but the House has an opportunity now to discuss the basis of the legislation, the basis of the calculations and the principles on which the scheme will operate in future.  The regulations which will be made between <Col N="117" /> now and next April will be almost exclusively confirmatory in effect.  At the most they will make very small variations here and there.</P>
      <P>I would have thought Deputy Boland would be satisfied with what is proposed from now on.  Every year thereafter, any changes in the figures will have to be made positively by way of regulations which will have to come before the House and be debated.  I could understand him having some grounds for complaint if the legislation provided that in future years the Minister could make regulations which would be operative unless they were annulled by the House. Then he could say the Minister and the Government were depriving the House of their annual opportunity to discuss social welfare matters and social welfare levels.  We are not doing that.  We are providing that each year in future, any changes the Minister wishes to make will have to be made by regulation brought before the House and discussed in the House and passed in the House.</P>
      <P>On reflection Deputy Boland might agree that, as we have legislation now under which everything can be discussed, and as the regulations to a large extent will be confirming what is in the legislation, it should not be necessary for me to proceed as set out in this amendment and the next amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to use this analogy again this week but there is an element of the three card trick in this. The Minister is introducing a Bill at the back end of November which is to come into effect next April.  Certain levels are set out in that Bill for social welfare contributions. A certain upper income is also set out in the Bill.  On the next page of the Bill the Minister is allowing himself to change the upper income limit within the next four months and he is depriving the House of an opportunity to discuss those figures.  If those changes are of a major nature there might be a very different attitude on the part of Deputies to the concept of changing the social welfare stamp to pay related contributions. If those changes appeared punitive on any section of the community, or militated unfairly against any <Col N="118" /> section, there might be different things to be said on the section.</P>
      <P>The Minister is giving himself the power to make those changes.  Apart from the fact that there is to be another adjustment of .3 per cent to allow for the special contribution because of high unemployment, the maximum paid by a person earning £5,000 or more is £160 at 3.2 per cent.  I am not suggesting he would but he could decide to double that figure, and the House would not have an opportunity to discuss that.  In fact, the regulation making that change would not be even laid before the House.  The House could suddenly discover that, while we had discussed a Bill with certain levels in it, when it came into operation in April its effects were completely different.  There is a provision that draft regulations covering any changes in future years would have to be laid before the House.</P>
      <P>There is this element of the three card trick.  The Minister is holding up a figure and saying &ldquo;There you see it.  It is 3.2 per cent from the employee and the upper income limit is £5,000.&rdquo;  Then he says &ldquo;Before this comes into operation on 1 April next I can shuffle the lot around.&rdquo;  If Deputies did not have to pay these rates, or if they did not read about the change in the newspapers, they might not even know that the rates and the upper limit had been varied within three months of the passing of the Bill.  I fail to understand why the Minister concedes in subsection (5) the right of the House to discuss any changes in succeeding years when he does not want any discussion on changes in the most important time of all, that is, during the transition from the stamp at a fixed rate to the concept of pay related with an upper ceiling provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister expects that between now and next April more up-to-date figures will be produced on average industrial earnings.  Almost certainly if they are produced, he will change the upper limit of £5,000.  The budget will be introduced next January and its effect on the income tax rate and on the economy generally may very well influence this Minister to change the rate he wishes to charge to employers and employees.  The <Col N="119" /> House will have passed the legislation on the basis of the figures contained in it, and we will have no further opportunity to discuss the changes the Minister may make between now and next April.</P>
    <P>I find that an unacceptable concept. That is why I put down this amendment and it should have been accepted by the Minister if he wants to follow through the spirit in section 5 which is amending section 6 of the 1952 Act.  At the very worst I would have thought regulations made under the section to which this amendment refers should have been laid before the House.  There does not appear to be any provision that the regulations made by the Minister prior to next April should ever be laid before the house.  I find that concept unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This section contains the kernel of the Bill.  It sets out to amend section 6 of the 1952 Act in its entirety. In subsection (1) (b) there is a reference to regulations to be made under section 12.  Those are the regulations which will introduce the rate to be charged to public servants.  On Second Stage we had a lengthy discussion about the fact that civil servants are covered for different benefits.  The bulk of them are covered for widow's pensions, deserted wife's benefit and death benefit.  Since the introduction of the concept that married women will be allowed to continue in the civil service, they have also been covered for the same benefits because the State has paid a contribution to itself, as it were, in respect of married and single women.  The female public servant has been covered for a range of benefits, widows and orphans pension, death benefit and deserted wife's benefit, without any contribution on her part. The only contribution which most of the female public servants make is 50p a week towards the health element of cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this system it appears that the males and females are going to be made pay the same figure so that the translation <Col N="120" /> of the male public servant's contribution into a pay related figure, which we have not yet heard and which the Minister was not able to give us clearly in the House when we discussed this on Second Stage, will also mean, if there is to be equal treatment, that the female public servant will, for the first time, be brought into the social insurance contribution net; and in return for being made pay what she does not have to pay at present she will be covered for only the same amount of cover as she already has.  It appears rather strange to be asking single female public servants to insure themselves for cover for widow's benefit, deserted wives benefit and death benefit which they could only become eligible for if they married and remained in insurable employment.  It appears to me to be rather strange to be asking them to pay a contribution in respect of that small amount of benefit.  I appreciate that single male public servants are only covered for the same figure.  But there is much more likelihood on their becoming married of their continuing in employment in the public sector for the remainder of their working life, whereas a high proportion of the single female public servants either resign on marriage or within a few years of it.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister made some effort to clarify these points.  When I suggested to the Minister that for the same amount of cover the voluntary contributors were apparently going to pay 1.7 per cent, he appeared to suggest that the female public servants who are covered for the same amount of benefits would have to pay 1.7 per cent. Presumably that 1.7 per cent of their reckonable earnings would be divided between employer and employee.  But the net fact still remains that the female public servant who up to this has not had to pay any social welfare contribution will now have to pay.  Indeed, she is one of the people being brought into the net to help to fund the entire changeover in the scheme.  It is important that the Minister should try to explain to the House what percentage rate of contribution he envisages in respect of the public servants generally and particularly in respect of the female public servants <Col N="121" /> who do not have to pay anything at all at present.</P>
    <P>That is the first very important point. There are other points which are quite separate but which relate to section 5 in different aspects of it.  I wonder would the Minister prefer if I made them all at the same time?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>At present people paying social welfare contributions by way of stamp pay them on a weekly basis so that both the employer and employees contribution is spread evenly over the 52 weeks of the year.  Even in the case where an employee is paid on a monthly or even on a six monthly basis the employer and employee are obliged to stamp cards on a weekly basis. Therefore, the income to the State comes in over 52 weeks and the contributions of the employee and employer are stopped over 52 weeks.</P>
      <P>In the proposed change over to a pay-related system, assuming for the moment that the Minister does not change the upper ceiling of £5,000 which I am quite certain he intends to change, the employee and employer will have to pay at certain rates until that rate, multiplied by whatever the upper ceiling is, is reached.  Consequently in certain cases employees and employers will have to pay in periods of far less than a year what should be the total twelve months' contribution into the social insurance fund.  That does not appear to be fair or equitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there is a provision in Britain whereby a person in these circumstances is allowed to have his contribution spread evenly over the entire contribution year.  I accept that the effect could be relatively marginal on the individual. Generally speaking we are talking about individuals who are on a higher income, so that the effect of having to contribute their 12 months social contribution in less than 12 months would not be a marked one for the employee, and I am not suggesting that. What I do want to point out is that this could have a very marked effect on employers who have a high number of <Col N="122" /> employees are earning above the upper income limit contained in the Minister's proposals, which is £5,000.  Certain large employers who have a high content of highly paid employees could discover their cash flow being interfered with because of the fact that in respect of any employee earning over £10,000 a year the employer would be required to pay the social welfare contribution over the first six months of the income tax year instead of over the 12 months of the contribution year as at present.  That is patently blatantly unfair to employers.  I am not suggesting that employers should be given any reduction in the amount they have to contribute but I am suggesting that in fairness to employers, and especially large employers who have a high content of highly paid employees, they should have the opportunity, if they so desire, of paying the employer's contribution evenly over the 12 month period.</P>
    <P>I suggested in one amendment, which was ruled out of order, that if an employee earning over £5,000 were to die during the year the full effect of the rate, multiplied by the sum, might not have been paid and so there would be a conceivable academic loss to the State in that regard.  Strictly speaking, that argument is correct, but it is a rather harsh interpretation of the situation.  I am making that same point now to the Minister and I hope he will deal with it in his reply. It is not that the State should be deprived of any money but in the case of highly paid employees the contributions should be, as they are at present, spread over the 12 months, not particularly from the employees point of view, because he is in the high income earning bracket, but from the employers point of view because there may be employers who have a large number of highly paid operatives.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make is that it is not at all clear in the definition of reckonable earnings what the effect of the rates charged will be.  There is a situation where certain enlightened employers who, although their employees by virtue of insurance cover are entitled to claim sickness benefit when their employees become ill still <Col N="123" /> continue to pay them the same amount of wages or salary as normally would have been paid.  There appears to be a danger that, when this Bill becomes law, that payment which the employer would make to his employee would be interpreted as reckonable earnings even though the employee was not working at the time.  Even though the employer pays his employee his weekly wages while he is sick the employer will still be expected to pay the social welfare contribution at whatever rate it is at the time on the money he pays to the employee in lieu of wages while that employee is ill.</P>
    <P>That is the purpose of amendment No. 2, which I accept can be described as having a potential charge on the Exchequer. I believe it is unfair to firms who pay their employees while they are ill if those firms are also expected to pay social welfare contributions in respect of the money they pay to their employees.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell the House that it is his intention to exclude, by regulation, any money so paid during the period when the employee is not actually in employment but is still receiving payment from his employer.  In relation to the amended section 6 of the 1952 Act, paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) set out the varying rates which are to be collected from voluntary contributors. Would the Minister please explain what the different voluntary contributors will be covered for in return for the individual rates specified in those three paragraphs?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of points of some significance in relation to the administration of this new system.  The first is the change in regard to female, feminine or women civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Which sort?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Feminine, female or women civil servants.  I believe there is no argument against bringing female civil servants into this new system.  Most Deputies are aware of the history of the situation.  Formerly, female pensionable public servants were relieved of the <Col N="124" /> obligation to pay the employee's share of their contribution in 1956 on the grounds that the majority of them were single and they were required to resign on marriage and consequently could not qualify for widow's contributory pension under the conditions then applicable. However, that position changed since the removal of the marriage bar in 1973 and the introduction of a lifetime average test for widow's pension. Women can qualify for a widow's pension now either on their own or their husband's insurance.  The insurance of men and women civil servants, with the disappearance of the marriage bar, have equal value for widow's pension.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Boland's argument that a lot of those civil servants may leave the service and, therefore, should not have to make this contribution is not really valid because with the way our social structures and employment structures are moving today there is every possibility that if a lot of those women leave the civil service on marriage or shortly after marriage, in the normal course of events they will probably take up other employment.  It is, therefore a good thing from their point of view that they should be brought inside the insurance net on those general grounds apart from the fact that any of them who wish to do so may now remain on in the civil service for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of it which from the practical point of view is the compelling argument, which is that the EEC directive on equal treatment for men and women in social security will require equality in contribution liability. This new directive will have, from the point of view of women, a number of positive things as far as any discrimination against them in regard to benefits will have to be slowly eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows yesterday the Council settled on six years for this process to take place.  The directive also has the other side to it, namely, that women have to have equality in so far as access and contribution <Col N="125" /> liability is concerned.  I do not believe we could, even if we wanted to, exclude women civil servants from paying the same contribution as men in future.  I believe, in practical terms, that would end the argument even if there were other considerations involved.  The other considerations which I have mentioned apply.  I believe the contribution rates, as Deputy Boland suspects, will be about 1.7 per cent in total of which the employer will pay 1.2 per cent and the employee .5 per cent, the same as men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment the situation the Deputy is describing for me and asking me to say is unfair is the sort of situation which applies right through the whole welfare insurance world and is one of the things that arising out of the directive yesterday we will have to deal with in a very comprehensive fashion. We will have to ensure that any rights or benefits applicable to men will be equally applicable to women in their own right. We will also have to ensure in future that we cannot incur the burden of duplication and that we cannot have married people drawing benefits in respect of each other or both parents drawing in <Col N="126" /> respect of the same children.  All those things will have to be teased out now and that, perhaps, is also the sort of thing which could be dealt within that context.  The simple compulsion at the moment is that these female civil servants are entitled to these limited benefits in their own right, the same as men, and therefore it is reasonable that they should contribute a limited amount.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that on the non-existent Labour benches there is an incipient demand that the public service as a whole be brought into full insurance cover.  The Deputy's Labour colleagues are going in the opposite direction from the one he suggests I go.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the point about trying to make provision for a person who is in permanent stable employment and who goes over the limit in one year and is therefore almost certain to be over it the following year and said he should be entitled to have his payments fixed for the following year, spread over 50 or 12 equal instalments.  There are many arguments against that.  It would have to be of universal application.  It would be quite inconceivable administratively to restrict it to people who are in permanent stable employment and unlikely to be leaving that employment the following year.  If it was fixed on that basis, there could be situations where people would leave employment before the full amount was paid in the following year, and to that extent the fund would be at a loss.  Apart from that, it is not acceptable in principle.  The principle is that we go over to cumulative pay-related contributions. Each instalment of income attracts the pay-related contribution.  What Deputy Boland is suggesting would depart in principle from that.  It would be going back to a flat rate contribution system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further factor in the situation is that PAYE and existing pay-related contributions are deducted on the basis which is enshrined in the legislation, namely, each instalment of income, weekly or monthly, attracting its appropriate percentage deduction.  This new system, if it is to work, must fit in with PAYE and the existing pay-related scheme.  If it is to fit into this structure, each weekly <Col N="127" /> or monthly instalment as it is paid, must attract its pay-related contribution on that amount.</P>
    <P>Even if it were acceptable in principle, and it is not for the reasons I have outlined, and even if it were acceptable administratively, and it is not for the reasons I have given, I do not think the disadvantages involved for either the employee or the employer would justify us making the change.  I do not think that the disadvantage to the employer or employee is of such an overwhelming nature that we could depart from our principle or that we should interfere with our administrative efficiency to cope with it.  It is not of such significance in the scheme of things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The same arguments apply here.  Disability benefit is out. What the Deputy is referring to are oc-cupational schemes in which sick pay is paid outside the social welfare scheme. There is no option but to include it, whatever the desirability socially of excluding it might be.  Payments of sick pay under occupational schemes are included for PAYE and pay-related benefits and have to be included for this purpose.  In my view there is no unfairness involved in including them. They are gross earnings.  To exclude <Col N="128" /> them could distort the picture of gross earnings throughout the year.  It would be entirely different if disability benefit were included.  I cannot see that there is any justifiable reason for excluding sick pay under occupational schemes, but even if there were, it would be very difficult for us to do this administratively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that if a firm decide to pay an employee while he is sick, or in the case which I would have instanced in my amendment had it been allowed, if a man is in receipt of disability benefit, the State would regard those payments as money earned by the employee for performing a service for his employer and the employer and employee would be expected to make a contribution in respect of those payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way it is at present under PAYE and pay-related. There is no change in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the way it is at present under the insurance stamp.  If a person is receiving a payment out of the State insurance fund, his card is marked with a credited contribution in respect of the period for which he receives payments from the State because he is ill or disabled.  Under this changed situation, while he might be paid by the State because he is not able to work, if his employer is enlightened enough to pay him the equivalent of his wages, the employer will have to make a contribution to social insurance fund.  He has to pay insurance for a man who is being paid his wages while he is sick and who is also paid by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference in principle.  The flat rate system is a different system and did not lend itself to any adaptability.  We are going over to the pay-related concept.  What we are proposing applies in relation to PAYE and pay-related benefit.  We are following that idea.  Why should sick pay not be included in a man's gross earnings? He gets sick pay because he is an employee.  It is an obligation his employer has to him as a result of that scheme.  The disability benefit does not <Col N="129" /> count.  That is still looked on separately. In so far as there is an addition to income in this way, it attracts the appropriate pay-related contributions. Otherwise, the Deputy will admit, the person who is in employment which had not got an occupational scheme would be treated relatively unfairly.  As I said, I do not think there is any element of unfairness in this proposal, particularly as it just follows on what has been established in relation to pay-related benefit in particular.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>At present there are three separate categories of voluntary contributors, each paying a different flat rate contribution.  The first category comprises persons insured for old age contributory pension, retirement pension, death grant, widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit.  The rate of contribution in that case will be 4.4 per cent under the new system.</P>
      <P>The second category have cover for widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit only.  Their contribution will be 1.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>The third category is comprised of persons who on 31 March 1974 were voluntary contributors at the higher rate but who on the abolition of the income limit for social insurance purposes became compulsorily insurable, but for widows and orphans pensions only because they are employed in the public sector.  They were allowed to continue as voluntary contributors for old age contributory pension, retirement pension and death grant.  This was to preserve their acquired rights to those benefits as well as being insured compulsorily for widows and orphans pensions and deserted wife's benefit.  In their case the new income-related voluntary contribution will be 2.7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been through all this carefully and the Minister has confirmed <Col N="130" /> everything I said on Second Stage.  When the Bill was introduced the Minister said it would not have the effect of bringing in any additional revenue to the State coffers.  He told us that he had been anxious to change over from the flat rate to the pay-related system in as equitable a way as possible so that the State did not stand to benefit in any way. In his reply today the Minister has proved conclusively, first, that the rates set out and the upper income limit provided for in section 5 may be varied between now and 1 April, the date on which the Bill is to come into operation. Therefore, the House will not have any opportunity of discussing any variation upwards in the rates that may be imposed on employer and employee. Neither will the House have an opportunity of discussing any upper ceiling that may be placed on incomes and which would affect the amount to be paid both by employer and employee.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have shown that the female public servant is insured, at no cost to her, for a small amount of benefit.  The State pays for that insurance enjoyed by the female employee even if she has only a notional idea of ever benefiting from it.  However, from 1 April next she will have to pay for that insurance.  We do not know how much she will be asked to pay but between her contribution and that of the State the total amount should be 1.7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, there is the person on a high income who now pays his contribution during a 12-month period but who under the new system will have to pay during a six-month period because of the change in the pay-related system.  His employer, too, will have to pay his contribution towards the employee's insurance in a six-month rather than a 12-month period. Anyone earning more than £5,000 per year will find that both he and his employer will have to pay the social welfare contribution during whatever period in the year the £5,000 is earned. Therefore, people earning £10,000, for example, will pay their contributions in the six months instead of in 12 months and, more importantly, their employers will have to pay the higher rate during a six-month period.  The result of this will <Col N="131" /> be manifested in the effect on the cash flow of the firm employing a large number of highly-paid people and such people are usually skilled operatives or people in senior management positions. In other words, they are people who are vitally important to the generation of growth and the production of further employment opportunities.  Because of this change it can be seen that the State will not be providing any encouragement or any incentive to employers to engage highly-skilled people; and these are the same people who when the Health Bill is introduced will find that they are to lose some of their health benefits.</P>
    <P>In addition&mdash;and this is the part I find most difficult to understand&mdash;there is the position of an employer who at present pays an employee when he is sick what are commonly known as wages but which are the equivalent of his wages although the employee is not producing any benefit for the employer.  In such cases the employer does not have to pay social welfare insurance in respect of the employee but there is a credit contribution recorded on the card instead of a stamp.  Such enlightened employers will now have to pay to the employee the same percentage of the money as would have to be paid if the man had been in gainful employment.  The State is forcing that employer to pay into the Social Insurance Fund and the employee will be deriving the benefit of the State payment by virtue of being covered by social insurance. There is no incentive in such a situation for an employer to pay an employee during a time of sickness.  The Minister told us when the Bill was introduced that it would not have the effect of penalising anyone, whether employer or employee, and that the legislation would not bring in any additional money to the State.  However, I have outlined three areas where additional money will accrue to the State.</P>

The terms of these regulations will be broadly similar to the present ones.  Under these regulations the principal employer, and not the immediate employer, will be treated as the employer.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, noting with grave concern the cutback by the Government on its effective capital provision for Local Authority housing, its failure to control the recent excessive increases in the price of housing, and its lack of action to control the cost of housing land, calls upon the Government to take effective measures, including legislative action, to control the price of housing land.</P>
      <P>It is easy sometimes to indulge in playing politics on the question of housing. We do so at the cost of the people who throng the queues looking for loans from building societies or who repeatedly call upon local authorities looking for some form of hope that they will provide what the United Nations has declared to be a basic human right.  This is the first debate effectively on housing since the Estimate for the Environment. The purpose of the motion is to examine the state of housing as of now and, in so far as any Opposition Deputy or, indeed, the spokesperson for the Opposition is forced to frame such a debate in the form of a motion such as this, so be it.  It is not my intention to try to score cheap political points and I have no wish to do so.  On a personal note, I am sorry to hear the Minister is unable to be present with us.  That is in no way a reflection on the Minister of State, whose presence is indeed welcomed, but I think all of us wish the Minister well in his present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having made those introductory remarks one may ask why have the Labour Party sought a debate on housing <Col N="138" /> at this moment.  We put down the motion in response to a specific request by the administrative council of our own party, the national executive, because of the express concern about housing prices that has repeatedly come through the ranks, so to speak, from all sectors of the community.  That concern is reflected in the official statistics that have been published.  Indeed, earlier today at Question Time the Minister of State referred to some of them.  The fact of the matter is that in the last year housing prices have increased by 34 per cent whereas building prices have increased by little more than 9 or 10 per cent and so there is an inflationary increase above and beyond the easily recognisable and understandable increase of approximately 24 per cent.</P>
    <P>Now the purpose of the debate is to focus in on the causes for that increase and see if there is any way in which we can mitigate, reduce or eliminate the factors which have produced that 24 per cent net increase in the coming months and in the coming year.  It is seldom Opposition Deputies get their case put forward so eloquently and so pungently by an objectively established and, indeed, State-funded body, the Economic and Social Research Institute.  The whole economic analysis of what has gone wrong in the housing market as expressed in a gut sense by members of the Administrative Council of the Labour Party is expressed in economic jargon and parlance by Messrs. J. Durkin and P.J. Menton in the quarterly economic commentary published by the Institute for September 1978.  One could simply read out the appendix on the housing market entitled &ldquo;The Housing Market.  Some aspects&rdquo; and make the case without going any further.  I would like to draw attention now to one or two salient features that must be brought to public attention.  I believe the Fianna Fáil Party bought the last election.  Nothing particularly wrong with that if you happen to come up with 84 seats.  I believe that when they went to the polls in 1977 the punters realised they were in a sense being bought and many of them were prepared to be taken for the ride.  What I am sure they did not know was the cost of that ride.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> Earlier today the cost of the abolition of domestic rates given by way of reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Noel Browne was estimated at £78 million, if my memory serves me aright, and I was prompted to make the observation that it approximated to virtually £1 million a seat for the Taoiseach and his 83 Deputies.  That is just the cost of the abolition of rates.  But I was wrong.  The cost was more because not only did the abolition of domestic rates cost the Exchequer that much, an Exchequer it is now claimed is no longer in funds, but according to this document the abolition of rates and the manner in which they were abolished was a contributory factor, among others, to increasing the cost of housing above and beyond the building costs index I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>To summarise what Messrs. Durkin and Menton have said &mdash; I will not bore the House by quoting extensively &mdash; they claim that the combined effect of the £1,000 grant, plus the abolition of domestic rates, plus the increase in funds into building societies brought about in part as a result of the tax concessions in the 1977 February budget, the last budget of the Coalition Government, which, if I may jog memory, reduced maximum income tax levels from 79 per cent to 60 per cent and consequently made available more funds for building societies with a consequent flow of money into building societies, the combination of these three factors bunched, to use their own phrase, demand in the latter half of 1977 and through into 1978.</P>
    <P>What, in effect, did that mean?  It bunched demand at a time when housing supply had dropped to a lower level of production due to the cyclical nature of the housing market and the housing construction market and also because of the aftermath of the depression.  By bunching demand &mdash; the word &ldquo;bunched&rdquo; is the economic phrase chosen by these two eminent economists &mdash; means in effect that the latter part of 1978 normal housing demand and the early part of the 1979 normal housing demand was bunched into the early part <Col N="140" /> of this Government's term of office with the effect of calling in advance of the money being available housing capital to pay off election debts in the real sense, the net effect of which was that the cost of housing zoomed way up above and beyond the real increase in building costs.</P>
    <P>A Government that came to office on the promise of providing a £1,000 grant, a promise of abolishing domestic rates forthwith, presumably on the advice of the think tanks and economic back-up services and all the other acoutrements that belong to a majority party, effectively in the assessment of these economists did more damage to the cost of housing provision than they did good.</P>
    <P>That may be considered to be a partisan view and certainly prior to the publication of this particular document it could be dismissed as a partisan view but it can no longer be dismissed as a purely political party partisan view.  It has the imprimatur of being paid for by the very Government itself.  That is the verdict of State finance-funded economists of the Economic and Social Research Institute.  If the Minister of State or any of his colleagues, who are notably absent tonight, want to pursue that all the quotations are there.  All the flesh to the bones of the argument I have made is contained in this particular document.</P>
    <P>I will be happy in my reply to refer to any criticisms that may be made of that overall conclusion.  From the sanctity of Trinity College economic common rooms, I can already hear the voices saying &ldquo;So what?  We brought forward housing demand.  We boosted housing output in the last quarter of 1977 which already had been falling in the first quarter.  We generated new confidence in the housing sector of the economy&rdquo; and so on.  These would be the objective and somewhat distant distilled comments of people who view housing from the sanctity of such a common room and the security of their own homes.  But what has been the real impact of such bunching?</P>
    <P>As far as this party are concerned, the impact is on the people who are most in <Col N="141" /> need of housing, because they do not have the economic resources to be able to play around in the market like so many others, the people who because of the economic system in which we live are forced to rely on local authorities to meet their statutory obligation to provide housing.  They are the people who will carry the cost of this election gambit.  They are the people who carry the effective cost of this economic and political strategy which has been described as the bunching of demand, or in more gut terms, the buying of elections. In a circular produced by the Department of the Environment, reference No. H37/78 published on 31 August of this year the Minister states in the second paragraph that the public capital programme allocation in 1978 is to be £80.77 million, but that more than £100 million could have been required if local authorities had been allowed to go ahead with what housing schemes they proposed to commence.  They did not get the extra £20 million.  Why did they not get the extra £20 million?  They could have spent it, the demand was there, and there are homeless people in every local authority housing area.  The local authorities with their public representatives and their professional managerial assistants sought an allocation of £100 million to meet some of that demand and they were turned down and given £80 million.</P>
    <P>Earlier today the Minister for State attempted to suggest that, having asked for £100 million and been given £80 million, they were reasonably satisfied. Neither I nor the Minister can answer for local authorities, who can make their voices heard when they want to, but as a public representative in Dublin city in a borough that has had an increase in the housing demand&mdash;the waiting list has jumped from 6,000 applicants to 8,000 applicants&mdash;I would say that if the Minister presumes that that is reasonably satisfactory then we live in a different world.</P>
    <P>Housing costs have undoubtedly gone up.  Ironically, one of the factors that contributed to the increase in housing costs was the spending spree of this Government.  As a direct consequence of <Col N="142" /> that spending spree people who are incapable by virtue of our economic system of economically entering into the housing market have been deprived of capital funds in order to finance that spending spree.  When one thinks over the implications of that, the attitude of this Government to housing needs begins to come into focus with a horrible stark reality.  One can reasonably assume that the cost of financing the abolition of car tax, for instance, was something in the region of £55 million.  It was certainly more than £20 million.  So not only have the Government's spending spree of bunching demand resulted in an increase in the cost of housing, but one of the most vulnerable sectors that has had to pay the cost of that spending spree has been the sector that depends on local authorities for housing.</P>
    <P>There is nothing unique or special about local authority housing that makes it so that everyone should have to aspire to a local authority house or should have to depend on a local authority to provide housing.  The historical reason for the existence of local authority housing is as much a commentary on the failure of our economic system to provide housing as it is upon anything else.  Certainly, no housing policy can be designed purely with the local authority housing sector in mind.  While the local authorities must get adequate funds to meet their obligations nobody on this side of the House regards the local authorities as being the prime movers in terms of housing provision.</P>
    <P>The last Coalition Government, in particular the last Minister for Local Government, made a special effort in local authority housing to such an extent that both the White and the Green Papers recognised that demand in certain areas had been largely satisfied in terms of gross need.  On the case that the local authority housing sector has been deprived of essential capital funds irrespective of whatever cash increase the Minister may announce later tonight as evidence of increased allocations, the reality is that, as a percentage of overall provision, the numbers and amounts <Col N="143" /> have been dropping and&mdash;much more to the point, because talking of percentages of GNP or overall budgets and so on may be ways in which we can interpret reality differently depending upon our debating viewpoint&mdash;the most important criterion at the end of the day is the number of houses provided or in real terms the number of people who are asked by their local authority to come in and sign for a house.  It is not from the mouths of the Opposition that that expression of disappointment come on that score; it comes, essentially, from the Minister.  He expressed disappointment at the number of completions when he opened a local authority housing scheme recently.</P>
    <P>There are contributing factors above and beyond the ones for which the Minister and the Government are directly responsible and it would be unfair of me not to recognise them.  There are difficulties related to weather, the completion of contracts on time and the scarcity of skilled labour.  However, they are not new.  Indeed, the first quarter of 1977 was a severe period in terms of building output and it was recognised as such by Opposition speakers here.  In so far as the Government are directly responsible, the Minister has given the verdict: disappointment in that sector. The local authority sector in good years covers approximately one-third of the overall housing need with the remainder being met by the private sector.  The Government have entered into a new form of Celtic mysticism in their naïve belief in the capacity of the private sector to stand on its head and deliver things for which it was not designed or produce things which it has no capacity to produce.  In the area of housing the private sector has been designated by the Government as the specific engine by which the demand which would otherwise have been satisfied by some local authorities can be amply satisfied.  The economic commentary I referred to dealt at length with the analysis of how building society funds have been distributed between the private sector, disregarding local authority funds.  The conclusion points <Col N="144" /> to the fact that within the private sector the people with high incomes, or, alternatively, those selling their first house and buying another, were benefiting most from the combination of Government policies.  I should like to quote further from that report:</P>
    <P>Even allowing for a substantial increase in incomes over the period of analysis there can be little doubt that the proportion of mortgages going to those on higher incomes did increase. The reasons for this could be twofold (i) because of house price increases only those on higher incomes could finance sufficiently large mortgages or (ii) that an upward quality shift in the demand for houses did in fact take place.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons why such a shift should have taken place:</P>
    <P>(1)  the reduction of the higher marginal rates of taxation in 1977 would have enabled many on above average incomes to finance greatly increased mortgages.</P>
    <P>(2)  the shortage of land in the outer Dublin area and the land price escalation could have given impetus to builders to build expensive houses.</P>
    <P>(3)  the high level of savings, and high inflows into building societies in 1976-77 implied that mortgage finance was not a constraint.</P>
    <P>(4)  by building more expensive houses, builders could avoid the need for a certificate of reasonable value.</P>
    <P>(5)  the abolition of rates, would have given an impetus to the price of secondhand houses especially and also, as it increased the real disposable income of such householders, could also have encouraged tradingup.</P>
    <P>That list of factors indicates to anybody who knows the housing market how complex and variable it is.  I do not wish to make a simplistic argument but I do have constraints at times.</P>
    <P>I have just given a combination of reasons why, all other things being equal, the people who have benefited from the Government's housing policy have not been those in the lower income <Col N="145" /> group, those who are just off the local authority housing lists and moving into the middle income sector.  They have not benefited from the effects of the Govern-ment's housing policy and the verdict is contained in the report I quoted from.  I should like to deal with one of the reasons referred to, certificates of reasonable value.  This factor has given continual cause for stress and concern within the industry.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we believe in the principle of the CRVs.  We recognise that Fianna Fáil&mdash;Deputy Molloy was the Minister responsible for its introduction&mdash;brought about the implementation of this scheme.  However, we are also aware of serious expressions of concern about its administration.  We cannot reconcile how the Government, com-posed of a party who depend so much on private enterprise to fulfil the housing needs in this area and who have publicly identified themselves with the private house building sector, have got themselves into a position of total confrontation with that sector over the question of CRVs.</P>
    <P>The CIF have indicated that builders are frustrated and dissatisfied with the operation of the CRV system and have been since the outset.  I should like to discount those people who do not like any form of scrutiny; they are not in the race as far as I am concerned.  I am concerned about the serious house builders, those on whom the Minister depends for performance.  Some officials of the CIF have responsibly spoken on their behalf and not on behalf of the cowboys.  On 14 September last the federation stated that as early as 1973 it voiced its concern at the manner in which the CRV system was operated, which was contrary to the assurances given to the industry.  The federation pointed out that it had continually advocated changes in the system to make it easier to operate without in any way lessening the control which the Department wished to exercise.  It said it repeatedly advised the Department officials that a no-change policy would force the house builder out of this system and reduce the number of new houses being built at the lower end of the market, for the first time buyer.  The federation stated that the reaction to this <Col N="146" /> advice from the industry had been to ignore it with the result that an inadequate number of new houses at prices which young married couples could afford were being built.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to an article by Eithne Ryan in <i>Business and Finance</i> of 28 September which reinforces this view. She stated that the builders' dissatisfaction with the CRV had caused many of them who would prefer to build a small house to turn instead to the more expensive house and sell outside the grant.  She said that this had resulted in small pockets of land in good residential areas becoming greatly overpriced.  A builder summed up the situation when he said that he was building houses for £45,000 but the price of the house was directly related to the price of the land.  He said he paid £20,000 for the site and had that land been priced at £5,000, which would have been more correct, the house would be selling for £30,000.  The kernel of the problem is that there are not sufficient serviced sites.</P>
    <P>There are many other illustrations one could provide in relation to the question of housing finance and housing costs and I could go into them, but I do not wish to do so because I do not have time.  I have tried to show the connection between election promises and the amount of money that was made available which had the effect of bunching demand.  That bunch demand, coupled with a number of other factors &mdash; largely the taxation deductions on personal income tax in 1977 which were welcomed by all sides &mdash; produced a phenomenon where demand was pumped up at a time when building societies had enough money to provide it.  The net effect has been an astronomical increase in the cost of housing.  That effect has been financed in part by public expenditure in the form of tax giveaways and the people who have had to carry that cost in part have been local authorities and they have been encouraged to push those people whom they reasonably can push on to the private sector of housing and off the local authority list.</P>
    <P>I am trying to show clearly that the combined effects of 18 months in office <Col N="147" /> of this administration has made it more difficult for a young married couple to buy their house than it was on 20 May when the election goodies were unveiled and the promises were put out for offer on the stalls of the Fianna Fáil Party then in Opposition.  I believe that if many of the young people who bought that particular pig-in-the-poke had been aware of the real cost of housing or if many of their parents had been aware of the real cost implications of that pig-in-the-poke the decision of June 1977 might have been different.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State may argue with some of my figures and some of my conclusions and he will certainly dismiss the political bias that by definition must be on this side of the House.  I accept that, but at the end of the day he cannot deny that housing costs have gone up and raced ahead of costs in either the overall consumer index or the overall building costs index.  He may dismiss my arguments as partisan but he cannot reasonably dismiss the arguments of Mr. Durkan or Mr. Menton as partisan because they are not.  It is in the interests of a democracy like ours that we have institutions such as the ESRI and others that have maintained their autonomy and are notably free from interference by either side of the House.</P>
    <P>I should like to devote my remaining time to identifying the sectors that they have identified as being some of the factors that have resulted in the increase in the cost of housing.  They have produced, I may add, a number of proposals for mitigating the current problems such as subsidising the cost of mortgages, reducing the liability ratio of building societies and making more money available for the SDA sector.  I am sure the Minister is aware of all of these.  They are options which fall within his administrative grasp.  I should be very surprised if he does not take up the liquidity option which seems to be the softest and the most obvious one.  I should like to know from the Minister what action, if any, he proposes to take to deal with the problem of the provision of serviced building sites.</P>
    <P>In answer to a question I put to the <Col N="148" /> Minister's colleague, Deputy Barrett, which was answered on 12 October, I sought to discover the number of housing sites available and in ownership of local authorities.  I was given a very staggering figure which I think in housing circular 37/78 is given as something in the region of 76,000 sites.  In my naïevity&mdash;I am still serving my apprenticeship here&mdash;I did not distinguish between sites and serviced sites. Therefore, I should like to know how many serviced sites local authorities have as distinct from housing sites since the figures may very well differ.</P>
    <P>Aside from the question of local authority houses, it is clearly indicated that there is a considerable land bank in absolute terms if these figures can be taken as accurate&mdash;and I have no reason to think they are not.  The question remains: what action will be taken by the Government to see that house prices generally are stabilised and, specifically, the price of land?  First, have they any legislative proposals in train&mdash;by that I do not mean under review&mdash;that would give effect to the Kenny Report, that would change the basis of the compulsory order legislation that we have at present and change the basis for valuation of land acquired under CPO procedures or in any other way intervene in the housing market to the extent that the land factor as the dominant cost in the provision of housing would be mitigated?</P>
    <P>Numerous other studies have clearly shown that unless some action is taken to stabilise the cost of land&mdash;serviced building sites&mdash;the bunching of demand in the housing sector for electoral purposes or otherwise will simply exaggerate the cyclical profile of the house building industry with consequent damage first, to the industry itself&mdash;I speak in a certain sense as a person who still has an interest in it.  It has suffered considerably from such cycles.  The land is a key factor and the wording of our resolution, having condemned the Government roundly, as is the formula in such motions, specifically asks what effective measures the Government will take, including legislative action, to control the price of housing land.  We have <Col N="149" /> identified the need to deal with housing land, that is serviced building sites, if some effective attempt is to be made to break the cycle of boom and depression in this area.  The Kenny Report has set out that the key to stabilising house prices is stabilisation of land prices by the provision of a substantial number of serviced sites.  By substantial is meant sufficient to influence the market price of all land for housing.  This is a difficult task to achieve when there is a high level of demand for land for other necessary economic purposes.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, there is no simplistic solution to this problem.  The components of the cost of the provision of housing are complex and highly varied. We recognise that, and we recognise that the housing sector of the construction industry is prone to extremes and high risk in terms of credit squeezes and booms and so on.  Perhaps in isolation it is the most extreme example of the absurdity and irrationality of the capitalist system of economic development and growth. No other system or sub-system mirrors the waste and irrationality better than that sector.  As a capitalist party, there is a limit to what the Government can do. We do not expect real solutions from Fianna Fáil.  Having quoted the quarterly review and other commentaries, we want to know what decisive legislative action the Government will undertake to undo the damage that has been done by them in their first 18 months in office.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes with approval the action taken by the Government to increase housing output, including the provision for this purpose of unprecedented amounts of public funds, and the measures which it has taken to curb the rate at which housing costs, including the cost of building land, have been increasing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I should like to express to Deputy Quinn my appreciation for his <Col N="150" /> kind remarks regarding the Minister for the Environment.  I know that all fairminded Deputies will share his hope that the Minister will be back shortly to serve the Oireachtas and his Department.</P>
    <P>While I disagree with many of the Deputy's contentions and must question the accuracy of some figures and estimates he quoted, I appreciate the constructive and restrained manner in which he put his case.  The one regret is that the Deputy did not have a better case to plead.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with each of the three points raised in the motion, to demonstrate how ill-conceived they are, particularly with regard to the record of those Deputies subscribing to it who had it in their own power as members of the previous Coalition Government to deal with a situation similar to that which their motion alleges to exist now.</P>
    <P>The first statement made in the motion criticises the cutback by the Government in the capital provision for local authority housing.  Are the Deputies opposite serious and honest in this?  Under the Coalition's last budget, in 1977, less than £72 million was provided for local authority housing. The policy to run down the local authority housing programme was by then well established&mdash;8,794 dwellings were completed in 1975, 7,263 in 1976, but only 6,333 in 1977, a direct consequence of the inadequate capital allocations made by the former Government for social housing.  The 1978 Budget raised the allocation for this purpose from £71.7 million spent in the preceeding year to practically £81 million which, together with the normal 10 per cent overdraft working margin which local authorities are allowed to use, represents a gross provision of £88.85 million in the current year, an increase which certainly more than offset the rising costs of building.</P>
    <P>The Government have made a further practical move to help persons on local authority waiting lists by assigning a total of £5.9 million to fund low rise mortgages this year, a move which will help tenants of local authority houses or people on waiting lists to become homeowners, thereby easing the burden on <Col N="151" /> local authorities of direct house building and speeding up the rehousing of other families on waiting lists.  This provision of practically £6 million compares with a total of £2.1 million advanced under the mortgage scheme in 1977.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested from time to time, and indeed in this House, that the present Government have a bias against local authority housing.  This is absolutely false.  The Government's basic housing policy was spelled out over nine years ago in the 1969 White Paper, &ldquo;Housing in the Seventies&rdquo;.  That document set out clearly our fundamental objective to ensure that every family should be helped to get a proper house of their own at a cost or a rent they could afford.  That is still our basic housing aim.  A person who can afford to build or buy a house for himself receives every encouragement&mdash;a grant of £1,000, exemption from stamp duty and rates and the availability of adequate mortgage finance, including a total of £39 million provided under the public capital programme for house purchase loans this year by local authorities.  At the same time, the Government have never varied their commitment to ensure that a family in genuine need of housing should not be debarred from getting it by reason only of their limited financial resources.  This commitment is reflected in the big increase in the allocation for local authority housing in the current year.</P>
    <P>Figures give a more incontrovertible picture of what has been done than mere words or opinions.  Under the Coalition's last budget, introduced early in 1977, a total of £99.13 million capital was provided for all forms of housing activity&mdash;house purchase and reconstruc-tion loans, housing grants and local authority dwellings.  In spite of rapidly rising costs at the time, this was a reduction of more than £6 million on the 1976 budget provision of approximately £105 million.  The present Government increased the 1978 budget provision over that inadequate total for 1977 by more than 40 per cent&mdash;from £99 million to more than £140 million.  I ask Deputies if it is not just naïve, but downright dishonest, <Col N="152" /> then for the sponsors of the motion to refer to a cutback by the present Government in their capital provision for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>There are a few other facts and figures which must be put on the record of the Dáil in relation to this motion.  When the Coalition were dismissed from office in the 1977 general election there were, at the end of May, some 29,496 local authority houses in course of construction, in tenders, or being planned.  This represented a considerable drop on the 34,854 houses at a similar stage two years earlier.  By comparison with the May 1977 figure, a total of 32,088 dwellings were being built or planned or at the tender stage at 30 September 1978. The number of men employed on local authority housing schemes was 6,174 at the end of May 1977.  By September last, the total was 6,550.  This is one of the best indicators of trends in the amount of work actually in progress at these two dates.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I would be less than frank if I did not admit that I have been disappointed myself with the level of local authority house completions so far this year.  This, I want to make clear, has had nothing to do with any shortage of capital for the programme.  Weather conditions in the early part of the year slowed down the programme and industrial problems in recent months, the scarcity of certain skilled tradesmen and some important building materials also have had a limiting effect on house completions, as on all other branches of building and construction.  Housing authorities estimated some weeks ago that they would complete about 6,500 houses this year.  I would be glad to see their expectations realised but, because of the factors outside my control and which I have mentioned, completions will probably be no greater than in 1977. However, we go into 1979 with a good programme of work in progress, in tenders or being planned and with an adequate work force employed.  In that year the Government are committed to maintaining a local authority housing programme designed to meet genuine housing needs and to maintain a steady rate of progress and employment.  The <Col N="153" /> capital to be provided in the 1979 public capital programme will once again give evidence of the Government's firm intentions to achieve their housing objectives.</P>
    <P>In short, I can assure the House that the local authority housing programme is at a satisfactory level.  There is no basis for the claim in the motion that the authorities have been left short of the necessary capital resources.  The situation in reality is that most authorities have never been so well funded and, indeed, generally, no authority have been short of capital for their housing programme in the current year.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion seeks to indict the Government for failing to control what it terms &ldquo;the recent excessive increases in the price of housing&rdquo;. Members opposite would have the public convinced that the Government are unconcerned about increases in house prices; indeed some Deputies have tried to give the impression that we are prepared to live with a situation of escalating house prices without taking any corrective action.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  In fact, our record in this area of house price controls contrasts favourably with that of the Coalition Government under whose four years of administration, average house prices rose by an unprecedented 113.5 per cent&mdash;including a staggering increase of 36 per cent in the cost of house building in their first year of office.</P>
    <P>When we resumed office in July 1977, we found that the controls on new house prices, as operated by means of the certificate of reasonable value system, which the previous Fianna Fáil Government had introduced in February 1973, had not been strengthened, contrary to what should have been expected after a period of rapid price escalation.  Indeed, the controls had, if anything, been considerably weakened by the drastic curtailment in 1976 of the new house grants scheme.  Concerned that the situation had been allowed to drift without any Government direction for four crucial years and also because he was aware that the introduction of the £1,000 grant could, in the absence of suitable controls, be inflationary, my Government <Col N="154" /> and the Minister immediately extended the CRV system to all grant type new houses provided for sale and also to flats.  Previously houses in schemes of three or less and all flats were exempt from the controls.</P>
    <P>I have been keeping the trends in house prices under regular review for more than a year past.  When statistics for the second quarter of this year became available they indicated that the average price of houses for which loans were advanced by the lending agencies were increasing more rapidly than building costs, although not as seriously as a superficial examination of the figures might suggest.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for me to emphasise this point.  Deputies quote freely from the statistics of average house prices shown in tables 19 and 19A of my Department's Quarterly Bulletin, but, where this suits their argument, they completely disregard the warning at the back of the tables that the houses concerned are not necessarily comparable from quarter to quarter or from area to area.  This applies particularly in areas where the number of loans approved in a quarter may be small and the average prices are influenced significantly by individual housing schemes.</P>
    <P>Subject to this caveat, I was satisfied that there was evidence, particularly in the first half of 1978, to suggest that the increase in average house prices was due to a tendency for builders to move up the market and to provide larger and more expensive houses than normal grant-type dwellings, thus avoiding the CRV controls.</P>
    <P>A significant development was the fact that the average price for CRV houses had, for the second quarter in succession, shown a rate of increase only two-thirds that of all new house prices.  It was against this background that the Government decided in August 1978 to request building societies, who provide the big majority of mortgage funds, to apportion their available loan money on the basis that at least 60 per cent of the total funds available for mortgages should be allocated for house purchasers whose mortgage requirements do not exceed £13,000 each; at least a further 20 <Col N="155" /> per cent of the funds should be allocated in providing mortgages to house purchasers whose requirements lie between £13,000 and £16,000 each; CRVs be furnished by all applicants for mortgages not exceeding £16,000 for the purchase of new dwellings; and that the apportionment of loans as between new and previously-occupied houses should be maintained at the levels then current.</P>
    <P>The Government decision, which is effective until 31 March 1979, was taken with a view to ensuring that the available moneys should finance the purchase of the greatest feasible number of reasonably-priced houses and, at the same time, that all purchasers of new houses with loans under £16,000 would be assured of getting reasonable value for their investment.</P>
    <P>These measures are already showing results&mdash;for example, figures to be published shortly in my Department's Quarterly Bulletin of Housing Statistics will show that the average gross price of new houses for which loans were approved by the main lending agencies in the quarter ended 30 September 1978 increased by 3.4 per cent compared with an increase of 8.4 per cent in the June quarter and 11.7 per cent in the first quarter of 1978.  Again, the average price for CRV houses increased by only 2 per cent between the second and third quarters of this year, compared with an increase of almost 6 per cent between the first and second quarters. Significantly, building society loan approvals accounted for 50 per cent of all loan approvals in the September quarter and the average gross price of houses for which loans were approved by the societies in the then quarter increased by 2.8 per cent compared to an increase of 9.2 per cent in the quarter ended 30 June last.  A comparison of the trends during the September quarter in house building costs, private new house prices and consumer prices shows also that while private new house prices were still somewhat out of line with house building costs during the quarter, there was a closer relationship between increases in house prices and in consumer prices generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="156" /> The stabilisation of the rate of increase in the cost of commodities such as building materials and joinery products and in the level of professional charges associated with housing have been important factors in the control of house prices.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is controlling these and the intervention of the National Prices Commission and the Minister since July 1977 has helped largely to stabilise the prices of basic materials such as cement, aggregates and readymix concrete.</P>
    <P>In the situation in which the Government must provide the £81 million capital for local authority housing this year and then meet in full the loan charges&mdash;a subsidy amounting to £45 million in 1978 as against £31 million spent on the purpose last year&mdash;it is natural that firm control of tender prices for these housing schemes is essential.  I want, therefore, to refer briefly to the arrangements in operation which ensure that optimum value is obtained for this huge expenditure of public funds.</P>
    <P>A local authority may accept a tender for devolved schemes of up to 60 houses without seeking specific sanction, provided the unit cost of the dwellings is within a limit agreed between the authority and my Department.  If the unit cost is higher than this limit a formal submission is required.  Generally, authorities work within the agreed unit costs and submissions are the exception rather than the rule.  The unit costs are reviewed regularly in my Department with regard to trends in building materials prices, labour costs and land prices.  In the case of a scheme comprising 60 houses or more, a local authority must get the approval of the Department to the acceptance of a tender.  Approval of a tender is very rarely withheld.</P>
    <P>Housing authorities have not had any serious problems in obtaining reasonably priced tenders for their schemes.  In fact, tendering has been keen and competitive.  An analysis of rural housing schemes comprising, on average, some 60 houses or so, shows that the average number of tenders received for each scheme was seven.  In the case of some large Dublin Corporation <Col N="157" /> schemes advertised this year, the average number of tenders was nine and indeed 14 tenders were received for one scheme.  Largely as a result of this keen tendering, the difference in cost between the lowest and second lowest tenders has been less than 1.5 per cent in some cases of the overall contract sum.</P>

      <P>This indicates that local authorities, without any loss of standards, are getting houses built at reasonable costs.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to say something about the third point of criticism in the motion, which alleges that the Government have failed to take action to control the cost of housing land.  As the Minister pointed out in a reply to three parliamentary questions on 11 October 1978, he shares the general concern about increased prices for building land. Like him, however, I am very much alive to the problems associated with the subject, the danger of acting without full and adequate information and the danger that particular decisions, possibly based on inadequate consideration of all the relevant facts and issues, could have a disastrous effect on the construction industry in the short and medium terms, seriously affecting the Government's programme of job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this point I would like to recap on the action taken so far on the proposals put forward by the Committee on the Price of Building Land chaired by the Hon.  Mr. Justice J. Kenny.  The Kenny Report was presented to the Minister for Local Government in March, 1973, the month in which the Coalition Government assumed office.  In a statement issued ten months later, on 26 January 1974, that Government indicated that the problem of the high cost of building land was a complex one and that an effective solution to it involved remedies which were both far-reaching and comprehensive. Although the Government announced their acceptance in principle of the approach put forward in the majority report, they indicated that before making firm decisions on many of the <Col N="158" /> more important matters of detail they would have to take into account the views of interested parties.</P>
    <P>Their statement at the time did not make a commitment as to finance for compensation and left open the question as to who should be the designating authority envisaged in the majority report.  The question of dealing with compensation in various cases, of hardship which might call for special treatment, was also conveniently deferred.</P>
    <P>A preliminary scheme outlining the legislative provisions that would be required to give effect to the main recommendations was later prepared in the Department of Local Government.  This scheme highlighted major legal, financial and administrative implications which would require further detailed study.</P>
    <P>The scheme, however, did not settle some of the more important issues such as the level of financial investment and the designating authority which the Coalition Government had left over for later decision.  Further questions which arose, requiring Government decisions, included the phasing of the introduction of the scheme, the constitutionality of certain aspects, whether to modify or restrict application of capital gains tax and wealth tax to land transactions affected by the scheme, whether resources, financial and staff, on the scale required to implement the scheme successfully would be made available.  However, the previous Government did not take decisions on these critical issues before leaving office.</P>
    <P>Since taking office as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, I naturally, in close association with the Minister, gave precedence to promoting the work programme of my Department and to the arrangements necessary for the fulfilment of commitments announced in the Government's election programme.  However, I have been examining the proposals put forward by the Kenny Committee to curb the increasing price of building land and, in particular, problems such as possible constitutional difficulties, the possible disruption of the long established traditional marketing arrangements for <Col N="159" /> land, and other legal difficulties and the problem of providing the financial and organisational resources necessary for its implementation.</P>
    <P>I have also secured substantially increased resources for housing, roads and sanitary services, thus providing the necessary infrastructure to increase the availability of serviced land for housing and other development.  An undue switch of resources from these sources to a programme of land acquisition could tie up excessive capital in land, giving little employment and possibly adversely affecting the building industry.</P>
    <P>As part of the current examination of problems associated with the cost of housing land, An Foras Forbartha have been studying land price trends in the Greater Dublin area since 1970 and other related matters.  This commission to An Foras Forbartha is designed to ensure that essential information on the subject is available to help in formulating ideas as to whether the Kenny proposals or alternatives should be recommended to the Government.</P>
    <P>Though I have felt it necessary to tell the Dáil in some detail what has been happening in relation to the Kenny Report, I would like to dispel any suggestion that the present Government are ignoring the question of housing land costs until final decisions can be made on that report.</P>
    <P>The cost of the site is one of the basic elements making up the price of a house and we have been acutely conscious that the rising cost of building land has necessarily affected the prices being charged for houses.  The improvement in the economic climate since our return to Government has meant that land costs&mdash;which had lost real value during the recession associated with the Coalition Government's term of office&mdash;have increased and to some extent have been responsible for the increases in house prices over and above building costs. Such increases in land or site value are taken into account by my Department in determining the reasonable value of houses for CRV purposes, but in this context I would like to make it clear that <Col N="160" /> we do not feel bound to accept in full and automatically the price paid by a builder for land or sites when considering an application for a CRV.  Considerable weight is given to bona fide evidence of actual site costs, but if the price paid by the builder is considered unreasonably high, having regard to site values in the same or comparable areas, it will not be accepted for CRV purposes.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I ask the House to support the amendment which I have tabled to the motion.  As I have said, I completely reject the motion. There has not been any cutback by the Government in their effective capital provision for local authority housing. We have not failed to control excessive increases in prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a terrible thing to see a decent man come into the House with a prepared script, presumably because he had neither the heart nor the conscience to speak from his own knowledge, and to have the effrontery to tell the House and the country that there is anything but an extremely serious position in regard to the provision of both local authority and private housing from the point of view of supply of houses, their price and the finance available for their purchase.</P>
      <P>It is a pity the Minister did not discuss this motion in a constructive way rather than in the inevitable defensive manner we have come to expect from the Government, and try to meet the parties on this side half way in an attempt to tackle a problem involving a basic constitutional right.  Then we would have been able to get above and beyond party politics and make progress on behalf of the people whom we are all concerned about.  I do not believe the Minister is aware of the gravity of the position.  For example, I do not think he appreciates that the local authority housing lists of applicants have increased in six months by between 30 and 35 per cent, a horrific figure by any standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This indicates a number of problems. It indicates first that there is a shortage of finance for people to buy their own homes; that there is therefore, possibly, <Col N="161" /> a shortage of houses available, that loans available are no longer of any use or relevance in the context of restoring house prices.  Earlier today I asked a question and I should like to repeat it. Would the Minister now be agreeable to consider, in order to get rid of the cross innuendos that exist in a debate like this, the possibility of an open inquiry into the whole area of house prices?  That would serve the interests of all parties involved, including the many professional organisations whose concern has been growing in vehemence and volume since the Government came to office, despite the purring sounds that emerged from those quarters prior to June 1977.  Such an inquiry could deal dispassionately with this important problem.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the response will be.  I suspect it will be negative because I suspect that Fianna Fáil have too much vested interest in ensuring that the facts of the housing situation will not be put before the people in a dispassionate manner.  I cannot see how such an inquiry would prejudice the case the Minister has put forward if he is happy with his case.  We all know that the devil can cite scripture for his purpose, and I suggest that the Minister has been extremely selective in the facts he put before us.  He is not taking cognisance of the huge social tragedy which is growing daily by virtue of the inactivity and the vested interests of Fianna Fáil who have turned a blind eye to the housing problem since they came into office, apart from a few cosmetic touches such as the £1,000 grant.  Nobody seems to know where that money went, or at least nobody is saying, though a lot of people know where it went.</P>
    <P>The integrity of the Minister's stance must be taken in the context of the promises Fianna Fáil made prior to the last election.  They were quite clear.  The manifesto stated:</P>
    <P>Because Fianna Fáil believes that as many families as possible should own their own homes, it will be made easier to buy a house and cheaper to keep it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wishes us to believe that that manifesto promise has been implemented <Col N="162" /> he is uttering a deceit. Nothing could be further from the truth. How can the Minister sit there and pretend that he is helping as many families as possible to own their homes, that it is easier now to buy a house and cheaper to keep it?  Only this week people got notices from the building societies of the highest ever increase in mortgage repayments. The Minister should not try to tell us that it is easier to buy a house and cheaper to keep it than it was a year or two ago.  In the propaganda campaign before the election we had large advertisements in the newspapers, including one in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, 3 June 1977.  The benign and smiling face of the Minister's leader appeared in a large advertisement in <i>The Sunday Independent</i> of 12 June 1977, in which we were told that Fianna Fáil would increase local authority house purchase income limits and maximum loan limits to realistic levels.  All I can say is that Fian-na Fáil's realism differs substantially from the realism which we are seeking on behalf of those who need houses.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the only way to make progress is to have the kind of inquiry which I now demand.  Because of the crisis in the housing situation, the full dimensions of which have not become clear, we should have a national housing authority and adequate funds to ensure the rights of people to own their homes and not be dependent on the whim of the £, the rise and fall of shares on foreign markets, the sanction of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, or the varying demands of a number of Ministers on the Exchequer.  Housing should be above other considerations.  I believe that the stability and welfare of our society springs from housing and education.  If the Minister considers the facts he will realise that major initiatives are necessary, not the kind of initiative that we have come to expect from the Government, which has been to kick to touch and to tell us that things are under review.  There is a fundamental difference between what I consider to be the function and art of Government and what the Government practise.  Government is about doing things, not considering options.  They were given the mandate to take action and that is what they <Col N="163" /> should do.  People are crying out for leadership and they are getting reviews. All things will be produced from this magical review body in the sky in three years' time.  That is the trick but I may be too young and naïve to appreciate it. I reject it as a shallow philosophy.</P>
    <P>The housing situation is alarming, particularly in Dublin where there are 8,500 families waiting for housing. House construction is not keeping pace with demand.  The Minister referred to the capital allocation.  The relevant data in this context would be to take the proportion of capital expenditure on housing over a 12-month period as a constant and assess it over a number of years to see how it works out.  There is no point in telling us that the cash provision for housing has increased when the cost of housing has gone sky high.  The cash provision is irrelevant unless considered in the context of other criteria. The percentage of the public capital programme allocated to housing in each financial year shows a deliberate cutback. In 1975 the figure for local authority housing was 11.82 per cent.  In 1976 it was 11.89 per cent, an imperceptible but significant increase.  In 1977 the figure fell to 10.89 per cent and in 1978 the estimate is 10.55 per cent, the clear peak of the graph coinciding with the coming into office of this Government.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister came into office the capital expenditure on housing has decreased, which does not surprise me. Anyone who has taken an interest in either the Green Paper or the White Paper could be surprised at the decision to downgrade the local authority sector. I do not know what the reason for this decision is but it is not to create more housing in the private sector, except in negligible numbers.  I appreciate that that may be the Minister's concern but that is not the way it is working out.  Paragraph 5.8 of the White Paper contains the following clear statement:</P>
    <P>In the face of these high costs and given the progress already made towards satisfying needs, the level of activity in the local authority housing programme and/or the extent of Exchequer <Col N="164" /> subsidies will have to be subjected to continuous critical review in the light of available resources.  The local authorities will be requested to examine the circumstances of housing applicants in more detail to determine priority needs.</P>
    <P>Not, one might assume, an unreasonable proposal.  It is only unreasonable if it is the only area of public expenditure to be given increased scrutiny, as if there were people on the housing list who should not be on it, as if local authorities were negligent in their scrutiny of applications. If there is evidence then let us hear it.  If not, that slander should be withdrawn.  It is like the other papers we have had from this Government: a way of creating an environment for cutbacks in order to fuel the private builders, which I favour to an extent, but the interests of some builders may clash with the best interests of the public.</P>
    <P>There is a need to ensure that adequate funds are made available for local authority housing.  The figures show that there is a decline in these funds.  When the Minister seeks to pretend that this is not so he is not telling the truth.  A major ingredient in the price of housing is the control of the cost of land.  Most of us agree that urgent action is needed in this area.  The position in regard to the land banks available to the major urban authorities is critical.  There is a negligible land bank available in the Dublin city area, which is the second largest local authority in the country.  The Government's lack of interest in this matter means that the majority of people seeking local authority housing are being forced to migrate to areas which are foreign to them.  I am talking about new clinical estates.  It is difficult to talk about housing without talking about the social implications of housing in these barren landscapes.  The Minister should consult with his colleagues in the Department of the Environment and Health.  Young mothers are obliged to rear families in new estates without shopping facilities, community centres, nurseries, schools, churches and so on. If young people wish to stay in the city they will not benefit from the grant because there is no new housing in the <Col N="165" /> city.  It would be of help to extend the £1,000 grant to these people.  They should not be forced to leave the areas in which they were born.  They are penalised by the Government and have to go into areas where there are grave social problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to pretend that the increased cost of housing does not give cause for concern.  Let the Minister deny if he can that in the last quarter of 1977 and the first quarter of 1978, the period in which it is reasonable to expect that this Government's influence would have been felt in terms of house prices, the price of new houses for which loans were approved by building societies rose by 44.1 per cent, the price of new houses for which loans were approved by assurance companies rose by 37.64 per cent and the price of the new houses for which loans were approved by the associated banks rose by 37.88 per cent.  Is it not clear, therefore, that an extraordinary increase, over two and a half times the increase in inflation during the same period, took place in the price of new houses?  This is tragically underlined by the fact that during the same period the cost of building materials rose by less than one third of the figure which the Central Bank maintain to be the actual increase in house prices.  In other words, there was an increase of over 23 per cent on what might be considered to be the legitimate cost.  Where has this money gone?  How is the extra 23 per cent justified?  That is a reasonable question and it is the Minister's job to give a reasonable answer.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister's complacency regarding available finances will bring at best a wry smile of regret to the faces of those who are waiting with bated breath to see what kind of loan they can get.  At worst, their reaction will be burning anger.  For the first time in recent years, people in this city have been obliged to queue from 3 a.m. to get application forms for loans. A new phrase is current in housing policy, namely, &ldquo;the loan famine&rdquo;.  I had not heard that phrase until six months ago.  Loans are not as readily available as they were and those which are available are in many cases irrelevant.  I <Col N="166" /> refer in particular to local authority loans.  The salary limit of £3,500 and the kind of repayments necessary will make this loan less and less relevant.  It is not enough to increase the loan unless the limit is increased sufficiently to enable people to obtain loans and to repay them.  The present statistics add up to an unreasonable proposition.  By his insistence on the tax certificate the Minister is ensuring that fewer rather than more people will get them.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to pretend that the local authority housing sector is healthy and that the number of completions and general activity in the area suggest that. The facts do not bear this out.  Although there was an uneven period during the past three or four years in relation to local authority housing completions, in 1976 7,263 local authority dwellings were completed.  The figure available to us for 1978 is 5,770.  That can only mean that the Government and the authorities are not building as many local authority houses.  It does not matter what gloss is put on the figures.  Over 10 per cent fewer local authority houses have been built this year compared with last year and the Minister knows that the number of completions for all houses built this year will be lower than last year.</P>
    <P>The Government's statement that they would build between 21,000 and 27,000 houses during the next few years comes into focus.  I suggest that house completions this year will be down.  The Minister should not try to blame the weather; it has not been more inclement this year than other years.  Local authorities are building fewer houses this year and have a lower percentage of total capital expenditure than heretofore. The Green Paper underlines both these facts in its philosophy which is to squeeze out of the market people looking for local authority houses and to squeeze the local authorities away from the provision of such houses.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister urgently to consider the problems of urban areas.  He shows no concern whatever, nor does any member of the Government, regarding inner city problems.  There are growing areas of dereliction and blight in this city <Col N="167" /> because young couples who want to live in the city are discriminated against in that they cannot get the £1,000 new house grant and must leave the city.  If Fianna Fáil continue to get their way only the old and the poor will be left in the city.  The Minister should consider the need to institute a properly phased programme of inner city housing.  The land is there if the Minister wishes to take the power.  At a conservative estimate there are over 200 derelict acres in Dublin city alone and nothing is being done.  The ridiculous compulsory purchase order procedures and the exclusion of the rights of the community because of the apparent reverence for the rights of the individual, both in the Constitution and in the national legislative framework, apparently paralyse the Minister and his colleagues from doing anything concrete about taking over these areas of blight which make this capital city the shabbiest in Europe.  It is a matter of growing shame to us all.  Cork, Limerick and Galway are the same except in microcosm.  They have the same problems of blight and suffer from the same lack of Government interest in inner city areas.</P>

      <P>In welcoming the Minister of State I recognise that he has inherited part of the problem.  I am not here to score political points but to try to do something about the issue and to raise the question of the future of the excavations now that the extra period which was given is rapidly drawing to a close. The Government, and specifically the Minister of State, have to make a decision in the next week or fortnight as to the future of the excavations.</P>
      <P>By virtue of the mandate the Minister's party got 18 months ago, he can decide that the national monument which has been so declared by the court in an unprecedented legal case can be systematically destroyed by a local authority.  The least he could say is that we do not know enough about that monument and that he will provide extra time and extra resources for the full and comprehensive excavation of that monument. He could say the Wood Quay site will be preserved as a national monument and systematically excavated in accordance with modern methods of archaeological excavation, unrushed, unhurried, and not starved for resources. The final format and future of the monument should be decided upon when the excavation has been completed.  Those are the three alternatives.  The Minister will have to make a decision within the next fortnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fear is that the Government will go for the first option, that they will let time run out like sand in an hourglass and permit the destruction of that <Col N="169" /> national monument.  If that is to be the decision of the Government, I want to know why.  We would all like to know what the decision is to be.  The cat and mouse game that has gone on so far is unacceptable and unworthy of a Government who enjoy an unprecedented majority in this House.  I was a member of the Dublin City Council from 1974 until September 1977 and I participated in many of the discussions about the civic offices in Wood Quay. There is an issue which affected me as a public representative then and which directly affects the Minister, that is, the accuracy and trustworthiness of the advice public representatives obtained from professional officials&mdash;and I do not mean administrative civil servants&mdash; in the execution of their duty.</P>
    <P>The big question mark which hangs over the decision to be made by the Minister, or the Cabinet if it becomes a Cabinet issue, is on whose advice will they make their decision.  The corporation made their decision about the future of that monument and the site on the advice of certain museum officials.  In deference to the traditions of this House I will not name them.  A decision was made about the value and the substance and the long term future potential of this site on the basis of considered professional opinion given to the 45 city councillors. The same advice is being given to the Minister through administrative channels.  In the words of one eminent individual who is not in the employ of the State, Wood Quay is a hole in the ground.  After an unprecedented presen-tation of professional viewpoints, which did not come from within the ranks of professional specialised civil servants, Wood Quay was declared a national monument by a court of this land.  One noted urban archaeologist and historian who knows the Dublin scene fairly well, talking about the Wood Quay excavation, or the Dublin Viking excavation as it is popularly called, said:</P>
    <P>The results of the excavations were beyond all expectations and caused an immense interest in early Dublin amongst archaeologists and historians throughout Europe.  For citizens and tourists, however, the sites remained <Col N="170" /> closed off behind high fences and were never seen or explained and hence were very little understood.</P>
    <P>This was said by Richard Howarth in <i>An Taisce</i>, Volume 1, No. 5, October-December 1977.  The public march last autumn changed the nature of public understanding about this matter.  Public representatives and their officials made decisions about the future of that site on the basis of professional advice tendered to them by people directly related to the National Museum and in positions of responsibility.  In <i>The Irish Independent</i> of 26 April 1975 it was stated that one of the difficulties of the excavations in Wood Quay was the problem of resources within the National Museum itself.  It was stated that the Wood Quay excavations were stretching the resources of the National Museum and the director intended to propose that work on other excavation sites such as Knowth should be suspended and work concentrated on Wood Quay.</P>
    <P>We know the site is important.  We know the extensive excavations have stretched the resources of the National Museum in the past.  We also know that the professional assessment of that site was rejected by the court.  The court opted to take the contrary view and decided that the site is a national monument. When they made that decision they changed dramatically the whole picture within which we have to operate. The Minister and the Government have a specific responsibility because they have the mandate.  They have the 84 seats.  They have to decide whether they will authorise the destruction of that national monument.  They have avoided making any clear decision.  Fianna Fáil were noted for their noise and claquery on Dublin Corporation when they were in Opposition.  The 15 members of the Fianna Fáil Party on Dublin City Council have been noticeable for their silence on this issue.  Why are we hearing nothing from the people who have the responsibility and who unashamedly sought a mandate and indeed bought a mandate as we heard earlier today in Private Members' Time?  The silence may be related to the fact that if they act responsibility on the implications of the <Col N="171" /> court decision there may be some kind of a price tag.  Because they used up all the cash in the kitty to pay for election promises, there is not a brass farthing left in the kitty.</P>
    <P>Because the Government are even in trouble in terms of servicing existing election commitments as witnessed by the <i>exposé</i> we had here this evening and because they got themselves into post election difficulties by promising more than they could deliver in terms of cash, they are now prepared to sacrifice the Wood Quay site because they do not have the money or the option to get extra money to take the course of action that is needed in order to deal responsibly and positively with it.  This spendthrift Government have blown money in every direction from cowboy banks that were bailed out and given promises of bailing out beforehand. Perhaps I should withdraw that particular phrase.</P>

      <P>I think I am getting to the core of it.  The Minister of State does not want to destroy a national monument.  It may not be in Cork but it is still a national monument.  He does not necessarily want to destroy it.  The Tánaiste has no vested interest in destroying national monuments.  At least I do not think he has.  So why are the Government allowing the situation to drift through into the first fortnight of December? Unless the Government do something positive the consequences of their inaction will result in its destruction.  There must be some reason.  I would like to hear from the Minister of State what it is.  I know there is no money in the kitty. I know that.  So do all the thousands of people who happen to be on the housing list.  The very least I want to hear from the Minister of State tonight is a commitment given on the floor of this House, the national assembly of the sovereign people of this country, that at least <Col N="172" /> enough time will be given for the full comprehensive and unhurried excavation of the declared national monument at Wood Quay.  That is the very least we want to hear and we cannot be more gentle than that.  In making that declaration and in giving that assurance to the House I would like the Minister of State to be able to assure us that the resources required to back up that commitment in terms of numbers of skilled and unskilled personnel as well as proper facilities for the housing and cataloguing of whatever finds emerge from that excavation will be made available by his Department. That is the very minimum we want.</P>
      <P>If the Minister stands up and says that he has been advised by his professional advisers that two months is enough, that they have been able to get through the earth mounds and all the rest of it like a dose of salts and that there is really nothing of any real consequence buried there and so on, it is fair to ask in advance if he is going to quote the advice of professional people whose considered opinion was rejected by the courts in the first place?  I would ask the Minister of State to please save the House the time and bother of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a separate issue here that I have mentioned already and it is one that I would like to go back to at length and that is the relationship of professional advisers to public representatives. Surely the Minister of State must now recognise that in this instance two sets of professional opinion were brought before the court of the land and one was accepted and the other was not and the one that was rejected is the one that the Minister of State may very well be quoting now in defence of the non-action which will result in the destruction of the monument.  If that is going to be the basis of any decision he cannot, in all fairness to him and in all fairness to this House, stand up and say that he is only a public representative doing his job and taking the best advice available.  It is no longer the best advice available.  Clearly and distinctly it is no longer the best advice available.  That will be a nice easy path for the Minister of State to scuttle off down and hopefully we will have enough time to excavate the monument. <Col N="173" /> That is the minimum and I put it up as a soft option first.</P>
    <P>The real choice that must now be made, the choice that in fact has been made by my own party, is that the area of the site at Wood Quay which has been declared a national monument must be conserved.  At a press conference when we launched this policy I was queried on the use of the word &ldquo;conserved&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;preserved&rdquo;.  Let me be clear on what I mean.  In order fully to excavate the site we are going to have to take it apart in some form or other.  If the collective professional opinion at the end of the day declares that it should be reconstituted in some form to reproduce and replicate what was originally there then that would be the conservation of the monument.  Simple preservation would be to freeze it in its present state and not to do any further excavation.  So there is a distinction in the use of the word &ldquo;conservation&rdquo; which must be clearly understood.  The Labour Party have clearly and distinctly, at both national and city council level, called for the conservation of the site at Wood Quay.  I would like to think that the policy document which we have produced and which has been dismissed by some people as a shabby compromise would in fact serve the Minister of State well as the basis upon which a positive and constructive decision can be made about the future of this site.</P>
    <P>There is another side to the Minister's problem and it is a real problem.  It is the legitimate demands of the administration of Dublin City Council and of the personnel involved in that administration for proper office accommodation.  I understand these demands because I was for two years an employee of Dublin City Council and was a member of the Local Government and Public Services Union.  I cannot speak with authority for that union; they can speak well enough for themselves and very authoratively. But I can certainly, in my personal capacity, speak with some understanding. The site that has been declared a national monument at Wood Quay must be conserved.  The rest of the site is a building site.  It has been cleared to <Col N="174" /> bedrock and An Taisce, who are charged with the responsibility of looking after the national heritage, have stated that the area on Wood Quay outside that designated as a national monument could and should be built upon. There is room enough there for the Minister to accommodate the pressing and legitimate needs of the union but there is no room for the Minister of State to allow, on the basis of whatever internal professional advice he gets, the destruction of what the courts have declared a national monument of this country.</P>

      <P>I am glad at the outset that Deputy Quinn mentioned the fact that I inherited something.  I was glad when he said that he would not make a political issue out of it but at the same time I am afraid the Deputy did go into a political field in accusing this Government of making pre-election promises and so on.  I have no intention of making anything political out of this very important motion before us this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came into this office no more than a year and a half ago and I had to look at all aspects of the Wood Quay situation.  I have to say here and now that there is no question of the Government remaining silent on this whole issue.  We are approaching this in a very responsible manner.  A lot of publicity was given to it.  I never like to come along and contradict certain statements and things of that kind.  I look at the facts.  Cork was mentioned here tonight.  I want to inform Deputy Quinn that there was a lot of dragging of feet where the Dublin Concert Hall was concerned but I made that decision when I came into office so that at least the people of Dublin would get a concert hall.  Feet were dragged for many years before that.  I want, first of all, to remove any suspicion which may fall on me as the person now responsible for making a decision on this matter.  I must make a thorough assessment of all the views expressed&mdash;God knows there are many&mdash;one contradicting the other. I cannot become emotional in this matter. I have a responsibility to face up to and any decision I make is with the full <Col N="175" /> responsibility of the office I am responsible for.  I must consider the views of the National Monuments Advisory Committee. I must consider the views of the National Museum.  I have to take into consideration the local authority workers' need for a suitable site.  I was rather impressed tonight by Deputy Keating, when he was talking about the building of inner Dublin and asked: &ldquo;Is inner Dublin to become derelict?&rdquo;  He said it was the most derelict part of the country.  I am sure that the Deputy, as a public representative, has to keep this very much in mind also.  I must consider the convenience of the site for a municipal building, especially its convenience for the people of Dublin.  I have to look at all the financial and other implications involved in this particular site.</P>

      <P>I have to take into con-sideration the views of the majority of the members of the local authority in Dublin who represent the people of Dublin.  I have to take into consideration that already £500,000 has been spent on the Wood Quay site as far as excavations are concerned.  I have been accused of certain things yet I have made no <Col N="176" /> charge against any particular person, professional or otherwise.  I am not an archaeologist but there are two people employed by the National Museum, for whom I have the greatest admiration, who are responsible for advising me.  I have to take into consideration the co-operation given by the Dublin city council. I have to take into consideration their proposition regarding the establishment of a museum on the site.  I am sure many people have seen the blueprint now but if not I suggest that they look at it.</P>
      <P>We are not running away from our responsibility and we are not trying to destroy something which is of national importance.  Excavation is something destructive because one is digging to find something else but in that process one is destroying to some extent.

      <P>In my reply to Question No. 413 of 14 November 1978&mdash;Official Report, Volume 309, column 767&mdash;I stated that I understood that the Mid-Western Health Board were satisfied that their programme of minor capital works could be continued until the end of 1978 within the moneys which I allocated to the board for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The minor capital works consist of a wide variety of small scale projects scattered throughout the health board's area. Some of the projects are contracted out and the balance undertaken by the workers employed by the board.  The numbers of workers engaged on the projects vary from time to time as the works are developed and completed.  I understand from the health board that the present complement of temporary workers will be continued in employment to complete the programme.</P>
      <P>The employment of permanent staff is a matter for the health board in the first instance and I have no current proposals from the board for the permanent employment of these maintenance workers based on a continued need for their services.</P>

    <P>It is estimated that about 70,000 cubic metres annually of material could be produced from conifer crops.  Of this up to 19,000 cubic metres might be utilised as pulpwood and the balance as sawlog.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 334 and 337 together. The sinking of the <i>Christos Bitas</i> on 31 October 1978 caused an oil slick estimated to extend about 600 feet by 400 feet.  On the following day, two oil slicks were sighted by aerial reconnaissance approximately nine miles due north of the sinking site.  The estimated extent of the slicks was 5 miles × 2½ miles and 6 miles × ½ mile.  Extensive aerial reconnaissance over a wide area during the following two weeks sighted no oil slicks and it may be assumed that those slicks which were seen on the 1st November were subsequently broken up by the action of the sea.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the advice available to me I consider that the possibility of oil from the <i>Christos Bitas</i> reaching the Irish coast is extremely remote and I would not consider it necessary or useful to undertake regular monitoring of the sinking site.  However, the Army Air Corps and the Naval Service would report any sightings of oil slicks that they might make in the course of their normal fishery protection patrol duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimate of the amount of oil an board the <i>Christos Bitas</i> at the time of sinking was based on the knowledge and experience of those directly involved in the operation, taken in conjunction with information on the size of the original cargo when the vessel left Rotterdam and the amounts <Col N="51" /> removed during the pumping operations and taking account of the amount spilt after the grounding off the Welsh Coast.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that all the oil that it was practicable to remove from the <i>Christos Bitas</i> was removed during the pumping operations and there are no grounds for casting doubt on the estimate of 1,000 tons remaining in or clinging to the vessel's tanks at the time of sinking.</P>

      <P>As to the second part of the Deputy's question the principle of liability irrespective of fault in respect of motor insurance has not yet been adopted here. As I already indicated in reply to a question by Deputy O'Keeffe on 27 April 1978, the introduction of the concept of no-fault motor insurance would have far reaching implications for our legal system and it would have to be the subject of consideration extending well beyond the motor insurance sector.  As I stated then, I will continue to keep an open mind on the question of a &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; insurance system and the Deputy may be assured that a careful analysis of all the factors involved will be carried out.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the action, if any, he intends to take regarding the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin, who was seriously injured in an accident in Dublin in 1970, and subsequently deprived of an award of damages by a ruling of the Supreme Court that the driver of the offending car was at that time in a temporary coma and therefore not negligent; and if his Department are in a position to award any measure of compensation to the victim in this case.</P>

      <P>Our law of civil liability is based on the concept of negligence.  The question of amending the law to provide that compensation should be paid to persons injured in circumstances where there is no negligence is one which has wide implications for the general law of civil liability&mdash;including the civil liability of motorists.  In this regard I would refer the Deputy to my written reply to Questions 350 and 351 on today's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the case in question the position is that an order of the High Court in 1969 awarding damages of £7,200 was reversed on appeal in the Supreme Court on the issue of negligence.  While I am naturally sympathetic to the plight of individuals who fail to obtain compensation in the courts because they cannot establish negligence, the position is that there are no funds available to me out of which such persons could be compensated by the State.  Furthermore any payment by the State to one person who fell into this <Col N="57" /> category would have implications for other persons who, over the years, were unable to get compensation for loss or injury because they could not establish negligence, whether their cases were brought to court or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 350 and 351 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that, in the first question, the Deputy is referring to the system of civil liability based on the principle of &ldquo;created risk&rdquo; under which the driver of a motor vehicle is deemed to be liable for injury or death caused by the vehicle, irrespective of whether he is at fault, unless he can bring himself within certain limited exceptions.  That system is not part of the law of this country.</P>
      <P>The principle of liability for damage caused by motor vehicles in our law is the same as that applicable in the general area of civil liability, namely, that to recover against the driver, a person has to establish that the driver has been negligent in the use of the vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Convention on Civil Liability for Damage caused by Motor Vehicles&mdash;which embodies the &ldquo;created risk&rdquo; principle&mdash;was opened for signature in Strasbourg on 14 May 1973.  The convention has not yet come into force because instruments of ratification or acceptance have not been deposited by the required minimum of <Col N="58" /> three signatory states.  Ireland participated in the work leading to the drawing up of the convention but has not signed it.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the &ldquo;created risk&rdquo; principle would represent a major change in this area of our law and views on the issue are divided both in this country and elsewhere.  It is a matter which I have under review but I should like to make it clear that such a change in the law could not be undertaken without a great deal of further detailed and careful study.</P>

      <P>The Government have recently appointed an extra chief superintendent and two extra superintendents of the Garda Siochána to serve in a new Garda division and district which it is proposed to set up in the Dublin Metropolitan Area on 5 December.  The new division, to be known as the Eastern Division, with headquarters at Dún Laoghaire, will cover Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock and Bray and their environs and the new district headquarters will be located at Blackrock.  The present status of Bray as a district headquarters will remain unchanged but it will be transferred from the Southern Division to the new Eastern Division.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the new division and district will reduce the workload of the divisional and district officers in the Dublin metropolitan area.  In addition, extra manpower will be assigned to Dún Laoghaire and Blackrock to take account of the upgrading of both stations.</P>

      <P>Shankill Garda station was first scheduled for replacement in November 1961 and the Commissioners of Public Works were asked to acquire a site and build a new station at that time.  I am informed by the commissioners that the delay in this case is mainly due to difficulties in acquiring a suitable site.  I understand that a site is under consideration at present.</P>
      <P>The floor area of the existing station is approximately 1,900 square feet.  Toilet facilities and wash-hand basins with hot and cold water are provided.  Approximately 90 per cent of the station area is at present in normal everyday use.  The Office of Public Works consider that the structural condition of the building is sound.  They say that the general standard of decoration is fair but redecoration of some areas is necessary, including a room on the first floor which is used as a storeroom.  They are arranging to have all necessary redecoration carried out as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The question of the total amount of money being paid in ground rents was investigated by the Ground Rents Commission, <Col N="60" /> which sat between 1961 and 1964.  However, the Commission were unable to arrive at any reliable figure.  As regards the number of home owners who are liable for ground rent, a study that was made in connection with proceedings on the Bill that became law as the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978 resulted in a very tentative estimate of some 250,000 ground rents on dwellinghouses.  As regards the final part of the Question, some 7,000 persons had, between the introduction of the purchase scheme on 1 August 1978 and 24 November last, approached the Land Registry, by way of personal call, telephone call or letter, for information or assistance in relation to the purchase of ground rents under the Act that has been mentioned.  Many of these persons were inquiring on behalf of other individuals or groups, such as residents' associations.</P>

      <P>The information sought in the question is not available in my Department or in Garda Headquarters.

Lest this should give the impression that a check is carried out only if there is some specific ground for believing that it should be carried out in the particular case, I should like to make it clear that the carrying out of a check is the rule rather than the exception.</P>

      <P>The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The Government have ensured through the local authority house purchase loans schemes that there is adequate finance available for those in the lower income group who wish to purchase a house. Net inflow of funds to building societies in the first ten months of this year are higher than for the same period last year.  Also it would appear that bank lending for house purchase will show an increase this year over last year. Furthermore almost 25 per cent more loans for house purchase were approved in the first six months of this year than for the same period of last year. Generally it is expected that the housing targets for the year will be achieved and that there will be adequate house mortgage finance available for this purpose. In these circumstances, it is not clear what purpose a special emergency fund would serve.</P>

      <P>In regard to the general position, it was indicated in the Report on Pollution Control that taking account of measures in hand and those planned for improving and extending existing control systems, or establishing new ones, the overall picture as regards regulatory provision for pollution control was considered generally satisfactory.

    <P>From inquiries made from Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Cork County Council, the position in these local authorities is as follows: Following discussions with the Local Government and Public Services Union, Dublin Corporation propose early in 1979 to introduce flexible working hours for a trial period of three months in one of their Departments.  The position will <Col N="65" /> be reviewed by Dublin Corporation at the end of the trial period.  Dublin County Council will also be keeping the position under review in the light of experience gained in Dublin Corporation. A limited form of flexi-hours has been in operation in Cork County Council for some time past but there are no plans at present to extend the current arrangements. It is unlikely that flexi-hours are planned or in operation in more than a very few local authorities at present.</P>
