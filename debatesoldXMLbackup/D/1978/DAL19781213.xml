      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the White Paper <i>The European Monetary System</i> and supports the Government's continuing efforts to participate in the formulation of a durable and effective system in the best interests of Ireland and of the Community.</P>
      <P>I should like to start by referring to the allegations that were made last week by the Leaders of the Opposition parties following the conclusion of the meeting of the European Council on Tuesday, 5 December.  I want to assert that there was and could be no confusion about my decision on the resolution of the European Council on the setting up of the European Monetary System.  At the end of the meeting, and I repeat, I told the Council I could not as of then indicate that I could recommend to the Government and the Dáil Ireland's entry to the system on the basis of the resource transfers offered but that I would give the matter further consideration in consultation with my Government with a view especially to see whether there could be a further basis on which I could make a positive response.</P>
      <P>At a press conference shortly after the end of the Council meeting I reported to Irish and other political correspondents what I had told the Council about my decision not to recommend our entry.  I told them word for word what I had indicated about half an hour previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue and I hope there will be no more interruptions. As I was saying, I made my position clear to the Council at the end of the Council meeting and subsequently at the meeting I had with Irish and other political correspondents shortly afterwards.  I told them what my attitude was and what I had said and so I suggest there was no confusion whatever as far as the net outcome of the Council discussions was concerned about Ireland's position.</P>
      <P>Any confusion as to our attitude has not been caused by this side of the House but rather by the type of obfuscation of which the motion put down by the leader of the Labour Party here today is an example.  It refers to the preparation for the Brussels meeting.  I doubt if any Council were ever as adequately prepared.  Between the 6 and 20 November the Tánaiste had bilateral discussions with all his colleagues from all the other member states to discuss the technical details of the EMS and, in particular, the Irish case for resource transfers.  During the discussions there was general acceptance of the principle of Community action to help Ireland to participate in the system.  However, there was no commitment, nor was it ever suggested there was, of the type of volume of aid which might be made available and neither was there at the Economic Finance Council, generally called the ECOFIN Council, on 20 November when I personally arranged a series of meetings with the Heads of Government most concerned with the foundation of the new system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 22 November I met President Giscard d'Estaing in Paris.  We discussed the technical and resource transfer aspects of the system in detail for more than two hours.  The French President indicated his understanding for the Irish case but gave no firm commitment on <Col N="1326" /> the volume or on the form of assistance which he would regard as suitable.  My conclusion on the meeting, as summarised by the press at that time, is that there was certainly support, certainly understanding but no commitment.</P>
    <P>Next I met the British Prime Minister, Mr. Callaghan, on 27 November and discussed the European Monetary System and other Community questions, as well as issues relating to Northern Ireland.  At the conclusion of that meeting I said that it had led to a clearer understanding of our respective positions. Mr. Callaghan showed the utmost goodwill and expressed the wish that whatever happened, the result would be in our interests.  Here again the conclusion of that meeting was accurately described in the press.</P>
    <P>On 28 November I met Chancellor Schmidt of the German Federal Republic.  The orally agreed statement of conclusions following that meeting was to the effect that the Chancellor had expressed his understanding of the Irish attitude and his willingness to support transfers of resources in the event of Ireland's entry to the EMS.  Methods of effecting these transfers were discussed but there was no final agreement.  The decisions on that issue were specifically stated to remain for the Brussels Council to be taken by the nine members of the Community.  The Chancellor indicated that the German Presidency would make the fullest possible use of the time between then and the Brussels Council to formulate proposals for transfers: and they honoured that commitment to the full.</P>
    <P>I stand over what I said after each of these meetings, both publicly and to this House.  I believe what each of the leaders said to me about their understanding and positive approach to Ireland's request for resources.  I believe that what they said to me they said in good faith.  I want to say I was not conned, as a newspaper heading seemed to suggest, and I am certain that there was no intention whatever on the part of these leaders to con me.</P>
    <P>After my meetings with the French President and the German Chancellor in particular, I felt that the transfers which <Col N="1327" /> we sought would not be in the form of grants only and at no stage did I give the impression that we could get the full amount of the transfers we asked for.  I still, however, expressed my confidence and I feel it was important that I should have done so.  Even from the strategic point of view if I had left one of these meetings and said that we were not likely to get support, or support even near what we were expecting, it would have been a bad mistake for me.  It would have been a mistake to adopt that stance and attitude.</P>
    <P>It is now well known that a draft resolution, prepared by the Presidency, was put before the meeting of the Council; that was on last Monday.  This draft provided for transfers by way of grants as well as loans to the less prosperous countries who would join the EMS.  The paragraph of that draft dealing with grants or cash transfers was in brackets indicating that there was no agreement on it.  This draft emanated from a meeting which was held by high officials of the member countries in Frankfurt on Friday, 1 December, which was called by the German Presidency.  That was part of the fulfilment of the undertaking given to me by the German Chancellor that he would use the time between my meeting and the meeting in Brussels last Monday to the full to explore what could be done.  This draft, prepared in Frankfurt, was before the European Council on Monday last.  I might add that the draft was circulated to the Heads of Government who would be meeting in Brussels on Monday, circulated during Sunday a couple of hours before I left for Brussels.</P>
    <P>It contained, as I indicated last week, two Parts.  The first Part dealt with the mechanism of the European Monetary System itself and the second part dealt with the form and amount of transfers to be made available to the less prosperous countries.  Part A only was discussed on the first day and for some time&mdash;an hour or less&mdash;on the morning of the second meeting.  There was no reference whatever to money on the first day, so any report of the likelihood of our being in or out, or of the size of the resources <Col N="1328" /> likely to be transferred at the end of the first day, any report of that nature, was purely speculative.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly again with what was decided in Brussels last week.  The Opposition have claimed that the Government abused the restraint they claimed they showed in recognition of the fact that the Government were in a negotiating position.  The reality, of course, is that the Opposition abused the position they occupy arising from the decision of the Irish people to relieve them of the responsibility of taking any serious decisions affecting the country's welfare and future.  They have constantly sought to misrepresent and to misquote the Government's statements and positions, to discover conflicts where none existed, and to accuse us of failure to provide information.</P>
    <P>Let us take this last charge first.  Immediately after the European Council in Bremen I supplied the conclusions to the Leaders of both Opposition Parties. Almost as soon as the Dáil resumed after the summer recess, we provided an opportunity for a very full debate on the Bremen conclusions.  That debate spread over five days.  At the opening, the Minister for Finance and I outlined the reasons for expressing our positive approach to the question of joining the European Monetary System, the expansion of trade that it would involve, the beneficial effect on the rate of inflation, on the rate of employment and investment, inter-Community investment and indeed outside investment into the Community that would be likely to follow. We pointed out also the difficulty that might arise.  We pointed out the need for moderation in expectation of income increases if we were to remain in and reap full advantage of our membership of the system.  We provided further opportunities for comment on the statements I made on my discussions with other Heads of State or Government and on the outcome of the European Council itself last week.  Last Wednesday, as soon as the text was confirmed from Brussels, I had the resolution of the European Council on the European Monetary System and related matters placed before both Houses of the <Col N="1329" /> Oireachtas.  I drew attention to this in my statement last Thursday.  Yet, apparently, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party had to send to Brussels himself for answers to these questions, the information on which had already been included in documents laid before the Houses.</P>
    <P>Since then we have published a White Paper which has been circulated to Deputies.  The simple fact is that this House has been kept at least as well informed, and indeed I would suggest better informed, than other member countries and other Parliaments in the Community on this subject.</P>
    <P>In his reply to my statement last Thursday, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, in seeking to discover conflicts in what, to any reasonable person, would be fully consistent indications of the outcome of the Brussels meeting, wrapped himself up in such knots that the Leader of the Labour Party was compelled to comment adversely on his performance. He was apparently disappointed that I failed to indulge in that weakness for juggling with figures.  What I did was simply to give the detailed and intricate conclusions of the Brussels meeting in reasonably simple and straight-forward terms.  What people wanted to know was the general form and amount of the transfer of resources which we were offered&mdash;not detailed figuring to four decimal places.</P>
    <P>Since then, by sending to Brussels for information that was already made available to the House in the normal way and by putting down Parliamentary Questions yesterday, to which he was given written answers yesterday, Deputy FitzGerald has, I hope, by now satisfied his curiosity.  I do not intend here to follow every hare he raised last week.  But I would like to add a little to the information and comment in my previous statements and in the documents that have been available.</P>
    <P>First, I want to repeat that the resource transfer we were offered was equivalent to approximately £45 million a year, each year over five years or £225 million in total.  This represents the grant equivalent of interest rate subsidies on loans.  At no stage have I, or any other member of the Government, despite <Col N="1330" /> what Deputy FitzGerald suggested here on 30 November and what Deputy Cluskey sought to represent last Wednesday, stated or implied that the loans themselves were a transfer of resources.</P>
    <P>I summarised the relevant sections of the European Council resolution here last Wednesday.  In doing so I indicated that the details of the scheme were not included in the resolution.  Since then the Leader of the Fine Gael Party has been complaining that he cannot confirm these details from his contacts in Brussels&mdash;I am sure they are many.  For instance, he has apparently been told that there is no record of any discussion on a moratorium.  I am afraid the Deputy will have to secure election to the job I now hold before he gets the full kind of information he has sought to get in Brussels of what transpires at meetings of the European Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to return to the meeting.  As I stated earlier, I intend to give some further bit of information. I felt precluded from speaking in any detail of what transpired at the meeting of the Council last week.  Those meetings are presumed to be held in private and only Heads of State or Government and Ministers for Foreign Affairs are present.  I believe they are expected to be held in an atmosphere of reasonable confidentiality.  Since then much information has leaked out, or been made available deliberately, so I feel free now to give a further indication to the House of what transpired as far as I was concerned at that meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that in response to a number of detailed proposals I put forward, some of which were also raised by the Italian Prime Minister, Signor Andreotti, there were Commission suggestions put forward at the meeting that the term of the loan would be 15 years; that the loan subsidy would apply over the full period of 15 years and that the full capitalised value would be repayable to the borrower; that there would be a moratorium from three to five years on repayments of capital and that loans from the Ortoli Facility, which stand side by side with the European Investment Bank as a means of securing loans within the Community, would also attract subsidies.  A number of these proposals were also accepted by the German Presidency when I visited Bonn and are reflected in the conclusions of the Council.  The Leader of the Fine Gael Party may have noted the correspondence between these conclusions and the written reply to his parliamentary question yesterday, in that the cost of the interest subsidies referred to in the draft resolution represents one-fifth of the value of the loans, as it does on the basis used in deriving the figure of £45 million.  These details were not specifically agreed at the European Council but it was clear from the reactions of the participants such as President Giscard <Col N="1332" /> d'Estaing and Chancellor Schmidt, as it is from the final conclusions, that there was general acceptance of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald made much of what he saw as a major inconsistency between reference to the period of the moratorium as three years, three to five years or five years.  As I have just explained, these details were not fully settled although the Presidency seemed to accept five years.  However, the Deputy has probably been gratified to note from yesterday's written reply that, in terms of the present value of the interest rate subsidies over 15 years, the difference between moratoria of three and five years, on a loan of £100 million between three and five years, is the comparatively small sum of £0.7 million.  For most of us this would not be a major issue but I can understand its significance for a Deputy who as Minister for Foreign Affairs went to the Paris Summit in 1974 with the Taoiseach and returned after settling for an additional six million units of accounts a year for three years at an average rate of £2½ million on the Regional Development Fund.  The Deputy went over there with high hopes and returned gravely disappointed and he greatly disappointed the country also.</P>
    <P>I readily concede to the Deputy that there is scope for discovering further major sums of these magnitudes in quibbles about the calculation of the £45 million. One could perhaps reduce it by reference to the availability of moratoria on commercial loans.  On the other side, one could find arguments for using a lower rate of discount to bring sums of money over time to their value today.  When all is said and done I think that objective observers will agree that when all the permutations are examined, the assessment I gave was a fair statement of the position.</P>
    <P>As reported in last Saturday's <i>Irish Press</i>, the Deputy has noted a number of other respects in which my statement to the Dáil was allegedly incomplete or incorrect. For example, he said that I did not explain that the loans were not general loans but rather loans for general infrastructure programmes and projects to be submitted.  There is, of course, as the House is aware, a difference <Col N="1333" /> between projects and programmes. Normally speaking the loans I have referred to, EIB loans or Ortoli Facility loans, are directed in the main to projects and programmes which are of a much wider connotation.  This and other conditions are clearly spelt out in the documents I laid before the House.  I might say in passing that Deputy FitzGerald was speaking then at a civil service dinner on Saturday night and while he complained that the information I gave was incomplete he did not go so far as to justify the heading contained in a newspaper the following day that I had got it wrong again.  I am saying that in passing in fairness to Deputy FitzGerald; he was not responsible for that heading.</P>
    <P>At no stage did I suggest that these were general loans.  I have indicated that loans from EIB or Ortoli Facility loans are made for certain purposes and that, therefore, they could not be regarded as general loans to do whatever we liked with, as the Leader of the Labour Party apparently thought to be necessary and realistic.  Indeed, it was clear to anyone who followed our case what the loans were for and, of course, this could have been established simply by perusal of the document laid before the House.</P>
    <P>Again, Deputy FitzGerald is reported as drawing attention to the fact that the Council resolution refers to an understanding that, in relation to the funds to be provided any direct or indirect distortion of the competitive position of specific industries within member states will have to be avoided.  He had earlier referred here on 30 November to the position of industries that might be vulnerable in certain circumstances. Does he suggest, having regard to the purposes for which the Community was established that it would have been sensible to seek to have the reference in question deleted from the draft conclusions? In any event the basic assumption on which he is apparently acting has no foundation.  There are far too many variables involved for anyone to be able to conclude that any sector would of necessity be affected adversely by our entry into the new system.  Much would, for example, depend on the way both <Col N="1334" /> management and workers in the industries themselves act.</P>
    <P>I hope it is clear from what I have been saying that in Brussels we sought and obtained quite a number of modifications to the proposal for loans and that it remained open to us to take further steps to ensure that aid was provided under conditions that made it as effective as possible.  We are still pursuing these questions.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer again to Bremen and to deal with the suggestion that the Government's tactics were misconceived from the outset and throughout thereafter. This allegation was made by the Leader of the Labour Party here on 17 October, again on 30 November, and was repeated last Thursday.  For example, on 30 November he said that at Bremen I gave an enthusiastic response to the whole idea of the EMS and that that was a serious mistake.  On 17 October Deputy Barry of Fine Gael suggested here that the negotiating stance adopted by the Government was not very wise.  He went on to try to put words in my mouth that I had never uttered and, when challenged as to the reference, could not back up his misquotation. This was also the case when Deputy Cluskey, on the same day, recklessly and irresponsibly claimed that the impression had been created within all member states of the Community that we were favouring entry into the system irrespective of what Britain did and, apparently, irrespective of what other conditions might be laid down regarding membership and irrespective of the size of the concessions that would be necessary for this country's future welfare.  Last Wednesday, the Deputy admonished me because I had not aligned myself with that approach.  But I want to ask the Leader of the Labour Party if he has any conception of the reaction that this kind of approach would have created amoung our other seven partners?  We will make our decision not on alignments with this country or that country, as the Deputy fancies, but on arguments applicable to this country and based on what is good for this country and for the Community.</P>
    <P>I want to say that everything that has <Col N="1335" /> happened has vindicated the positive but balanced approach adopted by the Government and confirmed that this was in the best interests not only of European integration&mdash;which means our long-term interest&mdash;but also in our interest in the medium&mdash;term.  The fact is that our support in principle for the concept of the EMS and our indication that we would be joining if the circumstances were right, evoked&mdash;and I want to emphasise this&mdash;a correspondingly positive and sympathetic response among our partners.  That is still in evidence: and that is still the basis on which we are continuing to consider the whole issue.</P>
    <P>It was on my proposal that the European Council in Bremen agreed to commission concurrent studies of the action necessary to strengthen the economies of the less prosperous member countries in the context of EMS.  All members agreed, it will be recalled, that such measures would be necessary for the success of the system.  Work on the concurrent studies was entrusted to the Community's Economic Policy Committee. Our representatives there put forward our arguments in relation to transfers of resources.  A Commission spokesman explicitly recognised that we had put forward a cogent case. However, it became clear at a relatively early stage that, on the crucial issues, their report would set out differing majority and minority views.  It would have been too much to expect a completely objective report in such a highly political domain.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald suggested here on 30 November that in the absence of studies such as he had helped to undertake in the run-up to EEC entry, in the first place, the Government had not been able to convey any convincing reason to our EEC partners for the proposed transfers but had been content to go with a begging bowl looking for transfers without being able to explain why we needed the money or what we proposed to do with it.  My comment on this is that we apparently put forward so strong a case as to lead the German Presidency to envisage the provision of 2,000 million <Col N="1336" /> EUA a year in subsidised loans for five years and a significant grant transfers through what was called a new window in the regional fund or a new budget line over a similar period.  On the figures that were in mind, the transfer in grant and grant equivalent to this country could have been as high as £600 million over five years.  It would appear that the reasons we gave were more convincing than those used when we got the £7,500,000 that Deputy FitzGerald brought home from the regional fund some years ago.</P>
    <P>These proposals were reflected, with technical changes and with the figures left blank, in the draft conclusions circulated by the Presidency before the Brussels meeting.  That draft referred specifically to a third section of the regional fund, of which Ireland's share would have been 30 per cent.  There was allocated also 50 per cent to Italy and 20 per cent to the UK.  There was the alternative of opening up a special line in the budget.  This would be a special grant fund in which Ireland would be able to participate.</P>
    <P>This, then, was the response to the Government's positive attitude to the initiative taken by Chancellor Schmidt and President Giscard d'Estaing and to the case we put forward for transfers.  I have reported already specifically on my meetings with these two leaders and with Mr. Callaghan.  As I indicated last Thursday, our case was, in the main, accepted, with some reservations as to the size and form of the resource transfer involved and this acceptance was reiterated many times during the Brussels meeting.  Indeed, in reporting to the Bundestag on the European Council on the day after the Council Meeting, Chancellor Schmidt went out of his way, as he has done publicly on at least two further occasions since then, to express his particular understanding of our difficulties and of the reserved position I adopted at the conclusion of the Brussels meeting.</P>
    <P>In the same vein, I received a letter on Monday last, from Prime Minister Anker Joergensen of Denmark, in which he indicated that he personally attached the very greatest importance to the participation <Col N="1337" /> of both Italy and Ireland in the system from the outset.  He went further and expressed his firm conviction that the possible extension of the number of countries participating in the EMS must not have the effect of reducing the aid given to Italy and Ireland.  On the gap between the amount of aid discussed at the European Council and our wishes, Prime Minister Joergensen expressed the opinion that the very idea of the EMS implies a common responsibility to ensure that difficulties encountered by one member country should be solved in a way which does not weaken the main purpose of monetary co-operation, the creation of stability.  This, in his view, implies that participation in the EMS carries with it the right of a member country which, contrary to expectation, faces the need for further assistance, to have the problem examined afresh.  I should like to avail of this opportunity publicly to express my appreciation of this message from my Danish colleague. I may say that I have also received a similar communication from Prime Minister Van Agt of the Netherlands, in which support and goodwill are given a concrete expression which I should also like gratefully to acknowledge.</P>
    <P>With so much goodwill, one might be forgiven for asking what went wrong. The answer is fundamentally an old one: the inability to reconcile conflicting interests and approaches, heavily influenced by limitations on the domestic political capacity to agree to compromises. It proved impossible to reach an agreement that would have been satisfactory for Ireland, not because of any defects in the presentation of our case but simply because, in the clash of wider interests and varying outlooks, the scope to accommodate our needs was not then available.  As I have previously indicated, we had anticipated the difficulties that could arise.  We had put forward a number of proposals for ways to overcome them.  I came back on this several times during discussion on resource transfers when it appeared that there was no agreement for some time on conditions envisaged in the paragraph referred to earlier.  During the course of the discussion I proposed that the Council consider the possibility of <Col N="1338" /> using the Regional Development Fund on the special budget line to which reference was also made, to supplement the transfer that could be made available to Ireland but for the reasons I have just outlined it was not possible to get agreement on my proposals.  On another occasion and perhaps in another atmosphere, some of these proposals might have provided a basis for a solution that would have met our case but, in Brussels last week, this did not prove to be possible.</P>
    <P>Here, I want to pay a warm tribute to the goodwill and to the patience shown by Chancellor Helmut Schmidt in the prolonged effort on 5 December to reach agreement that would enable this country to participate in the system from the outset.  As he himself has indicated publicly, he was prepared to go further than what was eventually incorporated in the resolutions of the Council.  All other members of the Council also showed the greatest understanding of the Irish position, but because, as I have said, of the relationship between what might have been done for us and what would have been required by some members in consequence, a reasonable conclusion was not possible in the atmosphere of the Brussels meeting.</P>
    <P>The resolution which I have presented to this House contains the conclusions of that meeting and many of the details of the new monetary system.  We are still considering the options open to us and certainly will join in the system if we can get the conditions right.  When the Council concluded in Brussels on 5 December last this certainly did not apply&mdash;and the House knows my reaction.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this debate is to afford Members an opportunity to say what their views are on the question of adherence to the new system, which is emerging after months of negotiation among the nine members states, a system of a delicacy and complexity for which there are few parallels in modern times.</P>
    <P>If anything is clear from what I have said it is that this debate is not an occasion for scoring points.  This is a national issue, affecting our future, our position in the Community and our relations with other States individually.  The final decision <Col N="1339" /> has not yet been made because consideration of the questions at issue is still going on: all the details are not yet known.  But the essentials are before this House.  The framework of the system is in the documents I have presented: the reasons for the system and for the Government's view that it could be extremely beneficial, given the right-conditions, have been explained on many occasions in this House and elsewhere; and the attitude of other countries is known.  The House now has a unique opportunity of expressing views and opinions on an issue of vital importance to the future of this country and of the European Community.  I hope that that opportunity will not be wasted.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;deplores the inadequacy of the Government's preparation for the European Council's deliberations on the European Monetary System in Brussels on the 4th and 5th of December 1978, condemns the resulting failure at that Council meeting due to this inadequacy in the preparations to secure adequate transfers of resources as a condition of Ireland's entry, and censures the Government for the various public misrepresentations subsequent to that meeting of what Ireland had been offered by the European Council as conditions of entry into the European Monetary System.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main approach in that amendment is to illustrate and confirm that our failure in those negotiations did not happen in Brussels; it happened long before Brussels.  Before the Taoiseach put his foot into the meeting on 4 December Ireland's case had been lost because we had not adequately prepared ourselves for the type of negotiations in which we were engaged.  We have listened for the last three-quarters of an hour to the Taoiseach giving this House an unprecedented, from any Head of Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;speech which displayed petulance, whining and a very defensive attitude but which was totally uninformative as far as any input into this debate is concerned.  We have for quite a long period, extending over weeks and months, sought from the Taoiseach and the Government certain information which would have led to a more informed debate and which, had the Government treated this House with the confidence and respect with which a Government should treat democratically elected representatives, would have been extremely helpful to the Government and might have saved them from the incompetent mishandling of this case which will have such dire consequences for the future development of this country.</P>
      <P>When I say that the negotiations failed at the preparatory stage I would like to take up a few of the points mentioned by the Taoiseach in the course of his three-quarters-of-an-hour speech here this morning.  It is quite clear from the reaction of the Taoiseach to some of the statements made that they hurt him, and they hurt him because they were true.  They hurt him because they were exposing in clear terms just where the lack of preparation lay and where the Taoiseach and his negotiating team had been negligent to the point of nearly criminal negligence as far as the future of this country is concerned.</P>

      <P>I will ask the Minister a <Col N="1341" /> few questions during the course of this and we might even get an answer at this stage.  The first serious mistake in the preparation which resulted in the failure of the Government in these negotiations happened in Bremen and it happened for two reasons.  First of all, there was a very enthusiastic response by the Taoiseach and the Government to the whole concept of the EMS and there was a refusal by the Taoiseach even to give serious consideration to other possible approaches to the forming of a European Monetary System which could result in the same admittedly desirable object: an end to speculation in European currency and a stabilising of European currency.  There were other ways in which that could have been achieved and some of those other ways would and could have taken into consideration the position of the weaker economies within the European Community.  The Taoiseach brushed that aside and would not even consider it.</P>
      <P>The other really serious mistake&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The other serious and fatal mistake was one which the Taoiseach made and to which I referred here last week.  The Taoiseach in the course of his address this morning said he visited the Heads of Government.  He said that of the countries most concerned with entry into the EMS&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The series of interruptions by the Tánaiste will not serve the purpose which he hopes, namely, to try to diminish, so far as the people are concerned, his part and his incompetence in these negotiations and the failure of these negotiations.  Of the three men sitting over there possibly the one who is least to blame is the Taoiseach but the Tánaiste bears a heavy responsibility and the unfortunate man sitting beside the Tánaiste, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, bears a heavy responsibility in this matter.  If the Tánaiste persists in interrupting, and possibly, even if he does not, I will go into a little more detail about his part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that he visited the Heads of Government of the countries most concerned with entry into the EMS.  One of the Heads of Government that the Taoiseach neglected to visit was the Italian head of Government and Italy played a vital part in the negotiations and indeed in the failure of the negotiations so far as this Government were concerned.  I have had some experience of dealing at European level and at Council of Europe meetings over the four-and-a-half-years of the previous administration.  Some of them are extremely complex and extremely difficult but one of the things that this country has is an excellent mission placed in Brussels who are totally prepared and equipped and able to supply Ministers who are entering into negotiations with very detailed information regarding the position which other countries are adopting, the position which they may as a second position, adopt during the course of negotiations and also very detailed information regarding what may or may not motivate a Government's position in the course of those negotiations.  I do not know where the Minister for Foreign Affairs was or what he was doing in the course of this long series of meetings that the Taoiseach described to us this <Col N="1343" /> morning regarding preparatory work for entry into the EMS.  There is one thing he certainly was not doing: he was not availing of the very expert advice that was available to him and should have been available to the Taoiseach with regard to the possible position of Italy in these negotiations.</P>
      <P>We have heard, and it was repeated over and over again, of all the massive goodwill that there is throughout Europe for Ireland's position.  We had it again this morning, that this goodwill and understanding of Ireland's position was expressed to the Taoiseach so forcibly and so sincerely by the Heads of Government of France, Germany and Denmark. All sorts of people are expressing goodwill towards us.  I believe that those expressions of goodwill were genuine and sincere but they thought they were talking to a man who knew his business; they thought they were talking to a man who knew how the EEC worked; they thought they were talking to a man who would realise that those expressions of goodwill could only be translated into monetary help or assistance if the mechanism could be found within the EEC's structures to do so.  That is obvious. I do not know how the Taoiseach did not seem to realise that.  There was no way that they, under the rules of the EEC, could make a special case of Ireland and give a transfer of resources to Ireland and exclude other countries, who are in a similar economic state of development, from availing proportionately of that transfer of resources. That was an extremely serious mistake. It was an extremely serious lack of knowledge going into these very high-powered negotiations and it led to this country being placed in the position in which it is today.  I will go into that in more detail later on.  It was because of this lack of knowledge of the EEC, which was available to our mission in Brussels but which was not listened to by the Taoiseach or was not conveyed to him by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that mainly led to the dismal failure of the Government's case at the meeting on 4 and 5 December last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect which the Taoiseach <Col N="1344" /> did not refer to this morning but which has been referred to repeatedly up to 4 and 5 December was the figure in regard to the transfer of resources by way of grant of £650 million over a five-year period.  It is reasonable, and I have maintained this day after day over the last number of weeks, for any responsible Opposition to ask how that figure was arrived at.  Surely if we are going to present a case for Ireland and put forward the difficulties that we would experience in the transitional stage of our entry into the EMS, we can only do so if we have an in-depth analysis as to what effect that entry would have on our employment, on our agricultural sector and on industries that may be weak and may go to the wall if they are not shored up during that transitional period.  We were assured by the Government on page 7 of the White Paper that was published that all this would be taken into account.  The White Paper refers to the member states who will participate fully in the system from its establishment and additional Community aid in the order of 200 million European units of account.  The significant part is as follows:</P>
    <P>They were also informed that this estimate&mdash;which was approximate &mdash;was arrived at after a detailed review of the programme of public investment aiding infrastructural and industrial development and the process of its implementation.</P>
    <P>That statement is in the White Paper. This morning in the Taoiseach's address to the House he said:</P>
    <P>There are far too many variables involved for anyone to be able to conclude that any sector would, of necessity, be adversely affected by our entry into the new system.</P>
    <P>We have a detailed analysis of the situation, according to the White Paper, arriving at the £650 million, and this morning the Taoiseach comes into the House and informs us that there are too many variables and nobody can calculate what will be needed or what sectors will be affected, and to what ex-sector will be affected.  The Taoiseach may be trying to blur the situation and trying to get out of his failure and that of <Col N="1345" /> his Government but there are legitimate questions which any Opposition are entitled to ask and which in those circumstances the Taoiseach has a responsibility to answer to the House and to the country.  If we were to go into the EMS under the offer that has been made to us or a slight improvement on it, could the Taoiseach tell us, as a result of the detailed analysis we are told about in the White Paper, how many jobs would be put at risk in this country?  In what industries would those jobs be put at risk and where would they be situated?  Has there been any consultation with the trade union movement, the Confederation of Irish Industry, the FUE, the farmers' organisations?  Have they been told that there will be transitional difficulties within their particular sectors and how the Government intend to overcome them?</P>
    <P>There can only be two reasons why this information is not available to us.  I am inclined to believe the first one when one reads those two contradictory statements from the Government.  The first reason is that there has not been an in-depth analysis of what the repercussions of entry would be and that the Government do not know.  This is further evidence of their lack of preparatory work in the negotiations resulting in their failure.  The second reason is that the number of jobs and the number of industries which would be put at risk under the terms which are now offered are so great that the Government are afraid to tell the country what they would be.  Those are the only two possible reasons why we are not being given this legitimate information.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach not realise that there is widespread fear and uncertainty throughout the business world, that people do not know where they are, that the Government are hopping from one foot to the other?  The Government are telling one member of the press that the matter is under deep consideration, that we possibly will go in, that our options are open.  One of this morning's papers says that it seems that the Government are favourably considering entry.  We had the Minister for Economic Planning and Development last week telling us that the <Col N="1346" /> options were still open and they were still giving it very serious consideration. At the same time the Taoiseach was telling a meeting of business people that under the present circumstances we were not going in.  This is a very complex, detailed and confusing issue to start with, but we have statement after statement, day after day, by members of the Government from the Taoiseach down, to add to the confusion, the uncertainty and the fear that is now prevalent regarding the gross incompetence of the Government in the EMS.</P>

The Taoiseach refused to answer those questions yesterday.  He refused to enter into any discussion on them or give a straight answer to them, but he assured us that all the necessary information would be made available here this morning.  Where is the necessary information regarding Italy's entry and whether or not we have an additional offer, which the Taoiseach promised yesterday to the House and to the people?  We have not had that information.

      <P>There are various statements in this morning's papers.  We can glean some information about what the Government's attitude may be from reading the newspapers.  The Press Gallery have been informed by Government spokesmen about certain attitudes the Government may or may not be adopting regarding entry into the EMS. As far as the Opposition, who were elected by the people, are concerned, we can only try to gather together whatever information we can get from the press because neither we nor the people who will be directly affected can get information from the Government in the House.</P>
      <P>When will Ireland's decision finally be made regarding entry into the EMS? Will it be after 4 p.m. next Friday when the House rises for the Christmas Recess?  Will the decision be made when the Dáil is not sitting and the Taoiseach will further be able to avoid an informed debate in the House when all the facts are known and when the Government's attitude is finally seen to be whatever it will be? If Ireland is to enter the EMS under the terms which are now offered, or under slightly improved terms, the House is entitled to be informed and is entitled to have a debate on that entry. The Taoiseach has an inescapable responsibility in the circumstances which surround this issue to ensure that, if we are going in before 1 January next, the announcement is made in the House and that the elected representatives of the people have an opportunity of discussing the matter before that decision is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the Government are <Col N="1348" /> still in a negotiating position.  What negotiating position are we in? &ldquo;Negotiate&rdquo; implies to me that one is in a bargaining position, that one is in a position to extract something from the other party or parties involved in discussions. Let us look at the result of the Government's mishandling of the negotiations and at the position we are in now.  The first result is that we have now a two-tier Europe.  We have now a situation where this country is officially in the second division as far as Europe is concerned and the first division will forge ahead.  Some members of the Community have been trying to achieve that over several years and the Taoiseach helped them.</P>
    <P>The second result of the gross mishandling of this issue by the Taoiseach and the Government is that, with the British in the position they are now in and with the desire of the other influential members of the Community to have Britain join the EMS, one of the conditions which I genuinely believe they will pursue vigorously for their entry is a complete review of the operation of the common agricultural policy.  At the end of that review we will have suffered severe damage.  Those are the two things which were achieved by the Government in Brussels.</P>
    <P>There are now seven out of nine member states in the EMS.  The United Kingdom and ourselves are not as yet members.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House, if the Government are going in now, will this be on the terms offered in Brussels, which he said then and has repeated a few times since were unacceptable and that he could not recommend them to the Government and the House for entry into the EMS? As a political facesaver for the Government will there be some kind of cosmetic operation added to those conditions to enable the Taoiseach to grab them and join?  If we stay out and after a general election in the UK they decide to join, what do we do in those circumstances? Will we stay out and go it alone?  Will the Taoiseach inform us what the Government's position will be in any of those eventualities?</P>
    <P>We have no negotiating position.  The <Col N="1349" /> Government should acknowledge that and try to cope with the terrible situation in which they have placed us.  While internal political matters influence member states, they also influence this member state and decisions and actions by this Government.  I suggested before and say again now that there is a great danger this Government will enter the EMS without the adequate transfer of resources by way of grant necessary to protect industry and jobs.  They will do it for the most base motives.  They will do it because they have brought the country into such an economic and financial mess and because of what is happening now in the Cabinet room in trying to frame the budget.  Their action will be dictated purely by party political motives and will not be in the best interests of the country.</P>
    <P>People have voiced objections to Ireland going around Europe with a begging bowl.  There may have been some justification for this during the course of the negotiations, explaining that we are a poor nation with a weak economy in the context of the EEC, but can any Irishman accept the fact that now and during the past four or five days our diplomatic corps and all our official State connections are being used in an effort to find some sort of political facesaver for the Fianna Fáil Party?  We are now going around Europe with the begging bowl, not in the interests of the nation but to get a political facesaver for the dismal failure of the Government in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what is on the table if the Government decide to enter now. We are being offered loans&mdash;they are nothing else.  The Government may try to confuse us with talk about a £45 million subsidy.  This £45 million is to subsidise interest payable on the loans.  We are being offered substantial loans at 6 per cent over a 15-year period but it will be five years before we begin repayments. At the end of the five years the £45 million subsidy stops and we are then paying interest at 9 per cent.  We will pay approximately £100 million per year in interest just to service the loan and that is approximately 6p in the £ for a PAYE taxpayer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> We have come a long way from the statements by the Taoiseach and the Government about the massive transfer of resources by way of grant which they sought in the initial stages.  Then there were meetings with the Heads of State of France and Germany.  There was some modification by the Taoiseach when he came to this House and said there would have to be a high proportion by way of grants.  There are no grants on the table for our entry to the EMS but massive loans at 6 per cent.  There is no transfer of resources to help us overcome the initial impact.  We will have to pay handsomely for the privilege of joining.  There is no doubt that the situation in which this country finds itself in relation to the EMS is the direct responsibility of the Government and is directly related to the haphazard, amateurish way in which they prepared themselves for and conducted these negotiations.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this is the end of the EMS.  There will be another announcement from the Government in the near future.  If the Government decide to join and do not do so before the House rises and try to avail of the fact that the House is in recess during the Christmas period, it will be seen by the people as a further evasion of governmental responsibility by the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  I do not know what the outcome of this sorry mess will be.  As far as this party are concerned, we laid down the minimum conditions for our support for entry to the EMS.  We did so because we are convinced that only by these conditions being met can we successfully get through the initial transition period of entry to that monetary system.  Those conditions stand because people are entitled to have the few jobs they now have guaranteed to them and not thrown away by a mad grab for the money on the table as short-term relief for the financial difficulties of the Fianna Fáil Government.  In the long term that action will have disastrous results on the economy and the hopes and aspirations of our people so far as employment is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot can be learned from the tone of a speech and the points of emphasis in it.  In this speech it is quite <Col N="1351" /> evident that we have an exceptionally defensive speech, one full of what might be called negative point scoring, and defensive in a way which is not explicable by the understandable and legitimate embarrassment of the Government in facing this House in the debate at a time when it has not been possible to take a decision.  We all understand that a debate occurring at this time, when the Government are understandably considering the position, is one which has certain limitations imposed on it, perhaps more limitations on the Government than on the Opposition although we too are inhibited in various ways.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances there were various possible approaches open to the Taoiseach.  The one he chose was such as to make me wonder if it was entirely his own.  The smoke screen tactic, in the particular way used today, does not seem quiet in character.  Possibly in this instance he was influenced by other advice as to how to confuse the issues here today.  What he said failed to obscure the contradictions and incorrect statements made by himself and members of the Government.  He tried to suggest that at no time was there any doubt about what decision they had taken in Brussels.  I suppose that is substantially true.</P>
      <P>But there seems to have been a different expression of that decision by himself and his Ministers, depending upon their degree of enthusiasm or lack of it.  He made the position fairly clear that night in Brussels as regards where he stood.  It was somewhat modified the following day by two of his Ministers, who sounded a more positive and optimistic note and led many journalists to believe that, contrary to what the Taoiseach had said, the Government might contemplate entering without any improvement in the terms.  To be fair, the Taoiseach endeavoured to scotch that idea in briefing the press on Wednesday night and I think he has been clear and consistent in his position throughout that we will not join on the terms offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He had difficulties in the Government on this, if there have been divisions <Col N="1352" /> and other views were expressed privately&mdash;and, I am afraid, some publicly&mdash;perhaps that is inevitable on an issue of such importance and he has endeavoured to keep that under control.</P>
    <P>Our complaints do not lie in that area so much, where divergent emphasis by different Ministers has contributed to the confusion.  What he did not deny, because he could not, is that whatever clarity there may have been that night on the decision that was taken, there has been a total lack of clarity since, and there remains even in his speech today a contradiction, with regard to what we were offered.  I would like to trace this through because each time we meet here I hope we have come to the end of the saga and that we will get an account of what happened consistent with what we were told previously and one that is credible.</P>
    <P>In today's speech there is what seems to me a need for a clarification by the Taoiseach in due course of a flat contradiction between the White Paper and the Taoiseach's speech.  This means we have not come to the end of this saga of confusion which started in Brussels when the Taoiseach failed to explain that the £225 million in loans was £225 million a <i>year</i> for five years, when he compounded that error by talking of £45 million in loans each year instead of saying &ldquo;in grants&rdquo;.  As a result of the cumulative effect of his two errors he produced a new picture which was internally valid, because if he had been right that the total was £225 million, it would have been right that the loans per annum would be £45 million.  The two figures he gave and the way he gave them were internally consistent and everybody believed them.  There was no inconsistency that any journalist could check on.  The double error had that effect and it is there the confusion started.</P>
    <P>When he arrived back in Dublin he spoke about a figure of 200 million units of account as being available per annum in loans.  In fact, the figure he was referring to was the figure for Ireland and Italy, which he did not mention, and was for grants not loans.  This second double error further confused the position.  We then had the Minister for Finance and <Col N="1353" /> the Minister for Economic Planning and Development telling us the next day that the Taoiseach got it wrong and the terms were very much better.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development explained about the loan terms, the interest subsidy and the effect it would have through our receiving £45 million a year in grants and he said also that there was a moratorium on which we had not yet put a value.  When the Taoiseach came to the House to explain the position the following day he told us that the moratorium had a value which was included in the £45 million, contrary to what the Minister said on radio the previous day.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil the Taoiseach managed to confuse the position further because he excluded all references to the Ortoli Facility.  He misled the House&mdash;unintentionally, I accept&mdash;into thinking that the loans involved were from the European Investment Bank only.  Those of us who have some familiarity with these loans know that such loans cannot extend to more than 40 per cent of the total amount of the project.  I double checked that figure because I was not 100 per cent certain of it.  If the Taoiseach had been correct and they were only EIB loans, then in order for us to collect £225 million in loans in a given year, we would need to borrow for infrastructural projects over £500 million.  That would have been impossible in any sense, physically or economically.  If you examine the capital programme you will find that, if you add all the headings which contain anything which has ever been defined by the EIB as infrastructural the total for 1978 is £285 million.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out to me in Brussels, while some of these headings include things which could be financed by the EIB, they also contain many things which could not.  We are not in a position from the breakdown to know precisely what the maximum amount of our present capital programme is which could conceivably, under the rules of EIB, be financed from it as infrastructural projects, but we know it is probably much less than £285 million.</P>
    <P>Had the Taoiseach been correct in what he told the House and had I not <Col N="1354" /> checked the documents, what we were being told was that we had the right to borrow £225 million for projects but of course the Government could not conceive that they would ever get the money or the £45 million subsidy because the present infrastructural programme is not big enough and the Government could scarcely, conceivably even if there were no constraints on borrowing, in a period of a year double the total infrastructural programme.  The physical constraints would make that impossible.</P>
    <P>In fact the Taoiseach got it wrong again.  His repeated statement to the House that the money was coming from the EIB was wrong; it was coming from the Ortoli Facility and the EIB.  He has not yet told us what effect this has on the amount we can borrow.  I can give him the information I have from Brussels on this, which is that in those circumstances you can borrow 80 per cent.  I do not know why he has not told this to the House.  The situation is that the information about this whole affair has to come from the Opposition benches making their own inquiries, which the Taoiseach seems to be unhappy about preferring to let us all stay in ignorance if he misleads us and preferring us not to tease out the facts and not be able to contradict him.  I can see the Government pleading that, but the duty of an Opposition is to get the facts and if the Government do not produce them to extract them for themselves and publish them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that with the help of the Ortoli Facility we will be in a position to borrow up to 80 per cent.  This means it is conceivable, on an outside chance, depending on how much under the infrastructural headings listed in our public capital programme is eligible for an EIB loan, that from a public capital programme of the same magnitude next year as this, if it were the same magnitude, we might just be able to borrow £225 million.  That would only be so if every item in our list of infrastructural items qualifies&mdash;I am told that this is not the case&mdash;so that in fact we would have to have a bigger capital <Col N="1355" /> programme than the present one in order to have enough infrastructural investment to get, even at the 80 per cent rate about which we have not been told by the Government, the chance to borrow the sum required in order to get the £45 million subsidy, which is what the Government are after.  The borrowing is irrelevant because we can borrow the money in various places at similar interest rates and whether we borrow it from Europe or elsewhere is irrelevant.</P>
      <P>The position is that we have not borrowed very much from the EIB hitherto partly because the EIB terms are relatively unfavourable&mdash;I shall return to this because it is very relevant to the benefit of the interest subsidy.  The most we have every borrowed up to last year was £52 million last year, which is barely one-fifth of the sum we are now proposing to borrow annually from this source.  The reason is because the terms are fairly harsh and it has not been thought wise to borrow there.  We borrowed elsewhere and without undue difficulty. Neither we nor the Government have been constrained in terms of borrowing money.  The wisdom of the Government's borrowing on the scale they are borrowing is something we contest.  The purpose for which they are using it&mdash; financing budget deficit&mdash;we contest also.  But they have been able to borrow and can continue to borrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of no assistance to us to be told that we can borrow from the EIB.  It means we are borrowing from an institution whose terms are more harsh than those we borrow most of our money from and which we have hitherto tended, therefore, to avoid.  It is not of any advantage; if anything it is marginally a disadvantage.  The only advantage lies in the £45 million interest subsidy, and our ability to touch that interest subsidy depends on our ability to find enough projects to submit in order to borrow £225 million from this not particularly attracjects source.  To do that it is clear that it would be necessary for the Government next year, even if every infrastructural project which could qualify for the EIB were submitted and accepted, to increase <Col N="1356" /> our infrastructural expenditure investment very substantially.  Otherwise, we will not get the £45 million which may, in fact, prove to be a chimera, something we will never actually reach.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that if we are going to increase our borrowing substantially next year for infrastructural projects and simultaneously adhere to what the Government have said about reducing total borrowing from 13 per cent to 10½ per cent then there will have to be very sharp cuts either in borrowing for other parts of the public capital programme or else in the very high current deficit.  Otherwise, the Government would be going back on their own commitment to reduce borrowing.  That commitment is one which the Government have referred to in the White Paper. Paragraph 12 of the White Paper states:</P>
    <P>Ireland indicated that grants were the preferred form of Community aid for the reason that it was the Government's aim to reduce the borrowing requirement as a percentage of GNP, an aim supported by the EEC Commission and in accordance with Community guidelines for Ireland.  Its importance would, if anything, be greater in the context of EMS membership.</P>
    <P>The commitment to reduce borrowing from 13 to 10½ per cent which the Government have undertaken is one which will be of even greater importance to us if we join the EMS.  We do not get the money unless we join, we are talking about what happens if we join and if we join we cannot get the £45 million subsidy unless we increase drastically our infrastructural investment.  If we do that, the effect on the rest of our public spending would be drastic if we have to reduce total borrowing which, apparently, is more important to do in the EMS than outside it.</P>
    <P>None of that has been explained to us by the Government in any shape or form.  I am teasing it out from statements made by the Government and pointing out the logical consequences if one puts the Government statements together, where they are contradictory or where they diverge or where they are based on <Col N="1357" /> different assumptions.  There is, in fact, no logical or coherent picture.</P>
    <P>I object to the fact that in the last debate the House was misled into thinking that the £45 million would come in some automatic way to us.  We were not told that it was a question of project loans or that there were limitations on what the loans could be for.  We were not told that there are strict limitations or that within those limitations we would have to increase borrowing for infrastructure very sharply in order to get the £45 million.  We were not told that the effect of this would be that there would be sharp cuts in other sections of the public capital programme or current expenditure.  We are entitled to be told those things but we still have not been told them today.  They are implicit in the various bits and pieces of statements in the White Paper and in the Taoiseach's speech, but it is necessary for me to spell them out because the Government are not doing their job in this respect.</P>
    <P>So much for the contradictions which have run right through.  I should now like to come to the latest contradictions&mdash;I suppose it is impossible for the Government to make any statement on this subject without contradicting themselves.  I should like to contrast the Taoiseach's statement and that in the White Paper statement as to what was offered by the German Government.  The White Paper stated:</P>
    <P>An increase in the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank and the new financial instrument (Ortoli Facility) amounting to 2,000 million EUA per annum for three years by way of loans for the less prosperous member states, was suggested by the Presidency of which 20 per cent would be available to Ireland.</P>
    <P>What did the Taoiseach say about what the Germans offered us?  It does not bear any resemblance to that statement in the White Paper.  The Taoiseach stated:</P>
    <P>My comment on this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The accusation that he had not done enough home work.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;is that we apparently put forward so strong a case as to lead the <Col N="1358" /> German Presidency to envisage the provision of 2,000 million EUA a year in subsidised loans for five years and a significant grant transfer through what was called a new window in the Regional Fund or a new budget line over a similar period.  On the figures that were in mind, the transfer in grant and grant equivalent to this country could have been as high as £600 million over five years.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach to tell the House which is correct, the White Paper or his speech?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Either one or other of those statements is correct, but the Taoiseach has gone so far as to add up the grant equivalent of the interest subsidy on 2,000 million EUA for five years and to add it to the grant offer made by the German Chancellor and provide the figure of £600 million.  If in fact he is correct about the five years and the White Paper is wrong it is easy enough to calculate, on the basis of the £45 million a year being the interest subsidy with a marginal effect as he pointed out with regard to the length of the moratorium, on the £225 million a year loan over five years, but if the three-year <Col N="1360" /> period is correct then the total amount we would be getting in grant equivalent would be £120 million.  Is the White Paper correct in indicating that the figure is £120 million?  That means the Taoiseach is telling us that the German Chancellor offered him £480 million in grants over and above the grant equivalent of the offer.  Alternatively, if the White Paper is wrong and if the Taoiseach is right, then the grant equivalent of the sum in question so far as I can calculate&mdash;I have to do the calculations on the spot here faced with the Taoiseach's extraordinary divergence from the White Paper&mdash;the effect would be of the order of £200 million in grants in lieu of subsidy for the five years and £400 million in grants from the German Chancellor.</P>

      <P>The White Paper states:</P>
      <P>An increase in the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank and the new financial instrument (Ortoli Facility) amounting to 2,000 million EUA per annum for three years by way of loans for the less prosperous member States, was suggested by the Presidency of which 20 per cent would be available....</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's speech stated:</P>
      <P>...we apparently put forward so strong a case as to lead the German Presidency to envisage the provision of 2,000 million EUA a year in subsidised loans for five years and a significant grant transfer...</P>
      <P>Those two statements are irreconcilable and the two Ministers opposite should not make fools of themselves by pretending to reconcile them.  It is obvious from the faces opposite that they are in a muddle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister is putting a remarkably unconvincing face on this.  The country was misled by a factor of five on the first night, was given another figure which worked out at almost half that when the Taoiseach arrived home, was given another figure the next day by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development which said the moratorium was calculated separately and then a statement by the Taoiseach that the moratorium was included in the calculation of £45 million but with no mention of the Ortoli Facility whatever. <Col N="1362" /> Then, when the Ortoli Facility was finally flushed out we have been given two different versions of what we were offered by the German Chancellor in terms of five years or three years.  This is no way to treat this House.  It is no way to run a Government and it is no way to negotiate.  The Taoiseach knows that well.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder we are in our present difficulty.  I can imagine the reactions in other countries, and we have had one indication of it, to the kind of negotiation going on.  Where a Government do not know what they have got and are incapable on six successive occasions of getting it right, their ability to convince anybody else that they should be taken seriously is very limited.  It is a tragedy at this time that the country is governed in this way and that our possibilities in this affair have been so disastrously handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entire negotiations were misconceived from the first, as the Leader of the Labour Party had identified correctly. I find it quite inexplicable.  On the record of this House there is reference to a series of visits made for previous similar negotiations in which once again the two main countries seeking assistance were Italy and Ireland in relation to the regional fund to which the Taoiseach has referred so contemptuously. In Volume 270, column 1138, of the Official Report dated 20 February 1974, in reply to a question from Deputy O'Kennedy, there is reference to a series of visits I made in relation to the regional fund.  They started immediately after a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Nine in Copenhagen on 9 and 10 September 1973.  Where did I go first?  I went to Rome on 12, 13 and 14 September for meetings on regional policy with the Foreign Minister and Minister for Special Investments for the Mezzogiorno.  Next morning I went to Luxembourg for a meeting on regional policy with the Foreign Minister.  That afternoon I went to Bonn for a meeting on regional policy with the Foreign Minister and that evening I was in Brussels for a meeting on regional policy with Commissioner Thompson.  From 17 September to 21 September I was in <Col N="1363" /> London for a meeting on regional policy with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.  I then went on to The Hague for a meeting on regional policy with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to Paris for a meeting on regional policy with the Foreign Minister and then to Brussels for various Council meetings. That was the order in which we approached this problem.  It was perfectly obvious, and one did not need to be a brilliant diplomat to work out that if we were to come out with anything reasonable from any such negotiations we should first agree with the Italians so that we and they would not trip over ourselves, each looking for more, and giving the others the excuse of saying that neither of us should get anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I did was to visit Italy and reach agreement with the Italians on the ratio between us, and on the fact that we would be entitled, on top of the ratio agreed, to some additional aid when the negotiations was completed.  We negotiated on that basis and at no point in those negotiations did they come to grief because of Italy or Ireland.  They came to grief because the proposal of the Commission was so clearly biased in favour of Britain, without any possible justification, that the French insisted they must have a share in what was obviously going to be a share-out all round.  The French and British insistence on taking almost half of the fund led the German Government, understandably, to ask why should they finance their two main competitors and to cut the proposed fund from 2,400 million units of account to 1,300 million units of account so that the total amount available at the end for countries other than France and Britain was not much more than one-quarter of the sum originally proposed for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all of that there was no error of negotiation on our part and there was no failure in arrangements with Italy.  There were no problems with regard to that. We worked closely with the Italians and, <Col N="1364" /> while the scheme itself was unsuccessful for the reasons I have mentioned and the total amount was reduced, we succeeded in that negotiation and in harmony with the Italians in not tripping over each other and in not having the Italians suddenly finding that we got apparently a bigger share <i>vis-à-vis</i> Italy than they were led to believe.  We got agreement with them.  We sorted out the matter to the point where the original 4 per cent share of the fund originally offered to us was increased to 6 per cent without objection from the Italians.  We increased by 50 per cent our share of the fund in negotiations before we went to the European Council to which the Taoiseach has referred.  It was done in harmony with the Italians, although it involved us getting a bigger share <i>vis-à-vis</i> Italy and a much bigger share than envisaged originally.  This happened because we first negotiated with the Italians, we brought them into our confidence and in that way we succeeded in increasing our share by 50 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We went to the Summit Meeting in Paris at a stage in the negotiating position where the fund was much smaller than we had hoped because of the interaction of France and Britain and because of German reaction to it, but we went to it at least with the starting point of a 50 per cent higher share of that reduced fund and we had sufficient agreement with our Italian friends to go to that meeting and say, &ldquo;We want more on top of that.&rdquo;  We got a small sum more on top of that, at which the Taoiseach has been poking fun.  Eventually we got the equivalent of 6½ per cent as against 4 per cent offered. We got a two-thirds bigger share than we were offered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of a fund which through no fault of our negotiations and through no disagreement with the Italians had been reduced.  I now want to turn from this merited criticism, merited because the basic error was not to go to the Italians first as I had done then, and I do not understand why what was obvious to me was not obvious to the Government, or why, when they had the example of the earlier negotiations, they decided not to follow it, with the result that when it came to the point the Italian obstacle arose, one which has now put our Government in the position where they do not know whether or not to go in, and they are in a state of considerable embarrassment.</P>
      <P>The Italian Government made a decision yesterday to go in.  It is being debated in Parliament now.  It will probably be defeated because the Italian Government have not got the misfortune of having a 20 seat majority.  If defeated the Italian Government will be in a very powerful negotiating position at that stage to seek more.  Could we arrange a small defeat here today just to help the Government because, without that, it is hard to see how this Government, because of the way they have handled this, will get anything more even if the Italians renegotiate and get more for themselves?</P>

      <P>What the Taoiseach dismissed as a trival achievement of topping up what we had already secured at Foreign Minister level&mdash;the 50 per cent increase in our share&mdash;has a possible significance for the negotiation the Taoiseach is engaged in.  It seems clear the Taoiseach has not told us much about the attitudes of individual Governments. Up to a point I understand why.  I do not think it would be helpful to assauge our curiosity at this stage as to who was responsible for what at the meeting, while negotiations are still in progress.  It would be unwise for the <Col N="1366" /> Taoiseach and it might alienate any of the parties concerned by being critical of them.  I say this in fairness to the Taoiseach, whatever may have been said otherwise&mdash;I think some things were attributed to him incorrectly&mdash;so far as I am aware he has been careful to avoid any such criticism which might damage our negotiations.</P>
      <P>In the agreement at the Paris Summit, of which I have here a photocopy taken at the time, with a version of my own handwriting notes on it, the percentages are set out, and ours is 6 per cent.  It is stated that Ireland will in addition be given another six million units of account which will come from a reduction in the shares of the other member states with the exception of Italy.  In other words, there is a procedure by which a sum is taken out and then the percentages which are set out are recalculated, although Italy does not have to pay any share of that.</P>
      <P>Have the Government considered proposing in the renegotiation that the six million units of account, small though it is, and I make no pretence that it is a large sum, could become the basis on which to build a transfer of resources which would come through the regional fund, but which would not affect the expressed percentages for member states? We know the sensitivity of the French Government in particular in relation to their 15 per cent.  They had to negotiate down from a higher figure to 15 per cent, with the UK moving to 28 per cent. It was not easy for the French Government to accept that their share should be barely half that of the United Kingdom when they claimed equal needs in the matter, or almost equal needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That figure of 15 per cent in the form in which it is in the regional fund decision is fairly sacrosanct in French terms. The French President is in a difficult position in that he has not got the kind of majority the Taoiseach has. Sometimes majorities are good. Sometimes they are not too good.  As in the case of the Italian negotiations at present, the French President's lack of majority is unfortunate from our point of view.  Has the Taoiseach considered <Col N="1367" /> proposing that the figure of six million units of account in the regional fund should be increased very substantially, and that it should come from a reduction in the shares of other member states with the exception of Italy, a reduction which would not at any point be expressed in figures and would leave the table of percentages expressed just as they are here?</P>
    <P>The House will note the interesting thing about this table.  It was not recalculated.  It would have been possible arithmetically in two minutes to add on to us the six million units of account out of the fund of 1,300 million UA, and then to re-divide that <i>pro rata</i> among the other seven countries apart from Ireland and Italy.  It could have been done, but it was not done for a very good reason. The French Government did not want the 15 per cent figure altered.  It was on the proposal of President Giscard D'Estaing that this particular solution was arrived at.  There was an alternative proposal from the British Prime Minister and the German Chancellor which would have secured us a few hundred thousand extra units of account but the French proposal was eventually accepted. It was proposed in that way so that the basic percentages remained unaltered in the document.</P>
    <P>Has the Taoiseach considered what seems to me to be a way of approaching this problem, taking due account of French sensitivity, a proposal that the regional fund could be used to help us by increasing by a very substantial amount the six million units of account, while leaving unchanged the table of percentages, as the French President ensured they were left unchanged when this document was published and prepared in December 1974?  I am asking the Taoiseach a rhetorical question.  I am not seeking information about the negotiations which it would be inappropriate to give.  But I suggest that this may be a fruitful line to follow up, for if the sensitivity we are faced with is that of the French President with regard to the regional fund, there is a mechanism which he himself chose in order to help us before, and which he himself could <Col N="1368" /> use in order to help us again, were he so minded to do.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government have not overlooked this in the negotiations.  I hope, though without much confidence, that in the past couple of days this matter has been under discussion.  I would hope that it might provide a solution to the technical problem of achieving a transfer to us, through an existing Community mechanism, in a way which does not tread on the political toes of any of the member states.  So much for that.  I want to move from that suggestion, which I hope is constructive.  I got nowhere in trying to find out whether the loan proposal was for three years or five years, and whether the German Chancellor offered us £400 million or £480 million in grants, which seem to be the figures which derive from the alternative interpretation.  We have been told by two Ministers that it will all be made clear to us at the end, and that by some magic trick, these two opposite or different formulae will be reconciled, and we will then know how much the German Chancellor agreed to offer in grants.  I am glad it will come out at some stage.  I am sorry we cannot hear it now.  Perhaps the next Fianna Fáil speaker will vouchsafe to us this revelation so that the rest of the debate can be carried on with more clarity than we have at present.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask why the interest rate is 9 per cent.  I understand other Governments are raising loans in Europe at interest rates of 6½ per cent to 7 per cent.  Is there not an Austrian loan at present in that range?  It is the case that we have not borrowed much from the European Investment Bank because the interest rates are too high.  How much value has an interest subsidy if it is an interest subsidy on an interest rate which is much higher than the prevailing rate?  Would we be much worse off if we borrowed at 6½ per cent or 7 per cent like the Austrian Government, with no interest subsidy, than if we borrowed at 9 per cent from the EIB with a 3 per cent interest subsidy?  Is this £45 million completely phoney?  Would we get the benefit of it had we never bothered with the European Investment Bank and <Col N="1369" /> simply borrowed this much money in the years ahead from other sources, without being tied down as we are by this, to use the money only for infrastructural purposes, and unable to use the money for any purpose connected with assistance to industry which is what the money is needed for above all.</P>

      <P>If we could borrow on the open market, like the Austrian Government, at 6½ per cent to 7 per <Col N="1370" /> cent, if that is correct&mdash;I put that to the Government; perhaps I have got the figures too low but they are the figures given to me&mdash;where is the great advantage in this?  We can only get this £45 million if we spend far more on infrastructure at a time when we are committed to reducing our borrowing.  To get it, we have to do that extra spending and the interest rate is much higher than the prevailing interest rate we could get elsewhere if we joined the EMS.  What is the purpose of the exercise?  Is it all just dust thrown in our eyes to give the impression that we are getting some great benefit, and to persuade us to join?  Is there so much dust in our eyes that it is misleading the Government into thinking they have got something and it would be worth while joining.  We should be told the answer to that.  We should be told the interest rates at which Governments inside the EMS are now borrowing.  That is the comparison we should make rather than with the interest rates at which we are borrowing now outside, and how different are they from the 9 per cent rate which in the context, seems extraordinarily high and explains why we hitherto have not borrowed much from the European Investment Bank.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Taoiseach had a curious reference.  The Taoiseach was addressing me when he said:</P>
      <P>Does he suggest, having regard to the purposes for which the Community was established, that it would have been sensible to seek to have the reference in question deleted from the draft Conclusions?</P>
      <P>It would have been sensible.  The Taoiseach then went on:</P>
      <P>In any event the basic assumption on which he is apparently acting has no foundation.  There are far too many variables involved for anyone to be able to conclude that any sector would of necessity be adversely affected by our entry into the new system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That sentence would have been more sensible if the Taoiseach had said that there are far too many variables involved for anyone to be able to conclude <Col N="1371" /> that any sector would not be adversely affected by our entry into the new system.  The argument that one cannot be sure that a particular sector will be affected and therefore we must not get any money to help industry because it is only a possibility that we might be affected, is one of the weakest arguments ever put to this House in regard to an external negotiation.  We all know perfectly well that if we join the EMS and if at a later stage we find ourselves with a different parity to sterling, we will be in a weakened financial position and many of our industries will be affected.  We know that if we join and remain at parity with sterling, within this 6 per cent float range, the value of our currency <i>vis-à-vis</i> currencies outside the EMS and sterling will tend to rise.  We cannot be sure of how much and we cannot be sure that we will indefinitely be able to sustain that because of the state of our economy today. We know that our industries will face difficulties, and they know it, and it is a poor argument for the Taoiseach to suggest that there are so many variables that one cannot be sure that some industry might be adversely affected and therefore we should not dream of looking for money for industry in those circumstances. It is probable that some of our industries will be adversely affected, from the beginning, in terms of selling to the countries outside the EMS and sterling. It is also probable that if we are in the EMS and sterling does not maintain its value outside, or joins and subsequently does not maintain its value we would be faced with competition, because of the different value of our currencies. It is precisely because of those dangers that we are looking for aid.  If in joining the EMS nothing will happen and the relationship of our currency to all other currencies remains unchanged, on what grounds is the Taoiseach looking for aid?  The Taoiseach put forward in his speech the reasons why we are looking for aid, and they were that precisely because joining the system will affect the relationship of our currency with others there will be adverse effects on vulnerable industries.  For the Taoiseach to suggest the contrary is not wise or <Col N="1372" /> honest in any negotiation.  The Taoiseach in the White Paper tells us that he sought aid for industry.  Why did the Taoiseach seek aid for industry if, as he says in his speech, it is not necessary? Having said that he sought aid for infra-structure and for industry it is pathetic of the Taoiseach to explain his failure to get aid for industry on the ground that there is no evidence that industry will need aid.  That certainly weakens the Taoiseach's case in this respect.  Page 7 of the White Paper says:</P>
    <P>Because of the need to expand capacity and to improve the rate of growth of productivity, the Government specifically requested that Community aid should aim to support additional investment in infra-structure and industry.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach told us in the White Paper that they are looking for aid for industry and then told us that I am some kind of a lunatic for suggesting that we would want aid for industry. The Taoiseach says referring to me:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> Does he suggest, having regard to the purposes for which the Community was established, that it would have been sensible to seek to have the reference in question deleted from the draft Conclusions?</P>
    <P>What was the Taoiseach doing?  The Taoiseach knows perfectly well that we need aid for industry and that that aid would be struck down as distortion of trade.  The problem is that our industries will face more acute competition.  They have already faced acute competition in the Anglo-Irish free trade area, they faced it because of our EEC membership, and they faced it in a world recession.  The cumulative effect of these three occurrences involved very considerable losses for industry, some foreseen by the Government and the Opposition and some not foreseen.  It is the industries which have already suffered which need aid.  They need aid to enable them to meet the sharper competition that would be involved if our currency has a higher value <i>vis-à-vis</i> the outside world or in the event of sterling joining and eventually moving out of line to a lower level than the ECU <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain as well.  The White Paper says specifically that we sought aid for infrastructure and industry.  We got additional money for investment for infrastructure, with a specific clause that it should not be used to help industry to face competition because that would involve distortion of competition.  The precise aid which is necessary for industry is excluded, and the Taoiseach asks me if I am so foolish to suggest that he should try to have it included.</P>
    <P>I am so foolish as to suggest it and that it should not have been negotiated on the basis of EIB with its present terms of reference without first of all getting a clear agreement that the money could be used to make industry more competitive.  We thought that was what the negotiation was about.  When the Taoiseach says that there are far too many variables involved for anyone to be able to conclude that any sector would of necessity be adversely affected by our entry into the new system, how does the Taoiseach think that will be received by Irish industry?  I am sure <Col N="1374" /> there are no great cheers from the CII at this.  The Taoiseach looked for aid for industry, but now that he has not got it we are told that industry did not really need it at all.  That sort of argument is not serious or sensible, and it is certainly foolish in the middle of on-going negotiations.</P>
    <P>What was submitted to our Community partners as a reasonable argument for the aid we need?  Paragraph 10 of the White Paper says that we informed our Community partners that</P>
    <P>it was estimated that, on the assumption that all member States would participate fully in the system from its establishment, additional Community aid of the order of 200 million EUA&mdash;or £130 million&mdash;a year, over a five year period, would be required.</P>
    <P>We were also informed that this estimate, which was approximate, was arrived at after a detailed review of the programme of the public investment aiding infrastructure and industrial development and the process of its implementation. We were not told that they were given the programme.  We were told they were informed that the estimate was arrived at after a detailed review of the programme.  Were they given the programme or just told that we had looked at our own programme?  If I were a German official I should be singularly unconvinced if I had been told that the Irish Government want £130 million, that they have been looking at their own domestic programme, that while they have no intention of showing what is in it they need £130 million for the purpose of financing it.  As a method of negotiating it is pretty puerile.  If the programme was submitted it is curious that the White Paper does not say so.</P>
    <P>What is this programme?  It is a programme of public investment aiding infrastructure and industrial development for a five year period.  Where is this programme?  Is it contained in the other White Paper which we have not seen? We know what the public capital programme is year by year.  We have had a Green Paper, various documents, even a manifesto, but I am not aware of the publication of a programme of public <Col N="1375" /> investment aiding infrastructure and industrial development over a five year period.  If it exists, why is it secret?  Why are the Government not telling us or any other Government what is in it?  This alleged document has been used as a basis for arriving at a figure.  There is no suggestion that the £130 million is based on anything.  It was not said that the programme of investment for aiding infrastructure and industrial development, which over the period is of the order of magnitude of £X million, will require to be increased by so much, and for this we need aid.  If that was said, we have not been told.  It would appear that the programme was not submitted.  Was it that the programme was non-existent or was it scratched together on the back of an envelope and was that not the kind of thing that would impress foreign governments?  As a method of negotiation, what is described here explains why we got so little.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the White Paper is singularly deficient in any attempt to suggest what the effect of membership might be on our economy. It has not much to say about this subject. Fortunately, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is, as usual, helpful.  As we read in <i>Magill</i> magazine, to which one has to go as a source of information about this Government, the Minister explains:</P>
    <P>If both Britain and Ireland were to go into the EMS then without offsetting action it would be expected that the growth rate would be lower and therefore increases in employment would be lower.  The borrowing rate would be higher but the inflation rate would be lower because the EMS would have a deflationary impact.</P>
    <P>That is a very succinct explanation.</P>
    <P>If Britain stays out and we go in, then all these factors would be exacerbated: the growth rate would be even lower, employment lower, the borrowing rate even higher and inflation lower at least within a few years of entry.  Ireland could also encounter balance of payments problems, possibly leading to a run on the Irish <Col N="1376" /> punt&mdash;perhaps even forcing us out of the EMS.</P>
    <P>I should add that it says, &ldquo;O'Donoghue, however, refused to comment on any issues relating to possible devaluation.&rdquo;  I should say that lest what I have read out would suggest the contrary.</P>
    <P>That is the Minister's assessment of the effects of going in without offsetting action.  It is a pretty grim picture except in so far as the ultimate effect will be favourable so far as inflation is concerned. What does &ldquo;offsetting action&rdquo; mean?  It is not clear from the context as to what it means.  My first reading of it is that it could mean the £45 million or whatever we get from the Community. Does the Minister seriously suggest that £45 million in transfers per annum for five years would have the desired effect?</P>

      <P>It does not seem that the sum of £45 million would be likely to have sufficient effect to do all the things that are necessary to deal with an exacerbated fall in the growth rate, an exacerbated reduction in employment and an exacerbated increase in the borrowing rate.  When one reads the article further the impression one gets is that he is talking of action that we might have to take.  The article says that he avoids the question of devaluation.  He seems to be talking about action on our part.  Is it the action he is reported as referring to yesterday&mdash;statutory wage control?  Is that the offsetting action needed if we join, having failed to get adequate terms in the negotiations?  Is that what the Dáil is debating today?</P>

It is a very uninformative way to run a Parliament if neither during a debate nor at Question Time can a question of that kind be answered.  If we are debating a Government failure in negotiation of such a magnitude that offsetting action, in the words of the Minister, would be needed on a scale that requires statutory wage control, then we should have been told this at the beginning.

It would be better if that matter had not been raised at this time, and I am speaking there in national terms, not party terms.</P>
      <P>We should have been given some attempt to assess the adverse affects of membership and some attempt to assess the benefits of the aid that is being offered to us or, indeed, the benefit that would come from the aid we sought.  We should be told in the White Paper also what action the Government propose to take in regard to the economy in the event of membership.  All that we now have, and it is a rather unfortunate outcome of the whole thing, is that the psychological atmosphere has been created in this country in which there is a widespread belief that the Government are now thinking of entering, despite the very clear statement of the Taoiseach that he would not recommend these terms to the Government, without any further concession, because of pressure from some Ministers with regard to the balancing of the budget, the easing of budgetary constraints so that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to accept that what is now appearing on all our papers has suddenly grown totally spontaneously.  We know that occasionally a story may appear in one paper which is ill-founded and speculative perhaps as a result of a journalist chancing his arm but more often because something that has been said has been misunderstood.  So, when we see reports appearing in all the papers in relation to a matter of Government policy, in my experience, in government and in opposition it is usual to find that report emanated from some Government source; otherwise, one does not get this spread across the papers.  If I am wrong on this occasion I am glad.  I am unhappy with the impression that is being created at this stage.  Apart from anything else, it is greatly weakening the Government's bargaining position; it is no help to the Taoiseach in this situation when the possibility remains of securing better terms and when I have suggested a mechanism by which they might be secured, to have rumours being fostered that we are going to join anyway, in other words telling the French President <Col N="1382" /> and the German Chancellor not to waste money on the Irish, that they will join when the Italians do, without any further assistance.  It is very unfortunate that these reports should occur in this form, and if they derive from divisions in the Government made manifest on radio last Wednesday, it is not to the credit of this country.</P>
      <P>All we are talking about derives basically from our present economic situation. Towards the end of 1976, we were at the end of a period when the value of sterling had fallen by 35 per cent and when it showed no signs of stopping, and there was no indication of any intervention to halt it and when we had imported in 18 months in respect of half of our total consumption 35 per cent inflation&mdash;in other words, we would have had 17½ per cent inflation at home deriving solely from the decline in the value of sterling, discounting price increases of goods in the sterling area or elsewhere and wage increases at home.  Just from the one single source, the fall in the value of sterling had increased inflation by 17½ per cent in 18 months at a time when we were desperately trying to bring down inflation&mdash;at that stage we as a Government had to consider seriously whether we could continue to maintain our relationship with sterling if this was going to go on.  First, we took certain precautions in order to be technically able to make a change should it be necessary.  We also considered what budgetary action would be necessary to put the country in a condition where it could face this.  As it happened, an intervention by the German Government saved sterling before the end of 1976. Had we been an irresponsible Government we would then have decided that the danger had been removed, and hopefully would not recur in the near future and as we had an election coming up, that we should go out and spend the necessary money to purchase the votes of as many people as possible and return to power.  Then we could tidy up everything afterwards and cope with the problems of breaking with sterling without any aid from anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We decided not to do that.  We took a decision that in the circumstances it was <Col N="1383" /> not certain that sterling would hold&mdash;it has held much better than we expected; our fears in this respect proved unfounded. But we took so seriously the future national interest that, because we feared that sterling might fall again and that we might have to sever that link in the next year, we decided that the kind of budget we would have would not be an election budget, that it had to be a budget which would hold the current deficit at the then existing level and would reduce significantly our borrowing. That was not an easy decision, and there was much argument and discussion about it.</P>
    <P>Finally, what prevailed was the national interest: we could not face into 1977 in a position where we might be forced into severing this link but with an economy so reflated and inflated by the actions of a Government trying to win an election that we would be unable to make that break and would be forced to stay linked with sterling, forced to continue to import inflation at a disastrous rate.  We put the nation first, and we were defeated by a Government which put first not the nation but their own vote-catching activities.  As a result we now have a situation where on the Taoiseach's own statement it is not possible for us to enter this Community even with the offer of £1,125 million in soft loans and subsidised interest rates, giving us £225 million in grants over five years.  The Taoiseach says it is insufficient.</P>
    <P>I take his word for it; he knows the state of the economy; he is in Government. He has every interest in entering the EMS if he thought the terms were right.  Certainly it has been no pleasure for him to come home from the meeting the other day and to announce that it had not been successful.  Had he thought that he could responsibly enter the system, he would have done so on Tuesday night last.  He did not because he knows that the economy of this country is now, after 18 months of his Government, not in the position we left it in deliberately so as to enable us, if we had to, to make the break with sterling without any aid, because there was no <Col N="1384" /> aid on offer then.  We are in the position now that even though substantial aid is on offer it is not sufficient, in his view, to cope with the problems created for this country by the way the economy has been mismanaged in the last 18 months. He is right; he is right not solely because of what has happened, because of the way in which we have had this consumer boom, because of the fact that although when we left office exports were rising much faster in volume than imports, for the last six months the volume of imports&mdash;which can be calculated from the monthly series, and I am sure the Minister for Economic Planning and Development has done it as I have done&mdash;has risen by 20 per cent and exports by 8 per cent.  We are moving towards a severe balance of payments difficulty.  Why?  For two reason: first of all, because on the import side, the Government's policies of inducing a consumer boom&mdash;9 per cent increase in consumption&mdash;in present circumstances led to an enormous increase in imports because in fact the kind of consumer boom they produced is one concentrated on imports.  What is the biggest single source of additional imports?  Motor cars&mdash;and the Government took specific action that encouraged the purchase of motor cars and an enormous increase&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not be long, but I want to make the point that the Government, by promoting a consumer boom and a massive increase in imports and by the policies they pursued, which were alienating for trade unions and workers and led to a wage round which turned out to be grossly excessive and has now led to a breakdown of any wage negotiation, has left the country in a situation in which the Taoiseach feels&mdash;and he must make his own judgment, I have to take his judgment as correct in this&mdash;that we cannot afford to enter this European Monetary System even with £1,125 million of loans and £225 million of grants.  Even that is not enough to salvage the position after 18 months of Fianna Fáil.  When we left office <Col N="1385" /> we had prepared&mdash;at the cost, all right, of losing office&mdash;the country to be able to join, with an economy tightly held and in a position, not to join the EMS, but to break the link with sterling, without any aid because at that stage no such aid was on the cards at all.  It is that failure we indict in this debate today as well as the failure in the negotiation itself.</P>

      <P>There have been so many misstatements and misrepresentations that it is not going to be possible to follow all of them.  But while it is fresh in Deputies' memories, might I refer to the point just made by Deputy FitzGerald when he said the previous Government, in the national interest, had prepared the economy for breaking the link with sterling with no aid from anywhere.  The Deputy indicted us, amongst other things, because of the extent of our borrowing. What are the facts?  One memorandum came before the previous Government on this matter.  It came in January 1976 before the budget came out.  In that year the borrowing of that Government was higher, as a percentage of GNP, than it is this year about which Deputy FitzGerald is complaining.  It is totally dishonest of Deputy FitzGerald to make those kinds of statements and to pretend that there is some truth in them.  What he is saying to us is that, having considered the whole matter in 1976, the then Government considered the necessity of breaking the link with sterling and, in the light of that, they prepared the economy for this situation.</P>

      <P>Following that memorandum they ran the country on a basis of a higher percentage borrowing of GNP than this year, which we say is too high, and have always said is too high.  It is because of what we inherited from Deputy FitzGerald and his friends that we are in this position.  However, the facts are that Deputy FitzGerald, in what he has just been saying, has been <Col N="1386" /> trying to mislead the House and the country.  Indeed he might like to be reminded that that memorandum which he brought before the Government &mdash;since he was talking earlier about pay pauses&mdash;contemplated a pay and incomes pause.  I mention this solely to demonstrate to the House, while it is fresh in people's memories since Deputy FitzGerald sat down&mdash;how much importance can be attached to the kinds of statements he has been making today and previous days.  Today for the first time we have an opportunity to answer the allegations that are being made. On each of the previous occasions &mdash;because of the structure of the situation under the Rules of the House&mdash;we had a statement from the Taoiseach, a statement from Fine Gael, a statement from Labour and no opportunity to answer.  Obviously, even in this early stage of today's debate, the opportunity to answer is one the Opposition do not welcome the Government having.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the EMS is concerned our basic stance, from the beginning, has been clear and unambiguous.  We made it quite clear there were two primary reasons we wanted to enter the EMS: political, because of its immense importance in its own right and its potentially greater importance in achieving much greater unity in Europe; economic, because we could see that, properly handled&mdash;and that is an important qualification because it puts an onus on the Government and on the people if we did go into the EMS&mdash;we could end up with a much lower inflation rate, lower interest rates and greater potential for growth.  Therefore, for those reasons, we regarded the EMS as extremely important and we said so.  We said we wanted to join.  The only question was: could we afford to join and to survive the stresses that would be imposed on the economy in the early stages?  We put a figure on the table in regard to transfer of resources to enable us withstand these strains.  We confined our arguments and our assessment of transfer of resources to the context of the EMS.  We did not&mdash;as some other countries did&mdash;try to bring in various other matters such as the common agricultural policy and the general situation in regard to budgetary <Col N="1387" /> transfers in the EEC&mdash;whatever problems exist there exist independently of the EMS, existed before and will exist in the future.</P>
    <P>One thing that emerged was that our approach to the EMS was different from that of Britain.  Unfortunately, we found we had inherited a situation from the previous Government in which, within the Community, we were regarded merely as an appendage of Britain.  Our views on matters of this kind were not of any real account because it was assumed that whatever Britain did we would do. In many cases it was not even thought necessary to consult us.  We inherited this situation and it took some time for the penny to drop amongst our other Community partners.  This became quite clear to me at meetings of the Economic and Finance Ministers when, having made our position clear, I found we were still being treated as if we did not count, as though all that counted was the attitude that Britain would take.  But suddenly the penny dropped and there was a total change in the attitude of our Community partners.  I think I can say with confidence that however this matter ends up&mdash;whether we are in or out of the EMS&mdash;our stature in the Community in future will be completely changed from what it has been under the previous Government.  We may rest assured that, in future, attention will be paid to Irish views on matters of finance and economics.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of misconceptions, some of which are genuine and some of which have been, I think, deliberately fostered.  I would like to deal with them briefly.  First of all, the suggestion has been made regularly, and it was repeated again by Deputy FitzGerald this morning, that we were depending on transfers arising out of the EMS in order to have a satisfactory budget.  The fact is, and I would have thought that Deputy FitzGerald should know this, Estimates are prepared a long time back. They are discussed by the Government. No Government could possibly be preparing Estimates in the present situation on the basis of what might come from the EMS.  We could not know <Col N="1388" /> when we were preparing the Estimates whether we would be in or out and we could not know what we were getting. Estimates have been prepared, and are virtually finalised in discussions at the Cabinet without any reference to the EMS, and our budget stance is being prepared on the basis of our economic strategy as outlined repeatedly before, during and since the last general election.</P>
    <P>When I said here, in response to a question by Deputy Barry about the date of the budget, that the date could be affected by the EMS I had two things in mind&mdash;one was the sheer physical pressure on a number of Ministers, not least on the Minister for Finance, arising out of the EMS and the negotiations, not all of which, of course, are taking place abroad.  I do not think it requires any great stretch of the imagination to appreciate the amount of time of a Minister for Finance that could be taken up in a matter like this, and that could affect the date on which the budget could be brought in, the sheer physical pressure involved and the ability to get through the ordinary heavy schedule of work at this time when added to by EMS requirements. The other things I had in mind was that if we joined the EMS, and this was before the Summit, there could well be sums of money being received which would have to be dealt with in the public capital programme.  These were the two things I had in mind and these were all I had in mind.</P>
    <P>In addition, I should say that the delay, and there has been some delay, in the production of the White Paper on the economy is also primarily due to the sheer physical pressure on the time of some Ministers, and especially on the Government as a whole, as a result of the unusual pressure we are under at the moment.  I am not complaining about that in the least.  I am merely explaining that there is a limit to what any individual or Government can accomplish in a given time.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made by Deputy FitzGerald and others pretending that there is some discrepancy between what the Taoiseach said after the Brussels Summit in regard to whether we were rejecting, <Col N="1389" /> accepting or reserving our position on what emerged at the Brussels Summit and what the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and I said.  There is, of course, no contradiction. If you look at what the Taoiseach said he did not close the door on the possibility that, having examined the situation and explored every possibility, we might still go into the EMS. That is what the Minister for Economic Planning and Development said and that is what I said when I referred to an episode which was not yet finished.  By now I hope it is clear to everybody that the episode has not yet finished.  That is simply all we were saying, and there is no contradiction whatever between what the Taoiseach said and what we said.  It is simply mischief-making to suggest there is any contradiction.  It is even more mischief-making to suggest that I, or any other Minister, is trying to pressurise the Taoiseach into accepting terms he said he could not recommend.</P>
    <P>The only thing that has happened&mdash;it is perfectly straightforward and now, I hope, obvious to everyone&mdash;is that further possibilities are being explored. And that is all we said would happen. That is what is happening and if, as a result of that exploration, there is a change in the position, then obviously the Government could well decide to enter into the EMS.  There is no decision on that yet because the full process of exploration has not been completed.  But there is no more to it than that, and I wish people would cease to misrepresent what is clearly a plain, straightforward situation by pretending that there are pressures within the Government and struggles within the Government on this issue.  There is no foundation whatever for that statement.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested in some quarters that there has been some excessive enthusiasm for the EMS on my part and on the part of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in contradistinction to the attitude of the Taioseach.  That was before the Summit. Anybody who has said that has not tried to produce any evidence in support of that statement.  The basic position we have adopted has been quite clear.  We <Col N="1390" /> want to go in for the reasons I mentioned earlier but we have at all times, each one of us, speaking on this, made it clear that whether we went in or not depended on the terms we could get in regard to the transfer of resources and, if we could not get satisfactory terms, we would not go in and, if we could, we would.  I defy anyone to point out any contradiction between anything said by the Taoiseach and any of his Ministers in this regard prior to the Summit.</P>
    <P>We come now to the question of what went wrong at the Summit.  This, of course, is extremely relevant to all the allegations we have been hearing about the manner in which we negotiated beforehand, the amateur manner, to quote Deputy Cluskey.  Offhand, I cannot remember the words Deputy FitzGerald used but he was certainly denigrating the approach we made to the preparation.</P>

      <P>I have outlined what our stance was and I have made it perfectly clear to all our Community partners.  I met my opposite number in each of the other Community countries. I discussed with each outstanding technical aspects of the EMS, our case for resource transfers, and one other matter to which I shall come in a moment.  Arising out of these bilateral discussions and bilateral contacts it is now a matter of public record, either from what we said or the representatives of the other countries said following these bilateral contacts, what the attitude of these countries was before the Summit, with one qualification which I will now explain.  That qualification relates to the French position.  It was not a matter of public record, but it was known to us and to every other member of the Community before the Summit that the French had objections and reservations about the use of the Regional Fund as a method of transferring resources, but having made clear their objections they made an alternative proposal, which was described as &ldquo;a line in the budget&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at what happened at the Summit.  Which country departed from <Col N="1391" /> the stance they were taking?  All this is on public record.  It was not the French, and I suggest that any reasonable assessment of what happened makes it clear where the problem was and why it occurred. We have been told that we were naïve, that we were misled or some such thing.  The fact is that we assessed correctly the attitude of each of the countries concerned.  But I have to go further and say that in all my bilateral contacts I discussed the matter I have already mentioned and then I discussed the possibility that the Summit might turn out precisely as it did.</P>
    <P>From the beginning we were aware of this danger and we drew the attention of each of our Community partners to it. We raised it, they did not.  We raised it with all of them, and nobody can say with any justification that we were not aware of precisely what was going on and of the dangers that existed.  Understandably, many of our Community partners reacted on the basis that in advance of its happening they could not contemplate a failure of the effort to establish the EMS&mdash;they could not assume that some countries would not go in and might even go so far as to veto arrangements being prepared for those who were going in.  I understand that attitude.</P>
    <P>But do not let anybody try to tell us that we did not know what was going on, and that we did not tell our Community partners what was a distinct possibility. Deputy Cluskey came in here some time ago and laid down a set of conditions for entry.  The first one was that there should be £650 million in grants, and not a penny less, and no strings attached.</P>

      <P>Yes, but he had a whole lot of other conditions.  In the last weekend his stance changed to &ldquo;an adequate transfer of resources&rdquo;.  I want to put a question which I hope some member of the Labour Party will answer: what is the stance of the Labour Party on the EMS?

Does it mean we should not be looking for any transfer of resources, or where do the Labour Party stand?</P>

      <P>Now we come to Deputy Cluskey, backed up today by Deputy FitzGerald with a total misunderstanding of what has been going on.  Let me refer to a statement by Deputy Cluskey as reported in the Official Report for 7 December at columns 1013 and 1014.  He said:</P>
      <P>In a series of visits which he made, the Taoiseach did not seek to meet Mr. Andreotti, the Italian representative at these talks.</P>
      <P>He then went on to quote from an interview the Taoiseach gave, and he referred to this sentence by the Taoiseach:</P>
      <P>But unfortunately there were other members who were regarded as the less prosperous countries and they did, of course, expect that they proportionately would get what we would get.  So I think that was an inhibiting factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has Deputy Cluskey to say about that?  Where is the evidence out of the Taoiseach's mouth that he should have gone to see Mr. Andreotti in advance?  It just shows how totally blind and brainwashed Deputies Cluskey and FitzGerald, who backed Deputy Cluskey up today, are.  That sentence to <Col N="1393" /> them is being interpreted only as involving Italy.  Let them have another look at the sentence and try to find the reality of the situation.  I will tell you the position in regard to Italy.  We had an understanding with the Italians and they did not depart from it.</P>

      <P>If Deputy FitzGerald wants to hear something let him stay quiet.  I have a limited time, he did not. For Fine Gael, Deputy P. Barry said that the £650 million over a five-year period was ten times too small.  Deputy FitzGerald&mdash;I suppose it is some advance on that&mdash;said it was five times smaller than our demands should have been.  Deputy FitzGerald said the EMS is a <i>de facto</i> EMU.  Will he deny that?  I will quote it to him if he wants it.</P>

If he is not prepared to say so, why on earth does he ask the Government, who are negotiating, to say so?</P>

When he gets the chance, would he go back and look at what he was quoting?  He will find the explanation quite simple.  The White Paper was quoting what the German Presidency was putting before the Summit; the Taoiseach's statement quoted what the German Presidency had indicated in the course of negotiations.  As the Taoiseach told Deputy FitzGerald, until he is elected to the Taoiseach's position there will be things going on which he will not know about.</P>

      <P>The theme that came through from what was said earlier, particularly on the Fine Gael side, was that we should follow the British, that we should be very cautious.  Deputy Barry's speech had many references of this kind, but I do not think that is the right approach for us.  Deputy Cluskey told us today that he has lots of experience in this area of negotiation while Deputy FitzGerald, about whom we have been reading for years in terms of his being an outstanding international negotiator, went all out to achieve his aim in regard to the Regional Fund but for a period of three years, 1975 to 1977 the total amount received by this country from that fund was £18.8 million.  If we give the Deputy the benefit of the doubt and take the allocations for those years as distinct from the receipts the total was £35 million.  These are the great negotiators who tell us that we do not know what is going on, that we do not know how to negotiate.</P>

      <P>We refused a better <Col N="1396" /> offer for one year than the people opposite got for three years despite their marvellous knowledge of international affairs.  The EMS is an immensely important concept, but there has not been any evidence of vision on either side of the Opposition regarding what the system could do for us not only economically but psychologically.  This Government were faced with that prospect earlier on and took the basic decision that EMS was very important for us and that we should go for it if we could get in and get the terms right.  Our whole approach has been consistent. The results that have come from the Summit have been disappointing, but they were far better than anything that was achieved by the people opposite in any other circumstances.  As I said earlier, the episode is not finished yet. We are following up various possibilities, but regardless of the outcome ultimately, the prospect of entry into the EMS has focused attention on important aspects of life, economic and otherwise, in this country.  Our stature in the Community is improved enormously.  If we join the EMS we shall have serious problems but we have never pretended otherwise. However, if as a people we are prepared to accept the challenge we can be certain that if the decision to enter is taken, it will be the most important decision ever taken by this country since the signing of the Treaty.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance indicated that our stature in the Community will be changed completely in the future.  I agree that it will be changed but at this stage the Government would be well advised to put the country out of agony and indicate that it is not intended to join the EMS on the basis of the terms negotiated, and negotiated so incompetently.  Unless they make such an announcement very soon&mdash;and I do not think they should wait for another 48 hours as obviously they will not be offered any great improvement on the terms negotiated&mdash;the whole matter will descend to the level of being no more than a situation of a group of political corner boys hanging <Col N="1397" /> around for another few bob.  Our national interest is not served by an exercise of that kind.</P>
      <P>The standstill in the negotiating position of our Government has been underlined by the Taoiseach's speech this morning.  There is no movement.  The Government are playing a public relations cat-and-mouse game of alleged explorations at diplomatic level.  In other words, they are phoning the Italian President to know if he has heard of anything, when we know that the Italians have not been able to effect any changes in their negotiating position.</P>
      <P>This morning we had an uncharacteristically petulant contribution from the Taoiseach in which he descended to the level of a mere attack on the Opposition.  This is about the last refuge of anybody who has nothing important to contribute.  The Taoiseach's statement gave no further information regarding the negotiations.  Neither did it indicate any further prospect of a change in our negotiating position, and we are left without any hope of an improvement in the negotiations in which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs participated in Brussels.</P>

      <P>At the end of the day after all the to-ing and fro-ing, after all the peddling of the alleged poverty of this country around the capitals of Europe by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, we are left with the prospect, and only the prospect of an interest subsidy which, in certain circumstances that are not in any way outlined because essentially they relate to infrastructural projects about which we still have not had any information, would be 67 million EUAs or £45 million cash per year for five years, making a total of £225 million over a period, and on the clear understanding that the funds provided would have to be concentrated on financing selective infrastructural projects and programmes.  To this extent the Taoiseach has been dishonest intellectually in his approach while the Minister for Finance has been dishonest in the <Col N="1398" /> context of the public capital programme. If the Minister had come into the House and told us that we would get about £50 million in terms of capital for telephone expansion or that we would get £70 million in terms of road structural development or that we would seek £50 million or £60 million in the context of harbour development, we would know at least what he was talking about in the context of the public capital programme relative to the EMS.  But all the Minister has done&mdash;and the same can be said of the Taoiseach&mdash;is to attack the Opposition, to adopt the attitude of &ldquo;let us have a go at Deputies FitzGerald and Cluskey in the hope of confusing the issue&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>We know from long political experience that this is the only way to keep one's troops happy when one is cornered and having made a right mess, not so much of the negotiations but in relation to the Government's public relations in that regard.  The public stance of the Government was incredibly bad prior to the negotiations because it was giving the game away all over the place through every visit.  It was so uncharacteristic of the Taoiseach; he was so effusively anxious of accommodation, so understanding of the position of the British Prime Minister, the French Prime Minister and so on.  Since these negotiations started I have met Social Democrats from Germany, France, Britain and so forth, as a member of the Council of Europe at a meeting recently, and they were not impressed by this kind of European effusiveness on the part of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in trying to con their way into a situation where the negotiating power that they had was extremely limited.</P>

      <P>I will come to that. We have a situation of direct relationship with and integration into the sterling money market.  I have found a of business people in this country are <Col N="1400" /> not very sympathetic to Labour party policies, but in so far as they are bemused and perplexed by what Fianna Fáil are up to on the EMS, many of them are prepared to talk.  They are appalled that all that the Government seem to be preoccupied about is to have some moneys for the public capital programme of next year or perhaps the year after, and, if that situation is resolved, what the effect of entering into the EMS will be in relation to a wide range of sensitive industries which are now at direct risk on entry.  As Deputy Cluskey pointed out, we all were bemused this morning when we heard in the Taoiseach's speech that there are far too many variables involved for anyone to be able to conclude that any sector would of necessity be adversely affected by our entry into the new system.  Surely that is giving their game away.  If that was the attitude of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste when they were going off to the capitals of Europe pleading poverty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I tell the Tánaiste that I am perfectly well aware of that and I do not have to be given that elementary lesson in monetary and economic affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will sum up this aspect of my contribution. I have a human sympathy for the Taoiseach in this situation.  I would not like to enter into any negotiating position&mdash;something which as a trade union official I did for a number of years&mdash;with not many cards in my hand.  It is never pleasant to have to do that with not much strength behind your application and with really not much more than a lot of prior public relations with the capitals of Europe.  We were not entering into these negotiations from a position of great national strength; to some extent we were entering from a position of national weakness by virtue of the Government's budgetary policy. Any of the German, British and French whom I met kept saying to me: &ldquo;If you are that poverty-stricken how could you abolish your domestic rates and car tax?&rdquo;  I kept saying that we really are very poor, we have no money in this Republic of Ireland where the Government were enabled to do all those things. In fact we were so well off we could even abolish our wealth tax because it did not really matter.  Generally speaking, therefore, I have a human and personal sympathy for the situation in which the Taoiseach found himself, but it was quite uncharacteristic and unnecessary that he should have allowed himself to get such a kick in the groin as he got.  I am very surprised that a person so politically <Col N="1402" /> astute should mishandle the matter so seriously.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have to address ourselves to the central question, should we on the basis of the known terms at this stage consider entry into the EMS? In the national interest the answer is unequivocally no.  The terms as now known and any minor improvements which may emerge from them in the next 48 hours do not warrant entry at this stage and do not warrant the kind of alignment and the risks inherent in that situation. That is the issue in this debate. Whether the Taoiseach was tired when he got off the plane on his way home from Brussels is not an issue here.  It is not an issue whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs has not much knowledge of economic affairs.  It is not an issue that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development&mdash;to my amazement and amusement as a fellow constituency colleague&mdash;continues to make a colossal eejit of himself now and again, almost every third day when he comments on different issues.  I am surprised at my colleague in the Dún Laoghaire constituency who, in his bemusement of alleged academic honesty, seems to walk himself headlong into it and then blames the media.  I suppose before Christmas we will all be blaming Santa Claus when more confusion emerges in relation to the Government's approach.</P>
    <P>Europe do not particularly feel that they owe us very much.  Europe have not been impressed by this alleged Irish pace.  The Premiers of Europe have not been impressed and neither have the Finance Ministers, and as a result we have been offered very little by way of relief on entry.  Until such time as we would have a major response from the other countries of the nine we would be incredibly ill-advised to proceed to entry on that basis.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the reference by the Tánaiste, who let another four-legged hare out of the bag when he spoke about the regional fund.  He stated that to date Ireland's income from the regional fund in the past three years was £18.8 million.  This should be noted by Deputies in the context of all the talk about regional fund income which we <Col N="1403" /> have had here.  When one thinks about it, what effect has that on our national economy in terms of the budget?  We have a budget which is currently running well over £2,000 million a year.  The Tánaiste admits that for all practical purposes in terms of any major impact on infrastructure here the regional fund is non-existent.  It is not a regional fund. It is not having any real impact on the Irish infrastructural situation.  The Tánaiste said that Ireland's national quota income from the fund on the basis of national quotas has been £18.8 million over three years.  It is not even one half of one per cent of our national budget.  It is even less than that.  How do we have the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste careering around Europe asking for &ldquo;another window&rdquo;, to quote the German President, to be opened in the regional fund for Ireland to get another bit of money when in fact what we got over the past three years is miniscule; it is irrelevant; it is not worthy of being called a regional fund.</P>
    <P>I apply the same criticism to the social fund in that regard.  Last year we got £4 million from the social fund.  It would not even add up to point one of 1 per cent of our total national budget.  It is a miserable amount of money.  There is no social fund inflow of any real consequence into this country.  There is no regional fund inflow of any consequence into this country, and it would be the height of folly to expect that at the Summit, the Taoiseach would have transformed the regional fund income and that the Tánaiste would have so succeeded as well.  My view is that until such time as there is a prospect of real income from the regional fund and until such time as that money is forthcoming&mdash;and it obviously has been totally opposed by the French&mdash;we should not enter into the EMS even in the context of money for infra-structural development here.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, early on in the Bremen situation the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste were caught up with this republican euphoria of breaking the link with sterling. That I would suppose is article No. 5.  After Partition and after the national <Col N="1404" /> language I suppose breaking the link with sterling would be about the greatest thing that the Taoiseach would like to go down in history on; he could comfortably retire on that.  But the reality is entirely different.  We have an integrated monetary system with Britain.  Breaking that link cannot be done in the context of the EMS and these negotiations.  It would require a far bigger political operation, a far greater economic effort on our part, to break through the direct relationship of parity with sterling.  In that sense there was a great national pretence going on and being built up by the Government of easy entry into the EMS, gently shiffling off the apron strings of sterling and all would be well on the night.  As we now know and as we should have appreciated long before now that situation is not as easily overcome as might appear.</P>
    <P>Finally there is a prospect of severe national demoralisation arising from the to-ing and fro-ing and the debacle of these negotiations.  I am opposed to the Taoiseach or any other Minister of State here chasing around Europe peddling our alleged poverty for a mere interest subsidy of about £40 million a year on a prospect, subject to very stringent conditions, of £225 million over five years. We have tremendous natural resources. We have a people who can and do engage in industry and exports to a very high degree with Europe and with Britain. We have tens of thousands of young people who are more than capable of making a tremendous contribution to national social and economic development.</P>
    <P>We should recover some of our pride in this situation.  We should kick the begging bowl out of our negotiations, and we should also be acutely aware of the fact that in the past seven or eight years since we joined the EEC the attitude of Europe is that they have given massive transfers of agricultural subsidy and resources into Ireland in the past. Europe, on that basis, does not particularly feel that she owes us anything.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with the Minister that if there were proper regional funds and proper social funds we could then have a transfer of <Col N="1405" /> resources through these funds.  Europe feels that by and large we have benefited very substantially from the common agricultural policy.  The fact that the money has come into Ireland and has not been properly redistributed is a matter for a debate on another day.  But there is a danger that the Government, hanging their hat so much on the sacred cow of monetary integration and ignoring all the other aspects of economic policy particularly co-ordination of economic policies, are forgetting as they have seemingly forgotten in recent weeks, the need for a planned co-ordination of taxation policies and social policies to combat inflation and social deprivation here.  These are far more important than the kind of Fianna Fáil devotees that we now see to the prospect of breaking the link with sterling or the devotees to the EMS.</P>
    <P>I therefore think that our country should not continue unduly long with this pretence.  I am very much in favour personally of the closest possible links with Europe.  I supported Ireland's entry into the Community and unfortunately the Government now are availing of the issue of monetary parity with Europe as a kind of soft option to soften the blow in relation to their own lack of internal resources.  In the national interest that kind of option should not be availed of in such a manner by the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have a direct link with sterling, and despite all the nostalgic hostility which many Irish people have in relation to that link it is going to be by no means easy to break that link, as has been proved in these negotiations.  Unfortunately there was a national impression created by the Government that all we had to do was simply take the decision for entry and overnight everything would work out with some transfer of resources to this country.  That has not now worked out, and for these reasons I would sum up by saying that, on the basis of the known negotiated terms, we should not enter at this stage; we should remain aloof.  We will in that context not be faced with the rigours of a transitional period when Britain goes in, as undoubtedly she will go in most likely at the end of next year and there is no reason in the wide world why <Col N="1406" /> we should not go in with Britain at that time.</P>
    <P>In the interim period we should try to ensure that the regional fund and the social fund in the Community are massively strengthened.  We can do that in the context of being members of the Community of the Nine.  When we have the presidency in the second half of next year it should be a bit easier to get that matter on the agenda.  Ireland can benefit within the Community to a very considerable degree without necessarily having to face the rigours of the EMS if there are strong regional and social funds.  I regret that the Taoiseach this morning attacked the Opposition for their views because it now appears that the Government are bankrupt of any further initiatives in this regard.  They are simply hanging around like a crowd of political corner boys waiting for something to turn up and to get a few easy bob for next year's capital programme.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that our economic management and the many sensitive industries that would be faced with the traumatic impact of currency changes are politically ready for that sleight-of-hand. They would not be able to face the rigours of that situation.  We should desist from that kind of headlong rush, sober up and accept the facts of life as they are.  We should then get down to the real issues of economic policy, taxation policy, budget policy and next year's public capital programme and run the country in a calmer, more responsible and undoubtedly more effective manner.</P>

      <P>At the risk of upsetting some of my colleagues on the other side and perhaps incurring their wrath it is important that a few points should be clarified and a few things put in their proper perspective as far as this debate is concerned.  The House and the nation owe a vote of thanks to the Taoiseach for his speech this morning.  It was educational and elucidatory and left nobody in any doubt as to what the Government decision is at this time. The public are so enamoured of the handling of the negotiations to date, the way the Taoiseach resisted pressures by other nations to take the package that was offered in the best interests of the Irish people and his personal standing has increased so much that the Irish people are now confident that their best interests will be looked after by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>I have the greatest respect for the Opposition leaders in this House but their contributions this morning were a great disappointment to me and I am quite sure to the nation.  The leader of the main Opposition had only sixteen members of his party present when he was voicing the opinion of his party in this matter.  Was the lack of Deputies behind him a reflection of the majority view of his party and the effectiveness of his leadership or was it a reflection of his contribution?  It seems that he was under some considerable pressure because of the lack of support by his backbench colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has been so adequately dealt with by the front bench members of the Fianna Fáil Party that it is only necessary for me to clear up some misunderstandings among the Opposition parties.  I am glad to see at least from the comments made by members of the Opposition that they recognise at last that our economic Ministers are the recognised authorities on the EMS.  I wish they would leave it at that and let them get on with the job.  They should stop interrupting for the sake of getting some notice in the newspapers tomorrow morning.  The scheme of the Opposition parties today was to create further confusion in the minds of the public at large. We had the leader of Fine Gael juggling without figures.  I am quite sure he is an extremely competent economist and there is no doubt in the world that his pocket calculator does a lot for him but I do not think it did a lot to enhance his image here today.  The Opposition suggest that they know the answers at all times.  Why then are they continually looking for clarification of points they raise?  Why do they ask questions if they know the answers in advance except that they are trying to twist the answers and confuse the people at large?</P>
      <P>The only contradiction I can see is the inability of Fine Gael to persuade anybody that they are a responsible Opposition. We had references today to people travelling abroad.  It is well known that the best traveller abroad in the last four years was the man who referred to it today, the leader of the Fine Gael Party.  I have no objection to people travelling abroad to improve their knowledge by getting advice from other nations and other economic Ministers but it seems to be taking it a step too far to level that kind of charge at the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition this morning did their best to incite the general public to opinions foreign to their best interests.  They want to distort the situation and instead of showing some kind of national patriotism they could very easily be charged with national sabotage.  That charge can be made against their performance <Col N="1409" /> over the last few years.  Why do those people have to go continually to Brussels to get their information?  Has the truth not always been, as far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned, that they get their instructions much nearer to home?  I suggest they get their instructions somewhere across the Channel, perhaps at Westminster.  Have not their instructions been coming from there for the past 50 years?  There is no reason to suggest it will change now.  Bíonn rang clamach ag an oide clamprach and it would seem to be borne out here today. Deputy FitzGerald certainly has a noisy bunch of backbenchers.  What one gets from that is learned length and thundering sound signifying nothing, and that is precisely what we heard this morning.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how Deputy Desmond can suggest, that the Taoiseach was not well received.  Our position was sympathetically considered and it would appear from communiques reaching the Taoiseach that every nation in Europe is aware of the difficulties we might have to suffer in the EMS and is sympathetic to the point of view expressed by the Taoiseach during his journeys abroad.</P>
    <P>I have always had a great respect for Deputy Cluskey's ability and his leadership of the Labour Party.  His contribution was a great disappointment to me and, I imagine, to the whole House. Who do the Labour Party think they are representing in the points of view they are expressing?  It is obvious that there is not even a united voice among their leaders as to what stance they and their followers should adopt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We hear of certain members of that party not doing particular things next year and being admonished by the leader that it is not the right thing to say at this time.  Deputy Cluskey stated that he does not want Ireland to join the EMS.  He does not want us to have any close links.  Is not that the stand they took when we were negotiating entry to the Common <Col N="1410" /> Market?  They want to be isolated in the Atlantic so that they can continue to practise what they have been practising during the past few years.  I do not suggest that they have not the best interests of the people at heart.  I would suggest to Deputy Cluskey that the question he raised this morning about the Italian affair should be put into proper perspective. It was suggested outside this House a few days ago that the Taoiseach should have consulted the Italians and that we were almost responsible for keeping the Italians out.  A few days later the Italian Government decide they would like to enter the EMS.  The Leader of Fine Gael is not blessed with mental telepathy either, because the suggestion I hear is that the Italian Government might very well win the day and Italy might become a member of the EMS.</P>
      <P>To what alternative was Deputy Cluskey referring?  He went on about this <i>ad nauseam</i> this morning.  He was challenged by several Fianna Fáil speakers to say what he would have advised the Taoiseach to do in the circumstances. The answer has not been forthcoming.  The Labour Party are merely involved in Government bashing today.  They are simply frightening the workers by unsupported estimates of job losses which might result if we entered this system.  This is not in the national interest and could not be regarded as national patriotism, and I might level the charge of national sabotage.  Who takes them seriously when their record in Government is a standing indictment of their performance in the very area they are talking about, namely, job losses and the creation of employment?  During the Coalition period they took unto themselves those same portfolios about which they waffle now.  Did they produce enormous job opportunities during that period?  No.  Did they bring about a situation of industrial peace? No.  Their record is so bad in this regard that the people completely lost faith in them and consequently they bit the dust in 1977.  It seems it will be a long time before they have the opportunity to hold any of those portfolios again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we consider the Coalition performance in Europe we realise the hollowness <Col N="1411" /> of some of their statements this morning.  Ministers were travelling to Europe almost daily and they achieved absolutely nothing as far as fisheries were concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to put matters into proper perspective.  Our Minister for Agriculture has got increased grants for disease eradication and improved grants for drainage programmes which will be of great benefit in the west.  When he came back with the money from the EEC we were able to match it £ for £.  That was not the situation when the Coalition were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several advantages to this monetary system, and I am committed to our entry.  The time will come when our position will be clarified and a situation will be created which will enable us to join.  Monetary union would mean more efficient control of industry and commerce, removal of exchange rate risks and inflation, and would give confidence to the Irish businessman.  There is no doubt in the mind of any businessman on this matter, irrespective of his political affiliations.  Seven different currencies are floating around Europe, as well as the dollar.  The £ sterling has depreciated over 60 per cent since 1971 against the mark.  If fixed rates are to endure, <Col N="1412" /> closer co-ordination of economic performance must be secured.  This is the Government's aim, and if the EMS is the vehicle to achieve it and if the Government are on the right road they deserve the support of the House in their endeavour.</P>
    <P>The EMS might give Europe the advantage of a major international currency. The United States, even with their weak balance of payments situation, derive many advantages from the fact that they are in this position.  We would be free from excessive dependence on the dollar.  I would suggest that the dollar is still the only effective medium of exchange, and an unsatisfactory one at this time.  The people, apart from the emotional and historical reasons, have long wished for an opportunity to break the link with Britain.  Let us be clear about that.  Ask people who are suffering the effects of increased mortgage interest rates what they feel about the EMS. They will tell one about their frustration with the link with sterling.</P>
    <P>Must we be dragged up and down by Britain's rate of inflation forever?  The hope is that the Taoiseach can arrange our alignment with the strong currencies of Europe and get us our just share of its improving economic growth.  For further information I have here a little diagram setting out in precise terms how the link with sterling has affected us in the past few years.  In 1964 the Irish inflation rate was 6.9 per cent.  It dropped substantially to 3 per cent in 1966, it rose when we were in office to about 7 per cent, and when the Opposition came to power it took off until it reached more than 20 per cent.  It is only since we came to power that it has been brought under control again.  In 1964 the British rate of inflation was approximately 3.2 per cent and in the following years it went up and down until it reached 24.2 per cent in 1975.  Could it be drawn from that that perhaps our complete link with sterling might have caused some of our serious inflationary problems?</P>
    <P>I believe the EMS would be a major stimulus for growth and employment. The lowering of barriers and the release of new monetary policies would help to restore employment and the confident <Col N="1413" /> growth of the 1960s could be renewed. What are the alternatives?  Between now and 1985 some 9 million young people are expected to join the Community workforce and that number will be in excess of those likely to leave it.  Does not this mean that all the member states will have to pump extra purchasing powers into their economies and take all the necessary steps to bring down unemployment to a more acceptable level? Fianna Fáil are committed to that policy.  The only people opposed to it are the pseudo-socialists who spend their time theorising and polishing up their doctrinaire policies rather than supporting Fianna Fáil measures that come from Ministers who are conscious of the human and social costs of unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely sorry if the Deputy has a problem understanding the EMS.  I have spent some time considering the matter and I am now in a position to comment on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was obvious from the start that the EMS would involve a larger and more redistributive Community budget.  Leading economists accept that as a fact of life.  I do not believe this was being sought purely to secure equality of economic performance but simply as a share-out of the greatly increased wealth which the monetary system, and eventually monetary union, would make available to the Community.  The strong nations are being asked to share the surplus that increased growth and stability has made available.  Was that too much for the Taoiseach to ask?  Was it too much to ask the partners to put all the rungs in the ladder and not to leave out every third one so that we would not slip up and down?  There are only a few pegs <Col N="1414" /> missing, and when they are inserted I think that a proper resource transfer will be made available to improve our infrastructure, to help us to overcome difficulties in catching up with European living standards and to reduce unemployment.</P>
    <P>Our living standards have improved since 1977 when our inflation rate began to fall.  Since Fianna Fáil came to power the rate of inflation has been reduced.  I have some statistics to bear that out.  In 1976 we were told that personal disposal of income rose by 17 per cent, but the truth is that it fell by 1 per cent for the simple reason that in that year inflation was running at 18 per cent.  The people of Ireland were conned at that time. Since 1977 there has been a decrease in the rate of inflation to around 8 per cent but at the same time we are maintaining the increase in personal incomes at 17 per cent.  I do not need a pocket calculator, as they have on the far side, to determine that that leaves a 9 per cent increase in personal disposable income. The Irish worker is well aware of this, and he is prepared to put his money on the Taoiseach and the way he has handled the negotiations on our behalf.</P>

      <P>Whatever type of car I have, I can tell the Deputy it was helped to be paid for by a good Fianna Fáil Government.  The Deputy's car does not have any tax on it either because we removed that tax.  The EMS is probably a step towards EMU, and the Community's goal is a single currency.  I suppose we could have the equivalent of some varying parity but with a central monetary institution.  We all know that this has political implications.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the nature of the policies pursued by the Government which has an influence for good or ill on the level of employment.  Some of that employment can be created by direct Government action such as' recruitment of additional civil servants, teachers or other people who are paid from the public purse. <Col N="1417" /> Other increases in employment can take place through the pursuit of policies which have a beneficial effect on activities on the private sector.  I have never seen anybody attempt to isolate, and attribute fractions of those changes in employment to the behaviour of individual Departments and Ministries, and it would be wrong to do so, because the policies are the policies of the Government arrived at after discussion by the Government.  I have indicated that my Department make their contribution in that manner.</P>

The fact that the Government can exert an influence on the private sector which can lead to an increase or decrease in employment does not mean that it is totally responsible for what happens in the private sector.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat it.  I asked the Minister if he would acknowledge, in the light of his having admitted that wage drift has been recognised as a distinct phenomenon by economists since about 1960, that a programme which speaks in advance of an election about a 5 per cent national wage agreement must have been compiled by people who knew that <Col N="1422" /> if they achieved 5 per cent on paper they would wind up in practice with something nearer 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to answer the question because I fail to see what the question is and I fail to see its relevance to Question No. 3 on the Order Paper.  If Deputy Kelly has a question in that area which can be formulated as a question, I will be delighted to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did say that the phenomenon which I hear people calling &ldquo;wage drift&rdquo; has been recognised for 15 years.  May I take it that somebody planning a national wage agreement of 5 per cent in the middle of 1977 must have realised that, if he achieved that on paper, what he was going to get in practice, taking a wage drift into account, which was then known about, would be something nearer 10 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Most people would recognise some wage drift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister is now blaming that predictable wage drift for redundancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said that the unacceptably high level of wage drift this year was a cause for concern.  It was not the fact that a wage drift existed; it was the fact that it was so unacceptably high this year.  That was not part of any calculations before, during or since the election campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister attribute the unacceptable level of wage drift to the Government's decision not to encourage or partake in a new national pay agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not, because the problem has been arising from the early months of the period of the present wage agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it likely that the carry-over effect of the current national wage agreement into next year could be of such proportions <Col N="1423" /> that it would exceed what the Government might set as a desirable wage increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see the purpose of the question.  Obviously, if one is making calculations for expected increases in a future year one normally identifies three components: the carry-over effect of any existing agreement, the impact of any new increase and the estimated effect of any wage drift.  Therefore, those factors would be recognised.</P>

      <P>The latest earnings data in respect of the transportable goods industries, which are compiled by the Central Statistics Office, relate to a week in March 1978.  At that time the average weekly earnings were £66.50.  The corresponding figure for a week in March 1973, was £26.03.  To sustain the 1973 level of earnings, the weekly pay, adjusted for tax and social insurance, of three representative categories of worker in March 1978 would need to be: £41.40 for a single man, £44.10 for a married man with no children and £48.18 for a married man with two children.</P>
      <P>The figures for March 1978, for the three categories were respectively £48.60, that is relating to the £41.40, £51.52, that is relating to the £44.10 and £54.75, that is relating to the £48.18.

      <P>In the light of the decision of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, it would be inappropriate for the Government to take steps to initiate talks for a further national wage agreement at this juncture.  For the majority of workers the present agreement will not expire until the end of May 1979.  The details of subsequent policies have yet to be evolved but it is clear that they will have to be geared towards achieving a considerably lower rate of wage increase than has actually emerged under the 1978 Agreement.  The attitudes of employers and the trade union movement will have a major influence on Government policies on wage developments.  While the possibility of statutory controls cannot be ruled out, the Government are not contemplating such controls at this time.</P>

On a number of occasions the Government have made it clear that they are willing not simply to continue national wage agreements in the structure in which they have developed since their introduction in 1970 but that they wish to see them developed in any manner which would lead to a more constructive resolution of issues in the incomes area.

A similar meeting was held with employer representatives.  It is quite wrong, and creates a totally misleading impression, to suggest that the Government are not concerned about this matter, not seeking to develop appropriate policy in this area and are not anxious to secure agreement that will enable the economy to develop on a healthy basis in 1979.  All these matters are very prominent in the Government's thinking at this time. What I am saying is that there are naturally questions of ordering or arranging the conduct of business including appropriate times for consultation with the trade unions and other bodies.</P>

Moreover, there are other possible developments which could influence the course of the economy in <Col N="1430" /> 1979 and whose content would presumably need to be established before any agreements or final decisions were made.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I would like to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>The latest available data on employment in manufacturing industry relates to June 1978 when the increase in employment over the corresponding period of last year was 4,700.  This was a significant improvement on the outturn in March 1978.  The year-on-year increase at the end of 1978 is expected to be about 7,000.  While this is less than previous expectations it compares favourably with past experience and has made a significant contribution to meeting the overall job requirements.  As such it forms a firm base for achieving an increased level of job creation in the manufacturing sector in 1979 and 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy measures taken by the Government have led to a sharp increase in overall economic activity in 1978 and this has created an economic environment favourable to the expansion of private industry.  This should form the basis for a greater contribution from the manufacturing sector to the overall job <Col N="1431" /> targets in 1979 and 1980.  Moreover, the high level of job approvals by the IDA in recent years is expected to lead to a significant increase in the number of jobs created in new projects in coming years.</P>

      <P>Well, I think it is correct to say that target figures were indicated this year and that we will continue that practice in future years if at all possible.  I would say, yes; I do not see why not.  Obviously the ability of the private sector to achieve any given level of target must depend not only on the nature of the Government's policies at work but also on the operation of other factors, such as the ones to which Deputy Kelly referred in his previous supplementary.  May I point out in that area also that we had no quarrel with <Col N="1432" /> wage restraint.  One of our points about those previous years is that the previous Government had the unique experience of negotiating two successive agreements which were to produce reductions in the actual living standards of workers, not increases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The 1976 and 1977 settlements were achieved because the trade union movement had confidence in the Government then and it was not the victim of divisive Government policies such as those with which the present Minister is associated.</P>

In view of the fact that the Minister has already conceded that the targets for the private sector were not reached this year but that they were nevertheless reasonably satisfactory&mdash;if I quote him correctly&mdash;does he propose to revise downwards the targets for 1979 and 1980?

      <P>In general practice the working relationships of the board with Ministers and Departments will not be on the basis of individual requests for advice.  Rather there will be continuous process of consultation and exchange of information and advice.</P>
      <P>One purpose in establishing the board is to encourage and promote interaction in the area of science and technology between the operational Departments and Institutions, so as to secure the best overall results from their national efforts in these fields.</P>
      <P>The board has, on request, advised various Departments on such topics as the funding of activities under the oil &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; scheme, Irish involvement in various international and EEC research and development programmes, and inter-governmental co-operation agreements.  The board has also been asked to carry out a study on the scientific and technical aspects of telecommunications activities in Ireland.</P>

I have tried to indicate that the bulk of the board's work will continue on the basis that I described, namely, this continuing <Col N="1436" /> process of consultation and so on.

I just want to know does any question of concurrence or competition arise with regard to the energy function, which the Minister mentioned, of this board with the Nuclear Energy Board and, if there is no concurrence or competition, why is there not?  Secondly, I would like to know whether any concurrence or competition arises with the Higher Education Authority in regard to funding research grants and, if there is not any competition, why is there not, because it seems to me, in the case of both these instances I have given, that there must be some functional redundancy in one board or authority or the other?  The second question is, will the Minister explain to the House why, at a time of high unemployment and difficulty in finding jobs even for graduates at technical levels, there has been such apparent torpor in recruiting staff for the work of this board bearing in mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government's undertaking to reduce the numbers out of work was set out in the White Paper &ldquo;National Development 1977-1980&rdquo; published last January. That undertaking reflected the earlier commitment given in the pre-election manifesto.  Progress on the undertaking has been substantial, and current indications suggest that the Government is within a few thousand of achieving its target of reducing the numbers out of work in 1977 and 1978 by 25,000.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that there is not a one-for-one relationship between reduction in numbers out of work and reduction in the live register.  In the period end-June 1977 and end-November 1978 there was a decline in the live register figures of approximately 14,000 expressed on a de-seasonalised basis.  On the basis of past trends this decline is consistent with the estimated reduction in the numbers out of work.</P>

      <P>I would regard it as improbable.  May I remind the Deputy that as far back as March last I first drew attention, on being asked similar questions, to the fact that there is not a simple relationship in increases in employment and reductions in the live register.  I was asked at that time by one of the Deputy's colleagues, Deputy Quinn, and I made the point&mdash;I will repeat what I said then&mdash;that if we are talking about an increase of 20,000 at work there could be a reduction of the order of 10,000 to 12,000 in the numbers on the live register.  So, if the live register falls by 10,000 to 12,000, that is consistent with an increase in employment of 20,000.  I have quoted figures and the basis of them is again independent academic work most recently quoted in June 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision by the Government to put before this House the Bill for the establishment of the Department of Economic Planning and Development was indicative of the Government's commitment to bring about effective national development. The functions of the Department and its role in economic and social development were covered at length by Government speakers during the debates on the draft legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of their statutory functions the Department of Economic Planning <Col N="1446" /> and Development are, under Government, the apex of the public service planning system for national development.  As part of this system, work on the installation of planning units in all Departments is also being conducted under the aegis of the Department of the Public Service and the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  It is now well advanced.</P>
    <P>The impact of the Department and the Government's planning arrangements generally are apparent in the development of the Government's planning cycle and in the Government's documents emanating from it&mdash;the White Paper &ldquo;National Development 1977-1980&rdquo;, and the Green Paper &ldquo;Development for Full Employment&rdquo;.  Apart from the more visible aspects of the Department's work it is also closely involved in the on-going process of Government business and decision making.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Department of Economic Planning and Development and the public service planning function now have a statutory base renders any comparison between the Department of Economic Planning and Development and the previous planning activities of the Department of Finance invalid.  One would not be comparing like with like.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that under the previous arrangements, when this function was carried out by sections in the Department of Finance, White Papers and Green Papers were being produced?  Therefore, the Minister cannot ask us to accept this as being an innovation due to his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to talk about the rate of production, the performance in the first year was a darn sight better than the one document produced at the end of three-and-a-half years.  The Deputy is adopting a most unusual kind of questioning.  Does he want to debate also the role of the Department of the Public Service, which had previously been part of the Department of Finance?  Does he want to debate the activities of the Department of Labour, which had previously been part of the Department <Col N="1447" /> of Industry and Commerce?  I am suggesting that all this kind of thing is irrelevant unless the Deputy has some scheme for the structure of Government, because surely it is well established that during the years the level of activity and the nature and the functions of Government activities change, and as they change so too do the institutional arrangements, so that we observe the creation of new Departments, the restructuring of existing Departments and agencies. But the fact that these changes take place does not enable one to make sensible comparisons with what had gone before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

As the Deputy is probably aware, fund aid in respect of approved projects is not used to &ldquo;top up&rdquo; the national aid already given to individual projects through the public capital programme.</P>
      <P>Moreover, it is a precondition of assistance from the regional fund that public authorities in the member states must participate in the financing of any project in respect of which an application for assistance is made.

At any given time a large number of jobs are scheduled, but the question is how rapidly can they be undertaken.  This depends on the availability of funds.

      <P>I am sure I express the sentiment of everyone in this House when I say how much I regret the unfortunate tragedy that occurred yesterday when a young security guard was shot dead in the course of an armed robbery.  On 9 November last in reply to a parliamentary question the Minister gave an account of various additional measures being taken to combat crime.  I cannot usefully add at this stage to what is in that statement.  The tragic events of yesterday do not alter the basic situation. The use of firearms by criminal elements is something that is becoming prevalent in our society, and unfortunately one cannot rule out the possibility of tragic incidents, even incidents involving loss of life.  There is no easy solution.  However, I am confident that the increased resources now being made available to the Garda Síochána will greatly improve their capacity to deal with armed robberies and other serious crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerning additional precautions in the period before Christmas, the Garda authorities are taking additional <Col N="1451" /> measures, though obviously I cannot enter into discussion about them.

We recognise the problem and are doing everything reasonably possible to meet it.</P>

      <P>I would endorse the Minister's sympathy to the relatives of the unfortunate deceased man.

      <P>I have not the 1978 Estimates with me because I did not anticipate a matter such as this arising on the question.  In recent months the Government have made considerable additional sums available to the Garda Síochána, as is instanced by the very heavy recruitment of new gardaí and by the provision of over 300 additional members to the detective force.  An examination of the 1979 Estimate at present in train would indicate that next year there will be a further substantial increase in the amount of money devoted to the Garda.</P>

      <P>We were dealing this morning with two matters, the effective and statesmanlike activity on the part of the Taoiseach, his economic Ministers and advisers, in carrying out negotiations on our behalf in relation to the EMS, and the strategy of the Opposition in creating total confusion both in the House and in the nation generally in relation to these negotiations.  Part of their strategy is to discredit the Government at a time when they are involved in the most delicate negotiations with our foreign partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy who has just left the House presented us with a further extension of the strategy of dislocation and confusion by bringing in side issues and red herrings to divert attention from what the Government believe is the most important matter to come before the House for a considerable length of time. However, in all this confusion in the minds of the Opposition some things have become absolutely clear.  All agree that the EMS has positive advantages for the Irish economy, that the EMS would act as a major stimulus for growth and employment, that it would help to reduce inflation which has been brought under control since 1977 by Fianna Fáil and which would continue to be kept under control if we could satisfactorily negotiate a deal with the EMS.  It is also agreed that the entry into the EMS must be combined with determined moves to promote better distribution <Col N="1471" /> of wealth.  That is what the current negotiations are all about.  It is agreed also that the weaker nations, including Ireland, need support to improve the infrastructure, perhaps particularly as far as the road works and communications are concerned, so that we can develop a better standard of living and provide more employment.  It is also agreed that the Fianna Fáil Government, through the Taoiseach, his advisers and economic Ministers are the best-fitted, the best informed and the acknowledged experts and authorities so far as this negotiation is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Governments were involved in all the major policy changes and major advances that this nation ever made.  If this step is taken it will be taken by Fianna Fáil.  This morning the Labour Party out of their own mouths agreed that they are not committed to doing anything except going on a Government-bashing binge this evening. It is also agreed that Labour do not know in which direction they are going. Their followers and supporters do not know in which way they are going, and they are being given contrary advice at every second public meeting of the Labour Party.  For people who did not support our entry into the EEC initially, for people who did not support our stand in relation to EMS&mdash;Deputy Desmond said this morning that he was not in favour of EMS&mdash;for people who are so anti-EEC, they are the first to put candidates in the field for next June's elections.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Cluskey rightly said this morning, the goodwill and the future of this nation lies in the arms of the Taoiseach.  The country well knows that they are the safest arms to be in at this time.</P>
      <P>All these matters have been generally agreed by the House, but it is agreed, probably only by Fianna Fáil, that both Fine Gael and Labour are in their proper places, in the Opposition benches, and EMS, EMU, political union and world union will come before they ever cross the floor of this House again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three areas of failure on the part of the Government in their negotiations for entry into the EMS.  First of all they failed to achieve what they set out to achieve, the formation of a special division in the Regional Fund through which transfers of resources could be made to us.  They failed to achieve something which the Taoiseach put very great store by, that a substantial part, if not all, of the transfers of resources should be in the form of grants, and they failed to have the aid which is being made available in the form of loans extended to industry as well as to infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach dwelt on the importance of achieving grants as against loans in the White Paper, where it is pointed out that we already have a very substantial level of foreign debt and a higher than average level of borrowing generally whether it be foreign or domestic, and that transfers of resources which take the form of loans are adding to that burden of debt and are therefore creating many problems for us, and are working in a contrary direction to the whole idea of an economic policy for a <Col N="1473" /> country within the European Monetary System, namely that the money supply should be restrained.  If we are expanding our level of borrowing in that way we are not pursuing the type of policy which would be consistent with membership of the EMS.  So what we are getting in the form of transfers of resources is inimical to our being successful if they lead to our overall borrowing being increased.</P>
    <P>Members of the House would need to seek the guidance of the Government as to whether or not their target to reduce the level of borrowing as a proportion of GNP to 10 per cent will stand if they decide to accept the terms of the EMS and accept the substantial loans.  Does that mean that they will drastically reduce borrowing from other sources so as to stay within their target?  If that is the case, the deal does not seem to be very attractive.  As the Leader of my Party has indicated, the terms which we are obtaining under the special facility are not more favourable than the terms obtainable from normal commercial sources.  Converting the type of loan which we could obtain in the normal course into another type of loan, the terms of which are not more attractive, is not achieving a significant improvement for our economy, except for a marginal improvement represented by the subsidisation of the interest rates.  As has been demonstrated, it is possible for us to obtain lower rates of interest from commercial sources.  The subsidy merely cancels relatively disadvantageous interest rates that we are getting under the proposed facility.</P>
    <P>A further disadvantage for us in the proposal is that it will involve doubling our level of foreign debt.  We do not know what effect it will have on our overall level of indebtedness.  The acceptance of these loans will lead to an increase in our level of foreign indebtedness, which is not a desirable thing.  In regard to foreign debt, the point needs to be made that we will not be able to recover any interest already paid.  If we are paying interest on debts to holders of Irish securities who are living here, the bulk of the interest paid to them will be recouped through income tax.  If <Col N="1474" /> we are paying interest abroad, we will not be able to get any of that interest back in the form of income tax because the people receiving interest from us will not be liable to Irish income tax.  This is an added disadvantage in contracting substantially increased foreign debt.</P>
    <P>Another point which needs to be explored is the restriction of the aid to infrastructure. It seems that there has been a retreat in our position, even since the Brussels Summit.  The Resolution published at the end of the Brussels Summit states that the funds thus provided are to be concentrated on the financing of selected infrastructure projects and programmes with the understanding that any direct or indirect distortion of the competitive position of specific industries within member states will have to be avoided.</P>
    <P>That was the position at the end of the Brussels summit.  Paragraph 35 of the Green Paper explains details of the scheme which were not included in the Resolution and states that the loans will be subject to the conditions that the borrowing country will have to provide part of the overall cost of the projects or programmes and will be limited to infrastructure development.  The only requirement at the end of the Brussels summit was that the loans be concentrated on infrastructure.  As a result of subsequent misnegotiation, it now seems that the loans may only be used for infrastructure.  A further retreat on the part of the Government is that even since Brussels they have conceded that the money is only to be used for infrastructure. The communique issued at the end of the Brussels Summit clearly left the door open for at least some of the money to be used for other projects.</P>
    <P>Within the terms of the Brussels Resolution it would have been possible for substantial amounts of this money to be given to the IDA.  In most IDA programmes there is no direct or indirect distortion of competition.  If there were, they would have been challenged by the Commission long ago.  Since the Brussels communique it seems that the loans are being limited to infrastructure development.  We have accepted that we will not get money for the IDA.  The limitation to infrastructure is inappropriate <Col N="1475" /> for the purpose for which the transfers are taking place.  The transfers are taking place because certain sectors of our industry will face a competitive disadvantage.  If industry suffers as a result of our joining the EMS, then the money should be paid to industry.  Why have the Government accepted that it should be confined to infrastructure?</P>
    <P>The reason we are seeking transfers is to protect employment in industry.  As infrastructure projects are short-term, jobs created in infrastructure will last for only two or three years, whereas jobs created in industry last a lifetime.  It would have been far better if the Taoiseach had succeeded in getting all of the transfer resources used in the sector where the problems will arise, namely, industry, and not for infrastructure.  It is the more difficult to understand why he accepted this limitation to infrastructure when one reads the terms of reference of the two instruments under which the aid is to be made available, the Ortoli facility and the European Investment Bank.  The terms of reference of the Ortoli facility are:</P>
    <P>The proceeds of these loans shall be lent to finance investment projects which contribute to a greater convergence and integration of the economic policies of member states. These projects must help attain the priority Community objectives in energy, industry and infrastructure sectors taking account <i>inter alia</i> of the regional impact of the projects and the need to combat unemployment.</P>
    <P>The terms of the European Investment Bank include aid for projects for developing less developed regions, projects for modernising or converting, undertaking or developing fresh activities called for by the progressive establishment of the Common Market where these projects are of such a size or nature that they cannot be financed by the various means available to individual member states, and projects of common interest to several member states which are of such a size or nature that they cannot be entirely financed by the <Col N="1476" /> various means available in the individual member states.</P>
    <P>These are two very broadly drawn sets of terms of reference under which money in the normal course can be made available either through the Ortoli facility or the European Investment Bank.  Why did the Taoiseach not succeed in getting his colleagues to agree that the money would be simply channelled through those two channels? Presumably there are restrictions to avoid misspending of money made available through either the European Investment or the Ortoli facility: there are existing procedures to avoid money being used for uneconomic purposes or being used for distortion of competition. Clearly neither facility is confined to infrastructure. Why then are the transfers of resources that are being made under the terms negotiated by the Taoiseach, or the best terms he could get at the time, confined to infrastructure?  No reason has been given in this debate or elsewhere.  I challenge whatever Minister replies to tell us why this has transpired. It certainly was not the impression we got from the Taoiseach in previous debates and statements before he went to Brussels.  It certainly was not the impression one would get from reading the communique issued at the end of the negotiations, which merely said that they should be concentrated on infrastructure. That is not satisfactory, but it is far better than what has turned out to be the case where they are in fact limited to infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Will the money for infrastructure which is made available be actually used to expand our infrastructure programme, or will it be used to save money for the Irish Government?  Will there be real expansion or will we merely be using European loans to finance things we would otherwise be funding by our own loans with no net increase in the infrastructural provision?  As the present Minister for Finance asked when he was in Opposition, I ask that separate accounts be drawn up by which it can be clearly seen (a) what the existing programme of the Government would have been for infrastructural development with existing resources and (b) the additional infrastructural provision now <Col N="1477" /> being made as a result of additional resources being made available.  We must have two separate sets of statistics and it must be abundantly clear to our own people and the Community&mdash;they are not giving us money to get the Minister for Finance off some financial hook on which he hoisted himself in July 1977; they are giving money for infrastructure&mdash;that this money is actually being used for increased infrastructural provision.  I now ask that such a clear statement in the form of separate accounts for the EEC-aided infrastructural development and our normal infrastructural development programme be drawn up.</P>
    <P>I have another reservation about the way in which this money is being made available; it will go through the official channels of a very lugubrious nature. First, these projects will perhaps have to be approved at local authority level, then at national Government level through the Department of the Environment, and, in a new and third stage, they will have to be approved in Brussels.  The papers will have to be examined three times whereas normally it would be only twice.  All the technical studies will have to be done, cross-checked and rechecked not only at county level and in Dublin but also in Brussels.  Will not that mean delays in infrastructure development rather than acceleration because of the additional bureaucratic processing?</P>
    <P>We know the incapacity of our Government machine to spend all the money for infrastructure.  We need only go back to yesterday to the debate on the Supplementary Estimates for Fisheries and the Department of the Environment for examples of this.  I pointed out that a substantial portion of the money voted in the 1978 Estimate for harbour development for fisheries was not spent in 1978.  Similarly, money voted for environmental projects and for making dangerous places safe was not spent in substantial proportion.  It was money that was available and essentially of an infrastructural nature which would have given substantial employment and it was therefore fully in line with the priorities of the Government.  That money was not spent.  I fear this money may not be spent either, because it will <Col N="1478" /> become gummed up somewhere in the bureaucratic machine.  Plans will not be prepared or there will be some other barrier across the multi-stage road to do something.  There will be delay and the money will not be used.  Meanwhile, perhaps we will be paying interest on loans to do things that we are not doing, and the purpose for which the money is being given, protection of jobs in industry, is being entirely neglected in the transfer of resources and it is all being channelled into infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I should also like to have a clear definition of infrastructure from the Government.  When studying economics I thought I got an idea of what infrastructure was, but I do not remember that it has ever been defined legally.  Is an advance factory infrastructure? Is the laying of an industrial estate infrastructure?  Or is it merely confined to roads, roads that do not necessarily lead anywhere, just roads from one town to another?  If it is an industrial road is it infrastructure?  It is very important to have that clarified at an early stage so that we get the maximum amount possible for the type of project which most directly protects jobs in industry.  We should seek the widest possible definition of infrastructure.  We should never have accepted the confinement to infrastructure but, having done so, we should try to interpret it as widely as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to advert to another problem in relation to the money we are getting for infrastructure.  The point has been made that the transfers of resources will have the significant effect that these loans coming in will help our balance of payments position and help us over the initial difficulties in joining the EMS.  But it appears to me that, if the money is spent on certain types of infrastructure, that money will go straight out of our economy; if the job is done anyway quickly, the money will not stay in our economy for any length of time at all.  For instance, if it is spent on telephone development&mdash;and I am glad to see the Minister of State responsible is here and perhaps he could clarify the situation in relation to the import content of telephone development&mdash;quite a significant portion of it, indeed, all of the equipment, is imported, so that the <Col N="1479" /> balance of payments effect we are seeking from that type of infrastructure, namely, a positive one, will be dissipated almost immediately because it will be spent on telephones which have to be imported. We do not manufacture telephones in this country.  We do not manufacture the switching equipment and so on that goes with them.  On the other hand, if it is spent on roads, we do produce most, if not all of the materials spent on roads, so that will stay in the country.  But it is very important to know exactly what type of infrastructure it is intended to use the money on if we are to assess its value for us from the point of view of the preservation of our position in relation to the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I presume, from what I know, that the money will be made available now for individual projects; we will be getting a loan of £500 million for roads.  We will be getting, as far as I know&mdash;and I would like clarification on this&mdash;£200 million from the EEC for a particular road.  The merits of that particular road as against other roads we might use money on will have to be assessed in Brussels.  They will have to say whether we are right to be spending money on, say, the Cork road when we should perhaps be spending it on the Galway road.  I understand the money will be given in loans for specific projects and not for a global programme.  If that is the case, will all the information being made available to Brussels&mdash;in support of our case for a particular type of investment and in support of our contention that the return on that investment will be such as to exceed the rate of interest that we are paying on the debt to pay for it&mdash;be made available to this House or will it be made available only to the bureaucrats in Brussels?</P>
    <P>There is another area to which I should like to refer, if I may change ground a little, that is, in relation to the impact on agriculture of our joining the EMS.  The Taoiseach has completely ignored agriculture both in the White Paper and in his introductory statement. This is surprising.  I cannot understand why no reference at all was made to <Col N="1480" /> agriculture in the entire discussion of the EMS.  We all know that those agricultural commodities which are covered by monetary compensatory amounts are insulated against changes in the exchange rate.  Therefore, there is not a problem with them.  But we know also that substantial areas of our agricultural and food production are not covered by MCAs.  I will give two examples&mdash;horticulture and that area of meat processing which has the highest employment content, namely, canned beef production. In the context of the EMS negotiations has any attempt been made to protect those two very vulnerable sectors of agriculture from the effects of our joining the EMS if that means that our currency rises above the level of the £ sterling?</P>
    <P>I should like to make inquiries also about the position in relation to exchange control.  This is a question I posed on the last occasion this matter was discussed.  It was not answered then and has not been answered since in any statement from the Government.  Does our joining the EMS mean that the premium which at present an Irish person with Irish £s, wishing to invest in the German stock market, must pay will no longer be payable?  If we join the EMS and are part of one system with the deutschemark, will those dollar premiums no longer have to be paid by Irish people?  Equally, if we join and Britain stays out, does that mean that Britain will be imposing dollar premiums on British investment in Ireland?  It is very important that this be clarified because it could have a major effect on the flow of funds.  For instance, if Irish investors are completely free to invest without paying any dollar premium on the German market, there will be a tendency for money to converge in the central economies where the return is the highest.  There will be a tendency for Irish investors, rather than investing in Ireland, to invest in Germany.  We should have that matter clarified before we proceed any further in the matter.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, I regret very much that the Government have done so little to protect thóse who are liable to be worst affected by our joining the EMS.  I believe that, if we can get the right terms, <Col N="1481" /> We should join the EMS.  It is important for us, in the long run, to be part of the central policy-making in the strong economies of Europe.  It is in our interests to have a say in the market place in which we will be selling our goods.  It is important that we have people to negotiate for us in that position who have the abaility to do so.  If we are forced, by bad negotiation, to stay out, it will be a bad day for this country.  It will be particularly bad if we stay out, lose whatever small concessions we have got, and then have to go in later when Britain goes in, getting no concessions at all then because there is no indication that the meagre terms we are now being offered will remain open if we do not go in now.  If we do not go in now and wait until Britain goes in in perhaps six or eight months' time, have we any guarantee that there will be any transfers of resources to us at that stage at all? Have we any guarantee that the terms now available to us will be available to us in six or eight months' time if Britain goes in?  There is that danger inherent in staying out, that we will lose whatever terms are on offer now, and I believe they are very insufficient.  Therefore it is vitally important&mdash;as our Leader said&mdash;that the Taoiseach and his Ministers do everything possible to renegotiate these terms urgently and endeavour to get transfers of resources which will protect jobs in this country and enable us to take our place with the strong economies of Europe, as a strong economy in Europe, in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously this is a debate of great importance.  One of the regrets one has is that it is not a definitive debate on a substantive motion in so far as, for instance, the Italian Parliament are discussing this question today, a matter of great importance to them, as it is to us; that in fact we have no authority; we are not a sovereign parliament; we will really have no direct say in whether we do or do not go in, the delegation of this House to the status of a debating society by the Taoiseach is something which should be referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the Taoiseach himself is one of extraordinary interest. Somewhere on Tuesday morning I heard <Col N="1482" /> somebody humming the old nursery rhyme: &ldquo;So Jack fell down and broke his crown, and Jill came tumbling after.&rdquo;  It appeared to be fairly apposite, because he had made an extraordinary decision, in some ways an extraordinarily courageous one, in view of the fact that the television cameras of the world, certainly of Europe, were on him, that he had indulged in a complete <i>volte face</i>; having encouraged us, from the very beginning, to believe that he was going in, he had to make this complete reversal of attitudes in relation to the system.</P>
    <P>When I thought that little rhyme was apposite I was really referring to the whole idea of the EEC and the consistent euphoria.  Indeed, it is quite remarkable the way this euphoria has been maintained since we went into the EEC despite the very serious consequences experienced by our society.  I, of course, opposed entry because I always regarded it as a rich man's club, a new form of latter day colonialism with the great central countries using us on the periphery as a colonial type society.  The most interesting feature of the negotiations has been not just the Taoiseach's behaviour but also the behaviour of the main Opposition party, particularly that of Deputy FitzGerald.  It does appear as if both these leaders seriously believe in the concept of a great western European federal society on the lines of the USSR or the United States of America in which there would be a grouping together of a number of nations broadly pursuing objectives in the interests of all the component parts.  That, of course, would have been the evolution if they had decided on the idea of a European monetary union rather than a monetary system.  This difference has not been stressed at all. Neither has it been stressed by the political and economic commentators in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>Talking in the context of someone in the EEC, there could be something to be said for some kind of acceptance of the idea of an economic monetary union in which there would be a central parliament rather like Congress, or some other form of federal organisation society like West Germany, which is a democratic republic, or some other society in which a representative parliament would have <Col N="1483" /> some overall control over the economic, fiscal and social policies of the component parts of that federal union.  But this has nothing to do with that at all.  It does not represent that in any way.  It is a reconstituted &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; device whereby we will be attempting to introduce some kind of stability into the European economy and finances and it is a very particular concern of the West German Government to establish some sort of stability of the German mark.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable how easy it is to generate a particular idea if you have sufficient control of the various communication media, but how anybody could look to Europe and to the nations of the EEC and, because of its power and stability, talk of going into it in some sort of monetary union or monetary system, and try to establish some links with the other financial structures in that union, in that community, in the light of the reality of the EEC at the present time is to me incredible.  The EEC is probably one of the most unstable social economies, socially and economically, that we have ever known.  There is Italy with well over 1 million unemployed, France with 1,500,000, Britain with around 1 million unemployed.  There is West Germany, the keystone of the union, at the moment a very frightened, worried and apprehensive West Germany. West Germany, people frequently forget, is part of a partitioned country.  It is not a stable unit.  It could not be and probably never will be until it becomes a united Germany again one side or other of the socialist-capitalist line.  But, as it is, it is quite remarkable that people should so shortly after the calamity of the Second World War, 30 years after, look to this state as a stable unit.  It is a society which at the moment is incubating a very dangerous industrial situation.</P>
    <P>There is the strike in the steel industry. As we all know, the steel industry is the key industry in great industrial nations and what happens to steel determines practically what happens to everything else.  In Solingen 37,000 people are out on strike.  This is the first steel strike for 50 years.  It is a strike which started from relatively <Col N="1484" /> modest demands by the workers.  But it is a key struggle, because what happens in this struggle will determine what will happen in many western European countries.  As I said, the demands are modest.  They might surprise the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and the Amalgamated Union and all the other unions here.  The workers are asking for a 5 per cent rise.  They are being offered a 3 per cent rise.  The response to their going on strike, these 37,000, was that within six weeks 29,000 people were locked out in other plants.  The largest union in West Germany with 2.6 million workers is at the centre of a challenge between capital and labour, employer and employee, and the general feeling is that the strike will not be quickly over, even though it is Christmas time, because there happens to be a recession in the steel industry.  The workers have to fight their corner and the employers have to fight theirs.  The workers are looking for a 35 hour week and the management do not want to give it for their own reasons.  Now that is not the kind of society, taken in conjunction with Italy, France and Britain, that should be rushed into so readily in order to become a partner in a very turbulent year in these famous western capitals and a very turbulent year also in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>Most of us, of course, believe we are watching the death throes of western capitalism.  Naturally it is taking time because it is enormously powerful.  There is a total inability to cope with increasing populations and advancing industrialisation. Remember, they are now threatened with the micro processors, a fabulous scientific concept which will close the conventional type of factory and reduce the outlets for employment to an extent never before experienced in industry.</P>
    <P>However, in the context of what we are dealing with the Taoiseach said we should try to join the system, and he was most enthusiastic.  Many people agreed with his excessive and unwise enthusiasm, without knowing anything about specific terms.  It was extraordinary that the Taoiseach should have displayed such enthusiasm without knowing the terms.  In the early days we <Col N="1485" /> were told about two things, the transfer of funds and the breaking of the link with sterling.  On the matter of the transfer of funds, it is most important to establish without any doubt that the transfer of funds does not mean a loan, because a loan is but a temporary transfer of funds.  The Taoiseach was talking about a permanent transfer of funds, and he mentioned £650 million. Reckoning on a drop in the GNP of about 2 per cent, that would work out at about £135 million per annum.  I quoted the nursery rhyme, &ldquo;Jack fell down and broke his crown, and Jill came tumbling after&rdquo;, because there were people who were even more unrealistic about this than the Taoiseach, even more euphoric. In his assessment of our needs&mdash;it will be interesting to see what he will do in the circumstances of any offer we may get&mdash;Deputy FitzGerald wanted compensation for a 10 per cent annual drop in GNP.  In a speech earlier in the month Deputy FitzGerald is quoted in the Official Report as having said:</P>
    <P>Given that our GNP next year will be in the order of £6,000 million we need a net transfer of £600 million a year permanently.</P>
    <P>I underline &ldquo;permanently&rdquo;.  That is an incredible concept.  He was not seeking £135 million on a five year basis.  He was looking for £600 million on a permanent basis.  This seems to me to reflect an extraordinary misconception by both major parties of what the EEC means. When they were selling the EEC to the people a few years ago Deputy FitzGerald made the famous statement that the cost of living rise would not be more than four or five or maybe 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>There has been a total misconception by these people that there is a genuine co-operative effort in Europe to establish a sort of federal society with all the people at the periphery being cared for and that the great wealthy central European economies are genuinely anxious for a redistribution of wealth.  Deputy FitzGerald believed this to the extent that he expected a £600 million a year grant from his colleagues, or comrades as he appeared to think they were socially.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> I saw a magnificent little programme on RTE shortly after their dispute&mdash;it was extremely good and RTE should be complimented on it.  There was an interview with a spokesman for Chancellor Schmidt who throughout the telecast did not take the smile from his face.  One of our people asked him about grants and about the level of the grants and the Taoiseach's £130 million a year figure was mentioned.  The spokesman for Chancellor Schmidt treated the matter in a paternalistic sort of way and suggested that it was an outrageous proposition that they should give us £130 million a year.  &ldquo;Forgive me for smiling&rdquo;, seemed to be what he was trying to say.</P>
    <P>This represents the great conflict in the whole concept of the EEC.  Has anybody any serious illusions any more on what the EEC is about?  I remember Seán Lemass once saying that nobody owes us a living.  Does anybody seriously believe, as the two Leaders of our two great parties obviously did, that Europe owes us a living?  As the spokesman for Schmidt said: &ldquo;Chancellor Schmidt cannot take any position: he speaks merely for Germany and there are nine peoples involved in making these decisions&rdquo;. When asked if his view was any different from that of the French, he said it was not.  The Taoiseach picked out Helmut Schmidt as Father Christmas.  Of course that is not true.  Nobody had the slightest intention of making substantial transfers to us and that transpired later at the summit.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to breaking the link with sterling.  This was referred to even in 1948 as something that should be done.  I think it would have been quite wrong to have done it, but it was referred to at that time.  When we heard of it I am sure the blood pulsed a little faster in our veins because we were delighted with the idea to use Wolfe Tone's famous phrase of breaking the connection with England.  There is no doubt there has been a certain element here of the idea of breaking the link with England, and I am sure the Taoiseach was anxious that he would be the one to break that connection with England. There has been a very dangerous evasion of this issue recently and we have moved right round in a circle and there <Col N="1487" /> has been a sigh of relief from all the economists in the newspapers and on television from all sides because we do not have to break the link with sterling. Wolfe Tone's great aspiration has been set aside because of the hard financial calculations that have been done in the meantime.  Because of the other difficult matters with which we are faced, we cannot afford republicanism at that kind of level.</P>
    <P>What are the calculations in regard to the breaking of the link with sterling?  It is all very well to talk about Mr. Callaghan and his usual avuncular assurances that all would be well, that he would look after us, that he would do everything he could to see he did not get in our way.  We all know what that is worth.  Is it not true that tonight Callaghan stands or falls on a vote on the sanctions issue&mdash;that his Parliament may not be there tomorrow?  Very soon there will be a general election and Mrs. Thatcher could become Prime Minister. With the unstable nature of British politics during their post-imperial decline, what validity have their assurances? Why should we accept a guarantee from Mr. Callaghan that he will keep some sort of link with European exchange rates?  Can we accept such a guarantee from any of the others?</P>
    <P>Twice already the &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; has been broken up.  Twice they have given assurances about bands within which currencies will fluctuate and the French, Italians and British have all had to withdraw.  What has now changed?  Why this euphoria about this discredited idea? It is not linked to any central determination by the nine countries to examine the whole matter in a panoramic way.  The organisation of such an enormous population cannot be achieved by fiddling around with exchange rates.  That has been shown already.  Nothing has been said by anyone in any of the countries which gives reason to believe there is likely to be any change.</P>
    <P>In the USA, with all their faults, there is a general attitude, a like-mindedness, about their aspirations for the various components of their state.  In the Soviet <Col N="1488" /> Union the basic socialist philosophy permeates the thinking of most of the laws, whether one likes it or not.  In this system there appears to be an attempt to establish a moneylenders' paradise, a bankers' paradise.  They know our economy as well as we know it ourselves and they are aware of its weaknesses. We were told by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste that we must reduce our borrowing from 13½ per cent to 10 per cent. With that kind of problem, any Government is faced with higher taxation or alternative taxation, such as taxing the wealthy farmers or taking over the mines.  The Government will not do that.  They will cut down on public spending on houses, hospitals, schools and roads.  Unemployment is the obvious sequel to that and it will push down living standards.</P>
    <P>This is the dilemma facing the Government. They are now offered a new loan which effectively doubles our existing indebtedness. It seems that the Taoiseach saw this as an outrageous proposal in the light of what he had been telling us about cutting down our current deficit. The proposal now is that we double our indebtedness by going into the EMS.  We have found a new moneylender with enormous resources.  What kind of an organisation would it be?  It is said that backstairs negotiations are going on.  Is it likely there will be a new summit by telephone?  Will they come to some new arrangement to salve the Taoiseach's conscience?</P>
    <P>The EEC is totally discredited.  I never believed in it anyway.  The next move must be away from the EEC.  It is early days yet but it would not surprise me if quite a number of people see it that way. The Taoiseach's reputation is now in question.  He can remain as Taoiseach under the pressure of the Tánaiste and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  They are obviously concerned with financial needs and he is under enormous pressure to reverse what he said publicly about this being a bad deal for our country.  He is of my own generation and it may be one of the last things he may ever do.  It is a very serious decision.  He should continue to maintain the stand he took.  He fully appreciates the implications of going into <Col N="1489" /> debt to West Germany who will be the taskmaster and paymaster.  Instead we should look elsewhere for the funds needed.  In the light of all he has said and his categorical denial of the suggestion that we should go in, I do not see how the Taoiseach can maintain his credit and his position of integrity if he does not either reject the idea or allow the others to accept it and resign.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the opening of the debate this morning it is hard to appreciate the continual flow of criticism regarding the lack of information on the EMS.  No Parliament in the nine countries has had more opportunity than the Dáil to look in great detail at the pros and cons and implications of joining the system.  The Opposition told the Taoiseach and Ministers responsible that we were rushing into the EMS, that we were blindly going into a system the full implications of which we did not fully appreciate.</P>
      <P>Up to the commencement of the Brussels Summit, the Taoiseach had kept the House fully informed on developments.  After discussions with various heads of State he made statements clarifying that we would certainly consider very seriously entry to the EMS if the terms were right.  The phrase &ldquo;if the terms are right&rdquo; has been conveniently forgotten by many Opposition speakers in assessing the up-to-date situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has outlined, in the hours before the commencement of the Brussels Summit the heads of central banks, Finance Ministers and their advisers were going into great detail on how the system could attract the nine members of the EEC.  The Germans, who hold the Presidency of the EEC, produced a working document with brackets around the figures put forward by certain countries.  Each country's case was discussed in great detail.  When the Taoiseach put forward the Government's case other countries possibly shifted their stance and took another line on their requirements of the EMS.  The Taoiseach, an able international statesman experienced at bargaining for this country, was very forthright at the end of the summit in bluntly telling <Col N="1490" /> everybody concerned that in his assessment the terms were not right.</P>
    <P>There is no question of the situation the Opposition tried to put forward. They first told us that were were rushing in and then said we had been conned. This is a complete distortion of the facts and the Government, in this House, have rejected it.  When one hears speeches from the Opposition benches, their lack of preparation and real study of the EMS is obvious and I suppose the best they can do is criticise.</P>
    <P>We have had a second opportunity to debate the EMS in this House but we have yet to hear from the Opposition parties what is their assessment of what we require as a precondition of entry. They try continually to distort the situation, and this cannot do us any good with our trading partners in Europe and further afield.  However, it appears to have been a storm in a teacup, and the Taoiseach this morning in his statement brought the position up to date.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that the leaders of the Opposition parties in particular should seek continually to get from the Taoiseach confidential information with regard to the negotiations prior to his having discussions and coming to an agreement.  As outlined by the Taoiseach this morning, if one or other leader of the Opposition parties can secure the office of Taoiseach the confidential content of our affairs will be entrusted to him, but until that happens it is the duty of this Government to negotiate on behalf of the people, to make a recommendation and then to give the House an opportunity to debate that decision.  Deputies on the back benches have full confidence in them.</P>
    <P>Since the Brussels summit, in common with Italy our Government and Cabinet have been discussing the situation that existed at the end of the summit. It is obvious that it is an ongoing situation.  It is well-known also that the Cabinet were discussing and considering the updated situation up to 11.30 p.m. last night.  Today the Italian Parliament is discussing whether they should enter the EMS, and the situation is similar here.  I have no doubt that since his return from the summit the Taoiseach <Col N="1491" /> has made alterations and changes in the request for finance in different forms to create the facility for entry if our fellow-partners in the EEC can see their way to meeting our case.</P>
    <P>With regard to Britain and the stand that country has taken, in the past when major political decisions were necessary by the Government of that country, due to their delicate balancing position they have had to shy away from such decisions. It is obvious that the question of entry by Britain into the EMS is being put aside yet again.  However, there have been comments and suggestions from this side of the House, and they have been set out in the White Paper, that there might be good reason for us to join the EMS and maintain parity with sterling. If we can secure the flexibility of the percentage rate of 6 per cent which the Italians have put forward and if we can get the necessary resources, whether grants or loans, we might be in a position to get the best of both worlds.</P>
    <P>As 50 per cent of our trade is with Britain&mdash;having come down from approximately 75 per cent since joining the EEC&mdash;it is obvious that the British market is an important outlet for us.  We would have complications if we entered the EMS and if there was a change in the value of the Irish punt as against the £ sterling.  If the Taoiseach, his financial advisers and the Minister concerned can bring about the transfer of resources as well as the flexibility of sticking with the £ sterling, I can see a situation that we may decide to enter the EMS before many days are passed.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile to reflect on the alternatives. If we do not enter the EMS what will be the position?  It is obvious that Britain will not enter at this stage, but as they are a large country and have a large economy probably they could have greater flexibility in opting for the system at a later date.  We are faced with the prospect of looking at the situation that will develop if we do not enter.  We would be losing an opportunity to co-ordinate our finances with what is developing to be our biggest market since joining the EEC.  It has been to the advantage of our fellow-members in the <Col N="1492" /> EEC because when the value of our currency was dropping their purchasing power was greater.  This can have a detrimental effect on our control of our own affairs.  In the EMS if the terms are right we have an opportunity to link ourselves, economically and financially, to a much broader and more demanding market.  We are in the EEC and the benefits of that membership are easily identified.  There is another step forward if the terms and the situation are right for entry into the EMS.</P>
    <P>It was difficult to understand Deputy Bruton.  He made a major criticism of the negotiating position of the Taoiseach regarding the usage of the £45 million which it has been suggested was available.  The Deputy wanted to know what was infrastructure.  He wanted to know if it was roads, communications or an advance factory.  I do not know how an Opposition speaker could be so vague about the reality.  We move our products in this country from the factories and the processing firms to the consumers.  The fabric of the buildings, the roads on which the goods are moved, the communications in buying and selling, can all be regarded as infrastructure.</P>
    <P>One can readily accept that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance will put whatever funds become available to the best possible use.  If we want examples of how to misdirect EEC funds we can look back at the record of the last Government where their Minister for Finance blatantly misused EEC funds: he brought them into the Central Fund for dispersal in a most inefficient way.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael and Labour Parties when given the opportunity to speak endeavoured to hurl personal criticisms rather than factual arguments in this debate so far.  We have heard no constructive or alternative comments regarding the workings of the EMS, our requirements and the future situation. The people seemed to hold a similar attitude to us towards the Coalition Government when the last election came up.  They decided that the Coalition Government had little other than arguments and excuses to put forward.</P>
    <P>Assuming that conditions for our entry into the EMS were favourable it is <Col N="1493" /> worth while to reflect on the likely development of continental investment here.  We can see a situation where Germany particularly would increase their investment here.  French investment would probably increase also.  We probably have not had enough involvement with France although we are now finding in France an excellent outlet for our meat products.  The potential investment prospects from both those large mainland European countries cannot but be of advantage.  There has been a rise in German investment here and there is a great potential market there for our food products.  Irrespective of what the outcome of the EMS negotiations are the Taoiseach has forged closer and worth while contacts with those two countries in relation to investment.  We have certainly shown our EEC colleagues the capability and the capacity of the present Government by the comprehensive presentation of our case in relation to our entry into the EMS.  Our European colleagues cannot but be impressed by our request for a transfer of resources and the serious intentions of this Government in improving infrastructure which automatically improves industrial development and job creation.</P>
    <P>It is hard to credit the Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Bruton, on the argument about infrastructure.  As a Deputy who must use one of the most congested motorways to reach his constituency Deputy Bruton must know that tremendous investment in our roads system is needed.  If our going into the EMS will make funds available for that vital improvement, if we are to get the investment to push development out from Dublin which is over congested, that is the right policy to pursue.  Naturally every Government must cut its cloth to measure, and with our increasing population demands for housing and other such facilities will continue.  We see in an EMS situation along with the committed policy of the Government to improve available facilities, that we can get funds for the investment-type requirements of infrastructure, and we must give this matter serious consideration.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach handled the situation correctly when he said in Brussels that he could not recommend the package offered <Col N="1494" /> but that we would debate the matter in greater detail.  We can assure the Opposition and the Fianna Fáil backbenchers that we have the fullest confidence in the way negotiations have been handled to date.  We are still confident that the excellent presentation of the Irish case may yet bring about a satisfactory conclusion.  The Taoiseach in his negotiations put forward a package in relation to the transfer of resources that other countries, Italy and Britain, appeared to have used in their negotiations and this has put our rating with our European partners well up the scale.  One cannot but feel satisfied that our case has been put forward in a most business-like fashion and that the matter is far from closed.</P>
    <P>To get a facility to link up with so many other currencies associated with thriving economies will certainly bring about discipline, but it will also be a tremendous challenge.  The issues in the debate prior to our entry to the EEC were similar to the issues in this debate. The issues at stake then were, did we want to get into a grouping of countries so as to get greater trade outlets with the removal of tariffs and barriers so as to allow us to expand and become more competitive?  The issues today are, do we want to link our currency with European countries who have shown the way in job creation and in the advancement of their peoples?  This is an opportunity to join with some very fit competitors.  We have asked for funds to enable us to compete.  We are looking for a five-year transitional period and for funding and facilities in that period.  That is the challenge, to become competent and efficient. We must accept the challenge and look forward to the potential that can arise if our case is accepted by our partners in Europe.</P>
    <P>The outcome hinges on what is happening in the Italian Parliament.  It appears that after seeing our case the German and French Heads of State have managed to get the Italians to reduce their demands.  One can only hope that our case for entry will now be given priority.</P>
    <P>When discussing this subject one must also consider the disciplines which the &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; imposed and recognise that <Col N="1495" /> it has been a useful exercise for the countries concerned.  The EMS is an extension of the &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; and it will impose disciplines on the economies that are able to sustain participation.  The greatest curse for many economies was the inflation in the early seventies.  At that time our economy was not controlled by the two Opposition parties who rushed to grab power without any clear-cut policy for dealing with inflation. That was a dear lesson for us.  At the last general election the people decided not to accept the incompetence of that abrupt marriage.  They have now charged the Taoiseach and his Cabinet with the running of the country.  One can expect positive and progressive results from this administration.  In 1978 we entered into a commitment in the budget and we are on target in regard to job creation.</P>
    <P>We are now in the final stages of negotiating our entry into the EMS.  The Taoiseach and his Cabinet have scrutinised the economy in relation to its potential.  There is also the possibility that we may end up with some form of financial arrangement with the Germans.  At this stage they are in an outward investment mood.  During the negotiations we had an opportunity of letting them know our potential.  As we face 1979 new horizons are opening up for us.  According to an IDA publication, investment is increasing in job creation and in improving the infrastructure. An investment of more than £70 million in 1978 must create more jobs.  Today we are in a much stronger position within Europe.</P>
    <P>I failed to understand Deputy Bruton's remarks.  Having complimented the Leader of his Party on his bungling, Deputy Bruton said that we must join the EMS.  He said that if we do not join the facilities that are available now may not be available in six months' time.  Are we to take it that the Fine Gael Party are advocating entry under any terms?  It is difficult to assess the attitude of Fine Gael in relation to the EMS.  They are suggesting that if Britain decides to join the EMS we will be left out in the cold.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Labour Party, which is obstructionist, is predictable. <Col N="1496" /> They have been critical but have not put forward any helpful suggestion.  They adopted the same attitude in relation to the EEC but they must admit that the decision of the Fianna Fáil Government to enter the EEC was correct.  However, they are never prepared to admit that they may be wrong.  Misleading comments about the Government can only confuse our European partners.  Whether or not we enter the EMS, the Government's decision will be the right one for us.  The detail in which our case has been presented has brought about a greater awareness of our progressive policies.  I compliment the Taoiseach and his Ministers on their negotiations.  I am quietly optimistic that we may yet be part of the proposed financial system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Who would have thought 18 months ago that today, almost on the eve of Christmas, we would be in this House watching the Fianna Fáil Government and their 84 Members with their backs against the wall.  That is where they are standing at present.  They may be broad-backed but it is a very long wall.  It is a situation in which they have put themselves.</P>
      <P>One of the problems we face when we are talking about this motion and about the Labour party amendment is that there can be only a few hundred people who fully understand all the implications of what is happening at present.  To judge by the glum faces on the Government benches this morning, there are not many of them to be found in Fianna Fáil.  I do not claim to understand every aspect of every implication of what is involved for us in the EMS but I am able to read and to listen and to make sense of what is said by the Taoiseach and by Government Ministers.  Another problem we are facing in this debate is that we are arguing about the length of a piece of string.  We do not yet know what is really on offer and we may not know until after a decision has been taken on our behalf by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to support the amendment in the name of the Leader of the Labour Party for at least six specific reasons. First, I believe that the Taoiseach did not accurately or correctly read the attitude of some other important members <Col N="1497" /> of the EEC to the fundamental question of transfer of resources when he was having bilateral discussions with them prior to the summit on 4 December.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I believe as indeed the Taoiseach himself believes, that he did not get enough by way of resource transfers as a result of that summit meeting.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I believe that the Taoiseach and the Government failed almost completely to consider and devise strategies to deal with at least some of the options that might have emerged because of the developing situation.  The classic example of this is the option that has now arisen with Italy apparently prepared to go in while Ireland remains undecided.  It seems very much as if the Taoiseach's and the Government's strategy was based on a fairly simplistic assumption that either everybody would be in or that Ireland, Italy and Britain would remain out.</P>
    <P>The fourth reason why I support our amendment is that I believe that the Taoiseach and other members of the Government have been deliberately obscure and diversionary in connection with that part of the discussion which relates to breaking the link with sterling.</P>
    <P>The fifth reason why I believe our amendment should be accepted is that I believe the Taoiseach and the Government have deliberately tried to conceal the seriousness of the problems which will face us even if we do go into the EMS.</P>
    <P>Finally, I believe they have attempted to conceal or minimise the domestic political and financial consequences of the strategy they have so far adopted.  I should like to spell out in rather more detail the substance behind these assertions.</P>
    <P>My first assertion was that the Taoiseach did not accurately estimate the attitude of important members of the Council of Ministers when he was conducting bilateral negotiations with them. In his speech this morning there is some evidence of this.  Doubtless the Taoiseach would not so describe it but it is very difficult to read the paragraph that I am about to quote and not feel sympathy for him.  He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1498" /> After my meetings with the French President and the German Chancellor in particular, I felt that the transfers which we sought would not be in the form of grants only and at no stage did I give the impression that we could get the full amount of the transfers we asked for.  I still, however, expressed my confidence and I feel it was important that I should have done so.</P>
    <P>This is a pathetic admission by the Taoiseach of the failure of his strategy or of the failure to understand in time how much less we were actually being offered than he had hoped for in the beginning.  Not only are we being apparently offered less but we are being offered it in forms different from those which he and the Government originally thought appropriate.</P>
    <P>It must be bitter for the Taoiseach to review developments that took place before, during and since the summit and to reflect on the strange happenings that have occurred.  High on that list is the ironic fact that in Europe it has been the Socialists and Social Democrats, the allies of this party in Europe, who have been trying to ensure that some decent transfer of resources takes place to Ireland while the political allies of the Taoiseach's party in the European Parliament, the Gaullists, have been doing their best to break the back of the transfer of resources move.  This morning the Taoiseach paraphrased assurances he had from two other members of the Council of Ministers that basically they supported the idea that there should be a greater transfer of resources to Ireland than was on the table at the time.  One of them, the Prime Minister of Denmark, was a Socialist; the other, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, heads a Government in which Socialists are also represented. Conspicuously absent from the Taoiseach's statement was any indication of the attitude, helpful or otherwise, of his allies in the European Parliament from Denmark whose attitude to this problem has not yet been aired in this House.  I suspect there are very good reasons why the Taoiseach has declined to do so.  This is the sad result of the sorry <Col N="1499" /> alliances that the Taoiseach and his party have made in Europe, alliances so sorry that they now have to go to people who are our allies in Europe seeking the help which these people are trying with the best goodwill to give us.</P>
    <P>The second main charge is that the Taoiseach has not succeeded in getting a sufficient transfer of resources.  Deputy Liam Lawlor, who spoke before me, made two statements which cannot be supported.  First, he asked had we ever made an assessment of what was needed by way of resource transfer to enable us to join the EMS.  We are prepared to take, at least for argument purposes, the Taoiseach's original statement that something of the order of £650 million in grants would be needed to enable us to meet the demands of the EMS.  I do not know how we can go any further towards satisfying him than by accepting for argument purposes the assessment and the figure put down by his own leader.  He has also accused this party in particular of failure to specify where we stand in relation to the EMS. This party's position has been spelled out by our party leader this morning and again in a series of statements heard in this House in the past few days.  He made it quite clear that we favour entering the EMS if and only if the terms are right.  He also made clear what, in his opinion, those terms should be.  They include an adequate resource transfer of the order of £650 million in terms of grants, not loans.  They include a refusal to accede to any dismantling of the common agricultural policy and a number of other items which are on the records of the House and which Deputy Lawlor has available to him if he wants to read them.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to say that we did not get enough; it is another thing to actually point out how much less we actually got than what we asked for.  <i>The Economist</i> of 9 December points out the whole detail of the transfer of resources argument in graphic terms.  The quotation, from page 17, reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The French insisted that the maximum that could be offered was extra loans of 1,000m ecus ($1.3 billion) <Col N="1500" /> per year plus 200m ecus ($260m) per year in interest-rate rebates.  Two thirds of this would go to Italy and one third to Ireland.  But the Irish wanted a minimum of $260m per year in grants (e.g., rebates) for themselves alone.  The Italians wanted $470m per year.  That meant requests for an annual total of over $700m in grants, against the $260m on offer. Result, unhappiness.  Ireland's Mr. Jack Lynch calculated that the offer would be worth only £45m a year to Ireland.  He told the summit that he would advise his cabinet against acceptance.</P>
    <P>The logic of this situation is that we were looking for a sum which we considered necessary for us to tide us over entry into the EMS, which was equivalent to the total amount that the EMS was prepared to advance both to Italy and to ourselves.  And, as we were only to get a third of that total amount in any case, and Italy were to get the other two-thirds, it follows quite bluntly that what was on offer to Ireland was only a third of what we felt was necessary.</P>
    <P>We all know that there are bargaining positions and fall-back positions.  We all know, as the Taoiseach said, that we do not necessarily hope to get everything we ask for but a third of what we asked for is a hell of a lot less.  The Taoiseach must know in his heart of hearts that there is barely any possibility, regardless of how it is to be achieved&mdash;through bilateral negotiations or whatever&mdash;that that offer, a third of what he thought was necessary, can be raised to anything like a reasonable and acceptable figure before the time when a decision has to be taken.</P>
    <P>Of course, the other main thing is that so much of the assistance which is to be made available to us is to be made available by way of loans rather than by way of grants.  Any farmer building a piggery knows the difference between a loan and a grant.  I will not labour the point&mdash;because the Leader of our party has already made it and it has been made by other speakers in the House&mdash;that a loan of this kind effectively is only an obligation deferred; it is not in itself a transfer of resources.  The <Col N="1501" /> economists will tell you there is no such thing as the free lunch; everything has to be paid for by somebody somewhere. Far too much of the alleged aid we are being offered in return for a decision to join the EMS is of the free-lunch category; it will have to be paid back by the Irish people in due course.</P>
    <P>There are certain other aspects of these loans to which I feel I should draw the attention of the House.  One of them, which may be a comparatively minor one only, is that the interest rebates we are being offered, amounting to some £45 million a year, apparently are to be financed from the EEC budget.  I would like whoever replies to this debate on behalf of the Government to explain to us whether these £45 million are to be financed by an EEC budget to which we ourselves will be contributing continuously. Therefore, will we, in effect, be contributing at least in part to this interest rebate which we are claiming effectively as a grant?</P>
    <P>The second major problem about these loans is that effectively they will be provided for us in European units of currency. For various technical reasons it is inevitable that the greater part of them will be made in hard currencies.</P>
    <P>If we go into the EMS; if we have to devalue, even within the narrow limits proposed by the EMS; or, worse still, if we have to come out of the EMS altogether, subject to a greater devaluation, we will be in the position of paying back these loans in currencies hardened against ours in a situation in which our exchange losses could be absolutely catastrophic.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to make about the loans is in relation to their timetable. The general impression is, because we have five years before we have to start paying back the loans, that, in some sense, we are being given a breathing space.  Of course, this is not true because the five-year moratorium&mdash;assuming it is to be five years&mdash;applies to the capital only; we will have to pay interest.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of key dates to which I should like to draw the attention of the House.  The first of these is 1981 because, in 1981, for the first time, the interest&mdash;if we take up the full amount of the loan&mdash;on the payment <Col N="1502" /> that would be made to us in that year will exceed the amount we are getting by way of rebate or subsidy.  Therefore, on that basis, we will be feeling the first chill winds of repayment in 1981.  The contingency of 1981 to the date of the next general election, I suspect, is not entirely unexpected, nor is it altogether unlikely that this is a major factor in the Government's thinking at this time.  The second major date I would bring to the attention of the House is the 1983-1984 period. This is the period over which our financial relationship with this loan structure goes through a radical reverse.  In 1983&mdash;if we were to accept this loan on these terms&mdash;there would be a net inflow of the order of £169 million.  But in 1984 there would be a net outflow of £123 million.  Taking those two together we are talking about a turnaround in a period of 24 months of £300 million. Certainly I would be interested to see how the Government of the day&mdash;which will not be this Government; it may well be another Fianna Fáil Government &mdash;will explain away to the people the need to raise those £300 million.  Effectively what is happening here is that this Government, certainly on the basis of this proposal&mdash;and it is unlikely they will get anything very much more satisfactory than this&mdash;are putting the future very much in pawn to pay for the present.</P>
    <P>I have dealt already with the question of Italy.  I should like to move on to the question of the link with sterling.  I have said that the Government here have been deliberately obscure and diversionary; that is a relatively mild description of what has been going on.  The White Paper contains a paragraph about the possibilities and the options in relation to the sterling link.  I will not read it in detail but it refers at the end to the possibility that Ireland could opt for a 6 per cent fluctuation margin even within the EMS, and finishes with saying that any decision to avail of the option of a wider fluctuation margin could be made in the light of the resource transfers or other facilities that would be available to Ireland in the event of membership.</P>
    <P>The Government have not told us what other facilities might be available to us apart from the resource transfers. <Col N="1503" /> In fact their whole section on the link with sterling betrays a woolliness which falls very far short of the information that we in this House would like them to give us.  The Taoiseach's speech this morning, unless I am greatly mistaken, did not refer to the sterling link at all, a most extraordinary omission in a situation in which he had the opportunity to reflect on the new position in which Italy is apparently committed to going in and we were, as yet, undecided.  I would have expected more from the Taoiseach on this, and certainly his failure to deal with the matter is in marked contrast with the wrap-the-green-flag-round-me stuff that has come from some of his colleagues in an attempt to persuade the people that the real motive for doing what is proposed can be concealed by nationalist rhetoric and a failure to examine any of the options seriously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn, who spoke at some length, was under the extraordinary delusion in relation to resource transfers that everything was just about tied up. He said there was no doubt whatsoever in any businessman's mind but that we were doing the right thing in trying to join the EMS.  I doubt if he has read the statements of many prominent businessmen and indeed, by trade unionists, because they have expressed serious reservations.  In relation to the level and amount of resources to be transferred Deputy Flynn said there are only a few pegs in the ladder missing.  I would hate to be buying ladders from Deputy Flynn or using one of his ladders to put against the side of my house to paint the wall, because, if Deputy Flynn really thinks that this package as presented to us is a fine financial package, with the exception of a few pegs missing, then he really ought to think again.</P>
    <P>The other major point is that the Government have not come clean in relation to the seriousness of the problems we would face.  There is a section in the White Paper on this.  Again, it is very woolly and very vague.  There was no reference at all this morning in the Taoiseach's speech to the possible problems we might face either in or out. The Tánaiste said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1504" /> If we join the EMS we shall have serious problems and we have never pretended otherwise.</P>
    <P>They may not have ever pretended otherwise but they have certainly not gone out of their way to draw the attention of the people and this House to the gravity of these problems, their nature and how the Government propose to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to turn the attention of the House to my charge that the Government have attempted to conceal or minimise the domestic political and financial consequences of the strategy they are adopting.  The Tánaiste went to considerable pains this morning to try to persuade the House&mdash;he adopted a special low tone of voice which he tends to adopt when he does not seem to be entirely convinced himself of what he is saying&mdash;that there was absolutely no relationship between this whole EMS question and the country's internal financial management as expressed in the Estimates and the budget.  I will quote now from an unrevised copy what the Tánaiste actually said.  He said:</P>
    <P>Estimates are prepared a long time back.  They are discussed by the Government.  No Government could possibly be preparing Estimates on the basis of what might come from the EMS.  Estimates have been prepared and are virtually</P>
    <P>I stress the word &ldquo;virtually&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>finalised in Cabinet without any reference to the EMS and our budget stance is being prepared on the basis of our economic strategy as outlined repeatedly before, during and since the last general election.</P>
    <P>I would add two grace notes to that statement by the Tánaiste.  One is by Mr. Michael Mills in <i>The Irish Press</i> today where he said:</P>
    <P>The Government spent some time yesterday discussing the EMS before returning to the study of the Estimates for Government Departments for the coming year.  Any connection between the two is entirely coincidental.  Most Ministers are believed to have expressed their opinion on the new monetary <Col N="1505" /> system and on the terms offered to Ireland.  Some Ministers are thought to favour entry to the system even on the existing terms but the Taoiseach's recommendation that the offer is not sufficient to meet Ireland's needs stands.</P>
    <P>There we have the evidence of a reliable and trustworthy political correspondent who says that there are even within the bosom of the Cabinet some Ministers who believe, because they are no doubt desperate for money, that we should take even what has been put into the begging bowl by the rich nations of Europe.</P>
    <P>The other grace note I would add is again in the words of the Tánaiste who, at the end of his speech, admitted:</P>
    <P>There could well be sums of money received which would have to be dealt with in the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>If the Tánaiste seriously expects this House to believe there is no relationship between the public capital programme and the budget or the Estimates he must really be taking us for a considerable bunch of suckers indeed, because every Member knows the public capital programme is effectively capital borrowed for public works and the interest charges for sums so borrowed must, of course, find their place in the Estimates and in the budgetary strategy of the Government.  It follows inevitably that, if a huge load of interest charges can be removed&mdash;I stress in the short term&mdash;by accretion of soft loans then there will be an equivalent amount of interest available for distribution in the Estimates between Government Departments and available to soften the impact of any budgetary taxation fiscal change. That is the link between the two and that is why there is an integral link between the EMS strategy and this Government's disastrously short-term financial and budgetary policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn said, with more hope than conviction, that the future of this country was safe in the Taoiseach's arms.  The Taoiseach has only two arms, and I expect they are fully employed at the moment keeping apart the sparring partners in his Cabinet.  It may well be <Col N="1506" /> that the best thing he can do in the circumstances is to refuse to bow to pressure both from Europe and from the many hungry Ministers in his Cabinet to accept terms like these, which are manifestly unsuitable for this country, to put the green flag away in the cupboard and look again realistically at other options open to us.  If he does this, if he refuses to allow himself to be ballyragged into accepting a deal that is patently unsatisfactory, even if it were to be the last service he would do for the people of this country, it might be the best, and only then would he be putting country before party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>If this proposal of the Community heads of Government for a new currency mechanism in the Community had no other result than to focus attention on our economic situation, with the intensity that it has, in my view it would have been well worth while.  This proposal for a new European currency mechanism to which we are invited to adhere has suddenly made us all turn and look very seriously at our overall position as a national economy. It has, I think, compelled us to do that much more than we would have done in the normal course of events.</P>
      <P>In one way or another, in the House and outside through various bodies like the ESRI or the NESC, we have had under review sectors and aspects of our economy and trends in the economy. These examinations and reviews have been concentrated, as a rule, on sections of our economy, and more often than not they are concerned with warnings about dangerous trends in incomes, in our balance of payments, in regard to cost indicators and other such matters. We do not normally look at the economy in the round and try to assess it as a unit.  It is only because we have come up against the problem of deciding whether to join this new monetary system that we have been compelled to subject the economy as a unit to a sort of performance test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a completely different type of examination from the ones we normally undertake.  I do not think we have had <Col N="1507" /> much time to carry out an overall assessment of the national economy, but it has been the subject of some examination and comment throughout the community by different bodies and organisations. Different organisations and individuals have made attempts to do this, and in so far as our national economy as a whole will be subjected to some new type of situation, a number of people have felt it necessary to look at the national economy as a whole in a comparative way.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what should have emerged from that new type of examination, that new assessment function that has been thrust upon us by these developments.  A fairly complex picture emerges, at least in outline.  There could be interminable argument about the details, but there are many criteria which we could use to assess the economy in a materialist international context, or indeed <i>per se.</i>  The simplest argument, perhaps, that we could use for international competitive purposes is the economic one.  There are others, but in the context of this debate or discussion, what is relevant is the manner in which, in terms of the materialist situation, our economy caters for our people relative to the economies of the other nations comprising the EEC.</P>
    <P>It is very tempting at this stage to enter a number of areas of comparison, and I propose to qualify anything I say by making the reservation that I am talking only in a materialist sense and that I am not for a moment suggesting that there are not many other valid criteria that could be applied which perhaps could give more favourable results in our case.  I suppose most Deputies are aware that there is a considerable volume of opinion, which is growing, in regard to growth economics. We have been brought up to speak in terms of growth economics, of gross national product.</P>
    <P>At this stage of world development, I should point out that other theories are now being put forward to revive the simple old industrial revolution concept of constant growth in GNP being the be all and end all of economic activity.  As I have said, for the purposes of this debate <Col N="1508" /> and discussion we should confine ourselves to the materialist aspect and examine whether the Irish economy is providing the same levels of materialist satisfaction as our neighbours throughout Europe are doing.</P>
    <P>Confining ourselves strictly to that theory, we must admit that our economy is doing very badly.  Let me immediately add that I do not accept necessarily that that poor performance is our fault or the fault of anybody else or indeed, as I have already said, that that is the be all and end all of the assessment of the situation, but the materialist criteria gives a reasonable starting point.  Looked at from the point of view of the normal consumer society indicators, we are in a very subsidiary state compared to our European neighbours, that is, if we are just to look at the usual criteria used to measure economic growth, prosperity and development in the modern world.</P>
    <P>I suppose the simplest measurement we can consider is that of per capita income&mdash;there are many others.  We could look at the number of telephones per head of our population, at the number of television sets per head of the population, the number of hospital beds, schools and so on.  Whichever of these we take we will find, and I do not like to use the word, that we are in a backward situation: if we take the simple measurement of per capital income we will find that our economy is not performing as well for its members as most of the other European economies.  Taking that measure alone, we will find that our per capita income by some standards of measurement is probably one-third that of Germany and our other prosperous neighbours.  It is certainly less than a half.  We are not producing goods and services at anywhere near the level of those who are at the top of the European league.  It is not of any particular value to say who is to blame, but it is at the basis of all the talk of Ireland being a special case in the discussions regarding the evolution of the EMS.  We are a special case because in the European league our economy at this stage of its development provides us with something between one-third and one-half of the materialist standard of living available throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> We must accept that fact, but to say that is quite meaningless by itself.  We must go on to ask why this is so.  That is a far more important question and is relevant in the developments now under such intense discussion throughout Europe.</P>

      <P>How do we develop to the point where we are at the same level as the others?  Are we not as intelligent as people in other member states?  Do we not work as hard as others in the Community?  If we work, are we properly motivated?  If we want to work as hard and be as effective as others, have we the means to do so?  These are the questions we must ask ourselves in the context of these discussions.  Are our industrial relations the problem?  Do all these stoppages, lockouts and go-slows seriously reduce the level of output of goods and services by comparison with more prosperous countries?  Is it in that area that the answers to our problems can be found?</P>
      <P>What about the managements of industry, commerce and agricultural enterprises?  Are they as effective, well-trained and hardworking as their European counterparts?  Is it the taxation system that is at fault?  Does our taxation system, because of lack of proper incentives or the prevention of the offering of proper incentives, hold us back in our attempt to reach the same level as our neighbours?  The scope for debate in these areas is almost endless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I imagine that many commentators and analysts would concentrate on one aspect of the situation.  I want to put forward my suggestion as to what is the basic impediment or inhibition which keeps our economy in this state of inadequate <Col N="1510" /> performance which prevents it from contributing to our welfare in the way in which the German, Dutch, Belgian or French economies contribute to the welfare of the citizens of those countries.  I am not terribly concerned with the British or Italian economies. This is very relevant because if we can claim with justification that the rate of growth in our economy is greater than in any other country in Europe nevertheless it is true that the disparity between the different levels of material prosperity in Europe is growing.  In fact, the richer countries in Europe are getting richer and this serious discrepancy between our level of income and that of other consumer societies is increasing.</P>
    <P>There is one factor which everybody must accept plays a major part in this situation.  One factor more than any other, or at least in direct line with others, contributes to our low level of economic achievement.  That factor is the level, the appropriateness and the suitability of our infrastructure.  I suggest it would be generally accepted that the inadequacy of our infrastructure, our roads, telephones, technical education transport and all these things which for convience are put under the generic title of &ldquo;infrastructure,&rdquo; is a major factor in our not being able to reach much higher levels of output.  This is the major impediment preventing Irish industry, agriculture and commerce from performing in the way they might otherwise perform.  I do not think they can be expected to function in the inadequate infrastructural environment we have today.</P>
    <P>Whether if we had an infrastructure of the same quality and sophistication as the Ruhr we would be able to match the German economy in performance is another question, but we would at least be able to start out on level terms and if we were still not matching in performance we would be able to identify where the fault really lay.  At this stage there is no doubt that a comparatively inadequate infrastructure is at the basis of our economic deprivation in terms of the European league.  I used the word &ldquo;comparatively&rdquo; very advisedly because I believe that the infrastructure we have <Col N="1511" /> today in enormously better than it was five, ten or 20 years ago but everyone who looks at it in the context of these discussions must accept that it is the main inhibiting factor in our attempt to keep up in the economic race.</P>
    <P>There is a corollary here with a principle that is often used by those who are concerned with the Third World and the hunger that exists in that area.  When I was Minister for Agriculture the principle used in those days was, &ldquo;If I give a man a fish I feed him for one day but if I give him a fishing rod I enable him to feed himself for the rest of his life&rdquo;.  In other words, it is much more important to provide the means whereby people can help themselves rather than to dole out temporary, short-term assistance.  If we are provided with the necessary infrastructural means we can catch up but if we are only provided with temporary handouts and aid and with short-term benefits I do not think we will solve the problem.</P>
    <P>My interest in the EMS debate is centred on the creation and improvement of our infrastructure.  It is not exclusively centred on it but it is centrally based on that aspect.  That is why the failure of the regional policy was probably the most serious disappointment of the Community to date.  The regional fund could have remedied this deficiency in our structure.  Potentially it could have been the mechanism that would have enabled us to come quickly from behind in economic performance. It would have been the means by which we could have been provided with our fishing rod but it did not work.  It was a failure.  The thinking and the philosophy behind it was wrong.</P>
    <P>We have our own infrastructural programme.  We have a public capital programme that is mainly directed towards improving our infrastructure.  It is about £500&mdash;£600 million per year but it is becoming increasingly clear that that programme is not on the scale that is required.  At the level at which it is pitched now it does not allow us to do what we would like to do in the European context.  I would not say that we could not from our own resources develop it to the point where it would <Col N="1512" /> give us the results we need but everybody must admit that if we could get immediate access to some new major source of development means we could transform the country very rapidly.</P>
    <P>So far as I'm concerned the question is, what does this new proposal mean in terms of our basic underlying problem, namely, the question of infrastructure. What is proposed is a new exchange rate mechanism.  In itself that would be desirable and would be capable of contributing to an expanding Europe out of which we would ultimately gain.  We must be clear, however, that for most of the member states involved this is nothing more than a new exchange rate mechanism and it is clearly seen to be such.  Much of the comment in this country was confusing in this regard. Phrases were used such as, &ldquo;We are going to be in&rdquo;, &ldquo;We are getting in&rdquo;, and &ldquo;We're in&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <P>It was as if there was some new community into which we could enter.  At the initial stages&mdash;I want to emphasise that&mdash;all that was involved was a currency exchange rate mechanism.  The expert committee that looked at this came out in classic economic fashion with the dictum that if the exchange rates were fixed at the right level in the new situation there would be no need for a transfer of resources.  That is the situation that presented itself to our negotiators when they came to discuss this matter.</P>
      <P>Let us recognise what this exchange rate mechanism means and what our adherence to it <i>per se</i> would be if there were nothing else involved.  It would have a number of technical advantages but not much more.  It would help us to participate in an expanding and developing unit but it is wrong to think that an exchange rate in any way can effect internal development policies and programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The foreign currency exchange rate of any country is to the national economy of that country very much what a weighing scales is to a person on a diet. It reflects the performance of the person <Col N="1513" /> but it does not do much more than that. The German economy is not strong because the German mark is a strong currency.  It is exactly the opposite.  The German mark is the strongest currency in the world because the German economy is the strongest economy in the world because the Germans can produce goods and services efficiently and at prices that the rest of the world want and have to buy.  The approach of our negotiators to these discussions to my mind was the right one.  We had to see in some way in the course of the discussions that we could have access to new means and to new resources that would enable us to develop our infrastructure, to develop our economy and solve our problems whether they were exchange rate problems or otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I was most impressed by what the Minister had to say. However, I must point out as someone who has listened to the speeches today that it is at variance with what some of his colleagues said.</P>
      <P>I believe that infrastructure is important. Even if we do not enter the EMS it is an area that will have to be tackled with grant aid from the EEC.  As a member of a country council, as I see it, we have massive infrastructural problems with regard to the development of Cork harbour.  The whole burden of that is now falling on the shoulders of a few people, mainly farmers and business people.  If there were never any EMS, we need this infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hoped that more reference would be made in this debate to the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy.  It should have been spelt out by the Taoiseach as being very much an integral part of our entry.  We all know that in the case of agricultural and related industries as Dr. Sheehy recently said so far as the subdivision of CAP is concerned about 70 per cent of the whole CAP reimbursement went into the pockets other than the pockets of the farming community, into marketing, transport and so on and that only 30 per cent of it actually found its way into the farmers' pocket.  CAP is very important for us since most of our industries are based on agriculture.  CAP has certainly <Col N="1514" /> proved its worth.  I strenuously disagree with the Tánaiste who made the point that we in Fine Gael had slavishly tied ourselves to Britain over the last few years.  The man sitting in the Chair at the moment could contradict that better than anybody else because he succeeded in obtaining, despite British opposition and defiance, a good deal for the farming community.  We had a succession of green £s which brought the farming community up to its present level and has brought agriculture related industries to the level where they are competing successfully with their European counterparts.  Even the German Government with only 4 per cent of its population in agriculture are strong supporters of CAP because they see in it the constancy of supply of good food at realistic prices.  When CAP did not operate, when sugar got scarce it went out of bounds.  That is one of the good sides of CAP.  Over the last 12 months Britain has been doing a lot of spouting about CAP.  From my small experience in the Council of Europe I am satisfied that Britain have alienated their Euro colleagues by this sort of maverick approach to the CAP and to the development of Europe.  They do not seem to be interested in the proper successful integration of the Community.</P>
    <P>With regard to our entry into the EMS we are glibly assuming that the Irish £ will appreciate against sterling on our entry.  On reading a paper this morning I noticed that the opposite is true.  In the first market opened by Barclays the Irish £ depreciated.  That may be an indication of what the previous speaker was talking about.  I am certain that admission to the EMS will cause some hardships, especially in the total absence of proper aid for our weaker industries. we had a good speech on infrastructure. which is important but it is not the be all. One highly successful industry is the sugar company, which is probably more dependent on roadways than most other industries.  That illustrates that while infrastructure is important it is not everything.  We must dig a little deeper when we are talking about aid to industries.</P>
    <P>The previous speakers endeavoured to figure out why we cannot compete with <Col N="1515" /> German and with more successful European nations.  There are a number of reasons.  Some of our more important industries were only started within the last few years and we had the whole problem of technology, training and so on.  We will always have the major problem of the size of industries here.  We could compare, for instance, our own little steel mill with the massive steel projects in Germany and we will always have comparatively small enterprises.  Sometimes that can prove to be advantageous. We are basically a developing nation.  It is true that even with grant aid some of our industries will be under severe pressure in an EMS situation, especially in the intervening period while Britain remains out, which will probably be the most difficult period for us, when Britain could possibly start moving stuff in here at lower rates.</P>
    <P>I agree with some of the previous speakers.  We cannot wait until Britain has concluded her deal, because if we do we will be left with very little negotiating muscle.  Obviously, if Britain had her elections over in the morning it could well be that by the following morning they would be in the EMS having duly sacrificed CAP in the process.  I would hate to think that we would, at that stage, have to go along and try to salvage the Common Agricultural Policy and indeed a good deal for ourselves.  We must admit that even in our present situation the fact that we have a fluctuating currency is affecting trade.  In the purchase of equipment whether industrial or agricultural, from the mainland of Europe it has been almost impossible to buy forward at the moment.  For instance if one were to request a tractor of a specific make and agree on a price, if there was a delivery problem of maybe a couple of months, it is quite possible that the whole deal would have to be re-negotiated, so that as we are now we have very real problems.  Indeed the business sector in the present situation find it most difficult to evaluate their purchases on a commitment basis.  Fortunes have been won and lost in the sort of fluctuation that goes on at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1516" /> The Sugar Company have to order large amounts of fertiliser in advance and they always find that the agreed price has been adjusted.  Such a situation makes it impossible for our industries to keep to their budgets.  To be successful an industrialist must ensure that his contracts are not subject to unforeseen crises. What may seem to be a good deal on face value may lead to bankruptcy when tied to floating currencies.</P>
    <P>The EMS is a serious issue.  I was surprised at the different attitudes adopted by Government speakers.  We were told that the sums had been done.  The figure of £650 million was mentioned and I accepted it as being sufficiently realistic to help our industries.  Now we are talking about entry at an insignificant figure.  If we need £650 million to participate then £650 million it has to be.  I am sure that the experts did not exaggerate.  They looked for something which they felt was necessary and I believe that we should have stayed with this figure.  It is in our interests and in the interests of other European nations that we should become an effective member of the Community.  In the past they have helped some of our deprived areas.  Was sufficient emphasis put on the importance of grant aid?  In view of the generous responses from the Community I am sure they would have accepted the figure of £650 million.  As the previous speaker said, if you teach someone to fish, assuming there are fish one can make a living.  No matter how wealthy the other European nations are, they cannot continue to give us grant aid.</P>
    <P>We were told that there was a great deal of secrecy about this matter, but I believe that the Leaders of the Opposition parties and our social partners should have been advised of the negotiations. What consultations have taken place with the trade union movement and with the workers in our industries? What did the Government say to workers in companies like Youghal Carpets, Blackwater Cottons, Midleton Worsted and so on?  As their livelihoods are involved, we cannot tell them in 12 months' time that they are victims of the EMS.  If the Government had discussed the matter with the leaders of our industry <Col N="1517" /> they would have received more support.  If the Government had done that people would not now be asking what it is all about.  People are concerned with our weaker industries and are wondering if they are going to be closed.  When people discuss the matter with me I always try to reassure them, but I know they would prefer an assurance from the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The leader of the farmers admitted on television that the Government's approach to the EMS was amateur.  What was more serious was his admission that he had not been consulted.  The green £ may be phased out and our substantial meat exports to Britain may be in danger until the British decide to join the system.</P>
    <P>There is still time to rectify many of the initial negotiating mistakes.  We need not be running back and forth to the Germans and the French.  It would be more convincing if the Taoiseach could tell them that our social partners are satisfied.  It is in the interests of all concerned that we should have a closer knit Community.  That is the goal that we should all move towards together, a stronger Europe.  I could see the benefits as being substantial in the matter of new industries coming here.  Firms such as Dupont and Fords would be very interested, I imagine, if we made a successful deal as regards entry to the EMS.  We must look outwards.  We must meet the people and discuss it with them.  In a modern democracy looking into your soul is no solution to a problem like this. In my estimation this deal is just as important as our initial entry: it is certainly the next greatest step.  It cannot be used as a way out of any Government financial difficulties or budgetary problems. We cannot accept another loan which would totally disregard long-term consequences merely to get out of short-term difficulties.  We cannot allow Ireland, heart and soul as it were, to be sold in the interests of any political party regardless of the good of the Irish people. Borrowing is certainly not the answer.  To my mind, we are already borrowing dangerously.  Every loan must be repaid; the bank manager must be met eventually.  Even a moratorium only puts off the evil day.  It might have some <Col N="1518" /> short-term advantage but in the final analysis these massive loans would have to be repaid.</P>
    <P>I do not accept what the previous speaker said about infrastructures solving our problem.  The real answer to our young and struggling industries&mdash;that is what many of them are&mdash;is proper grant aid so that within the factories necessary development work can be undertaken to make them more efficient, so that more money could be spent in training young people to participate in industry, again leading to more efficiency.  We are already receiving grants and I cannot see why there is so much objection to giving us grants in this instance.  I think it is chiefly because it was not spelled out properly.  If the problems of our industries were properly explained, the problems of growth and development, and that people who initiated these industries put themselves into a heavy borrowing position to get the industries started, it would make the position clearer.  In order to give a man a good start you do not give him loans which could very often put a halter around his neck.</P>
    <P>I should like to see our negotiatiors going back and demanding that grants be given to ensure that we would take our place among the other nations.  I have no doubt about our ability to do so. We have had some of the greatest industrial successes in the world.  The inhibiting factor seems to be the fact that we are a poor nation, very often dependent on the whims of multinationals. That has caused some major industrial problems in the past.  I am convinced that we could have a first-class future if we could negotiate proper terms which, in my book, would be by way of massive grant aid for this country.</P>
    <P>The whole atmosphere of uncertainty is doing a certain amount of damage. Our present approach can be compared to that of a man building a house without foundations.  Time may not be on our side&mdash;I fully appreciate that&mdash; but I believe there is still time to have discussions with our social partners and have it spelled out for them in layman's language what is involved.  There was sufficient confusion here today in highly technical language but there must be a <Col N="1519" /> simple way of explaining what is involved for our people.  Having done that, we could go back to the EEC saying: &ldquo;We will participate.  We will do our job if you give us the initial, once-off grant necessary to do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate so far has not added a great deal to the knowledge we have been seeking since EMS was first mooted.  It was of little account today whether the Opposition could score off the Government, whether the Taoiseach was confused as between his outlook as expressed on the night when things blew up and the opinions expressed by his Ministers for Finance and for Economic Planning and Development. What is perhaps important is whether we have yet been given sufficient indication of what is involved if for no other reason, whether we are going in or staying out, than that the people we represent here and who are all-important in these decisions should know what we are about in their name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Member of the House trying to decide what is at issue I must admit that I am still not very clear about it.  One thing that does emerge and which has some attraction but which in itself would not make a great difference between whether we should go or stay is that the concept would seem to envisage creating a situation in which stability between currencies within the Nine would be secured to a greater degree than heretofore and that therefore we would have fewer fluctuations and less chance of the wild inflation movements which we have experienced to our cost in recent years.  Outside of that I have not yet heard spelled out the exact material advantages for us&mdash;leaving out altogether whether we get loans or grants or nothing&mdash;of going in.  I am still puzzled about that while at the same time not ignoring the voices in the wind that clearly indicate to me that if I were to have a bet tonight, the bet would be that we are going in.  When I say that I am still asking myself why are we going in, I wonder whether the Government and members of the party who ultimately will make this decision know clearly and concisely <Col N="1520" /> and without doubt why we should go in &mdash;if we are going in as I believe.</P>
    <P>It was only five or six months ago that there was any real publicity about this which brought it to the notice of the ordinary people. We heard of it and it was publicised that we here were all for it.  It seemed from there that it was only a matter of moving along and informing the public and this House and the other agencies of the State as to what it was about, having had the indication from the spokesmen for the Government that this was a good thing but without the qualifications, without the detail and without the knowledge that we are still without to a large degree.  As the months moved on and we got nearer to the time of decision the only thing we really began to get then was that there were conditions that were insisting upon being fulfilled by the other members of the EEC if we were to go in.</P>
    <P>As it drew near to the weeks of final decision it emerged that the figure put on our requirements was £650 million and it was put around that this was to be by way of grants.  Then as it came to a final climax last week we were rather sure that we were going to get what we were seeking because of the very good publicity that seemed to follow the Taoiseach's rounds of the heads of government of the three major powers, Britain, France and Germany.  It only added to the confusion and the disillusion and disappointment when last week we found we were not doing at all as well as the Taoiseach was obviously led to believe by the heads of these three Governments.  So what ignorance existed before then was compounded by the confusion created after the event.  One national newspaper of last week printed big headlines one day in the middle of the week that we were in and on the following day the headlines in the same newspaper were that we had been conned.</P>
    <P>I am still speaking for the ordinary members of the public who are more confused today than they were a week ago or a month ago.  While the concept of overall stability and the cessation of the violent ups and downs and swings between currencies and their relationship <Col N="1521" /> to each other is a grand concept it is not the full answer obviously.  That alone would not be a reason why we would decide at this stage to go in.  It just would not be enough, being offered much less than we regard as necessary to make it attractive to us or indeed worthwhile for us to go in.</P>
    <P>When all that is said and done it does not matter at this stage whether we were conned; it does not matter whether we were confused or misinformed or misled or anything else.  The decision is still being taken.  In this regard this idea has now come through that instead of grants the only thing that is available to us is loans or a transfer of resources.  I would like to ask a question on that aspect. How, by way of repayable loans or money can one truly transfer resources from the lender to the borrower?  If money is borrowed and must be paid back, no matter how small the interest, by the time the total transaction is completed a transfer of resources has taken place but in the reverse direction; the borrower will have transferred his resources to the lender rather than as is being put across at the moment the lender in some way transferring resources to us.  If the money is repayable and there is any interest on it then the balance is in the reverse direction and the transfer of resources instead of coming to us will, to the degree of the interest be a transfer of resources to Europe, to Germany, to the stronger powers within the EMS and within the EEC.</P>
    <P>If I am wrong I would like to hear it explained because that is the way I see it. If the way I see it is right how then do we tally this with the needs that the Government and all their advisers have calculated as being an exact figure of £650 million?  The Government have calculated this figure as being the sum required to be transferred by way of true transfer of resources from within the EEC to this country in order to enable it to participate in full and be a worthy member of the whole EMS set-up.  How do we now contemplate the substitution of loans for grants of £650 million, whether initially in one lump or spread over five years or whatever the case might be?  How can we now reconcile <Col N="1522" /> that calculation of a need for that net amount by way of grant to us with what is now more likely to happen, a transfer, but not really a transfer to us but the provision and the making available of loans to this country?  They just cannot tally; there is no way in which they can be reconciled and in fact the transfer of resources will be in the reverse direction given whatever the period may be that the loan is spread over.</P>
    <P>These loans or this money or transfer is obviously not going to be granted to the degree that we have regarded as essential. Are we going to use it for this infrastructure that we have heard talk about?  Have we given any consideration&mdash;and I hope the Government have and are giving consideration&mdash;to the situation which will arise for certain of our weaker industries who immediately can see that if, on our joining the EMS, the Irish currency moves above the sterling of Great Britain, they will then be in a non-competitive position resulting in loss of business to them or perhaps even in their going out of business and that would be a calamity for them and for the workers, with more people unemployed.  Whether or not we get any part of any of the resources, whether borrowed or by way of grant, are the Government doing something positive about helping to cushion those immediately endangered industries for some period to help to improve their productivity and render them more competitive against the new breezes that will be blowing?  Have they taken and are they satisfied that they are taking steps to ensure that these industries are not wiped out merely because the Government did not do something about them in time?</P>
    <P>Has the Government also considered just what the immediate situation is going to be as between Britain and ourselves?  The breaking of the link is a grand concept and one which immediately raises traditional emotion in the hearts of many of our people here, but looking at it from the point of view of both Britain and Ireland it is not one-way traffic by any means.  We are no longer dependent on Britain to anything like the degree that we were over the centuries but nevertheless we still do 48 <Col N="1523" /> per cent of our export trade with Great Britain and let us not forget that a very substantial part of her custom lies here in this island as well.  So it is a two-way movement and one which will affect both of us, if in fact the parity that has existed and does exist at this very moment disappears.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that it can disappear whether both countries join or not. There are people who believe that if only Britain were in things would be just the same as they were before and that there would be parity.  This is not true at all.  If we both go in we both go our separate ways.  Our currency and its value within the EMS will have its own separate values.  If these happen to be, by accident, by coincidence exactly similar to Britain's then we would have parity but by accident, not by design, not by anything we can do unless we have, behind the scenes and with the agreement of the EEC and the whole EMS set-up, a bilateral agreement with Britain whether in the interim she remains out &mdash;which will be undoubtedly until the election is over because Mr. Callaghan is too long around to turn away the support of the pro-EMS people in saying he will not go in or the anti-EMS people by saying that he will go in&mdash;or after she joins the EMS.  He will postpone a decision until after the election and perhaps at that stage it might not be he and his Government who will have to make the decision.</P>
    <P>Surely, between now and the election in Britain, if we are to join the EMS and because of the magnitude of the inter-trading between the two countries, there is necessity for us to have some sort of acceptable bilateral understanding that would retain, while we are in the EMS and they are outside, some sort of parity that would bring us along to the point where Britain would make her decision. There will be changes whether she goes in or stays out, if either one of us goes in and the other stays out or if both of us go in.  There will not be parity unless both of us stay out.</P>
    <P>I am asking those questions in the likelihood that either one of us or both of us will go in and there will no longer be parity.  What are we doing in the weeks <Col N="1524" /> and months ahead in regard to trading between ourselves and Britain?  What are we doing particularly about cross-Border trading, which is one of the things very much in my mind and naturally in the minds of the people I represent?  Those living on the Border or near the Border are very interested in the answers to those questions.  What are we doing with regard to the weak industries about providing for them so that they will not go to the wall immediately with the initial draught they will take?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Social Welfare said that the Mark is the strongest currency in the world because it represents the strongest economy in the world.  This is only because their productivity is second to none in the world.  All the loans and all the grants that we may get, wherever we may get them, will not alter our position so far as our currency of the future is concerned whether we are inside or outside the EMS unless we can do something about raising our productivity.  This means taking off the unemployed register as many people as we can and putting them to work.  If we cannot do this we will be dragging along with the beggar's bowl five years from now, more even than we are today, whether we go in or stay out. It is better to employ more people doing essential jobs.  At the moment we are giving money to people for doing nothing.  If we improve our productivity it means that we go into the EMS without a beggar's bowl or we can stay out without it.  It is important to get people back in employment in greater numbers than ever before, building up the assets and wealth of the country, providing that which we want today but which we will be paying more for 20 years from now.  We have the tools to do this, we have the men to do it and we can get the money to do it.</P>
    <P>We have not to be dependent in a beggarly way on Germany, France or anybody else if we are prepared to buckle down, put our own resources to work, create the capital, put the people off the dole on to the productive work of providing the necessities we need here of infrastructure and others, and all those other things will follow.  We need not have any fear about the EMS, what effect <Col N="1525" /> it will have or will not have, whether we are in or whether we are out, as it rests with us.  We need productivity. Employment is necessary if that productivity is to go up.  We have it all at our hands, and instead of doing the job in that way we are arguing about how we go in and how much we get for going in.</P>

      <P>The subject matter of today's debate and the one we had some time ago has very serious consequences for the country.  The debate we had previously and the one we are having today suffer the limitation that a great deal of the arguments and counter-arguments heard from these benches relate to the policy of the Government as defined by us.  The difference between our debate today and on the last occasion is that the Taoiseach explained to the House then that negotiations had scarcely commenced and that in fact it was not open to the Government to expose much of their negotiating hand. The position today is that we understand there is still the semblance of a negotiating position.  There has been a result, there has been confusion about it and there is now apparently the possibility, according to Government speakers, of a decision in the wake of those confusing results.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, whatever misinterpretations he may claim his statements have been subjected to, appears to have been disappointed with the results of the recent European Council meeting. He has made it clear, whatever may be the charges and counter charges on the merit of the accuracy of his grasp of the figures that were offered, that he could not recommend the figures he understood were offered him at the Council meeting.  That limitation is hanging over all our discussions here today.  I do not know the result of the decision of the Italian Parliament, which obviously has a heavy bearing on the course of this debate and presumably has some connection with whatever eventual Government decision may be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a distinction between the proceedings in the Italian Parliament and here.  The Parliament there is at least in possession of their Cabinet's recommendation. That is not the position in <Col N="1526" /> relation to this Parliament as we are not, as of now, in possession of the entire Cabinet's recommendation in respect of the present negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste likes to deal in primary colours.  There is either rejection or acceptance, for or against, one is Irish or not Irish, there is the national interest and there are those who are against it. The Tánaiste, following that line of thought, this morning challenged the Labour Party to state where they stood in regard to this matter, whether they were for or against it, as if the matter was one of simple black and white alternatives, a decision one way or the other.  The Labour Party have made it clear from the very start that our primary concern was the protection of employment.  That remains our primary concern.  That was why we put forward the idea of a resource transfer.  We thought that necessary to defend existing employment here.  We did not believe that the loan option, however generous, would be in the same class of superiority as that of the resource transfer.  Our attention, therefore, has been focused on the terms of entry.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste asked for our view on the whole question and asked whether as a party we have any commitment to the question of the monetary system itself. Without the grant arrangement it is our belief that the terms would not be such as to command the support of this party. From common observation we realise that there are certain industries, such as the shoe and leather and the textile industries, that are very vulnerable and which would be in need of strong action in the kind of situation envisaged in the EMS.  There have been representations from both management and union side in those industries in which concern was expressed regarding a possible worsening of their position, both in terms of employment and in the overall situation.</P>
    <P>The availability of cheap credit facilities as distinct from a resources transfer mechanism would not be as satisfactory as low-interest facilities would fall to be repaid, as an outright grant would not be.  We consider the important consideration to be the obtaining of a clear undertaking that adequate resource transfers would be made <Col N="1527" /> available to counterbalance the serious consequences that would befall employment. Presumably that was why the Taoiseach decided that the terms were unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>So far as the Tánaiste's challenge to us is concerned, we are as aware as is anybody else here of the advantage that would accrue to the national economy in the event of our not being tied to the interest rates that have prevailed in Britain in recent years.  We are aware, too, of the advantage of having more control of our economic destiny, but we must stress that the terms of any movement away from the link with sterling, in the context of the protection of employment must be a right move, and that is why we have been critical and questioning but have not been reassured by the kind of bargain that has emanated so far from the recent talks.  Indeed, in regard to the challenge thrown out by the Tánaiste as to who was on the side of greater economic independence in relation to EMS, as to who was on the side of breaking the link with Britain, the point could be made that since our independence there has been an inverse ratio between the rhetoric of independence and its practical implementation in economic matters.  In the period since independence the party opposite have held sway much of the time. However strident has been our commitment to sovereignty and to the formulae of sovereignty, we have shown scant interest in seeking to break the currency link which tied us in every major economic decision to the dreadnought UK.</P>
    <P>The terms must be right if we are to seek the opportunity of breaking the link with currency.  As we have said from the start, our entry to the EMS must not be at the expense of employment.  We have been very strong on that point. Regardless of what terms are negotiated the vulnerable industries and, consequently, the employees, must not be asked to pay the price, especially since those employees and workers generally have been asked previously by this Government to pay the price.  We are more determined than ever in seeking <Col N="1528" /> guarantees for the protection of employment when we consider the chicanery and the shameful juggling being engaged in by the Government in defending their programme on employment.  The unemployment register becomes like that oath familiar to those who have knowledge of the early history of the party opposite, that was, an empty formula. The unemployment register has become almost as shadowy and as phantom-like as that earlier oath when one considers the arguments of somebody such as the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, because when we talk about a reduction of unemployment we are no longer talking of a reduction in the number of those on the live register.  We say that the unemployment register exists but the people opposite said that this year they would reduce by a specific number the number on the live register.  That undertaking has not been honoured.</P>

      <P>At this time we are asked to drop our opposition to the terms as known to us now, and this request is coming from a Government who to date have shamefully broken their pledge on unemployment.  We are asked to support the Government while the Tánaiste, the Deputy Prime Minister, has the gall to come here and ask us where we stand in relation to the terms as we know them.  We stand four-square for the protection of employment.  We are aware of the advantage in a break from sterling, in a break from the interest rates that do not comply with our pattern of economic development, but we stress that the terms must be right at all times.  As we have said consistently, the terms have not been right as expressed here by the Taoiseach and by some Ministers in relation to the question of the defence of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year there has been an increase in the number of people at work.  We will not deny that.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development has been at pains at various meetings, regardless of whether reporters were present, <Col N="1529" /> to point out that achievement, but he must know that the increase in employment this year is based on once-off measures which cannot be repeated indefinitely, that it is based on a very high proportion of new jobs in the public service.  Those policies cannot be repeated if the borrowing figures for future years are to be adhered to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>To the Government who chastise us because we are not in the same national interest mould as they, we would say that they have broken their promises on employment so far and that the terms they have pronounced are not good enough to command the support of working people, because we have not been convinced that employment can be protected in the difficult period ahead should we decide eventually to join.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, we are right in seeking terms that are consistent with the protection of employment, because jobs lost in the adjustment period ahead will not be recreated by a Government who have broken solemn promises on the jobs front.  I trust that I have replied adequately to the Tánaiste's challenge, a challenge in which he endeavours to isolate the Labour Party from what he conceived as the national interest.  The national interest dictates clearly that we should seize any opportunity available to us to get more control over our own economic development to ensure that our interest rates are not dictated by the city of London.  But in seizing the correct opportunity for breaking that link that opportunity must be wedded to terms that protect employment in the context of the grave unemployment situation which exists here, especially when taken in the context that the new jobs created this year are based on policies which obviously cannot be pursued indefinitely.  When we remember that the new jobs created this year were not brought into being by private industry, are not based on manufacturers and do not have a sustainable basis for the future, our fears are all the more increased as we look at the protestations <Col N="1530" /> of this Government on the issue of employment.  An adequate transfer of resources and a specific plan to protect vulnerable employment over the adjustment period are needed.</P>
    <P>If it comes to pass that this Government enter the EMS, none of us in this House knows the full implications for the length of adjustment.  No one can foretell that.  We do not know how long the difficulties may last, but we are clear about one part of the scenario because of the close link that has existed and still exists between ourselves and the British economy.  A great proportion of our exports still goes to Britain and unfortunately a great amount of their imports in recent months has been coming into our home market, with a great number of Irish export jobs depending on that British export market.  It is clear, whatever other complications may exist in relation to this question as to Government intentions or to the future relations with the EMS, that there is a great danger in the context of Irish employment that our goods on that British market will be more costly if we move into the EMS with Britain not doing so for a period, the possibility being that markets will be lost to us in Britain. Therefore the consequence for home employment is jobs lost.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, clear that the Labour Party would not be doing their job in this House or in the country if they were not very concerned to ensure that the terms, especially as they impinge on employment, were right.  That does not take away the fact that we are conscious of the advantages that would accrue to the economy, in the event of the terms being right, by adhering, in a basket of currencies, to other currency systems speaking away from the sterling link. The connection with sterling has meant that there has not been any real control in the home economy by Irish Governments. It has meant that, willy-nilly, our interest rates have had to climb up.  It has meant all the other constraints and difficulties that have hampered our efforts to bring into being a pattern of economic development here.  The two countries are dissimilar, their needs are different and it has never suited Irish national economic aspirations that we <Col N="1531" /> were tied hand and foot to the British economy.  But the terms must be right.</P>
    <P>A lot of this debate has been concerned with the excellence or otherwise of the negotiators.  The Tánaiste this morning threw down the challenge that the last Government had not exactly excelled when it came to negotiations on the Regional Fund, although anyone conversant with EEC affairs would know that it is not a very fair comparison to cite excellence of negotiating capacity one way or the other.  The Members opposite know that several major members of the Community have had very strong views from the beginning on the size of the regional fund itself.  The Tánaiste went further.  He challenged the Labour Party.  He went further still in comparing the performance of the present Government with that of the Coalition.  I do not know what led the Tánaiste today to believe that it was important from the Government's point of view that he should put the record right on the excellence of their negotiating tactics, but apparently he felt it necessary.  Probably the recent confusion on figures, on what has been achieved or otherwise, led to this necessity that the Tánaiste perceived in making the claim to be better negotiators than the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Further, he detected a new stature which had been won by the present Government in the EEC.  He does not say who won this coveted European stature award or which member of the Government is responsible for bringing home this trophy.  We do not know whether it was the Minister for Foreign Affairs who won this European Oscar or whether it was the Minister for Agriculture.  Perhaps in his modest way the Tánaiste was putting himself forward as the candidate who had brought home this prize as one of the Government's negotiators.  Of course the Tánaiste has never been a man to hide his light under a bushel.  It is probably not advisable in politics to have that trait of modesty. The Tánaiste was scarcely a term in this House before he aspired to be Taoiseach.  Some of us are long enough in this House to remember that aspiration of his, and there is a lot of evidence <Col N="1532" /> to suggest that he still has it.  The Tánaiste said this morning that when they came into office they were not long in Europe before the members of this administration discovered that we were regarded as an appendage of Britain. That was discovered by these newly minted Republicans back in office.  I quote him: &ldquo;It took some time for the penny to drop amongst our other Community partners.&rdquo;  A new force had arrived in Europe with the election of this Government.  The expression &ldquo;the penny to drop&rdquo; is an unfortunate one and the Tánaiste would be well advised, when he is making the claim to a new stature, to get a more imaginative scriptwriter, because at the very heart of this debate on the EMS we are talking about pennies, even if they are of the Deutsch denomination.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste talked about inheriting the situation of an appendage of Britain. We may rest assured that in future attention will be paid to the Irish views on matters of finance and economics. Presumably the Tánaiste is in fact shyly putting himself forward as the person who has won the coveted award in Europe this year as star negotiator.</P>

      <P>It must have been. We will leave aside the question of whether they got the figures right because that has been debated exhaustively enough.  At the end, whatever the Government may decide, we will judge the excellence of their negotiations by the results.  I do not wish to delay the House tonight in raking over the figures that have been misunderstood or otherwise.  If this Government have something up their sleeves presumably we will at some stage hear about it and we will be able to do the sums.  We will say loud and clear what we think of the results of the negotiations of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hearing the Tánaiste today, one wonders about this new stature which has been won in Europe by this Government in matters of finance and economics.  One wonders if this is the <Col N="1533" /> Government who sent the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Wyse, to Finance Ministry meetings, as they did.  Of course Deputy Wyse is a decent man but I would have thought that it was subjecting him to some strain to send him to Finance Ministers' meetings prior to the Bremen meeting.  It would be interesting to know how many Finance Ministers' meetings were attended by the Tánaiste prior to the shattering events of Bremen.  I do not have the impression that the Bremen decision took him unaware, though I suppose there is no obligation on Deputy Wyse to tell his boss, the Minister for Finance, what has been happening out there.  He is a busy man, with Wood Quay and so forth on his mind.  Certainly I would not have thought it was the correct preparation for a Government who claimed, in the words of the Tánaiste, to have won a new stature in negotiation tactics.</P>
    <P>We will judge the excellence or otherwise of the negotiations by the final result.  It is unclear whether we have had a final result.  One understands that there have been further meetings at official level.  I suppose to some extent the Government are in possession of whatever extra facts have arisen as a result of these meetings.  We are not in possession of those facts.  Presumably the Government, if they intend to take action on the matter of entry, will be declaring what are those facts and we will be judging them.</P>
    <P>We have been talking about the negotiations, the reasons that led the Labour Party to their view on entry to the EMS, foremost being our concern to see that employment is adequately protected.  Not as much attention has been focussed on the kind of disciplines that would face us in the event of our membership of the EMS, the kind of fiscal discipline that may well be necessary. The debates we have had to date have concentrated in the main on meetings that have taken place and assume support for our position.  However excellent are these negotiators in the present Government one cannot repress the feeling that there has been an immense gap between their published expectations, a certain confidence expressed at <Col N="1534" /> an earlier period of the negotiations, and the end result.</P>
    <P>However one may dress it up the fact is that we are faced here with a series of loans.  There is no doubt that there is a very big gap between the kind of grant element in the loans and the kind of grant element looked for by the Government initially.  The debate we have been having has concentrated, from the Government side, on the contacts they have made, the kinds of expressions of support that were forthcoming.  There has been little heard, except cursory references, of the kind of discipline that might be necessary were we, in the EMS, to try to bring our inflation rate down to that of the German rate.  Perhaps it is for a very good reason there has been this coyness on the part of the Government to discuss this aspect of their negotiations at very great length.  The reason may have something to do with the fact that we are still discussing the possibility of entry to the EMS at a time when all arrangements for decisions on the incomes question next year have been abandoned.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I asked the Taoiseach whether there were any plans by the Government to encourage the emergence of orderly wage negotiations next year.  The Taoiseach said that the present national agreement had something like four months to run&mdash;not to worry.  That is a strange view from the head of a Government involved in attempting to get into the EMS, an integral part of which&mdash;no secret has been made of this by, among others, the German Chancellor or the French President&mdash;will be very tight surveillance of incomes.  There are no arrangements here at this point in time for the encouragement of any method of dealing with this matter next year.  Legitimate speculation may be entertained on whether a Government&mdash;or certain members of it&mdash;which appear to be devoid of any plans for the serious matter of the arrangement of negotiations on incomes next year, are not pinning their hopes for control of incomes next year on our membership of the EMS.  It has been suggested in certain sections of the press that the prospect of an easy budget <Col N="1535" /> is brought nearer by the possibility of soft loans in the EMS.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Economic Planning and Development has of late&mdash;and I stress of late; he was rather silent on the issue earlier in the year&mdash;been sounding a note of alarm on the incomes front as we know it at present.  What can be said is that certain members of the Cabinet have been referring to the trade unions as culprits, stating that wage claims have gone beyond the figure set by them and that that was another reason employment targets were not being reached this year.  Of course they are a Government fertile in excuses.  They are a Government who, despite their large majority, are never responsible for bad news.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply giving this as an illustration of the way this Government seek culprits everywhere except in their own ranks.  This was the Government responsible for the major economic miscalculations of the year in question, the budget.  That was and is the source of a great deal of the sense of grievance felt by many sections of the community over this year.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that a Government seriously contemplating the possibility of entry into the kind of stringent discipline that would be required of membership of the EMS have no plans at this time for the arrangements necessary this year for negotiation of wage questions.  I do not know how they answered this one at the recent series of meetings.  I do not know whether the reply given by the Taoiseach in the Dáil that it was four months away and that was time enough to look at it, was satisfactory when Helmut Schmidt asked that question, as undoubtedly he must, because it is an elementary one for any country seeking membership of the EMS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am making is that the Government have not been very forthcoming on this aspect of their negotiations on EMS membership.  I say this with good reason, because they have no ideas on how this matter is to be tackled.  At this point their solution is: get into the EMS to see if the foreigners, the other partners in the Community, will settle their domestic problems for them.  The question may well be asked: how many members of the present Cabinet see in the EMS a statutory wage <Col N="1537" /> policy under another name?  It is a valid question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there are several Walter Mitties in the present Cabinet.  With all humility, I think I am asking a very significant question.  I am asking to what extent members of this Government see in membership of the EMS next year the imposition of a statutory wages policy, since they have made no arrangements and have expressed no intention of attempting arrangements for the discussion of wage negotiations next year?  Whether the kind of industrial relations situation we have at the moment&mdash;I refer to the strikes and disruption taking place&mdash;is a good prelude, and I am here talking about the possibility of our entering the EMS; we do not know the terms or the kind of disciplines required and one of the important disciplines would be some kind of incomes policy&mdash;is a good prelude to entry I tend to doubt.  We have had industrial disputes.  We have faced a series of industrial disputes which threaten to widen the rift in a society which is ridden with conflict&mdash;strikes, go-slows, factory disputes, all indicating widespread employee disillusionment with current economic policies.  The public sector which employs one in four of the work force has been very seriously hit by strikes over the year&mdash;Aer Lingus, the ESB, CIE, the Post Office.  In fact the Post Office are threatened with yet another phone strike before Christmas.  The ESB have been plagued with industrial disputes in the major power generating stations. The members of the Post Office Workers Union are being pressured to strike.  We have the busmen threatening to strike in January.  Most of these disputes have at their heart an argument about incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is legitimate, I think, to consider whether in fact that kind of situation, chaos in industrial relations, is the best preparation for entry into the EMS.  One would expect that a Government which were serious about undertaking all the <Col N="1538" /> obligations of EMS membership would be at pains to spell out the implications of membership in these conditions.  It is difficult to see how the transition can be made from the kind of dispute ridden society we have to the kind of discipline required in the EMS situation.  One would expect that, if the Government were serious about all of the implications of the EMS, they would now be hard at work spelling out their ideas on how wage negotiations would proceed next year instead of the kind of nonchalant comment from the head of the Government that there are four months to run and things will presumably look after themselves.</P>
    <P>We believe that the Government have underestimated the possible deflationary effect of the EMS on employment.  We had from the Taoiseach this morning something which almost amounted to a denial that different sectors might be affected by membership.  There were, he said, too many variables and, since there were so many variables, he doubts now that any industry will be affected by EMS membership.  He is taking very lackadaisically, indeed, the inherent threat to Irish employment.  The Government seem to ignore their own responsibilities as the elected Government. They are never tired telling us they have a mandate to rule, and yet on the crucially important question of incomes there is no advice offered by the Government on how things are to be managed next year and how agreement is to be won between the social partners, the employers and the trade unionists.</P>
    <P>Now I have some experience of the difficulties inherent in this kind of exercise. Yet, within what may be days of EMS membership, there is no information from this Government on how they see things being managed on the incomes front next year.  Is it any wonder, then, that Opposition spokesmen have taken the Government to task on their negotiations to date?  Is it any wonder that we express our criticism of the kind of figures that have been produced here? Is it any wonder that we are still here at this late hour asking for guarantees that employment will be protected in any new arrangement?  Is it any wonder we ask how incomes are to be decided next year <Col N="1539" /> in the absence of any information from the Government?  The Government in their budget early this year signalled to all and sundry that the good times had come in permanent form.  Employment was to be improved.  Rates were abolished.  Nice things were being done and, following from them, a mood of moderation would sweep the country.  In this very House the Minister for Economic Planning and Development quipped that the previous national agreement had been overtight and their attitude towards incomes would be more generous.  We now find him at the end of the year pleading that they were, of course, too generous by far.  I believe it is a difficult thing in a democracy to explain the connection between moderation in incomes and the retention and expansion of employment, but it is a job that politicians elected to run the economy must do, whatever the unpopularity may be in doing it.  It is a job which, if you are to get the support of the trade unions in that task, you must also for your part listen carefully to their suggestions and, wherever possible, incorporate them when they are sensible. That is why this Government has been asked repeatedly to listen to and act on the suggestion of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that a national development corporation be established to help foster employment.  So far the Government have resolutely refused to act on that suggestion.  The Government in the budget evaded the main economic issues for a Government serious about expanding employment.  The signal is there from the NESC that borrowing will not be reduced next year, and that indicates that the kind of thinking which inspired the last budget, which I described as a major economic miscalculation, is still not absent from those benches opposite, and I am deeply mistrustful of the real reasons why this Government want to bring this country into the EMS on the terms known to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that coming up to Christmas a Government begins to feel the strain, even the best of Governments like the one I served in.  It has been a long session.  Individual Ministers are <Col N="1540" /> subject to severe demands on themselves, on their families, on their personal lives, and there is a kind of anxiety to look forward to the vacation, and a corresponding impatience with the exigencies of parliamentary life until the recess begins.</P>
      <P>However, taking all these factors into account&mdash;I am allowing that any Taoiseach must bear the main burden of the Government's work&mdash;I found it impossible to understand the extreme petulance, the extreme impatience and the pitiably weak style and tone of the Taoiseach's performance here this morning. I know he is tired.  I know he is trying as best he can to carry on his back a lot of passengers in his Government, unlike his predecessor; I know he has a lot of people with inflated titles which weigh heavily on them but do not seem to contribute much to the rest of the country; and I know he is the scapegoat and the target for criticism because the rest of his Government, perhaps wisely, keep a very low profile, a profile in the shape of a plate in many cases&mdash;you can scarcely see them above the horizon&mdash;but the performance of the Taoiseach here this morning was the weakest I have seen a Taoiseach in my nine years in one House or the other House.  It was petulant, it was impatient, it was bad tempered.  Within seconds of standing up he was shouting across the House because the front bench here and in the Labour Party had not been given copies of the speech, which members of the Press Gallery were reading through freely.  When I sat over there behind my Taoiseach and watched across the floor for four-and-a-half years, I can say without too much exaggeration that there was scarcely a day when business in the House could get off a start without some twopence-halfpenny little row being raised by Deputy Lynch because he had not got the report of the bagpipes commission, or something like that, with his morning coffee, because he had to read it in the newspaper first, or because somebody was late, or he had been treated in some discourteous way.  Day in, day out, we were hearing about the calculated discourtesies with which he was being treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1541" /> We have not gone in for that, but we have complained when something goes wrong, as for example two weeks ago, I had to complain that newspaper reporters and commentators had access to a report of an industrial inquiry that Members of the House did not have when the topic was being discussed.  This morning, when Deputy Collins complained because he did not have a copy of what the members of the Press Gallery had in their hands, the Taoiseach turned red in the face and rounded on him.</P>
    <P>I take that to be a sign of strain.  I do not blame any man for losing his temper, and I fly off the handle myself, but I take it as a symptom of the absolute disarray which this part of the Government apparatus is in when the Taoiseach delivers a speech, the first time I have seen it in nine-and-a-half years watching Taoiseachs delivering speeches, which departed so freely and so weakly from what had been written in front of him. My conclusion is that his script had been put together at the last minute, that he himself had not been shown it or that it had been shown to him at a time when he could not make substantial corrections, that he did not like it and that he was ashamed of it.  I have often had to find fault with the Taoiseach, if that is not a presumptuous thing to say, but I do not believe he has it in him, at a time like this of such a historic potential for the country, to deliver a speech almost all of which consisted of disparagement of the two Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach sank to the level of sneering across the floor of the House at the leader of my party that of course he would have to wait until he was elected to the Taoiseach's job before he would know what went on at European Councils. Deputy Cosgrave never sank to that depth of debate, and to do Deputy Lynch justice, I had never seen him sink to that depth before.  As I have said, I believe the speech had been put into his hand at the last minute, that he had not time to read it, that he did not agree with it or like it and that he certainly had not drafted that speech in the way in which it was drafted.  That might be a matter of no importance except that it is a symptom of the disarray in which the Government <Col N="1542" /> find themselves over this matter. The Taoiseach was impatient with interruptions. Speaking for myself, I think interruptions are the life and soul of debate.  I do not lose my temper when I am interrupted, and neither does Deputy Corish.</P>

      <P>As for the Minister for Economic Planning and Development over there, occasionally he gets a nasty look on his face when he is interrupted, but mostly he is able to stomach interruptions. There are few people in the House who cannot, and the Tánaiste is one of them: he gets a kind of a Brazil nut expression on his face when interrupted too freely, and then of course the debate deteriorates.  To my mind it is part of the life and soul of debate that there should be a certain amount of give and take.</P>
      <P>The performance here this morning was pitiable.  I was looking across at the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery this morning packed, figuratively speaking, with the gold braid of the Diplomatic Corps.  What can they have thought of the performance of the Taoiseach?  If they were able to follow the way the House works and if they related the performance to the terms of the motion before us and realised that what the Taoiseach was doing was asking us to take note of the White Paper, the European Monetary System, what can they have thought when the Taoiseach scarcely mentioned the White Paper from beginning to end?</P>
      <P>In omitting to mention the White Paper from beginning to end, the Taoiseach was doing what the rest of the country have been doing.  I combed the three Dublin newspapers this morning&mdash;<i>The Cork Examiner</i> had not arrived&mdash;and I could not find a single reference to the White Paper in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, though the document had appeared 24 hours previously.  It had disappeared as though it had never been. There was one reference to it in <i>The Irish Times</i> and one in <i>The Irish Press.</i> Had a White Paper ever sunk beneath the waves in such a short time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1543" /> When I look at the document I hope the Chair will not think that I am making a meal out of questions of typography or of bad typing or that obviously three or four typists had to work at the thing to get the pages together in time.  The EMS is not something which fell out of the sky yesterday morning. The EMS has been on the table since last July.  Other countries have been able to provide Government papers on it, and although I realise that the negotiations which leave us in the present situation are not much older than a week, it would have been possible to have provided the guts of a White Paper by now, to have put in print reasonable tables and details. I had nearly exhausted my stock of condemnations when the Green Paper came out, but the Green Paper was an <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> compared with this.  Apart from its pitiable external appearance, apart from the fact that one would be ashamed to let a foreigner get the impression that this is what we mean by a White Paper, I have to say that there is almost nothing in it which might not have been supplied from the debate here last October.</P>

      <P>Let me point out that I said in this House at the conclusion of the debate in October that if the other side insisted on a paper by a particular date they would get a paper but the content would depend on what could be produced at that time.  I had to hand out the prospect of postponing the date of the debate until we could have sufficient material and I was denounced from those benches.  The suggestion was immediately made that we were trying to go back on commitments, to which I promptly replied that if the Opposition wanted a debate on any particular day they could have it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I can remember the Minister saying something along the lines he has now outlined, but let us take what Deputy O'Leary and others have been saying about their worries on the EMS question, and that is the immediate impact that joining the EMS without Britain will have on certain vulnerable industrial sectors.  Either the Department of Economic Planning and Development, if they are worth their salt, have information and have made assessments in regard to these vulnerable sectors or they have not that information and have not made those assessments?  If they have not the information and have not made the assessments, then the Minister should resign and take his Department with him.  If they have the information and have made those assessments and have anything to say to industry or the unions, why can it not be said here in the White Paper?  Although this bundle of typescript weighs a couple of ounces, it consists mostly of photocopies of EEC documentation.  I have seen more trouble put into a script for the Minister for Health in opening a swimming pool or the Minister for the Environment in opening a car salesroom.  It is beyond belief, even with all the reservations made by the Minister opposite, that the Government could seriously produce this as a document on which this House might discuss this historic step.  It is a feeble effort.  The speech with which the Minister opened the debate this morning was also a feeble effort and he almost forgot to mention the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in doubt&mdash;and I am sure the Minister would admit the same&mdash;as to what I would do if there were a lever or switch in front of me, the operation of which would put us into the EMS.  I can see there are arguments in both directions and I recognise the force of them.  I agree with the Minister and I believe I would carry my party with me in saying we are in favour of the EMS if the conditions are right.  I understood that to be <Col N="1545" /> the position of the Labour Party also. The Minister said the same thing on 16 October.  He said we would go in if the conditions were right.  What does that tell us?  We would go to live in the Arctic circle if the conditions were right and we could make the place habitable.  The Minister has not told us what the conditions are.  He has not related the conditions on which he has been insisting abroad to deal with problems which will clearly arise here in the event of the entry of this country to the EMS while Britain remains outside.</P>
    <P>In October I tried to warn the Government against giving in to what I then described as a &ldquo;weak-witted Wolfe Toneism&rdquo; according to which there was some inherent benefit in breaking the link with this or throwing off the fetters of that when the possibility is, whatever the historical reasons which make us to some extent dependent on the market. next door, that by striking that kind of bold attitude thousands could be put out of work.  I completely reject that kind of emotion as being a worthy component in a debate of this kind.  I would not give a thraneen for the emotional difficulty talked about by some inside the House and commentators outside the House of finding ourselves isolated in a situation where we may be accused of trailing along on Britain's coat tails if the Italians join the system.  Of course I feel it in the sense that I have a lot of &ldquo;little boy&rdquo; feelings of one kind or another about railway trains or bright uniforms and brass bands, but it is not worth a thraneen to the people who will be thrown out of work if we make the wrong decision on the head of an emotional response of that kind.  The Minister knows that.  The trouble with the Minister is that through a concatenation of personal circumstances, perhaps even accidents which he may now regret, he has joined a party in which it is poison to speak the truth about matters like that or to qualify the Green Flag in the slightest particular at any time or for any reason.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the EMS if it will reduce the fluctuation of exchange rates and bring our inflation down to the level of the strongest economies in Europe. <Col N="1546" /> Nobody on these benches has said a word against that.  Of course we are in favour of it.  I looked at the situation as presented by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister opposite in October last and I asked what the major snag would be if we were to enter the system while the British remained outside.  I want to emphasise once again that I do not give a thraneen about the British one way or the other.  Let them paddle their own canoe.  I feel no sense of responsibility, allegiance or alliance with them, though no doubt it will suit the lower echelons of the Minister's party to allege otherwise. They can paddle their own canoe; they have their own resources and their own advice and apart from the general solidarity which one is expected to show to another member state of the EEC I have absolutely no further feeling about them whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that we import relatively far more from Britain than from any other trading partner.  The most recent figures I could find show that in the months January to August of this year the proportion of goods imported from Britain has actually risen compared with last year.  The figure is about 49 per cent in the first eight months of this year as against 47 per cent in the same period last year.  I agree that the difference is marginal but the point remains valid.  We import a very heavy percentage of goods from Britain and those goods are in competition on the home market with Irish goods, while our exports are in competition with the same goods on the British market.  Any Government who do not spell out these things in terms which a simple soul can understand are not doing their job properly.</P>
    <P>My party have not infiltrated the Confederation of Irish Industry.  I have no idea of the politics of most of their members, though some of them make no secret of their politics.  I have no inside information about the allegiance of the confederation.  They are all businessmen and I do not believe one of them would support a political party which he regarded as hostile to his own business interests.  Early this year the CII computed that the existence of the British <Col N="1547" /> temporary employment subsidy had cost in the textile and footwear industries alone about 3,500 jobs.  I did not put those words into their mouths.  They calculated that because the British competitive position had been permitted to be distorted by the provision of a temporary employment subsidy, 3,500 Irish men and women were out of jobs which they otherwise would have held.  That subsidy was a serious matter and I pursued it on many occasions in the House. On one such occasion I managed to discover that the first time an official protest was made to Brussels about that subsidy was, by a funny coincidence, the day I put down a question in the House asking the Minister when such a protest had first been made.  That was I February.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of where blame lies for the neglect of the Government in regard to the British temporary employment subsidy, I should like to know why the White Paper does not set out some kind of assessment of a difference in value of 1 per cent, 2 per cent, 5 per cent or even up to the supposed limit of 6 per cent between our currency and the currency next door if, because of being shackled to continental currencies, our currency drifts or is pulled upwards <i>vis-à-vis</i> the British currency.  I realise that not many Deputies have mentioned the White Paper for reasons I have tried to explain.  Has the Minister made any calculation as to the effects of a difference of that order in the prices of Irish goods in ranges in which Irish goods compete with British goods?</P>
    <P>I want to mention a matter which I hope will not be thought contemptible because a lot of time is devoted to it in other contexts.  Has the Minister computed the effect on tourism if the Irish £ were to drift up substantially as against the British £?  That is not an argument against joining the EMS by ourselves but it is a consideration I would have expected to be spelled out by a Government who were doing their job and purporting to put out a White Paper instead of this schoolboy's blotter.  We depend on tourism to an enormous extent to close our trade gap as the Minister <Col N="1548" /> knows and if he does not know it he should not be in his job.  What effect will it have on hotel prices if the Irish £ is worth more than the English £ to the extent that Irish holidays will be that much less competitive?  Why has that not been mentioned?  Why have the tens of millions of pounds that we get out of tourism each year not been taken into this computation and if they have been taken into account why have we not been told about them?</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question about the progress of these negotiations and the kind of result obtained by the Government.  What were we told in the communiqué that emerged after the summit on 5 December?  It is set out in 3.4 of the White Paper:</P>
    <P>The funds thus provided are to be concentrated on the financing of selected infrastructure projects and programmes, with the understanding that any direct or indirect distortion of the competitive position of specific industries within member States will have to be avoided.</P>
    <P>Why is there that understanding?  It was put into the communiqué as if it was something as unalterable as the laws of the Medes and the persians or as the sun rises in the morning and sinks in the evening.  In his speech this morning when the Taoiseach was taking to task one of the leaders of the Opposition parties&mdash;I have forgotten which one&mdash;he adverted to this matter.  He said, &ldquo;surely you did not expect me to look for protection or shelter for industry when the whole point of the EEC is to do away with that?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The only achievement the White Paper considered worth mentioning was that it was on the Taoiseach's suggestion that the communique of 6-7 July contained a reference to the &ldquo;need for concurrent studies of the measures to be taken to strengthen the economies of the less prosperous member states and the fact that such measures were essential for the success of the system.&rdquo;  That was included on the Taoiseach's proposal and I am grateful to him for making sure it was done.  However, when it gets down to the things that obviously will be matters of difficulty here what do we get?  In <Col N="1549" /> July the Taoiseach said that he struck this blow for Ireland, that he ensured the communiqué included a paragraph about strengthening the weaker economies but in December we get a paragraph that not only does not envisage some help for the sector where help will be needed but which specifically rules it out.</P>
    <P>I cannot see what is so non-negotiable about assistance for an industry that suddenly finds itself threatened by a development of this kind.  I do not think I am quite in the dark about what the EEC is about.  When we joined the EEC on 1 January 1973 we were not thrown in at the deep end immediately.  Transitional measures were applied to ease the shock, and this was quite right.  I should like the Minister in his reply to tell us if there is not some analogy between the shock of joining the EEC in the first place and of finding ourselves part of the proposed monetary system now.  Surely there is something comparable in the shock to be experienced by the threatened sectors and tourism, which has not been mentioned, with the shock a large part of industry experienced on 1 January 1973?  Why is it so unthinkable that there should be some special measures to protect the threatened sectors of Irish industry during some transitional period whose duration geniuses in the Minister's Department could work out?  I could not say whether six months, one year or two years would be necessary but I take it the Minister has an opinion on how long, in the event of a relative devaluation of the British £, Irish industry would have to adjust itself in order to compete on level terms?  Why is that so automatically excluded?</P>
    <P>In common with many other Deputies I have to learn much of this stuff as I go along but I cannot help looking at the gaping hole in the Government's negotiating record and what they were looking for.  The Government were looking for a figure of about £650 million spread over five years.  In October last the Minister for Economic Planning and Development when asked by Deputy O'Leary if the Government were looking for loans or grants replied &ldquo;grants&rdquo;. <Col N="1550" /> Even the founder of his party would have found it difficult to take out of that reply any meaning other than grants mean grants.  That is what the Minister was looking for.  Even if he got that and not merely soft loans, what would the grants have amounted to?  I know that simple people&mdash;I would not be offended at being included in that category when considering this matter&mdash;are baffled by large sums of money that are many thousands of times more than they will have occasion to spend and over which they will never have disposal powers. What is £650 million spread over five years?  I do not know if the Minister has looked at it this way.  Even if we had got that amount it would have to be devoted to infrastructural projects but it is not much more than the State, substantially out of its own resources, has spent on telephones in the past few years and we have a long way to go there.  We could sink £650 million in the telephone system and not see it.</P>
    <P>I represent a constituency in which there has been quite understandable resentment because of a promise to which no less a personage than the Taoiseach himself added his authority three days before the election.  Senator Ryan had the authority of Deputy Lynch to give his personal commitment to the building of a new dual carriageway that would take the strain off a series of completely inadequate narrow suburban roads leading roughly from Palmerstown or Chapelizod to the Dún Laoghaire car ferry.  The difference between the Minister's party and mine is that we made no rash promises about it. We could have lashed out 50,000 circulars saying that Liam Cosgrave would provide that road but we did not do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall stick to the Southern Cross road route.  I do not know if the traffic on that road thunders past the Minister's door but it could not be too far away.  When Deputy Niall Andrews was beating a retreat from the commitment from which he benefited I think I heard him put a figure of £70-£80 million on it.  That is a small section of dual carriageway that one could lose on the map of Dublin.  How far would £650 million go in building roads, in supplying telephones?  Would it compensate for the destruction of a substantial part of the traditional industry that is labour intensive?</P>
      <P>CIE are getting up on their hind legs at last and are demanding what they should have demanded a long time ago, and they are not making any secret of the problems.  They are expected to run a bus service in a city which is choked with tax free cars&mdash;an extra 100,000 of them have joined the road since this Government came in.  They are also expected to run a rail service which is bulging at the seams in the dirtiest, most dilapidated coaches this side of Baghdad.  This cannot go on.  Day in and day out the commuter trains from Dundalk in one direction and from Bray in the other break down and leave as many people stranded on the line as would a bomb scare.  CIE say that they have to have a new electrified commuter service on the Dublin suburban lines and that they have to have new rolling stock.  All one has to do to see the need for all this is to buy a 25p ticket and travel from Westland Row to Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How much will all that cost?  Would there be an awful lot of change from the £650 million, even if the Government got it, which they will not?  I cannot understand why these points have not been taken up with a bit more emphasis before this.  I know that is a lot of money, but devoted to infrastructure and not devoted to things which really <Col N="1552" /> need money, it is a drop in the bucket compared to what we need.  If the EMS were never heard of we would still have to find the money for that infrastructure. Suppose the EMS disappeared in smoke tomorrow morning for some reason as little foreseen as was last week's fiasco, are we still not going to have to do something about the Dublin commuter lines?  Are we still not going to have to build a Southern Cross Route and provide the infrastructural services that the Confederation of Irish Industry never tires of listing along with bad industrial relations as the chief obstacle to industrial development and prosperity.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be personally offensive, but I wonder if the Taoiseach and the two Ministers opposite are out of their depth with the people they are dealing with in Europe.  Are they serious at all?  The one thing that people here are afraid of in regard to EMS is loss of industrial employment in the short-term.  I am in favour of EMS if we can get the right terms.</P>

I am absolutely certain that I would not go to Europe, knowing that I was risking 10,000 industrial jobs, and look for an amount of money that would barely build 15 miles of motorway around the four or five biggest towns.  I would be afraid of making a laughing stock of myself.  I would not do anything for a sum of money that would not electrify the Dublin commuter rail service and provide it with proper rolling stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That team of Ministers might have made a special case and might have made some effort to bring home the special situation of this country in regard to EMS membership.  They could have <Col N="1553" /> emphasised to the Europeans the very special position we have in regard to unemployment. We are at the head of the European league in relation to unemployment. We are in a special position politically, and not just economically, in regard to unemployment.  The Minister knows that.  The scales of the countries are so different that an increase of 10,000 industrial workers out of their jobs here will have a political impact here.  I am not talking about Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael politics.  I am talking about the roof over this Parliament.  The political impact here will be absolutely out of proportion to a similar loss of jobs among the larger European countries.  If you could attract something the size of the Volkswagen works in Wolfsburg, that would on paper solve our entire unemployment problem; but we are on a different scale.  An extra 10,000 jobless here is a very serious matter.  It is a far more serious matter perhaps even than an extra 100,000 jobless in France or Germany, bearing in mind that the supporters in those countries for the unemployed are a great deal more generous than they are here.  Surely, that might have been a reason for asking that we be not pinned to the business of aids, whether loans or grants, not being useable for the purpose of distorting competition.  We must distort competition for a few years if we are to join this system.  Why was that not said?  If it was said why was it not in the White Paper and why was the Taoiseach not only silent about it this morning, but dismissive of such a possibility?</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach or the Ministers opposite are being hard nosed in these negotiations it is not coming through in translation.  Possibly, the kind of language that we hear from Deputy Colley comes through a bit more politely in French, German or in Italian.  Possibly, the evasions that we hear from the other Minister opposite come through in a different form when mediated by the interpreters in Luxembourg, Brussels, Rome or Bremen.  I do not know what the reason is, but it is certain that this Government have not pursued those negotiations on the point I am talking about with sufficiently hard nose.  Now we are in the situation where we will find <Col N="1554" /> ourselves possibly having to make a very hard decision.  I hope it will be properly made, but I will not promise not to say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; if it is wrong.  I am only flesh and blood the same as the rest of us.</P>

      <P>I have nearly given up saying friendly things about Fianna Fáil because as sure as I do someone like Deputy David Andrews will say that I am condescending or being patronising. That is the kind of response I get. Fianna Fáil are so used to dealing with people who can only think in terms of saying whatever offensive thing comes into their heads, even if it is a lie, that they cannot appreciate when somebody says that they agree that Fianna Fáil have made a good job of this or that.

      <P>We tried to thrash out the situation in regard to unemployment today, but unfortunately, the Ceann Comhairle would not allow me to pursue the matter.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development said&mdash;and this is highly relevant to our EMS situation&mdash;that he thought a question which I had put down to extract the ratio between the wealth-producing jobs the Government would claim to have created and those which were not wealth producing was a meaningless question. Would the Minister say that to Mr. Schmidt, to Mr. Giscard, or to even the humblest functionary from the remotest village in Apulia or Jutland and expect to be taken seriously?  The Minister would not: he would be ashamed to say such a thing.  What the Minister said today amounted to saying that if the female half of our population were all <Col N="1555" /> nurses and the male half were all gardaí, we could have the very same standard of living we have now.  We could not and the Minister knows it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that there is a distinction between a job which creates wealth and a job which simply consumes it.  I did not say those jobs were not productive.  They are productive, because they produce a service which we must have; but they are not wealth productive.  Any Government can borrow enough money, can buy enough desks and chairs and put enough people behind them with enough typewriters.  We could have done that if we had no sense of responsibility.  I am still waiting for an answer to that question. I regard the Minister as being guilty of a gross evasion by the line he took here today about it.  I cannot believe that the Minister would stand over an answer of that kind if he were dealing with the people in Europe.</P>
      <P>We are being brought now to the brink of an historic decision, which will be made the right way, I hope, for the sake of all of us, and to the brink of a situation in which the Irish £ will be judged by itself for the first time ever.  It is such a small appendage at the moment to the currency area represented by these islands that nobody has ever asked what the Irish £ is worth alone.  That question will be asked when we first enter this system.  I presume there will be an initial value at which we enter the system for the Irish £.  We are in a weak position.  I am not selling us short.  I read the Minister's speech in October where he mentioned a couple of the favourable factors in regard to the inherent value of the Irish currency but left out the weak factors.  The weak factors are that our wages policy, if it can be called that, is in an indescribable state of chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wage demands of a level previously unheard of are being made.  The Minister knows this and he complains about it himself although his party created the atmosphere which made it certain that <Col N="1556" /> these demands would be made, in which the guards are looking for 40 per cent, the nurses for 50 per cent, higher civil servants for a rise of £88 per week, not just £88 per week.  Would the Minister dare to ask for a rise like that?  Of course they are only the asking prices but did the Minister show these figures to Helmut Schmidt or to Giscard D'Estaing?  I am damn sure he did not. Did he show them the trade figures which we have had for three months in succession, a record trade deficit for three months?</P>
    <P>All these features are the negative side of our situation but the hard-headed people of the kind that the Taoiseach and his Ministers find themselves out of their depth with are able to do their sums.  I am sure they are in possession of the official figures which reflect these things. They have embassies here with very little else to do except make newspaper cuttings, with very little else to do except sniff out reports of wage demands here of temporising there and of commissions being set up on conditions of pay and so on.  They are able to draw their conclusions about what a spineless Government we have, a Government which reached power after an election the like of which would not be seen anywhere else in Europe.  If the Fianna Fáil manifesto had been produced in the remotest hamlet of western Europe they would have been laughed out of it.  If the country is facing difficulties, I do not want the Taoiseach and his Ministers looking down their noses making solemn faces at me and asking me to show restraint.  What restraint did they show when they were out chasing votes?</P>

      <P>I should like to be able to reply to the many points that have been raised and the many hares that have been flushed out in the course of the debate.  Alas, time prevents me from doing so but I cannot resist dealing with a few of them, even the ones that are extraneous to the issues before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is fresh in my mind I will deal with Deputy Kelly's remarks about wealth-producing employment, saying <Col N="1557" /> how wrong I was to imply that the jobs could not be classified into wealth-producing and non-wealth-producing employment.  He suggested that I was trying to say that if all the men were engaged as police and all the women were engaged as nurses we could still enjoy the same standard of living.  Of course I did not suggest it.  Neither did I suggest that if we had no nurses and if we had no policemen and if everybody was engaged in what the Deputy would presumably describe as wealth-producing employment, making ticky-tacky boxes in ticky-tacky factories&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister contemptuous of box factories?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not but this is the example the Deputy quoted to me today.  I am simply making the point that one cannot describe or define wealth-producing employment in simplified terms.  There is ultimately involved what I might describe as a fallacy of composition.  That is why I refused to answer the question but I invited the Deputy to submit his description of what he regarded as wealth-producing and non-wealth-producing occupations.  I will supply the numbers corresponding to those and the Deputy can make what use he thinks appropriate of them, but the Deputy was not going to have me supplying allegedly wealth-producing or non-wealth-producing classifications. That is the point I am making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not recognise any distinction even remotely like the one I am trying to make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The question was tabled to me.  The Minister accepts responsibility for the replies.  I am telling the Deputy the reasons why I refused to answer in the terms I was invited to.  I am also saying why I disagree with the references which he made and why I think he is wrong, but I am open to persuasion in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closing theme of his address, &ldquo;no matter what we get it is not enough&rdquo;, helps me to lead into a discussion of the issues before us.  There ought to have <Col N="1558" /> been two separate themes.  One was the question of the EMS and the issues surrounding the nature of that system and the extent to which Ireland would benefit from membership of it.  That was the substantive issue for debate.  Tacked onto it there was a separate issue concerning the negotiations leading up to the Brussels Summit of last week and on the various discussions which took place afterwards.  First of all, we had the play itself, the EMS, and then we had discussions about the players.  The bulk of the contributions from the other side of the House, crudely summarised, seemed to suggest that they did not think much of the system because they did not think much of the players.  They tried to convey the notion that the proposals which emerged from the Summit were clearly inadequate because of the inadequacy of the Taoiseach and his Ministers in the preparations which led up to the proposals issuing from that Summit.</P>
    <P>I have to remind Deputy Kelly that judged simply on the criterion of the amount of money that was put forward as a suggestion, £45 million in terms of grants, represents a substantially larger sum than the amounts which were forthcoming from regional funds negotiated by the Coalition Government. Therefore, if we were inadequate then the other side of the House must be grossly inadequate by some factor of five, six or perhaps even tenfold.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is also pursuing the notion that not alone would it be inadequate because it was not up to the amount originally sought but that the amount sought was itself inadequate.  I recall hearing that one from Deputy FitzGerald who misleadingly introduced estimates associated with my name, estimates produced in a different context for a different purpose.</P>
    <P>The proposals put forward by this Government in the context of the EMS are not to be confused, should not be confused, and have only been confused by the leader of Fine Gael and some of his acolytes as being appropriate in the EMS context.  That inability to distinguish between the characteristics of the EMS and the characteristics of a full European economic and monetary union <Col N="1559" /> is symptomatic of the confusion which has characterised that side of the House, especially many of the utterances of Deputy FitzGerald.  I shall return to that subject because I want to emphasise that the confusion is not on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Because of the many references to the personnel involved in the negotiations, including myself, I trust I will be forgiven if I take time to deal with some of these remarks as they affect me.  The Tánaiste said today that the nature of the statements made in the House last week precluded any effective reply from us.  I was accused by Deputy FitzGerald of making statements on RTE radio last week which were at variance with what the Taoiseach had said.  Some people in the media even went so far as to dramatise the nature of that alleged difference and the motivation for it.  What I was saying was not at variance in any way that I could identify with what the Taoiseach was saying.  Let me quote from a transcript which I have been given.  I went on to state the various terms.  Then I was asked did the package fall short of what the Government had sought and I said yes, it did.  Then I said on the basis of the proposals that had been put forward, the Taoiseach had said that he could not say that he would recommend it at this time: &ldquo;That is why no formal decision was taken and the Taoiseach indicated that he would want the Government to discuss it and that he would want the opportunity of examining some of the possibilities further before any final decision is taken.  That decision should emerge within the next week or two&rdquo;.  That was my attempt in my words to repeat what the Taoiseach had said the night before where, although he had indicated that the package as offered was not one that he felt he could recommend, he went on to say that nonetheless he would seek to explore other possibilities.</P>

I hope I am repeating verbatim what I said on that occasion.  I have indicated that, in my words, I was attempting to repeat what the Taoiseach had said the night before.  At the end I was again asked my own personal views and I said it would be premature at this stage: &ldquo;I am not offering any views.

      <P>I have made my statement.  It is the first opportunity I have had of making the statement in this House and I want to do it as fully and freely and as accurately as I can.  I hope that will be an end of the matter.  I think that is all I need say on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points were raised in the debate this morning.  I shall try to deal with them quickly.  Again, there was this notion of seeking to impute confusion or contradiction to this side of the House with Deputy Cluskey at one stage saying that there was a contradiction between the White Paper which referred to a detailed review as the basis for our assessment for these resource transfers and a paragraph in the Taoiseach's speech where the Taoiseach had said that there were far too many variables involved for anyone to be able to conclude that any sector would, of necessity&mdash;my emphasis&mdash;be adversely affected by our entry into the new system. There is no contradiction there whatever because the basis for seeking resource transfers was geared to a likely programme of expenditure which would be undertaken to strengthen our infrastructure, to improve investment in our industry. That is one type of calculation which can be made and which was made as the basis for our case.  It is quite a separate calculation to seek to identify what would happen to each individual industry or sector of the economy in the event of our membership because one would have to specify the particular characteristics that one envisages for membership&mdash;and there are quite a number of possible circumstances.  If I had time, I would develop that point but I simply make the essential point that there is no contradiction between what <Col N="1562" /> was said in the White Paper and what was contained in the Taoiseach's remarks in the House this morning.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey also said incidentally that there was no resource transfer involved in these loans, these soft loans that had been offered.  I shall be coming back to that.  I just want to note it carefully.  There is a transfer involved and I shall refer to its value in a few minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald made a number of points quite a few of which were dealt with by the Tánaiste in his remarks earlier today, so I can take them as dealt with.  One point which Deputy FitzGerald stressed a few times was the emphasis on the manner in which a special line had been introduced into the regional fund to provide an extra six million units of account for Ireland several years ago.  He asked why did we not seek to have recourse to this type of approach when we were presenting our case.  The fact is that we not only looked at that possibility but at a number of others also.  To update the position, may I point out here that arrangements for regional policy, the regional fund and so on have moved on quite a bit since then and that there is also a non-quota section of the fund at the present time and that this could also be an appropriate vehicle.</P>
      <P>Another point raised by Deputy FitzGerald was that 9 per cent interest on these loans would be excessive.  But, of course, no one has ever suggested what the actual rate of interest on any such EEC loans would be.  The 9 per cent rate referred to on a number of occasions on this side of the House related to the interest rate that was used in order to arrive at the value of the subsidy contained in these loans.  It is a number used in order to carry out a calculation.  This is where I can come I think to something that I was invited to do last week by Deputy FitzGerald.  I am sorry he is not here to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy FitzGerald would wish the Minister to realise that <Col N="1563" /> no discourtesy to the Minister is intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  I trust that in due course he will have an opportunity of consulting the records of the House.  So, I shall try to put it on record as carefully as I can.  First, he was saying that again one of the points that led to confusion was that in my remarks on RTE radio I had drawn attention to the fact that there was this subsidy element in loans, that there was a five-year moratorium and that there was a value in this moratorium on which a figure had not yet been placed.  He thought this contradicted the statement by the Taoiseach where the £45 million calculation did include a moratorium element. A few paragraphs later Dr. FitzGerald said and I quote:</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach went on to make the following statement which I am sure is not totally clear to everybody in this House &ldquo;that the present value of a 3 per cent interest subsidy with a three-year moratorium on capital repayments included in most of the calculations is equivalent to approximately 20 per cent of the value of the loan discounted at 9 per cent.  Now, hands up those who understand that, hands up.  Does anybody understand it?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He invited me to put up my hand and it was at that point that I promised him that I would deal with that aspect fully and fairly this evening.  I now propose to do so because I want to use this in order to show that the Taoiseach's statement was correct and also to show that there was no difference in that statement of the Taoiseach and my remarks.  So, the confusion then is on Deputy FitzGerald's part, not on my part.  I might add that since he indicated five unnamed experts in support of his views, I felt that they might carry some weight and that is why I need to refute them as fully, fairly and accurately as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us set out the basis clearly: we are going to be talking about loans for 15-year periods.  Basically there are two ways in which loans can be repaid, if we are thinking of normal commercial situations <Col N="1564" /> to begin with.  One is by what is called the annuity method, which is the method used with mortgages on houses and so on, where one pays a large amount of interest on the bulk of the loan in the first year and a small amount of capital and then that small amount of capital repayment in the first year, because it can be invested at a rate of interest, will accumulate up to a bigger figure at the end of 15 years and so on; in the second year one pays a smaller amount of interest and a slightly larger amount of capital and that larger amount is now invested for 14 years and so on.  That is the annuity method.  It is a fairly complex one but there are well-recognised mathematical rules for arriving at the amounts involved.</P>
    <P>However, since Deputy FitzGerald specifically asked us to avoid the algebra and to put it into the form of simple arithmetic I am going to use a second method which is simpler, and the degree of error involved is very small; all the approximations will be right to the nearest round numbers.  The second method, then, is to simply assume that the capital sum is repaid over the 15 years.  The first case we will take is where it is repaid in 15 equal instalments. So we have a loan which is repayable in 15 equal instalments and the first case is where there is no inflation. I emphasise the words &ldquo;no inflation&rdquo;. In those circumstances if we consider an ordinary commercial loan at a commercial rate of interest with no inflation and ask if a moratorium has any value in those circumstances the answer is no.  That is the one case in which Deputy FitzGerald's five experts might have been right.  If that was the question he put to them then their answer is one with which I would agree.  But I doubt if that was the question that was put, for reasons I will come to.</P>
    <P>I now wish to move on to pick up the value of an interest subsidy, because we were asked to explain it.  If calculating the value of a subsidy I need a more convenient way, using simple arithmetic, to illustrate how long one borrows money for if one repays in 15 equal instalments over a 15-year period.  That is equivalent <Col N="1565" /> to saying that one borrows the whole sum for the whole of eight years and then repays it in one lump sum.  So instead of borrowing £100 and repaying it by 15 instalments of something under £7 a year for each of the 15 years one would incur the same amount of interest if one borrowed £100 and paid interest only for eight years and then repaid the loan at that point.  That is equivalent to an eight-year full term loan.  So an ordinary 15-year loan with no moratorium is equivalent to a full term loan of eight years.</P>
    <P>If we now introduce a moratorium it has the effect of postponing the average date at which one makes the capital repayment.  If it is a five-year moratorium that means one makes no capital repayments in each of the first five years but one must now make larger capital repayments from the sixth to the fifteenth year.  The combined effect of those two elements is that on average one borrows the money for ten-and-a-half-years instead of eight years so the effect of the five-year moratorium is to postpone the average date of repayment by two-and-a-half-years, from eight years to ten-and-a-half-years.</P>
    <P>Now we can introduce the value of the interest subsidy plus the value of the moratorium: If we take the simple case of 2 per cent interest subsidy on a loan of £100 million then the subsidy would be £2 million in the first year, £1.1 million in the eighth year and it would be down to £130,000 in the last year and so on.  But if my simple rule is applied and we just say it is equivalent to a full eight-year loan then one would just take £2 million for eight years, £16 millions, as the amount of cash that would be associated with the subsidy over this full eight years.  But what is the value of £16 million spread over an eight-year period?  To answer that one must find some discount rate to find the value today of £2 million in eight years time.  £2 million in seven years time and so on. That is where the 9 per cent figure came in, it being the current rate of interest in a number of loan cases.  If one discounts at 9 per cent in order to find the value today of this £16 million one will find that it comes out at something like £10.3 million. <Col N="1566" /> So £10.3 million would be the value today of a 2 per cent interest subsidy on a 15-year loan.</P>
    <P>The moratorium element has the effect of pushing out the average term of the loan from eight to ten-and-a-half-years, and in this simple example it would have the effect of adding on another £2.7 million to the present day value of the subsidy, so that one would have the interest element of £10.3 million and the subsidy element of £2.7 million, to make a total of £13 million.  That means, I trust, that I can now read off in the case of a loan of £225 million, at an interest rate of 9 per cent over a 15-year period that if there is a 3 per cent interest subsidy with no moratorium, the present value of that subsidy is £39,847,000.  If there is a five-year moratorium, added on to that subsidy the value increases to £45,565,000 and rounding that off, that is the £45 million to which the Taoiseach referred and indeed which I used in my remarks.</P>
    <P>That deals with the first three cases, first, the commercial loan, second, a loan where there is an interest subsidy, and, third, a loan where there is a subsidy and a moratorium.  I now need to introduce a further example in order to deal with the alleged contradiction between my remarks on radio and the Taoiseach's statement.  I want to introduce the concept of inflation which I trust most of us recognise exists.  I trust we would agree that inflation means that £100 next year is not as valuable as £100 this year and its purchasing power is reduced by whatever inflation figure one cares to insert.  This problem of inflation will be reflected in the interest rate that would normally apply on commercial loans because, for instance, if one takes a 9 per cent interest rate that would be very high to be a real rate of interest; historically it would be very high because the real rate of interest for long periods of time has been in the region of 3 to 4 per cent and so 9 per cent interest rates reflect the fact people observe inflation to be present and allow for it in the sum of money that they want on any particular loan, because they now want the money to cover both their real earnings and they want money to <Col N="1567" /> cover the inflation effect, the fall in the value of their money.  The point I was making in my remarks on radio is that if one discounts an interest subsidy and if one takes in the value of a moratorium at a 9 per cent interest one is understating the true value of that moratorium, because if one eliminated the inflation element in the interest rate, that is, if one discounted these future sums of money not by 9 per cent which has an inflation element in it but by, say, 5 per cent if we allow that inflation over the next five or ten years might on average be in the 4 per cent range, that would have the effect of increasing the present value of the subsidy by another 3 or 4 percentage points.  That was the point I was making on radio.  That was the basis of the remarks I made that it also had a value but I had not yet placed a figure on it.  The reason I have not yet placed a figure on it, I hope will be recognised from the simple example I have given, which shows that it can be fairly complex trying to take account of the impact of inflation rates on prospective future sums of money.</P>

      <P>I will use my time as I think appropriate just the same way as Deputy FitzGerald did, sneeringly and undermining the position of the Taoiseach, alleging that there was discontent and disputes between the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  This is my first occasion to refute every one of those allegations and to show that all the error and confusion stems from the far side of the House.  The final point I want to make on this brings me back to my earlier remarks.  If one allows for the presence of inflation, which is contained in all of the current interest rates, then a moratorium, even on a commercial loan, may have a value.  I would like to know, therefore, what question Deputy FitzGerald put to his five alleged experts before I know if the answer they gave was correct or not.</P>
      <P>At the outset I specified a case with no inflation and I said in those circumstances it would have no value.  I suggested that most present interest rates include an inflation element.  I would like to know what question was put and what answer was given.  I have demonstrated for Deputy FitzGerald's benefit that a moratorium has a value.  I have demonstrated the way in which one calculates the value of the moratorium in interest subsidy.  I have demonstrated that if he could not understand the statement made by the Taoiseach that the failing was on his part not on ours.  Incidentally, for an alleged economic expert, I could not believe it when he said he did not understand a simple economic statement like the present value of something discounted at 9 per cent.</P>

First of all, if we distinguish that what has been proposed in the EMS context is a package of loans on the one hand accompanied by a subsidy which can be converted into a cash payment it represents a grant.  Let us separate the two elements and now let us see&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are two elements on offer.  One is loans at a normal rate of interest.  If we separate the subsidy and take that as a cash grant it becomes a cash transfer.  I would have hoped, after the examples I have given, that there was no need to debate that any further.</P>

Deputy Bruton also implied that it would have to increase our borrowing figure and would affect our domestic money supply.  Let us be clear on this.  If we take those loans, they become part of the normal financing of the Government's capital programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If external financing is not required, if the effect of these loans is then simply to add to our foreign reserves there is nothing to prevent us using some of our external reserves to repay some of the existing foreign debt so that at the end of the transaction if one does not need any additional foreign borrowing one does not add to one's foreign debt.  One simply offsets this loan by a repayment of existing foreign loans.  One's net foreign indebtedness at the end of the period need not be any higher.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not fit for first year.  He cannot understand that.  All of the statements along those lines from the other side of the House are wrong.  I am not mincing words and there is no confusion about that.  If anybody wants to challenge that statement of mine I invite him to give his own lecture in his own time.  The loans do not mean that we are committed to any level of foreign borrowing higher than we would otherwise make.  We may or may not need to make some additional foreign borrowing.  That is something which must be determined in the circumstances of the time, whether it is next year or any other later year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loan aspect of it does not affect <Col N="1571" /> our position except perhaps positively.  If there is any need for foreign borrowing in the coming years is it not comforting to know that that borrowing facility is already available?  There do not have to be any rumours, scares or other types of hysterical outbursts to imply that in order to finance the Government's programme there will be a shortage of credit for other investors in the economy.  One banishes any speculation of that kind by demonstrating that a loan facility is already available.</P>
    <P>We have established that loans can have a positive value.  They do not automatically commit us to any increase in our foreign indebtedness.  They certainly do not commit us to any additional indebtedness over and above that which de desire.  We have also established that the subsidy element represents a real transfer of resources.  The question then must remain: &ldquo;Is that level of grant sufficient?&rdquo;  We have heard a statement from Deputy O'Leary, who told us that the Labour Party will support entry if the terms are right, and Deputy FitzGerald and also Deputy Kelly have implied that Fine Gael would support entry also if the terms were right.  We, too, have been saying that we would support entry if the terms are right, but the question is what are the right terms?  That is a matter for debate in the context of numbers.  I have not time for that now, but I trust that my earlier illustrations were sufficient to show why I do not accept Deputy Kelly's type of calculation.  There is a question, then, of other conditions or circumstances. Deputy O'Leary spoke of the importance of safeguarding employment. That consideration has been the prime basis of our approach.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for our saying that any transfer should be concentrated in a form that would enable us to improve our investment, to improve our infrastructure and other facilities was, taking the long-term view, to improve the efficiency of and reduce costs for firms operating in an Irish environment.  That is a way in which the competitive position is helped and in which employment <Col N="1572" /> is safeguarded.  The shorter-term effects are that this would insulate that type of inflow of funds from having any adverse effect on our inflation.  We do not want such an adverse effect.  If you are accelerating your spending in these infrastructural programmes it is possible to provide more jobs whether in road building, in the supply of telephone services or in other types of infrastructure. Deputy Kelly appeared to be rather sneering about the value of such an approach. All I can say is that if an extra £50 million or so is spent each year in these areas, it must lead to a significant addition of several thousand employed in those areas.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised the question, too, of the possibility of adverse effects on existing industries, but most of the hypothetical circumstances that were referred to were circumstances in which Ireland would become a member while Britain would remain outside with the British £ being devalued against the Irish £ and our firms, therefore, being at a cost disadvantage.  But at a cost disadvantage of how much?  How can one put a figure on it now?  Surely the appropriate position to adopt is to recognise that there are a number of hypothetical situations and to develop&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;an appropriate kind of policy which could be applied should any of those hypothetical situations arise.  That is the approach we will adopt.  I assure the House and in particular I want the message to go out to trade union members, to management and to all others concerned, both inside and outside the House, that it is because we are determined to ensure that the EMS of itself will not have any adverse effect on our employment performance or on our ability to generate improvements in our living standards that we have been pursuing the negotiations in the manner in which we have been pursuing them, and we envisage pursuing those approaches until we are satisfied as to the nature of the conditions that would exist in an EMS context.  But I <Col N="1573" /> must say that it is not only a question of what Europe can do for us.  It is also very much a question of what we can do for ourselves.</P>
      <P>This morning Deputy FitzGerald quoted some remarks of mine that were published in a magazine when I spoke about offsetting action.  The Deputy seemed to be going on to imply that all of that had to come from Europe, and that was why I interrupted him to make clear that some of the offsetting action had to come from within the country. There is no point in any Irish Government, from whatever party or of whatever complexion, going off to Europe and saying that we need certain financial supports as well as other supports in order to maintain some level of performance and to achieve some increase in employment if, when they come back home, the behaviour within the economy is such as to undermine the prospects of achieving those results. That is why the Taoiseach and other Ministers have been saying that in an EMS context there must be a more realistic approach to a number of industrial relations issues and to a number of other related issues, but it is the incomes issue that has been highlighted in the remarks.  While we envisage real increases in living standards and in incomes, continuing those increases must be geared to what the economy can afford. It is unrealistic to suggest that real increases in incomes in double figures can occur year after year.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary spoke of the effects of some of our policies, but may I remind him that he, as Minister, negotiated wage agreements that in themselves would have produced a reduction in the living standard of workers.  He said it was our policies this year which led in part to the explosion of wage demands.  I suggest that the truth is that after a period of depression, of repression and of various other sorts of recession during which many people were forced to accept reductions in their living standards, there has been a dramatic turnaround in this <Col N="1574" /> country's fortunes in the past 18 months.</P>

      <P>We say to the people: &ldquo;yes, we share your ambition. We think it is possible to produce genuine improvements in living standards, but not at an impossible overnight rate&rdquo;.  What we are asking for, whether in an EMS context or in the context of our own circumstances outside the EMS, is a realistic recognition of the pace of improvement which can be sustained, and we are asking also that those who are already fortunate enough to have secure employment will exercise an extra degree of restraint so that we may press ahead with the fastest possible rate of improvement in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I remind Deputy O'Leary, too, that our policies this year have produced the largest single increase in employment in any year since the foundation of the State?  That is a fantastic performance, but we should like to see an even better performance next year, and there can be a better performance next year given the right degree of understanding and support. That is the nature of the opportunity that is opening up before the Irish people.  It is the nature of the opportunity that may be strengthened and facilitated further within the context of the EMS.  It is an opportunity that would give Ireland a chance not only to improve her own circumstances within her <Col N="1575" /> own context but to make her contribution, a not unworthy contribution, to the building of that better Europe which is at the heart of the proposals for an EMS. While we may spend our time here debating the precise details of loans, transfers or anything else, it is important to remind ourselves of what this discussion is all about.  Ultimately it is all about the possibility of creating a major new element in the construction of a European union, the possibility of a further major step forward along the path to European union.  Surely that is an ambition <Col N="1576" /> that ought to be shared by many people here on both sides of the House. It is for that reason that we would expect widespread support both inside the House and outside for attempts to bring about, not only the construction of that EMS, but the most effective opportunity for Ireland to participate in such a system.</P>

      <P>I want to raise the question of the administration of the Low Rise Mortgage Scheme and its application to single-parent families where there is only one child.  According to Dublin Corporation, the scheme applies to persons who, at least one year prior to the date of application, had applied and been accepted by Dublin Corporation at the time as constituting a family of three persons in need of rehousing on the ground that their existing accommodation was dangerous and so on.</P>
      <P>Specifically the issue here is that Dublin Corporation have regarded single parent families, with one child, as being the equivalent of three people and, for their housing purposes, have always regarded that to be the case.  Recently an application by a single parent, with one child, for a low rise mortgage scheme was turned down by Dublin Corporation. When I challenged their decision I was told that the Department had ruled specifically&mdash;in their interpretation of this&mdash;and had clearly indicated that while the corporation may give the loan of the capital sum, the Government were not prepared, in the interpretation of the Department, to pay the subsidy.</P>
      <P>I want to ascertain from the Minister who is running the Department of the Environment.  First of all, in the Fianna Fáil Manifesto it is said that because Fianna Fáil believe that as many families as possible should own their own homes they will make it easier to buy a house and cheaper to keep it.  That is the manifesto promise.  The White Paper published in January 1978 at paragraph 5.7 said:</P>
      <P>It is the Government's policy to help and encourage as many as possible to provide their own homes.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper published in June 1978, at paragraph 5.16 said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's policy is to ensure that as many people as possible are able to purchase their own homes rather than have to rely on rented accommodation. To enable them to do so, there must be an adequate supply <Col N="1579" /> of small to medium-sized houses available for purchase at acceptable prices, and there must also be an adequate supply of mortgage finance available in an appropriate form.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council in their comments on the Green Paper, in paragraph 5.15 said:</P>
    <P>An important determinant of the demand for housing is the flow of loan finance&mdash;especially the flow of building society advances.  The flow of advances by building societies is dependent on their net inflow of funds, which in turn is dependent on the flow of deposits.</P>
    <P>They go on to say, at paragraph 5.17, that the council agrees with the Green Paper that house purchase should be made easier for some potential house-buyers, in particular for those on relatively low incomes, and then go on to talk about the overall management of funds.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in three specific quotations, one before the general election and two afterwards, the indications and policy of this Government are fairly clear. However, its interpretation in the lower regions of the Department does not appear to be so.  When this question arose I put a Parliamentary Question to the Minister asking him if he would revise the regulations of the low rise mortgage scheme so that single parents with one child who otherwise meet the requirements of the loan will become eligible to receive the loan.  The Minister's reply essentially was that he was reviewing the situation&mdash;a favourite refrain of this Government&mdash;and that no decision had been made until that review had been completed.</P>
    <P>However, it was not the first time the matter had been brought to the Minister's attention.  In fact Cherish had written to the Minister a letter, of which I received a copy and of which the Minister was aware I was receiving a copy, drawing his attention to this administrative anomaly.  The Minister replied to Cherish on 6 December, acknowledging their letter, but did not <Col N="1580" /> give any indication of what was happening.</P>
    <P>I think I have established the case fairly clearly.  There is a clear Government policy with regard to encouraging home-ownership.  The Government have taken a lot of major initiatives in terms of making finance available and so on.  A number of families, and specifically one of my constituents, approached me.  I advised the woman in question to go for a low rise mortgage loan.  She applied to the corporation.  Initially the corporation said: &ldquo;yes, you qualify on all the normal counts&rdquo;, and then she was turned down.  I contacted the principal officer in the Housing Department of the corporation.  He took the matter up with the Department.  The Department quite clearly stated that the Government would not be prepared to entertain this application because it was in conflict with their interpretation of the scheme. As I understand, that is the factual situation. If I have not presented the case clearly, it was my intention to do so and I will certainly accept any corrections.</P>
    <P>I want to know what is happening in the Minister's Department.  I want to know did he specifically make that decision. I want to know if the Minister had on his desk, at any stage, a memorandum or note seeking advice on interpretation of this scheme when it was raised and pressed by the major local authority housing agency in the country, namely, Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>First of all, I want to know did the Minister himself see this application and refuse it.  If he did I want to know how he can reconcile that decision with Government policy as stated in the three documents from which I have quoted.  If he did not see it&mdash;and I can readily understand he cannot see just everything&mdash;I want to know who the official is in the corporation who obviously flew in the face of Government policy.  I want to know at what level that official dealt with the matter and I want to know what senior official, assuming the Minister did not see it, okayed the position because I presume, when a matter is raised by a principal officer in the housing department of the corporation, it merits at least a second opinion in the <Col N="1581" /> Custom House.  It seems to me the Minister's officials do not know what Government policy is, which is regrettable to say the least, and are, therefore, in a contradictory position in regard to the administration and implementation of the Minister's own declared objectives for which he has a democratic mandate and which he has quite clearly repeated on a number of occasions.  I have given three Government quotations and the Minister himself is on record on more than one occasion quite clearly reiterating the Government's policy of encouraging home ownership.</P>
    <P>If it has not been simply&mdash;I am seeking parliamentary language&mdash;a ministerial mistake or some confusion on the Minister's part, if that is not the case, I want to know has the Minister actually refused this himself and, if so, can he indicate to the House the amount involved in the subsidy and any additional cost that would fall on the Department if they picked up this additional interpretation of the low rise mortgage scheme with specific reference to single parent families.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say something about the difficulties of single parent families in trying to get houses in a city like Dublin.  First of all, because of the nature of our society, single parent families tend invariably to be female parents with one child or children.  If a man is left without a partner and has a child people rush to his aid because he presumably cannot cope with a child or children.  If a woman is left in similar circumstances the same response is not there and frequently she is left on her own.  Her difficulty in getting a mortgage, in getting guarantees for loans or overdraft, in getting a lease signed are innumerably greater because she is female.  The difficulties are there.  Cases have been well documented and Fianna Fáil Deputies who know their constituencies know that that is the situation. Yet, here we have a situation where either the Minister, who is ultimately responsible, directly intervened and said &ldquo;No&rdquo; in this specific instance when the matter was raised or someone in his Department said &ldquo;No&rdquo; and, if somebody in his Department said &ldquo;No&rdquo;, I want to <Col N="1582" /> know what will happen to him and in what way is the policy going to be changed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister, having brought this matter to light, if he would, independently of any review of the low rise mortgage scheme referred to in his reply to me on 7 December, forthwith make it known to every local authority that single parent families with one child will be eligible under the general terms of the low rise mortgage scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no conflict here between Government policy and the Department of the Environment or myself.  With regard to the point as to who decided this, I decided, not the officials. It is very important to realise that this scheme was introduced in November 1976 by the then National Coalition Government and the local authorities are responsible for the administration of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The three categories are: (a) an existing tenant or tenant-purchaser of a local authority house who surrenders his dwelling to the local authority on receipt of a loan to purchase a private house; (b) families of three or more persons who, at least one year prior to seeking the loan, had applied to and been accepted by a local authority at that time as being in need of rehousing on the grounds that their existing accommodation was dangerous, structurally unfit or seriously overcrowded and that their financial circumstances were such that they could not reasonably be expected to provide proper accommodation from their own resources, and who are still in need of rehousing; and (c) a person who has been allocated tenancy of a new local authority house and who wishes to purchase that house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were the conditions laid down <Col N="1583" /> by the National Coalition Government, not by my predecessor.  This went to Government and the Government made this decision.  The Government of the law laid down these three conditions for a person who would have to qualify.  A loan under the scheme can be 98 per cent of the cost of the house, or £9,000 maximum, whichever is the lower, and as a measure of the importance which I and the Government attach to this scheme a few months ago we raised the amount which would be available from £7,500 to £9,000.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific category to which the Deputy referred, I am aware of the category and the particular case.  It is a matter of concern to me that this is the position but under present conditions that person cannot qualify. As I told the Deputy in my reply to a written question, the whole scheme is being reviewed at the moment and, whether that is a favourite word or one the Deputy does not like with regard to the operation of Departments, that is the position.  We are in touch with local authorities in order to get a proper report as to how the scheme is functioning before we make the desired or necessary changes and I am sure the Deputy cannot quibble with that.  He asked why I took so long to have a look at the scheme.  There is a very simple answer to that.  This scheme, worthy as it is, and it is a very good scheme and a very attractive scheme, did not get off the ground last year and it did not get off the ground until we were well into this year.  Last year the total amount necessary for the scheme in a full year was £1,500,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> This year it will exceed £6 million.  I have made the necessary cash available outside of the estimated amount at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>Immediately the returns come back from the local authorities, with particular emphasis on Dublin Corporation, the main authority involved in this scheme, changes will be made but those changes will have to be made by the Government since the scheme was introduced by the Government and the conditions were laid down by the Government.  It is my intention to make any changes necessary with all possible haste when I have all the data essential in order to approach the Government.</P>
    <P>As an indication of how popular the scheme has become, this year there were 645 applicants in category (a), 509 in category (b), the category referred to by the Deputy, and 549 in category (c). They were the figures on 30 September. An urgent review is, therefore, in everybody's interest.  There is no delay on my part with regard to this review and changing the conditions.  I repeat no official in my Department is in any way in conflict with Government policy with regard to housing.</P>

I cannot say at this stage when I will be in a position to convey a decision to the local authority on this scheme, contract documents for which were submitted to my Department on 25 September and which are at present being examined.</P>
