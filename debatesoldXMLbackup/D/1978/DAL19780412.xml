    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said last week, it was rather surprising that we did not have some contributions from Fianna F·il backbenchers on this Bill as we have had on other measures that have gone through the House since the election. It was with a fanfare of trumpets that the measures to date were announced, but we seem to have come up against a wall of silence on the Government side of the House in respect of this Bill.  That is no wonder because on examination and consideration the effects the Bill will have not only on those directly concerned, <Col N="448" /> those who will be called on to pay the enormous increases, but on the purse of every housewife, are beginning to sink in.  It matters not whether you are a country dweller, although many would say that only those in agricultural areas will be affected: that is not so because this is a removal of an indirect food subsidy and the removal of any food subsidy affects every housewife.  I shall come back to that later.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record first a few examples of how the food producing people will be affected.  I think it is unusual for a Minister to introduce a Bill without giving some examples of how it will affect whatever section of the community it is directed towards. I have examples of a number of holdings in county Dublin.  The first has a land valuation of £107.50 and a building valuation of £30, a total of £137.50.  Last year this man was called on to pay total rates of £1,055, less 25 per cent on the rates on the dwellings and buildings which amounted to £78.75.  That represented a first instalment of rates reduction which the National Coalition had embarked on to phase out rates over a number of years.  That left a bill for this holding of £921.80.  This year, because of the introduction of this Bill, on the same valuation the total rates will be £1,601.88 which, with a Government subsidy of £349.50, will leave the bill at £1,252.38, an increase of £330.58 or 35.86 per cent.  I ask the Minister to compare this with the 11 per cent increase imposed on the country as a whole.  That was on a holding of 95 acres, not a big ranch.</P>
      <P>In an example of a similar type of holding, with a land valuation of £144 and £22 on the buildings, the rates bill in that case was £1,000 on the land and £250 on the buildings, a total bill of £1,250.  In 1978, this man's bill will be £1,700, a net increase of 35 per cent or £450.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that some examples should be put on record here seeing that the Minister omitted to do so in introducing the Bill.  On another holding of 73 acres, which I suppose would be an average holding in this very important food producing section of the community, with a land valuation of <Col N="449" /> £84 and a building valuation of £16, in 1977 the rates bill was £680.75, less the 25 per cent on the buildings under the scheme introduced by the National Coalition, £42, leaving a total rates bill of £638.75.  As a result of this measure now going through the House the rates on that holding will be £1,165, less the Government allowance on the buildings of £186.40, leaving this man with a bill of £978.60 or an increase of £330.85, which is 53.21 per cent.  Compare this with the 11 per cent for the remainder of the ratepayers of the country.</P>
    <P>A further holding, not large, 82 acres, barely enough for a man to get a living and to rear his family from, has a valuation of £81.75 on land and £9.50 on buildings.  His last year's rates were £595.96 less the 25 per cent on buildings, leaving a balance of £571.02.  As a result of this measure again the total bill here will be £1,063.07 less the portion which the Government will pay on the buildings of £110.68, leaving a total bill for the occupier to pay of £952.39, an increase of £381.37 or 66.79 per cent.  I ask the Minister to compare this with the 11 per cent for the remainder of ratepayers.</P>
    <P>These are by no means the worst cases.  They are cases which I have picked at random, and indeed I go on to give an instance where benefit will be brought to land-holders and food producers in the country as a result of this measure this year.  Those are the holdings under £75 but over £60 valuation.  One such holding in County Dublin with a land valuation of £66.50 and buildings £9.50 means that the rate bill last year was £483.82 less the Government subsidy of £24.94, leaving a bill to pay £458.88. As a result of the Government abolishing the rates on private dwellings the bill this year will be £537.09 less the Government subsidy in this case of £110.68, leaving a bill to be paid of £426.41.  This farmer comes out of it quite well this time because he has a reduction of 7.08 per cent, but when the second part of this Bill is implemented and the allowance is reduced on valuations over £60 how will he fare out then?  I suppose I should make some allowance for an increase in <Col N="450" /> rates, which would be normal, because I cannot remember a year when Fianna F·il were in office when we had a reduction in rates.  At this year's figure, the amount in this case when he is affected by this Bill will be £885.41 less the Government subsidy on the dwelling of £110.68, leaving him with a total bill of £774.73.  This is an increase of £81.69, and this is again an average farm.  He has 85 acres.  He is not a large land-holder, not a rancher, but one of this large body of hardworking food-producing farmers.</P>
    <P>I believe that this increase will have to be passed on to the consumer, and there is no point in the Minister saying to me or to this House, &ldquo;He can have an allowance on income tax and we are giving him an allowance on other expenses as far as income tax is concerned&rdquo;. This is a bill that will have to be paid whether or not there is an income or profit.  You do not pay income tax unless you can show a profit.  However, it is not unusual to have a year of loss in the farming industry, and even though they might have a year of loss this section of the community will have to meet this bill. I have not seen anything about provision for an easing of payment of bills in hard years or when this section might come into a bad time because of weather or for many other reasons. Therefore it is a bill that will have to be paid and I have no doubt the farming community will be pressing their various organisations to have an increase in prices of foodstuffs in order to pay it.  Can you imagine a person earning a living on 85 acres of land, rearing a family of five or six children and having to pay an increase of 81.69 per cent on his rates?  Have we ever had an increase of this nature before in any commodity in any section?  I doubt if the Minister can give me an instance where we have an 81.69 per cent increase.  And this is not a rancher.  It is not even a person with £70 or £80 valuation.  I am speaking of a man with £66.50 land valuation who will be expected, when he is affected by this Bill, to pay an increase of 81.69 per cent.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister justify this increase, He has said to all other ratepayers, <Col N="451" />&ldquo;No more than 11 per cent&rdquo;. He can instruct other local authorities throughout the country to confine their increases to 11 per cent.  I have no doubt that this increase and the hardships it will bring are not going to be confined to the farming community, and that is why I have come into this House to speak about it.  I am greatly surprised that we have not at least an occasional voice from the Fianna F·il benches to highlight what is happening here.  I warn the Minister that when they go home to their various constituencies over the weekend and when they will mix with the people at Mass or socialising they will get the message.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell what effect this is going to have on food prices?  We are entitled to know.  I am absolutely surprised that we have had no indication from the Minister when introducing this Bill as to the effect it is going to have other than to relieve the Government of having to pay out £7.5 million, in other words the amount the Government will save.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to compare this amount with the amount of wealth tax paid to the Exchequer last year, something in the region of £8 million.  That is approximately the same figure as the Government are saving by this measure.  Assuming the farming community, and this is a fair assumption, paid half that wealth tax&mdash;and I doubt if they did because there are many other wealthy people in the country who are not food producers&mdash;are the Government now recouping on the double in rates what they lost through the wealth tax?  It is fair to assume that farmers paid no more than £3.5 million or even £3 million of the wealth tax collected last year.  Here the Government are extracting £7.5 million from farmers in lieu of the loss of the wealth tax.  If that is not a con job, then I am not an Irishman.</P>
    <P>Is it the Government's intention to extend this increase to other ratepayers, such as shopkeepers, factory owners and owners of business premises, in an effort to recoup the entire rates on domestic dwellings?  If that is so we are entitled to know.  Is this the thin end of the wedge?  Are shops, factories <Col N="452" /> and business premises in for the same treatment?  Are they to have a similar increase?  If so, I believe there will be an outcry.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that some of the farming organisations have not to this hour given their comments on this Bill. I wonder do they realise what is happening. Do they realise that an increase of over 80 per cent will be expected from the smaller food producers? If so, then it is their duty to make known the views of these people. Those who must still pay rates are being asked to pay not an 11 per cent increase but in many instances an increase of over 80 per cent, despite the impression given by Fianna F·il before the election that these people could expect some relief.  It was widely made known that these people would not have to pay rates on their buildings and dwellings.  Why were they not told that their land would have to pay the extra rates, and more?  Why were they not told that this indirect food subsidy was being removed?  There is no doubt the people have been conned.</P>
    <P>As I said, the effect of this is not going to be felt only by those directly mentioned in the Bill&mdash;those with land valuations of over £70 in the first instance and over £60 in the second instance&mdash;but it will be felt in every home because there is little doubt that the people living on these holdings will have to pass on these increases.  They must have been living in the lap of luxury to date if they can afford to pay this increase without looking for an increase for their produce.</P>
    <P>I want to make a comparison with similar holdings in the six northeastern counties.  In the case of the examples I have given of similar sized holdings the rates are from £30 to £35 to £100 to £140 and certainly no more than £150.  Their land is not rated; only the buildings are rated according to age.  I have spoken to some northern farmers with moderate holdings.  At the weekend one of these men told me that his rates bill&mdash;and he has over 200 acres of land&mdash;is only £37.  It is as low as that because he is living in an old dwelling.  If he were to build a new house his rates bill would be drastically increased, but even so it would be only <Col N="453" /> £100 to maybe £140 and certainly no more than £150.</P>
    <P>Are we not putting our farmers and food producers at a tremendous disadvantage when they are trying to compete with their neighbours across the border who have only to pay one-tenth of the rates bill here?  Is it not encouraging more smuggling of foodstuffs and livestock across the Border? I do not know what it is legal to take across the Border today or what it is necessary to smuggle, but I know a fair amount of smuggling has gone on for many years and this will increase that trade.  Consider the difference in the rates bills of two farmers living within a mile of each other on either side of the Border.  Does such a difference not put our farmers at a distinct disadvantage when they are trying to market their produce.  It would appear the Government are determined to increase that difference instead of bringing the two parts of the country into line with each other?</P>
    <P>I have given examples of people with moderate holdings but I can give an example of a larger holding of 260 acres in County Dublin with a land valuation of £240.75 and a buildings valuation of £18.  That person's rate bill last year was £1,854.34 less a Government subsidy of 25 per cent on the buildings of £46.26, leaving him with a total bill to pay of £1,807.08. Under this Bill his rates will be £3,014.44, less the entire rate on the buildings of £209.70, leaving him with a total bill of £2,804.74.  Compare this with his bill of last year of £1,807.08 and the difference is 51.25 per cent. That is going into the larger bracket, and by the figures I have given the Minister can see that the effect of the Bill will be far greater on the smaller holding than on the larger holding.  Is he now transferring the amount of money that was paid last year in wealth tax to farmers with much smaller holdings who are much less able to bear it?  With a farm of 268 acres the increase will be 51.25 per cent, that particular holding having a land valuation of £240.75, as compared with the farm of 85 acres and a valuation of £66.50.  When such a <Col N="454" /> farmer is affected by the Bill it will be 81.69 per cent.  This clearly shows that the effect will be far greater on the farmer with the smaller holding who is less able to provide for his family and to bear the cost of the increase and he will be more determined to pass on the increase to the consumer.</P>
    <P>This is my great concern.  It will not be felt immediately and will not be felt at all this year because a farmer will not be obliged to pay full rates until the end of the year.  Even then he can stand the expense for a short while.  He may not press for the increase in food prices until this time next year but it is certain that there will be an increase in food prices as a result of this measure.  Deputy Fitzpatrick made the case last week that never in the history of this House was the title of a Bill so deceptive.  It cannot even be described as an increase in rates.  It should be described as an increase in food prices or the removal of a food subsidy.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we should see so many empty benches on the other side of the House.  Two Deputies on the back benches of the Government party broke ranks last week and overlooked what they were instructed to do, that is, to stay out of this House while the Bill was going through.  I invite some of the other backbenchers to come in before the end of the debate and to let us hear what they have to say about this measure.  What about the Minister for Agriculture?  Has he anything to say about it?  Does he know that the Bill is going through the House?  Was he present at the Government meeting when the decision was made that this Bill should be introduced? What about the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy?  Has he anything to say about the removal of the food subsidy and the subsequent increase in food prices?  I would welcome a contribution from either or both of these Ministers, as well as from the Fianna F·il backbenchers.</P>
    <P>More will be said about this measure.  It will be talked about in 12 months' time and in two years' time when it will be having its full impact, not on the farming community but on the housewives when they go out shopping. They will have to pay this increase <Col N="455" /> and I am extremely disappointed that this Minister should have taken such a hand in conning the people.  I should like him to tell us, when replying to the debate, if it is the intention to extend this to shopkeepers, to the factories and to commercial buildings. I have a suspicion that there is another Bill on the way to recoup the loss of the rates.  Rates are not abolished; they are being paid by the Government and not by the occupiers of domestic dwellings and the effect of this has been to throw the Custom House into a state of dire confusion.  I would go so far as to say that because of the slowness in the transfer of money from central funds to local authorities many jobs are now threatened.  The sum of £1.6 million has been paid to Dublin County Council in lieu of domestic rates.  That is about one-tenth of the bill for the entire year.  That has been paid in almost three-and-a-half months, going well into the fourth month.  If that is the treatment local authorities are to be given I am afraid jobs will be in jeopardy because local authorities will not be able to carry out their programmes.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister has taken heed of what was said here last week and what will be said today, but a little weight might be added to the debate if we could have an occasional Fianna F·il contribution.  As the debate proceeds, I will be watching eagerly to see if we would get a contribution from the Fianna F·il benches.  I suppose the Minister is having good sport and that the instruction has been: &ldquo;Do not show your face on this Bill.&rdquo;  That is denying half of this House the democratic right to speak.  It is a backward step for any party to put such a muzzle on its members and I hope some members will rebel against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt the Minister tried to slide this Bill through the D·il.  The explanatory memorandum is brief, as was the Minister's introductory speech.  The Bill itself is a short one which one might not regard as being very important. It is a Bill which will bear heavily on farmers not only large <Col N="456" /> farmers but all viable farmers as defined by the Land Commission.  Next year it will affect all farms with valuations of more than £60.</P>
      <P>We have been told that the saving this year will be £7 million while the valuation threshold is at £75, and in my estimation the saving next year, when the £60 valuation threshold will apply, will be something like £27 million.  That is a heavier sledge hammer on farmers than even the new income tax policy which increases the multiplier to 90 and reduces the threshold to £75.  The new form of taxation which this Bill represents must be paid by farmers whether they are earning a profit or not and therefore the Bill is a harsher taxation measure than the new system of farm income tax.</P>
      <P>I doubt if farming interests yet realise that this is a Bill with such savage effects.  If the threshold is to be reduced further in future legislation, say to £50 or even £40 valuations, we will be going very far backwards in relation to taxation policy on farmers. As a means of taxation, rates have been condemned by Fine Gael but never by Fianna F·il who not so many years ago issued a White Paper suggesting that rates could not be abolished.  At that time a couple of elections ago, I remember Deputy Gerry Collins was embarrassed in Limerick when his war lords in Dublin did a somersault.</P>
      <P>This time, they decided to abolish rates on domestic dwellings, and of course that went a long way towards winning them the last general election. However, the cost of that election victory remains to be gauged.  The last budget permitted a deficit of £400 million on capital account and there is a danger that this will run the country into financial ruin, because it must be paid for.  Coming towards the end of Fianna F·il's first year in office the coffers are bare and next year or the year after the gallop will be stopped because the finance masters in Europe will put a stop to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is one of a series of measures introduced to try to remedy the deficit situation.  If ever there was a misnomer it is &ldquo;The Rates on <Col N="457" /> Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1977&rdquo; because this Bill imposes extra taxation on medium type farmers and perhaps next year on small farmers.  VAT is being imposed on livestock sales, food subsidies have been withdrawn and the ban on heifers going into intervention has been announced.  They are all forms of taxation on farmers.  The withdrawal of heifers from intervention at a time when it is too late to put them in calf means that farmers will not have a guaranteed outlet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely listing them as a series of taxation measures affecting farmers.  I will not expand on that.  In relation to agriculture generally, with the change of Government it is astonishing how substantially the attitude to farmers has changed, this Bill being a perfect example of that.  Deputy Clinton, while Minister for Agriculture, brought farmers through a prosperous period from 1973 to 1977.  It is peculiar that the new Minister, Deputy Gibbons, is not cutting any ice in Brussels.  He is not getting the same increases and has not the same strong voice as the former Minister.  A series of legislative measures and actions by the Government have hit the farmers since Fianna F·il came into office.  There is no doubt that there will not be an increase in prosperity in the farming community in the years ahead.  That is evident when you consider the price increases for this year under the common agricultural policy.  The outlook for farmers is not good because we have a weak Minister in Brussels and a Government that are prepared to beg, borrow and steal taxation from any quarter because they are short of money, and at present the sledgehammer has fallen on the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the overall situation, it is a pity that there is not an agreed taxation policy for the farming community. It was a mistake that the farming organisations did not meet with previous Ministers for the purpose of setting out an overall strategy for taxing the farming community, a <Col N="458" /> strategy which would be understood by all and acceptable to the farmers themselves who freely admit that they should pay their fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>In relation to this legislation, I thought that the move to tax farmers' incomes would lead to the gradual abolition of rates on agricultural land, which is the system in England.  The Taoiseach himself spoke in that vein on 4 April 1974.  Deputy Fitzpatrick from Cavan, Fine Gael spokesman on this Bill, quoted him correctly in his speech and I have no wish to repeat it, but the Taoiseach did speak in this way on 4 April 1974.  It is this double talk which will eventually lead Fianna F·il into trouble and I believe they are already in trouble this year, which is only the first of four years.</P>
    <P>The Government said that the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings would not be recouped by the imposition of, or by an increase in, rates on other types of property.  That was the clear statement of the Minister when the question was raised of striking the rate for the current year.  The Minister and the Government are going back on their word in that respect because in this Bill they are increasing the rates on agricultural land on medium-size farms.  This is another piece of duplicity when one considers the way in which Fianna F·il operate.  I remember the position the Minister took during the debate before the striking of the last rate.  This Bill negates the Minister's position in relation to the abolition of domestic rates and his clear undertaking that the loss of revenue from domestic rates would not be recouped by other increases in rates.</P>
    <P>How much will the implementation of the proposals in this Bill cost the farmer?  There will be no relief for farmers once they reach the threshold and I hope they understand that. Previously where there was a relief of rates up to the threshold and a farmer with a £60 valuation, at a rate of £11 in the £, would have been paying £331, taking into account the reliefs.  That is now being increased to £660, a doubling of the rates bill.  One could say that the farmers will be paying double rates from next year if they have a valuation of £60 or more, irrespective <Col N="459" /> of whether they earn profits.  Even though I understand that the rates are deductible in part-payment of the income tax liability, nevertheless there are many farmers with £60 valuations who, because of their personal allowances, allowable expenses and so on, will not be subject to income tax Fianna F·il are getting around the situation by saying: &ldquo;We do not mind if you do not pay income tax because you can still pay your rates; we will still get money out of you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The farming community have gone through the last four years in better shape than many industries and I believe that the farmers should pay their fair share of taxation.  The way in which Fianna F·il are going about getting money from the farmers is by the use of what is accepted as regressive taxation.  A rates bill has always been considered a regressive taxation policy.  It has been condemned on a number of occasion as being bad policy and is an instrument which cannot be used equitably to levy taxation, yet Fianna F·il are using it.  There is no doubt in my mind that the reason for this Bill and the other recent impositions on farmers is that the Government have run out of money and will take every measure possible to get money from everybody.  They are going after the farming community who, as has often been said, are the backbone of the country.  Their contribution to the export drive must be fully acknowledged.  Their contribution towards increasing agricultural based industry is vital to our prosperity and to employment.</P>
    <P>It is important that we evolve a fair system of taxation and that we allow every possible incentive to farmers to increase their investment and their production and also to avail of the many markets abroad for suitable commodities which they produce.  This Bill, as well as the other impositions on farmers' incomes, which Fianna F·il have levied in the past few months, is a retrograde step.  There is no overall policy in relation to the taxation of the agricultural community. It is surely time for the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach to <Col N="460" /> sit around the table with representatives of the agricultural bodies and hammer out an overall taxation policy. Any industry will not expand and will not feel secure unless it knows the direction in which it is going in the short term and in relation to what type of taxation policy it will meet in the near future.</P>
    <P>The three-year accounts period which the Government introduced in the budget has been unsettling for farmers because they do not know where they are going unless they know exactly the level of taxation in the three-year period.  That was a serious omission in the budget.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this Bill and I ask the Government to meet the farmers, sit down and establish an overall strategy in relation to the taxation of the farming community.  A taxation policy should be established which is fair and allows expansion and above all allows confidence in the agricultural community in relation to its future.</P>
    <P>The Bill is another step on the way to completely shattering the confidence of farmers in the Government and to completely shattering their confidence with regard to what will in effect be their net disposable income in the future.  This Bill should be condemned because it is using the rates system again.  It is regressive and it will now hit small farmers and medium-type farmers irrespective of their profits.  It is bad strategy in relation to taxation and I condemn it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like Members on this side of the House, wish to raise my voice in objection to the introduction of this Bill.  Its very title is misleading. It is a complete misnomer to entitle this Bill Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill; 1978.  That title is dishonest. We have heard of poetic licence but this is carrying parliamentary licence to a ridiculous degree. More suitable titles for this Bill would be The Non-Abatement of Rates on Agricultural Land Bill, 1978, Rates on Agricultural Land (Extension) Bill, 1978 or Rates on Agricultural Land (Imposition) Bill, 1978.  Any of the titles I have mentioned would be more honest titles for this Bill.</P>

      <Col N="461" /> I would like, so that the Minister may be fully aware of the feelings of farmers, particularly the farming community and the agricultural community of South Tipperary whom I represent, to bring home to him the true feelings of these people.  I object vehemently to the introduction of this Bill.  The Minister should be under no illusion about how this Bill has been received in South Tipperary.  Quite a number of the farming community at the moment are not fully aware of its implications.  Some of those who are aware of its implications have told me that it is completely unacceptable to them.</P>
    <P>There was no mention at all in the manifesto document of this increase in rates.  The South Tipperary farmers were led to believe that when Fianna F·il came into office all their tax problems and all their rating problems would come to an end and they were about to enter into a utopia, a Tir na n”g.  This Bill is one of the many pieces of legislation which has shattered that illusion.  The farmers in South Tipperary are wide awake and fully realise they have been sold down the river by the Fianna F·il Government.</P>
    <P>This Bill affects 1,009 farmers in South Tipperary.  That is the number of agricultural holdings of £75 valuation and over.  Next year, with lowering the valuation to £60, a further 400 farmers will be involved.  That makes a total of approximately 1,409 farmers in South Tipperary who are affected by this Bill.  They are expected this year to pay £471,000 to the Exchequer. That averages at approximately £470 per farmer, which is very near to the national average of £466, being levied on every one of the 15,000 who are involved in this.</P>
    <P>The farmers in South Tipperary believe that this extra £470 each is their contribution to the abolition of wealth tax.  I had sympathy for some of the farmers who had to pay wealth tax but I had no sympathy for those who deserted the country when they were asked to make a small contribution to the national coffers by way of wealth tax.  They went away to sunny climates and when the coast is clear, <Col N="462" /> having no doubt made adequate contributions to the Fianna F·il funds for the abolition of wealth tax, they now return to bask in the Irish sunshine having for the last few years basked in the Mediterranean sunshine.</P>
    <P>The imposition in this Bill lies very heavily on areas in South Tipperary where the land is very highly rated.  A farmer need only have approximately 30 Irish acres to be caught under this Bill.  The land in certain areas is rated at £2.50 per Irish acre and a farmer with a small holding of 30 Irish acres will now be asked to pay £728.25 this year in rates.  Next year, with the expected increase of 11 per cent, he will be asked to pay an extra 11 per cent on top of that figure.  This system is based on the land valuation system. The Minister must surely be aware, as all the farming organisations are aware, that this system of rateable valuation is unjust.  The Minister and his advisers, rather than introducing this system further into our rating code, should be looking at a way to remove it completely from the statute book.</P>
    <P>Those with £75 valuation are being asked to pay approximately £315 extra each.  Those with £100 valuation in South Tipperary will be asked to pay £387 more this year.  These are not big farms.  Perhaps in certain areas where the rateable valuation is very low these would be sizeable farms, but not in South Tipperary, where the rateable valuation per acre is about £2.50 per acre.  Farmers are expected to pay this increase while the Minister for Agriculture is negotiating for a 2 per cent increase for farmers, and the industrial workers have been granted an 8 per cent increase.  This 2 per cent increase will be swallowed up immediately by increased costs.  Our Minister is negotiating for a 2 per cent and another Minister is extracting £7 million from the farmers.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a further instance of the anti-farm legislation that has been introduced by Fianna F·il since they took office.  In the budget there was an announcement that the thresholds would be lowered for income tax purposes this year from £75 to £60, that the multiplier system would be increased from the existing 65 to 90 and that the farmers who wanted the multiplier <Col N="463" /> system would have to opt for a three-year period.  Since this Government took office the consumer subsidy on cheese was removed consequently increasing the cost of cheese by 10p per lb.  This affects the farming community indirectly as people are being discouraged from buying cheese.  A further anti-farming piece of legislation was introduced in the VAT Amendment Bill, 1977.</P>

      <P>We are only discussing rates on agricultural land in this Bill.  We cannot go over the whole field of farming.  The Deputy will get an opportunity for that on the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be in conflict with the Chair.  I am only bringing to the Minister's notice the anti-farming legislation that has been introduced since they took office.  I am concerned at the ability of farmers to pay their rates and I am outlining these details, so that when the Minister is replying he may amend this legislation taking into account the anti-farming legislation that has already been introduced.  I am fearful that with the 2 per cent increase being sought by our Minister they will not be in a position to pay this increased demand.  There is also the 10 per cent VAT on AI services and agricultural contractors whose earnings are over £1,800.  There is also a 10 per cent VAT on admission to agricultural shows and fairs.  To the farming community this is a further extension of anti-farming legislation.  As a Deputy representing a strong agricultural community in South Tipperary it is my duty to bring these facts to the attention of the Minister so that if we are not successful in bringing improvements into this Bill the Minister and his Cabinet may be deterred from introducing further legislation to take money out of the farmers' pockets. This money is badly needed for the development of farms.  The fertiliser subsidy was also withdrawn.  This takes £4 million that could be put effectively into land and buildings from the farmer's pocket.  The withdrawal of this subsidy means that <Col N="464" /> small farmers will have to pay a minimum of £30 extra this year for fertiliser and the larger farmers will have to pay something in the region of £300 extra and this is at a time when the phosphate usage of fertiliser is only at about one-third of the desired level.</P>
      <P>The imposition of these rates had been successfully resisted by the National Coalition when in office.  I was told that the Department officials trotted out this Bill annually to the then Minister but he in his wisdom resisted it, because he saw the value of these concessions to the agricultural community.  It is amazing that the present Minister should willingly accept this system.  It is too simple and facile a way to collect £7 million from the farmers; there are no forms to be filled in, no accounts to be kept, and no multiplier system.  The Minister, perhaps with the prodding of the Minister for Finance, has acquiesced at last to the demands of his officials in his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <P>The Deputy should not introduce the officials.  The Minister is completely responsible for the decisions of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister has advisors who advise him.  The Minister has accepted the advice of his advisors and has imposed this further taxation on the farming community. The Minister in his speech said that the only change from the existing arrangements was that farmers whose land had a valuation which equalled or exceeded income tax thresholds for full-time farmers would no longer benefit from the rates relief on agricultural land.  By implication the Minister stated that the taking of £7 million, the further involvement of 15,000 farmers in this Bill is a small change, a casual approach to the taking of this £7 million.  The Minister stated that the rates can be accepted as a first instalment of income tax.  In a lot of cases that is true but not in all.  I know of farmers in South Tipperary with small acreages of perhaps 30 acres who would not be liable for income taxation, so they cannot avail <Col N="465" /> of this as a first instalment of income tax.  Now they have to pay £728 this year, an increase of £351 on what they paid last year.  To them this is of no benefit.  The Minister also stated that the rates on dwelling houses and out-offices have been removed.  That is in common with the urban dwellers but as the Minister knows the rates on the dwelling houses and out-offices were a very small fraction of the overall rates. I urge the Minister, before replying, to have further consultations with his advisors, and in view of the importance of agriculture to the economy they should come up with a more enlightened and original approach to the taxation of farmers.  The farmers have accepted the principle of taxation. They are prepared to pay their fair share of the tax bill, but they always stressed that anything based on rates is inequitable.  Surely the poor law valuation system should be systematically phased out rather than be incorporated into the system, ensuring that in ensuing years no attempt will be made to abolish rates completely. The Minister has allowed a sliding rule in the income tax system especially for those farmers with holdings of over £75 valuation.  Perhaps the Minister could ensure that farmers with a valuation of, say, between £75 and £100 would not be liable to full rates on this occasion but rather be dealt with on a sliding scale.  Perhaps farmers with valuations of, say, £100, £90, £85 or £80 would pay one-tenth, two-tenths, three-tenths or whatever is the proper apportionment under the income tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is totally unacceptable to the farming community who are sorely disappointed that, since the present Government assumed office, one repressive Bill after another, particularly in relation to the farming community, has been introduced.  They are disenchanted and disillusioned.  I have no doubt but that when the new rates demand notes are issued they will give good voice to their objections.  Perhaps the Minister might yet save the day if, in his reply, he would state that he is allowing some concession particularly to smaller farmers.  In certain parts of the country a holding valuation of £75 denotes that <Col N="466" /> a farmer has quite an extensive holding but, as I have pointed out in certain areas of south Tipperary, where land valuation is approximately £2.50 per Irish acre, a person there with a small holding of 30 Irish acres is immediately liable and, next year when it will be reduced further to £60, 400 farmers with yet smaller holdings still in Tipperary will be caught.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Bill.  It does nothing to encourage the farming community to plough back moneys into their land, to develop further, especially in a year when, according to the Minister for Agriculture, the farming community will receive a meagre increase of 2 per cent for their produce. One might add that the increases were always limited but the former Minister, Deputy Clinton, never accepted the limitations placed by Europe and went out and fought for higher ones.  I would urge the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;in an effort to enable Irish farmers to meet the increased costs incorporated in this Bill &mdash;to fight for higher increases, something in the region of 8 per cent to 10 per cent which were fought for and obtained by his illustrious predecessor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not surprised at the introduction of this Bill, one to raise further taxation amounting to £7 million.  We all know the Government need extra funds for certain reliefs given, very beneficial reliefs to certain sections of the community and the wherewithal to replace these funds must be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the face of it one might think this was a Bill that would pass through the House in a matter of minutes but this party have taken the right line in prolonging the debate on it to show that it is retrograde legislation.  My main concern is that it is the first retrograde step regarding the rating system of this century.  I shall not deal with the inequities and so on of the rating system; they are well known.  I am disappointed that it appears that the only time Fianna F·il are concerned about rates, in bringing about an equitable rating system or, as I would hope to see implemented in the not too distant future, the cessation of the rating system and the provision of a proper local <Col N="467" /> tax structure, is at election time.  As was mentioned in the debate last week, in 1971 we got the true concept of Fianna F·il thinking on the rating system when a report was commissioned which reported to the Government of the time that the rating system must be retained and that, in the foreseeable future, no changes could be envisaged in the system.  The Government adopted that report, took it to their hearts.  They said: &ldquo;This is what must happen and we will give it our full blessing;&rdquo; in other words, that rates must continue on the scale that had obtained up to that time.</P>
    <P>There was a local government election in 1973 when we got the first real breath of fresh air as regards a change in the rating system proposed by the Coalition side of the House, when they promised that, if returned to office, certain changes would be implemented.  These changes were introduced and, as a result, have benefited the people liable to rates to a great extent over the past number of years.  During their election campaign Fianna F·il realised that the people who had been forgotten about&mdash;that is the people who paid rates whether they were in cottages, were industrialists or living in mansions&mdash;felt very strongly about them.  Before the end of that election campaign they changed their tune and actually upped the action proposed by the Coalition and proposed that all rates be taken off private housing.  As we know, they were not elected on that promise but they had to carry this promise through to the last election.  Fair play: they made the promise again and, on being elected, carried out their promise of taking rates off private dwellings.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that, having been given the lead in thinking as regards the rating system we might have some progressive thinking on the situation henceforth.  But here we are taking a step backwards&mdash;in other words, we are taking relief from people who benefited heretofore.  The Government may be trying to placate urban dwellers. They will get £7 million from farmers with valuations of £75 and, while that may antagonise the <Col N="468" /> farmers, the urban dwellers will be quite happy.  That is not the kind of thinking in good Government.  The whole rating system should be given serious consideration with a view to devising as soon as possible an equitable system.  Any step taken now should be a step in that direction and not this retrograde step.  I appeal to the Minister to amend the Bill if he is not prepared to withdraw it.  If he does not amend it the result will be moving backwards in our taxation system.</P>
    <P>It is argued that these rates will represent income tax and this is a concession that only the farming community will enjoy.  Why did the Minister introduce the Bill if the purpose is not to collect increased taxation?  It is the farmer who will be hit, not the business man, the professional man or the industrialist.  The farmer who is making a profit will get the allowance but the farmer who is not making a profit will pay the full rate. How can a man who is not making a profit meet such a payment?  This Bill will double the charge on the £75 valuation farmer.  That will mean an increase of about £400 in rates.  The person least able to pay will be asked to double his contribution.  Would it be possible to carry forward the liability into succeeding years because the farmer will not get the benefit in the year in question if he does not make a profit?  It is only right that he should be allowed to carry forward against future income tax payments.</P>
    <P>It is disheartening to see a Bill of this nature introduced here.  The thinking of the Government seems to be that they must get more money to bolster up the Exchequer.  What will they look at next?  This is&mdash;it must be &mdash;of great concern to all.  Industrialists and the business man who improves his premises can seek a revaluation but the farmer is not in that position. Those who make a profit and those who can spend their money on luxuries should carry the burden.  We should not tax the primary producers.  It is essential that the £75 valuation farmer should become more efficient to enable him to compete with his counterparts in the EEC and elsewhere.  Australia <Col N="469" /> and New Zealand have very progressive farmers who are looking for markets in the EEC.  We do not want these markets opened up to them.  They had these markets in the past and they could get them again.  The danger is we might not be able to compete.</P>
    <P>I understand that farmers in other EEC countries do not pay rates.  Not alone have our farmers to pay rates yet the system is being extended.  I am disappointed that no Government Deputies have seen fit to speak on this Bill.  It will certainly affect farmers in the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency. Next year the figure will be reduced to £60 valuation and the possibility is that at some time in the future the allowances will be removed completely by the present Government because the members of that Government have no conscience and no proper concept with regard to rates.  We must warn the people about their long-term objective because they are certainly taking a backward step here.</P>
    <P>The people should be warned.  The smallest farmer will have to pay a high rate charge by the end of the term of office of this Government.  In certain parts of County Kilkenny a man with a farm of ten or 15 acres may have a valuation of £20 and if this allowance is taken from him he may be required to pay £200 in rates.  That is not equitable but it is a prospect that faces such a farmer in the coming years.  The rate charge will increase each year because the Government have no intention of changing or improving the system. This is a retrograde measure and it will put a brake on all sectors of the economy, commercial, business and farming.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we encourage the farming community in particular to produce more goods.  In my county we have the Avonmore Creameries, a large food processing factory and they are continually requesting increased supplies.  This Bill is just the tip of the iceberg.  It has been introduced by the Government in their first year of office but what will they introduce in the next four or five years?  This Government have a majority of 24 and they will run their full term of office.  They will bring in whatever legislation they <Col N="470" /> wish irrespective of the views of any section of the community.</P>
    <P>With regard to the food processing situation, Avonmore produce butter and cheese.  The Government recently removed the subsidy from cheese&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting away from the Bill before the House.  We cannot discuss the food processing industry on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  The Government are not helping the food processing industry.  Avonmore Creameries require all the support they can get. Recently they have gone into the cheese business and the drastic increase of 10p will not help the sale of that product.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to get £7 million for the Exchequer.  In his reply perhaps the Minister will state clearly why the Bill was introduced.  He should tell the House why people will have to pay extra money.  I do not think he can state it is an allowable charge for income tax.  During the election campaign when Fianna F·il speakers announced that rates would not be charged on private houses, on the houses of the farming community and on outbuildings, they stated that no other rating system would be brought in to replace the existing scheme.  We can fairly say that Fianna F·il have reneged on that promise. That is another reason why the Minister should have second thoughts about this Bill and withdraw it.  The Minister should engage in constructive thinking on the rating system.  I think he would like to do that.  I know he is in charge of a large Department and he may be overburdened with work, but I would commend him to study the rating system.  I do not say he can change the whole system overnight but he could bring about some major changes in the method of raising rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man who does not make a profit is the person who will be hit by this Bill because he will not be able to offset his charges against any other item.  The person who makes a profit and who puts his money into improving a large house will have the <Col N="471" /> advantage of not having to pay any rates on his investment but the man who re-invests his money in the productive end of his farming enterprise and who gets an allowance for his investment against his income tax will not get any benefit from this Bill.  In fact, he will come out at the worst end of it.</P>
    <P>This is a mini-budget.  In fact, we have had a mini-budget every second week since Fianna F·il took office.  The fertiliser subsidy was removed, putting another £7 million into the Exchequer. The subsidy on cheese was removed. That will have a more drastic effect than the amount of money actually involved because it will hit the industry and it will hit employment.  It is very relevant to this Bill because employment, especially youth employment, is one of the top priorities here and in many other countries.  It is being given more thought than any other aspect of living.  We are all aware about how concerned the Minister for Labour is about the problem.  The Minister for the Environment should have discussions with that Minister in connection with this Bill which is a disincentive to those engaged in the food processing industry anxious to create jobs.  Our share of the British food processing market has been reduced drastically and this Bill will not help that situation.  We should do everything possible to create more jobs. One way of doing that is to give reliefs in rates to those who employ extra people.  There is not much point in giving such people a miserly sum, as was done some years ago.  The Minister for Agriculture has not helped the situation by debarring heifers from intervention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting away from the Bill again.  I have given the Deputy a lot of latitude but he should remember that the Bill deals with agricultural rates only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that I have strayed from the Bill but it is important that I stress the other implications involved.  The thinking behind the Bill is wrong, it is a backward step <Col N="472" /> when we should be going forward.  I want to assure the Minister that we will give him every support for any change he wishes to make in the Bill if it is forward looking as far as rates are concerned.  The Minister has got off to a bad start with regard to rates. He should drastically amend the Bill. We are now getting a mini-budget every second week as far as the agricultural community are concerned and that does not surprise me because the money must be found somewhere. However, the Government should not take retrograde steps in their efforts to get that money.  We are anxious that the farming community produce more to help our economy but the Government are compelling them to pay more in rates.  I cannot understand why the weak person should be the one to bear this extra burden.  I cannot understand why the rates should be doubled on the person who does not make a profit and I do not think anybody can give an explanation for that move.</P>
      <P>Many small shopkeepers spend sleepless nights before the rate collector calls because they are not in a position to pay him.  Rates are also a major worry for small business concerns and small industries because they wonder if it will be their turn next.  The Government should carry on the thinking of the National Coalition who gave a lead in this regard. Small shopkeepers are under enough pressure from big organisations who are in a position to buy in bulk without having to face the problem of rates.  The Government make the rules and they should not be putting pressure on small shopkeepers. Nobody, including the farmers, object to paying a fair share towards the cost of running the State, but those who do not make a profit should not be asked to pay such taxes as rates.  A lot of criticism has been levelled at farmers and farming organisations recently. Those organisations accept that farmers should pay their fair share. Farmers are happy to pay out of their profits but I agree with them when they contend that they should not have to pay if they do not make a profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the election campaign the Fianna F·il canvassers, from the <Col N="473" /> Taoiseach down, gave the impression that if they were returned to office taxation on the farming community would be drastically reduced.  It does not appear like that now because taxation is being increased every week. The farming community were misled by Fianna F·il during the election campaign.  Fianna F·il for many years now have spoken against the rating system and some members suggested that because 50 per cent of the production of farmers was exported they should be given the same concessions as industrial exporters with regard to rates.</P>
    <P>The Government have made an about turn from that type of thinking. I wonder if they have studied this Bill.  Do they know what it is about? Or, are they only concerned in misleading certain sections of the community so as to get themselves back into office?  This is the impression we get on this side of the House.  I hope this is not their thinking, that we shall see progressive thinking and that we shall have amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to make a few comments on the Bill because I am amazed that neither the farmers who will be affected by it nor the organisations that normally concern themselves with the welfare of farmers and farming seem yet to be alert to what is happening or understand the purpose of the Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is simply to extract a further £7 million from the farmers&mdash;an extra £25 million when we count up the various subsidies that have been removed by the Government that went out at election time and dangled these carrots in front of the farmers.  There was to be no more taxation; they would have all the subsidies in the world and all sorts of new schemes.  This is one of the Bills being brought in to recover the cost of the carrots dangled before the farmers in the election campaign to secure their votes by false pretences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment explains the purpose of the Bill here and tells us he had to bring it in because the legislation providing relief of rates for farmers had run out last <Col N="474" /> December: he had to rush to their assistance with this legislation.  But that is not the purpose and I am surprised that the Minister wanted to pretend that it was: its purpose is to get easy money and the Department of Finance, better than any other Department, know how to get easy money. This requires no collection; you have only to put out your claw and pull in the money.  That is why it is being done, not because it is an equitable or just tax&mdash;it is neither one nor the other and the Minister knows that.  In the case of farmers affected by it, it simply pushes up their rates anything from 65 per cent to 80 per cent.  Next year the figure will be higher and will cover more farmers; that had to be specified in the course of explaining the contents of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Why do we do these things?  Why do we take money from where it is easiest to take it?  The Minister knows better than most people that the valuations on which he is working are 200 years old and bear no relationship to the present value of land.  Those who will pay the extra £7 million are greatly over-valued, people with large families or commitments and who normally would not pay income tax and therefore are not in a position to claw anything back.  The Minister knows that and I can understand his shame in being forced to come in here by the Minister for Finance and by the Government who never cared about the farmers.  They pretended to care, and they did care for the few weeks of the election campaign, but immediately it was over and they had secured support they came back with legislation eroding any benefits and aids that had been left to agriculture.</P>
    <P>Since we joined the EEC a great effort was made in Europe to get an exact assessment of the aids to agriculture in the various countries for the purpose of either abolishing national aids altogether or putting them on level terms.  They got all that information; they extracted it assiduously from us.  But the action taken was nil and the present Minister does not seem to be doing anything about it.  It was discovered that the Germans had five times as much national aid as we <Col N="475" /> had and in the circumstances where a member state had five times more than we had we continued to erode these benefits here and we continue to pretend that it is due to EEC pressure. It is nothing of the sort because the pressure should be exerted where the national aid is so much higher.  This is merely an easy opportunity to extract more money from farmers and from a section that very often is not in a position to pay or should not be asked to pay because of the circumstances there.  Personally, while I had some responsibility for this sort of thing, I was concerned about valuation and the unfair and inequitable aspects of it.  I spoke to those responsible for evaluating soil and assessing the ability of certain land areas to produce certain crops and achieve certain production. I asked them how far they had got with the task of land assessment. They said that if they got 80 people for five years they would be able to complete the work and to provide an up-to-date and proper valuation for our land.  That is what the Government should be thinking about. They talk of providing employment; there is an opportunity to employ 80 or 100 people and get an equitable valuation.  They should not be bringing in legislation to rob people who should not be robbed in advance of having this proper valuation.</P>
    <P>I am appalled that this legislation means, for a certain number of people who will be required to pay it, an increase of 65 per cent to 80 per cent in their rates.  Next year it will be a 65 per cent to 90 per cent increase. Across the Border there are no rates on agricultural land.</P>
    <P>No less a person than the Taoiseach seriously says that we have reached a point where serious consideration should be given to total de-rating.  If we had total de-rating everybody would know who was paying a fair share of tax but we have this mix of tax and rates that is always wrong and particularly wrong where it is based on a situation where the poor law valuation is more than 200 years old and where so much land improvement and reclamation have changed the entire <Col N="476" /> scene.  The whole basis for the calculations then made is now completely different.  Yet, the legislation has been rushed in.  I do not know why there was this haste.  There is no reasonable explanation for it but it is an easy way of extracting an additional £7 million from the farmers. That makes a total additional £25 million now being taken from farming by the present Government.</P>
    <P>I took part in programmes prior to the election with the Minister for Agriculture and I saw the performance. No other impression was given than that all the taxes we were proposing to shower on the backs of the farmers were going to be removed and that in future farmers would look confidently forward to more subsidies, more assistance and less taxation.  We see now what they are getting.  Deputy Crotty rightly spoke of the adverse effect of measures of this kind on farming confidence.  We got an example of this in 1974 when farmer confidence dropped because of the oversupply of cattle and beef in Europe, and it was very difficult to restore.  I know what is going to happen to farmer confidence if we go on eroding unnecessarily and wrongly what remains for Irish farmers.  I cannot understand why there has been little or no reference to this in the media.  I searched the <i>Farmer's Journal</i> over the weekend and there was absolutely no reference to it.  The <i>Farmer's Journal</i> normally can see a cloud arising miles away.  I searched last Saturday's <i>Irish Independent</i> and I came to the conclusion that &ldquo;The Drover&rdquo; must have lost his way in the mist on the hill.  There was no reference there either, and normally everybody is fleeced when anything like this is happening.  They are not yet aware of what this Bill is all about, but the time is fast arriving when they will be in no doubt about what is happening.  When the rate collector sends out his demand notices they will start to talk and then it will be late.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crotty expressed the hope that the Minister on Committee Stage would amend this Bill drastically.  He will not.  He will not be allowed to amend it because the purpose of it is <Col N="477" /> simply and solely to get the £7 million in a crude, easy way, but not a just or equitable way.  The people who are going to suffer are people with large families and large borrowings, people who are not in a position to pay income tax but who happen to have this type of valuation through one accident or another.  There is nothing equitable about this.  It is unjust and undesirable legislation which is going to have nothing but adverse effects on farming and the agricultural industry generally.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that it is the Minister for the Environment who has to come in here to do this to the farmers.  He is doing it because he is forced to do it, not because he likes doing it or because he believes it is just, honest and equitable.  He is simply the Minister who happens to be in that seat at the time and he is forced to do it.  I know the way the Department of Finance think when they are looking for money and I am told they are cutting their throats for money at present.  I am assured by everybody I meet that the Government are running out of money even though they have borrowed in excess of £800 million in the present year.  I hope that is not true and that we will see more jobs before it happens.  The one sector which more than any other is in a position to provide jobs is the sector processing agricultural raw materials.  They cannot process those raw materials unless they are produced and you will not get the production unless you have farming confidence.</P>
    <P>I came in just to take the cloak off this Bill and to alert people to what it is all about.  It is an easy £7 million for the Government which is being got from people who should not be paying it.  Nobody knows that better than the Minister.  I would like what Deputy Crotty was asking him to do would happen, but I know too well it will not: the Minister will not be allowed to do it.  I hope that this will get the adverse publicity it deserves. The quickest way to arrive at reasonable land valuations, if we are going to have rates at all, is to provide the institute with 80 or 100 people for five years and get a right valuation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> However, in the long term we should not be basing it on this type of thing at all.  Land should not be taxed on its quality.  There should be complete derating and a fair taxation system. Farmers have said on many occasions, as I have also, that they should pay their fair share of tax. They have said they are prepared to pay their fair share of it.  The only way to decide what is a fair share is to remove the enormous bill of rates, which is not based on equity or justice or on the ability of the farmer to pay. It is based on quality of land which has not been properly assessed or which was assessed over 200 years ago.</P>
    <P>I regret that I have to come in here to criticise this because I know that money must be secured.  If a Government are to provide the services necessary for a country they must get money.  They must get it fairly.  All the people who are in a position to pay must be asked to pay.  But the money should not be got in this crude and inequitable fashion.  All of us who are public representatives have a responsibility to come in and present the case as it is and not to allow it to be glossed over and cloaked.  It is supposed to be a necessary continuation of legislation in order to provide continued relief for farmers.  This is a great deception, and unfortunately the media have not really awakened to the deception.  The farming organisations and papers have not wakened up to it, but they will when the demand note arrives from the rate collector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak on this important Bill entitled Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1978.  It is an interesting Bill, but I think the title is wrong.  This Bill should be entitled The Removal of Relief of Rates on Agricultural Land Bill, 1978.  Basically what is happening in this Bill is that the farmers are losing £7 million of the relief which has already been applied to agricultural land.  It is sad to see this relief being removed.  The farming community were entitled to expect and anticipate that they would have been allowed to retain this £7 million.  There is now an additional £7 million being <Col N="479" /> paid in rates by the farming community. At present farmers who have a valuation of over £75 are going to get no rates relief whatsoever and it is intended then to reduce that to £60 next year.  I ask the Minister of State who is present to bear in mind, that farmers now being affected by this do not qualify under two headings for most important benefits which every other member of the farming community and almost the entire population are entitled to.</P>
      <P>They are, first, higher education grants and, second, benefits under the Health Acts.  If people whose rateable valuation exceeds £60 apply to their county councils or the Department of Education for a higher education grant they do not get it, irrespective of how many there are in the family, if the father is ill, and so on.  That is a very important point.</P>
      <P>Similarly, farmers whose valuations which date back to the Griffith valuation, which is more than 100 years old, do not qualify for benefits under the Health Acts.  Under the Health Contribution Acts a farmer cannot contribute towards the local health boards.  If any member of his family goes into hospital that member does not qualify for benefits and the farmer must pay the full account.</P>
      <P>We are assessing people for rates under this antiquated system.  I spoke to a number of farmers about this. They are worried that they have to meet this additional charge because under this arbitrary system we are chopping down at a certain point in valuations and saying &ldquo;You qualify for absolutely nothing&rdquo;.  That is an amazing situation.  I would like to hear of any other section in the community who are completely removed from every benefit being given by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see, the only thing for which they qualify is children's allowances where there is no means test.  Because they have a valuation of over £60 those farmers do not qualify for anything else.  Farmers must be very strong to overcome these obstacles.  I know farmers with very large families whose valuation is just <Col N="480" /> over the £60 limit and they are very upset because they do not qualify for the higher education grant.  This additional burden is now being levied on them and they have no way of appealing against it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government seriously to consider what they are doing under this Bill.  Our farming community may get the idea that everybody is against them, that their rights are not being considered in conjunction with the rights of everybody else, or that a situation is arising where their rights are not being taken into account.  If that should occur, there could be a grave situation in this country.</P>
    <P>All the leaders of farming organisations have admitted that progress has been made in agriculture.  They have stated that they are happy that this is so and that the standard of living of the farming community has improved. Their honest statements should not be taken as an admission that they are giving the Government a blank cheque to extract money, willy-nilly, from them.  That would be wrong.</P>
    <P>I would like clarification on a number of points.  This Bill is a forerunner of a Bill which has come before the House annually and was usually introduced by the Minister for Agriculture. Was there any reason for the Minister for the Environment to bring in this Bill this time?  I ask this because the Minister for the Environment is from a constituency which does not have as many large farmers as there are in Carlow and Kilkenny.  The Minister for Agriculture has managed to sidestep a most unpopular Bill in his own county by handing it over to the Minister for the Environment.  This Bill relates to agriculture only and should have been brought in by the Minister for Agriculture.  I would like the Minister to reply to this question.</P>
    <P>There are a number of interesting points in this Bill.  A report on &ldquo;Local Finance and Taxation&rdquo; was issued in 1972 when Fianna F·il were last in Government.  On page 10, chapter 4, the first paragraph deals with the rating system and the need for local taxation.  This Bill coupled with that <Col N="481" /> paper which the then Government issued is more than worrying.  Paragraph 4.1.1. states:</P>
    <P>To the extent that local services cannot be financed by direct charges, such as fees, rents, etc., they must be paid for by taxation, raised either centrally or locally.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4.1.2 states:</P>
    <P>The Government consider it essential that local authorities should have power to levy local taxes. Moreover, they believe that these taxes should be capable of financing a significant proportion of local expenditure, if local democracy and a sound local government system is to survive.</P>
    <P>It is significant that Fianna F·il believed that local taxation must form a basis for sound local democracy.  If that is Fianna F·il thinking, then the removal of rates on dwellinghouses in towns and cities will be financed by rates paid by the farming community. There will now be two systems of taxation for farmers, income tax and rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister estimates that this year something in the region of £7 million will be brought in through taxation of farmers with a valuation over £75. Next year the valuation will be reduced to £60.  I should like to know how much additional taxation will be brought in by the removal of relief on farmers with a rateable valuation between £60 and £75.  The rating system was removed from dwellinghouses because it was regarded as inequitable, unjust and unfair.  If this system was wrong for people living in towns it is equally wrong for those living on farms.  There is no criterion according to which one can say that this system is right.  There is no logical reason which would permit the farming community to agree to this.  During their period in Opposition Fianna F·il said that they would remove rates on dwellinghouses because they were unfair but in spite of that they are now increasing the rates on the farming community.</P>
    <P>On 4 April 1974 the then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lynch, spoke <Col N="482" /> about income tax.  At column 1515 of the Official Report Deputy Lynch said the following in relation to the farming community:</P>
    <P>Obviously, they anticipate and fear that the £100 norm of land valuation&mdash;according to a completely outdated criterion, incidentally, the Griffith valuation some 100 years old now&mdash;will be reduced according as the Minister feels it necessary and, of course, as the Revenue Commissioners advise.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>They indicate that rates are already a heavy imposition on many of them, especially the progressive ones.  Therefore, there would be now a much stronger case to extend the Fianna F·il policy of relieving homes, to relieving agricultural land from rates, if the incidence of income tax is going to bear more heavily on farmers as time goes on. It has been pointed out&mdash;and I think the point has been well taken&mdash;that farmers are the only producers whose means of production would be subject to income taxation. Another point which I think has been well taken is that about 50 per cent of their output, 50 per cent of their product, goes for export, whereas those in industrial production enjoy complete freedom of taxation from profits deriving from those industrial exports.</P>
    <P>Basically the Fianna F·il policy would be extended to relieve farmers from rates.  That is what I read from it. It is certainly most unfair that farmers who had been granted relief from rates are now to lose this relief.  Why have the Government gone back on this statement?  Perhaps it is in order to bring in revenue in an easy manner. Reading Deputy Lynch's statement at that time the farming community would have felt that when dwellinghouses were being relieved of rates land would also be relieved. Rates on private dwellings had been keeping the local authorities going and I fear that this will now be paid for by the agricultural community.  This would be a scandal.  The farming community will be strongly opposed to any method of <Col N="483" /> forcing them to pay for the servicing of local authorities.  In the long run this will be answerable for at the polls in the European elections, the local authority elections and the next general election.</P>
    <P>In 1975, when the £17 allowances for agricultural workers was being removed, Fianna F·il opposed it; and even though the amount was nominal I saw a lot of merit in what they were saying.  That £17 relief was a gesture towards farmers which encouraged increased employment on the land.  I suggest to the Minister that an allowance of an increased sum should now be introduced to facilitate farmers and to encourage them to employ more workers.  In industry the Government are continuing the employment premium scheme introduced by the National Coalition and I suggest that a similar gesture should be made to farmers.  I would ask the Minister to consider this seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This has a bearing on rates, but I will not pursue it.  This Bill removes reliefs from rates on land and I do not think Fianna F·il would lose face if at this stage they amended the Bill even if it meant forfeiting the £7 million it would save.  It would be regarded as a fair gesture by farmers who are, after all, the source of our main exports.  A prosperous agricultural industry affects everyone in the country.  A bill of this sort only serves to perpetuate the gap between the different sections of the community and to widen that gap.  We should be striving for harmonious relations with all sections of the community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill imposes an additional tax of £7 million on farmers with valuations of more than £75 and it only emphasises the differences that exist between the different sections of the community.  It is a dangerous step and because of the <Col N="484" /> nature of agriculture this will be to the detriment of the people as a whole.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, the people who stand to lose this benefit failed to qualify for other benefits given by the Government and this additional burden comes at a time when the fertiliser subsidy is being removed.  All our efforts at this stage should be directed toward retaining the confidence of our farmers.  As I have said, they are our greatest exporters, and our main concern should be to encourage them to expand their export potential.  The additional impost on the farmers through this Bill and the effects of the removal of the fertiliser subsidy coming so close together will not do anything to retain the confidence of the farming community.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Minister for Agriculture to prevent heifers going into intervention, coupled with all the other moves in regard to agriculture, may cause a certain amount of fear among farmers and a loss of confidence. This must not be allowed to happen to our most important industry. No matter what is said, confidence must be maintained in agriculture. This Bill is only one of a number of moves all of which are having an accumulative effect on the farming community.  It is a worrying aspect.  I am certainly worried about it and I am sure many people involved in agriculture are worried about it.  The seizing of additional moneys, which cannot be objected to and which should not be required by the Government, should not be tolerated. There is no appeal once the rates have been struck and the demands sent out. The rated occupiers are the people who must pay.  If it is wrong to have rates on new dwellings it is equally wrong to have rates on agricultural land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should consider the system of valuations.  He promised that rates on dwellings would be abolished and this has been done.  Recently, in reply to a question, he said he was no longer keeping records of valuations on dwellings.  If this is so in regard to dwellings then he is no longer interested in raising rates on them and he should not be considering rating <Col N="485" /> agricultural land.  We would be better off without our rating system and the Minister should seriously consider reviewing it without delay.</P>
    <P>We are one of the few countries in Europe that is imposing two systems of taxation on one section of the community&mdash;our farmers are liable for income tax and rates.  Many commentators and those who constantly criticise the farming community fail to take account of the great deal of money that is paid by farmers in rates and the great amount of money that is spent by them in relation to other aspects of their business.  We are one of the few countries in Europe with two systems of taxation and every member of the farming community must feel he is being treated unfairly when his European competitors have only one system.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been discussed at great length because of the strong opposition which many people have to the imposition of additional taxation on the farming community.  The situation must be remedied in order to allow farmers to be more competitive.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.  The most recent live register total refers to 31 March when it stood at 111,014.

      <P>The live register total for the end of March 1978 is 1,676 higher than the figure of 109,338 for 1 July 1977 but this increase is considerably lower than the seasonal increase one would normally expect over this period.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to separate payment of benefit, assistance or pension in respect of a claimant's wife and children which can be made in certain circumstances to the wife.</P>
      <P>There was an anomaly in regard to the payment of the increase in respect of children where the couple were separated and the children were living with the mother.  Regulations, effective from 1 April 1978, have been made removing this anomaly and enabling payment to be made to the mother in such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation always was that after the husband refused, the Department could then decide to make split payments, but in the first instance if a wife applied for separate payment the Department asked the husband to give his consent.  Is the Minister not aware that it was recently suggested in the House that the precondition ought to be removed as well?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>We decide the matter entirely on the basis of what is right in the particular circumstances.  We do not require the husband's consent.  The Deputy should realise in those particular cases there is not usually any dispute because those are cases where even though there is a separation the husband is maintaining the wife and children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it not the case that even where there was not separation, situations arose where through the benefit being paid to the husband, <Col N="490" /> the other members of the family were not benefiting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This case deals with separations.  This is where husband and wife are separated but where the husband is still supporting the wife and the children.  The difficulty was that the husband even though he was supporting the wife and children could not claim an increase in benefit because of the children unless they were living with him.  We have changed it so that even though the children are living with the mother the father's benefits can be increased and they can be paid either to the father or to the mother as we decide.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria applied to married women claimants for unemployment benefit are the same as those applied to all other claimants for that benefit and are to be found in the conditions for entitlement in Part III of the Social Welfare Act 1952 as amended by subsequent legislation.</P>
      <P>The statutory conditions referred to provide in general that unemployment benefit is payable to insured persons during periods of unemployment provided they are capable of and available for work, can satisfy the contribution conditions and are free from certain disqualifications.  The only statutory condition for entitlement relating to married women in particular is that their title is limited to 156 days' benefit, as compared to 390 days generally, where they are living with or are being supported by their husbands.</P>
      <P>The 390 days limit applies however where the husband is an invalid and is being supported by his wife.</P>
      <P>The determination of eligibility for entitlement is made in the light of the particular circumstances of each case by deciding officers and appeals officers of my Department in the exercise of their statutory functions.</P>

      <P>What emphasis is placed by the deciding officer on the fact that a married woman has a young family?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that we had quite a discussion on this yesterday and I stated then, and now repeat, that the mere fact of a married woman having children does not, as was suggested yesterday, automatically debar her from benefit. There is no such rule or practice.  The situation is, as I described at some length yesterday that a married woman is under no disadvantage; it is purely a matter of the deciding officer or subsequently the appeals officer deciding as to whether or not she is available for work.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the rates of social welfare payments, including unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance payments, were increased by 10 per cent from the beginning of April, which represents a substantial improvement in real terms.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 18 and 19 together. The increase in real terms of 6 per cent in social welfare payments is arrived at by comparing the amount of benefit payable to individual beneficiaries in the year 1978, taking into account the increase of 10 per cent from April 1978, with the amount which would have been required to bring the corresponding payments in 1977 up to a level sufficient to compensate for the projected increase in the cost of living in 1978.  The increase is based on forecasts made by the Department of Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Minister would have his views as to the veracity of the Department of Finance's forecast.  Could the Minister not accept that an increase of this nature to social welfare beneficiaries is hardly likely even to keep them in line with increases in the cost of living, bearing in mind that other benefits, such as adjusted income tax allowances, removal of car tax and household rates will not benefit people in receipt of social welfare benefit?</P>

      <P>Married women who are living with or who are wholly or mainly maintained by their husbands, are paid unemployment benefit for a maximum of 156 days as compared with a maximum of 390 days for married men.  Married women living apart and unable to obtain any financial assistance from their husbands can receive benefit for the same duration as men as also can wives whose husbands are incapable of self-support and who are being maintained by them.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to recent questions regarding the relative entitlements of men and women under the social welfare code, the Government are committed to working towards the elimination of discrimination against women in the field of social security.  I have also stated that this must be achieved in a phased and orderly fashion because of the considerable expenditure and the degree of administrative planning involved and also because of the significant changes which will have to be made in social welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>As a first step in implementing this policy, the special provisions which apply to single women and widows for receipt of unemployment assistance will, as announced in the Budget Statement, be removed with effect from 1 October.

      <P>I am not satisfied that advertisements are the best way of doing this job.  I received representations from a group in Dublin, and there were some trade union representatives on that group as well as others, and the group specifically asked me to put in a full page advertisement, which I did, but I did it because the group attached importance to it.  I do not think newspaper advertisements are all that effective in this particular area.  I think leaflets and information centres are much more effective.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that part of the problem about the other publicity he mentions, such as leaflets and an information service, is the fact that people have to make contact with this service in the first instance before they become <Col N="506" /> aware in many cases of the benefits to which they may be entitled?  Would the Minister not consider investigating on a scientific basis the effectiveness of communicating information to possible social welfare recipients in order to ensure there is a full take-up of the money available?</P>

      <P>So far as I have been able to get any opinion on it my information is that newspaper advertisements are not read by the sort of people who will be affected.  It is a continuing problem to try to get the information across.  I recognise there is a variety of ways in which those entitled to benefits can and should be informed and, as our community, health and social welfare services improve, more and more people will be more fully informed.  We all have a function as Deputies, like everybody else, to make sure people get that to which they are entitled.  That is our aim.</P>

      <P>A claim for supplementary welfare allowance is normally dealt with by the local community welfare officer who interviews the claimant and obtains particulars of his or her circumstances and means. Where a claim is a straightforward one for a basic allowance or one where the situation is urgent, the officer authorises payment on the spot. Where the application is for an additional allowance or a single payment to meet exceptional needs, the approval of a senior officer may be required and this is normally forthcoming within a matter of days.</P>

      <P>It is most unlikely that there would be an appeal in the case of the exceptional sums.  There are two different things here.  One is the normal supplementary welfare allowance, either the full allowance or a reduced amount.  That is decided by the community welfare officer in the first instance with an appeal to the appointed person.  In other cases there may be a need, as is envisaged in the legislation, for exceptional payments to meet particular circumstances.  As matters stand some of these cases have to be reffered to the Department because, in theory, they may have to be authorised by the Minister.  As I have said, we have an informal working arrangement whereby it can be dealt with more often than not by telephoning the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation dealing with the matter referred to by the Deputy provides that in certain circumstances credited insurance contributions may be awarded to insured persons where there has been failure to stamp their insurance cards.  Before this can be done, however, it must be established that the contributions were, in fact, legally due and that failure to pay them did not occur with the consent or connivance of the insured persons or was not attributable to any negligence on their part.</P>
      <P>These inquiries are dealt with as urgent matters more especially in cases where the insured person is claiming benefit and where his title to it is dependent on the crediting of contributions. While it would obviously be more satisfactory to obtain statements from employers in all such cases, these are, in fact, dispensed with where the investigating officer is satisfied on the basis of other evidence that the requirements of the legislation governing the crediting of unpaid contributions are met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Department's records, the person concerned will reach the age of 65 years in 1982 and his total Irish insurance will not be sufficient to entitle him to a retirement pension on that insurance alone, even assuming that he has full Irish contributions until then.</P>
      <P>However, it is understood that he was employed in the United Kingdom from 1943 to 1955 and insured under British legislation and that he continued his British insurance on a voluntary basis after he resumed working in Ireland.  His pension entitlement will, therefore, fall to be examined under EEC Regulation No. 1408 of 1971 which provides for the aggregation of insurance periods of migrant workers in the member states.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to give an estimate of the actual amount of pension to which the person concerned will become entitled on reaching age 65.  If, however, he had an uninterrupted record of British insurance from 1943 to 1974 he would qualify at that age for a proportionate Irish retirement pension based on the ratio of his Irish insurance to his combined British and Irish insurance and he should also be entitled to an appropriate pension from the United Kingdom authorities on the basis of his British insurance.</P>

      <P>I should like to put a suggestion to the Minister that might improve the scheme, bearing in mind that one wants equity in this situation and that somebody who has a telephone is in a better position than a person who does not have one. Would the Minister consider extending the scheme by way of making a facility available to an old aged pensioner who does not have a telephone whereby he or she could make a limited number of free telephone calls at the local post office?  This would in some way meet the situation in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to that.  The whole forestry operation is becoming mechanised at present with a view to supplying an efficient raw material for industrial development using added-value timber products and timber development ranging into paper, newsprint in particular. This area is being examined by the IDA in conjunction with my Department and it involves the efficient production of the raw material which at that level is not inclined to lead to increased employment by reason of mechanisation.  However, the overall impact, if we develop a substantial added-value element in the timber industry, would be of tremendous benefit to the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not have heard me correctly.  I am thinking in terms of this area being an outstanding area where we can have a substantial added-value on to the timber industry which does not exist at present.  That depends on the efficient production and harvesting of the raw material itself.  For instance, at present we have no newsprint manufactured here.  The amount of added-value in regard to timber products here at present is lamentably low and has been neglected over the years.  I say that categorically.  An examination is in <Col N="521" /> train at present with the IDA and I believe it will shortly lead to the announcement of positive plans for substantial employment in a whole range of added-value industries based on the efficient production of timber products.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Fair Rents Tribunal: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That D·il …ireann calls on the Minister for the Environment to set up a Fair Rents Tribunal to ensure that tenants of private houses and flats benefit from the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings.&mdash; (Deputy Horgan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I said yesterday <Col N="608" /> evening the time is long overdue for the establishment of some form of Fair Rents Tribunal.  According to the Government White Paper there will be a cutback on centre city housing because of cost factors.  That will have very serious repercussions because it will throw a vast number back on to the private sector within the city.  One can imagine what will happen if there is not some form of control and some mechanism upon which people can fall back to ensure the rents asked are reasonable and fair.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to give this matter careful consideration.  There will be serious consequences for housing in Dublin city because young couples with families will not have any accommodation.  They will not be able to afford the rent required for private accommodation and, because of the Government's policy, they will not get housing in their native city.</P>
      <P>The motion specifically refers to the matter of the abolition of rates and this is an aspect that should be considered urgently.  The Government must ensure that the rights of people are protected. If they are not, there will be serious consequences.  I do not know if the Minister will announce tonight that he is going to set up a Fair Rents Tribunal, although I hope he will do so.  If that is the case I hope he will set it up as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that additional funds will be made available for housing for the elderly.  Given the present market situation, young married couples with children have no hope whatever of obtaining accommodation.  The whole area of private letting will have to be taken into consideration by the tribunal. There must be no discrimination.  At the moment young couples are discriminated against, particularly if they have a baby.  Any legislation must ensure that discriminatory practices in the private sector or even in the local authority sector are abolished.  Safeguards must be provided to protect the rights of people.  While the motion put down by Members of the Labour Party deals with rates, overall a tribunal is required urgently to meet <Col N="609" /> an impending housing crisis in Dublin city.</P>

      <P>The terms of this motion bring together two very important themes or factors, namely, privately-owned rented accommodation on the one hand and, on the other hand, the abolition of domestic rates.</P>
      <P>The abolition of domestic rates is my responsibility.  In order to accomplish this and to fulfil our undertaking we brought a motion before the House on 6 July that was passed and from that date the necessary preparations were made for derating domestic dwellings, community halls and secondary schools.  This will be followed by a Bill&mdash;the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1977 &mdash;that will come before the House very soon.  It is almost ready.  In that legislation I shall deal with the issue that is involved in this motion, namely, ensuring that full benefit will accrue to people in private rented accommodation as a result of the derating of that accommodation.</P>
      <P>Quite a number of people are involved. The landlord of a premises usually included in the rent an amount in respect of rates which tended to increase from year to year.  It is the intention of the Government to ensure as far as possible that tenants get the benefit of derating.  It is a complex problem and there are legal complications in ensuring that this will happen and that it is complied with in accordance with the wishes of the Government and of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make clear my attitude to the motion before the House.  I have considerable sympathy with the objectives of the motion.  I believe the people who tabled it were well intentioned. However, I have a real reservation at this stage as to whether the aim of the motion can be achieved by the means put forward, namely, a Fair Rents Tribunal.  I am still to be convinced that the setting up of this kind of tribunal now would be the best way of achieving what we want, namely, to give the benefit of derating to the tenants concerned.  I have not closed <Col N="610" /> my mind completely on it but I do not think it will achieve the result all of us would wish.</P>
    <P>It is a very complex problem.  The setting up of such a tribunal involves considerations far beyond this single issue.  I am confident that the best way to help those concerned is to use existing statutory provisions in addition to the provisions contained in the forthcoming legislation.  This will be a quicker and better way to achieve the purpose of the motion before us.  I hope I shall be successful in this.  In due course Deputies will have a chance to debate in this House the merits and demerits of what will be involved.</P>
    <P>This debate would not be taking place now if the Government had not taken action on derating, as promised in the manifesto and in accordance with our commitment given five years ago.  Were it not for the fact that the Government took the necessary action and brought about derating of domestic dwellings we would not be faced with this problem.  Fianna F·il grasped the nettle.  We said we would do that in 1973 while the National Coalition had a different approach.  They believed in doing it in stages.  At first they removed the health charges from the rates and thereafter reduced rates by 25 per cent.  They were late converts to the need to remove rates on domestic dwellings, community halls and secondary schools.  Their approach was different from ours and the public recognised this when they elected us.  We have not failed the public who supported us.</P>
    <P>When we made our decision to derate domestic property we had to consider whether the relief should apply to owner-occupied dwellings only or, whether it should be extended to rented accommodation such as we are discussing now.  We decided it would be wrong to exclude that sector.  It is not easy to ensure that such people get the benefit of derating.  We all know that there are difficulties involved between landlords and tenants, in particular those who pay rates in their weekly or monthly rents.  However, landlords have been given the relief and we must try to ensure that tenants also benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> Once the principle of derating rented accommodation is established the question arises of how to ensure that relief is fairly passed on to tenants.  I should like to point out that some weeks ago I mentioned in the House that I will be including this in forthcoming legislation. There are different categories in rented accommodation.  Firstly, there are local authority tenants.  Before January last I sent a circular to each housing authority instructing them not to collect rates from tenants of their rented accommodation from January. We have 103,000 dwellings provided for letting by housing authorities and tenants of such properties are getting the benefit since January.</P>
    <P>Domestic rates relief applies also to private rented accommodation and this was dealt with in a more general circular which was sent to housing authorities before January.  This made our commitment clear to the housing authorities, that the full benefit of domestic rate reliefs should be passed on to tenants of rented accommodation. Where inquiries are received from either landlords or tenants, housing authorities were asked to make it clear that domestic rating relief would extend to all housing accommodation. The authorities were asked to point out that landlords should reduce these rents by the amount of the rates relief grant on properties.</P>
    <P>The Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, provides statutory backing for this instruction as far as rents of controlled dwellings are concerned.  With the removal of rates from houses, amounts added to the rents of controlled dwellings under the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960&mdash;amounts corresponding to the rates paid by the landlord&mdash;no longer constitute &ldquo;lawful additions&rdquo; to the basic rents of those dwellings.  Tenants of such dwellings have available to them, therefore, the remedy of serving a notice on their landlord under section 13 of the 1960 Act reducing their rent to an amount equal to the lawful rent. An estimated 45,000 dwellings are covered by the above provisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan adverted to this point, but he appeared to link it to sections 19 and 20 only of the Rent <Col N="612" /> Restrictions Act, 1960.  By referring only as he did to the special provisions applying to small controlled dwellings in certain appointed areas, he may unwittingly have given the impression that the right to secure a reduction of rent is available only to tenants of this special category of controlled dwelling. This, of course, is not the case.  As I made clear in my reply to a parliamentary question, as reported in Volume 303, columns 1604 to 1608 of the Official Report, quoted by Deputy Horgan, all tenants of controlled dwellings are entitled, following domestic rates abolition, to secure a reduction in their lawful rent.  The general provision applying is, as I have said, section 13 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960. The provisions of Part III of the Act mentioned by Deputy Horgan are of application to small controlled dwellings only.</P>
    <P>In much the same way, small dwellings under the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928 &mdash;that is, mainly rented houses or flats with a valuation of not more than £8 in Dublin and not more than £6 elsewhere&mdash;will also benefit fully from domestic rates relief.  This will be the case whether dwellings are controlled under the Rent Restrictions Acts or not.</P>
    <P>In many other private lettings, the tenant, as part of his contract of tenancy, had always accepted direct liability for the rates due on a dwelling. Again, where this is so, the benefit of domestic rates abolition is guaranteed to him under the terms of his contract.</P>
    <P>I think it is important to emphasise that existing provisions already guarantee the passing on of domestic rates relief in the case of a majority of tenancies in the country.  I also accept that in certain cases, especially where shorter term lettings are involved or where a unit of letting does not correspond to a unit of valuation on the rate books tenants often had not been paying rates as such.  It may be assumed that in such cases the rent which the tenant pays reflected in some way the cost of rates even though no amount would be specified in the demand from the landlords in respect of rents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> I can assure Deputies that the forthcoming Bill will be designed to ensure that, as far as possible, the benefit of rates abolition is felt also in those cases. In general, it is my intention to place an obligation on landlords, who before 1 January 1978 paid the rates on dwellings occupied by their tenants, to make to the tenant by way of proportionate set-off in the rent an allowance equal to the amount of the rates in question.  I would suggest to Deputies that further discussion could more usefully take place when the terms of the Bill have been circulated and the Bill itself is before the House.</P>
    <P>The solution proposed by the motion is the setting up of a fair rents tribunal. This would involve the extension of rent control to the whole of the private rented sector.  As such, the proposed solution goes far beyond what the motion is attempting to ensure.  It would go far beyond the issue and the aims we are discussing.  I think Deputy Horgan admitted this in a limited way last evening.</P>
    <P>The experience of rent tribunals in other countries is not very encouraging. It is a complex and expensive organisation to set up with serious indirect costs for the community in general by way of increased public expenditure. Considerations of organisation and finance could be described as secondary if it achieved all we wanted it to achieve.  The question is&mdash;would it?  It is by no means the case that it would. There seems to be a connection between the extension of rent control and the falling off in supply of accommodation where the control applies. This has been the experience not only abroad but here.  There was a drastic decrease in the supply of unfurnished rented accommodation here between 1946 and 1971 as reflected in the censuses. In 1946 there were approximately 161,000 unfurnished rented units.  By 1961 this had fallen on 100,000 and by 1971 to 65,000.  Estimates at present in regard to 1981 show that it will be so low as 42,000 if it follows the existing pattern.  As Minister with overall responsibility for housing I cannot regard this evidence lightly.</P>
    <P>In 1975 a review of the whole area <Col N="614" /> of privately rented accommodation was begun in my Department with the object of bringing forward solutions to the problems attending the private rented sector.  That review has now been completed.  Its purpose is to provide the background information and analysis which can form the basis of any proposals to be formulated in this area.  The review deals with all aspects of privately rented dwelling accommodation including the availability, cost and suitability of such accommodation. In the course of the review, account has been taken of recent developments in other countries, notably the United Kingdom, in relation to privately-owned rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>Regard has been had also to measures which had be taken and the effects which such measures had on the overall situation, particularly the effects on the supply and availability of such accommodation.  As my colleague, the Minister for Justice, recently indicated in the House, the review has been circulated to other Departments for examination and for their observations on it.  Pending the outcome of this examination it would, of course, be premature for me to disclose details of the review.  The points mentioned by Deputies during the debate on this motion will, however, be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that my concern and that of local authorities for the area of private rented accommodation ranges a good deal beyond the matters which I have dealt with so far.  Under section 70 of the Housing Act, 1966 housing authorities have power to make bye-laws regulating the physical condition of houses let for rent in their areas.  Since 1973 when model bye-laws were circulated to housing authorities by my Department, 39 authorities have adopted bye-laws.  Despite certain criticism of their operation the bye-laws are being administered with increasing effectiveness from year to year. In all cases housing authorities favour an initial approach to the parties concerned. They offer advice and are willing to have consultation with those concerned before resorting to enforcement measures.  Only reluctantly do <Col N="615" /> they resort to these when the persons concerned are not receptive of advice and suggestions and do not want to know about them.  They are then forced to adopt enforcement measures.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning.  I am in sympathy with the motion.  I am not convinced that it is the right way to do it; as a matter of fact I am convinced that the way I am proposing to do it, namely to have the necessary sections or section included in the forthcoming Bill, is the immediate way to tackle the issue.  A rates tribunal would not be confined to this issue in isolation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one single issue, and the setting up of a rents tribunal is so complex and would take so long that it would not deal with the problem in the immediate future.  Some people have expressed concern because a number of tenants have been paying the rates since 1 January.  It is probable&mdash; indeed pretty definite&mdash;that the landlords who have collected rates since 1 January would be collecting the rates for the second payment of last year, 1977.  The reason I would be definite about this is that there is no way that they could be collecting the 1978 rates because I do not know of any local authority in this country who has issued the demand notes yet.  A landlord can hardly collect it when he does not even know the amount of it.  In all probability it had to be in every case that landlords were collecting these rates in retrospection, or at least one half-year retrospectively.  Since the change in the rating year to 1 January from 31 March the demand notes very rarely were issued in any local authority area anywhere before March and because of the changes in local financing this year, due to the abolition of domestic rates, there is no way the local authorities could have the demand notes issued yet.  In my opinion there is no danger that any landlord is collecting the 1978 rate from 1 January last.  He would be collecting the remaining portion of the second <Col N="616" /> half of the 1977 rate.  Therefore there is still time to ensure that the tenants we are worried and expressing concern about will benefit from the fact that the rates have been abolished, and I hope they will when the necessary legislation has passed through this House in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before us is a symptom of the increasing concern in the community at the degree to which expectations which were built up seven or eight months ago are not being fulfilled.  I accept the good intentions of the Minister and I have no doubt that the legislation which in February he promised to introduce very soon but which still does not show any signs of appearing, when it does eventually come about will include measures which would meet to some extent the kind of concern being expressed by the movers of this motion and by those who support it in principle, as we on this side of the House do.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the abolition of the domestic rate, which we all welcomed, was embarked upon without any clear idea of what this would imply and no mechanism had been thought out to ensure that the benefits would be automatically passed on to the approximately 300,000 tenants in rented accommodation throughout the country. It is perfectly clear from recent surveys carried out by the Flatdwellers' Association that they are not being passed on.  I do not primarily blame the landlords here because they have problems in their own right, not merely the problem of the Rent Restrictions Act but other difficulties as well.  The legislation and the proposal to abolish rates should have been accompanied in the first place by proper measures to ensure that the benefit would apply.  The Government's decision to abolish rates simply has meant nothing to over 250,000 people.  They have not benefited and they do not seem likely to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the case could be made that rates are not being collected for the current year.  By the time legislation is enacted I have no doubt another year will have elapsed. <Col N="617" /> The Minister was asked in the D·il in the debate on 21 February 1978 to which he referred whether or not this legislation would be retrospective. There is not any reply on the record and I do not remember whether the Minister nodded or not.  I do not think he did.</P>

      <P>We will have to wait and see.  We may find that the Bill when introduced will encompass the essence of this motion and perhaps improve it, but at present there is a very anomalous and unhappy situation where people who were led to believe, rightly or wrongly, that their rents would come down and legislation would be enacted to protect them now find that neither has occurred.  The truth is that the Fianna F·il Party during the election campaign issued a special document in at least the flatlands in Dublin areas in which they promised immediate legislation to cope with the list of points which the Flatdwellers' Association brought to their attention.  I am wiser now and I believe that this move was primarily designed to catch every possible vote, regardless of the cost, the practicability or the integrity of implementing it. Thus far on the one occasion when the Flatdwellers' Association met the Minister for Justice, the Minister responsible in that regard, they were not impressed by his enthusiasm or interest.  They were rather brusquely handled and he left after about five minutes.  He is not here to answer for himself this evening so we will say no more about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be problems with a fair rents tribunal, but on balance it is worth considering the setting up of such a body, to which both landlord and tenant could have recourse.  They both have problems and it is legitimate to see these problems and the difficulties which both landlord and tenant are having in the context of the difficulty which we have at the moment in relation to basic housing policy. Dublin Corporation and some other local authorities some time ago set up <Col N="618" /> a system of registration of landlords. It has not been an outstanding success, and that was predictable, because if these by-laws were implemented overnight all that would happen is that thousands of people would be precipitated onto the streets and there would be no place for them to go.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the position of the tenant and the landlord needs treatment immediately and I hope it will get this in the context of a new Bill which will deal with fundamental problems relating to both sectors.  A landlord is entitled to expect a fair return if he lets accommodation in which he has invested money if he keeps it in good condition.  First of all, he is helping the Government and the local authorities to fulfil their statutory duty of ensuring that people are housed in decent conditions; that statutory duty is not being fulfilled at the moment.  Secondly, it is reasonable to believe that because the landlord, unlike any other person who is involved in investments of any kind, is acting in an area which involves a basic need and a fundamental right, a particular Government interest should be taken with regard to the provision of decent tenant accommodation.  The rights of the tenant need major attention also.  At present it is clear that there are problems, not merely with regard to rents but on other aspects also.  The Minister mentioned that people had the right under the appropriate section of the Act to insist on rates being allowed.  I ask him in all sincerity if he does not accept the position of the average tenant who might, for example, be a single person or a married person with a young family, going to the landlord and saying &ldquo;Please, I want this allowance, or else&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister must accept that there is a certain degree of unreality about that suggestion.  The onus should not be put on the tenant to ensure his right.  It does not happen in any other case.  The onus does not rest on the housewife to prove she is getting value for money and that she is not being overcharged.  The first obligation is on the people involved in that trade to ensure that they are acting in <Col N="619" /> accordance with certain standards.  It is unrealistic to expect the average tenant to go to the landlord because there is a hidden fear of intimidation and worry that the landlord would say &ldquo;Then you can get to hell out,&rdquo; which is what some of them would say.</P>
    <P>If one has a young family&mdash;and many of these people have&mdash;there are enough trauma and burdens without getting involved in an argument with the landlord.  Many of these tenants would not be aware that they were entitled to this benefit and therefore would not seek to have it implemented. I do not believe that the onus should be on tenants, who are seeking to have a decent roof over their heads and to have a certain degree of privacy in their private and married lives, to drag the landlord before the court, a tribunal or any third party.</P>
    <P>The Government have a responsibility to protect and ensure that people in all walks of life have decent accommodation and that they are protected from the minority of rapacious landlords.  Although there are many people involved and providing excellent accommodation, in some cases at ludicrously low rents, the fact is in some quarters Rachmanism is still alive and well and doing good business.  I will be happy to forward details of numerous cases to anyone who does not agree with that, but there is very little tenants can do about it at the moment.</P>
    <P>I appreciate also that if major and immediate measures of a heavy handed nature, the Minister used the word &ldquo;sledgehammer&rdquo;, were to be introduced they could have major implications for the problem of local authorities in trying to house people.  That does not mean we should shirk the responsibility of protecting those people who are now in trouble.</P>
    <P>The ending of discrimination against tenants, not just with regard to their rents but in regard to other matters, is important and needs attention.  A would-be tenant should not be refused accommodation and the Government of <Col N="620" /> the day have the moral, and should have the statutory, responsibility for ensuring that such tenants are not discriminated against on the grounds of such things as class, colour, creed or family size.  One of the primary problems of the urban areas is the fact that in a so-called Christian society a couple with a child or a couple where the wife is pregnant find it almost impossible to get accommodation.  In some cases they get accommodation on the strict understanding that if the wife becomes pregnant they must leave.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>I do not expect any side of the House to have a monopoly of wisdom on how to handle this but my view is that that sort of discrimination should be outlawed. I hope the Bill the Minister speaks about will encompass measures to deal with that type of discrimination. It is wrong that growing numbers of immigrants should be discriminated against on the grounds of colour.  It is wrong that there should be this type of discrimination at all.  We should do everything possible to ensure that accommodation is provided for people regardless of these essentially and fundamentally discriminatory, in some cases even sectarian, concepts and ideas.</P>
    <P>The Rent Restrictions Act has contributed to the problems.  This is not a black and white issue.  I know of tenements housing old people and some young people.  Because the rent is so small it is not worth collecting.  This gives the landlord an excuse to allow the dwelling to fall into disrepair.  In some cases people are living in what are little more than hovels.  I have spoken to the people who own these houses.  They will explain the arithmetic of the matter and say they cannot cope financially.  There is no recourse at the moment in that sort of circumstance.  There is no point asking an elderly lady of 70 years of age living in one small room to insist on getting the landlord, who in many cases is an absentee landlord, to ensure that she gets her rights.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this is a sledgehammer proposal.  It is a very acceptable suggestion worthy of consideration. <Col N="621" /> All it asks is that people who are either tenants or landlords, because there is no discrimination in the proposal against landlords, could have recourse where necessary to an independent arbiter.  That is a perfectly acceptable procedure in all walks of life and in all measures involving trade or commerce or an exchange of commercial interests in other areas.</P>
    <P>It does not necessarily mean that every case will go to this tribunal but it does mean that the rights of both parties will be protected.  In my view it is a reasonable suggestion and is worthy of support.  I can only assume that the fact that the Minister does not accept it is an indication that he may have this measure or one very similar to it in the Bill which he promised some months ago but which we have not seen yet.</P>
    <P>I frankly believe, and I say this more in sorrow than in anger, that this Government have a vested interest in maintaining the problem as it is.  The State has the fundamental responsibility for providing housing.  It is clear from the Government's White Paper on housing and from their fairly hamfisted efforts so far with regard to the provision of grants and the extra-ordinary escalation in house prices which has occurred in recent months, that they are to say the least of it very uncertain about where they are going with regard to the provision of houses. This means for the tenants, the landlords and the question we are dealing with here that if major moves were to be initiated which would appear to have the effect of curbing the minority of landlords who act in this Rachman-like way, there could be a backlash which would put more people on our housing lists, and the Government clearly do not want that.</P>
    <P>From a second point of view they are also hamstrung.  My overriding impression coming into this House is that Fianna F·il have sold their soul to a certain extent, and are simply enmeshed with the seedier and seamier elements of the new rich society, where the rights of the weak are trampled underfoot.  I do not believe that the Government party feel a real <Col N="622" /> responsibility or interest in those who are weak in our society.  The people at the heart of this evening's motion are weak.  They are the people who cannot speak for themselves adequately or articulately.  Therefore this motion is very timely because it brings to our attention the problems that exist.</P>
    <P>There is no point pretending that impending legislation at some unspecified date containing unspecified measures will deal with the actual situation where present landlords can legally demand rent increases of up to 100 per cent.  I stress also that the socio-economic groupings involved in flat dwellers are, on average, people who are relatively less well off than others.  Why should flat dwellers from whom a demand may be made for an increase of up to 100 per cent in the rent&mdash;I admit this does not happen in all cases&mdash;feel constrained to comply with the spirit of national co-operation which various Ministers are requesting in the context of the national wage agreements? Is that not totally unrealistic?</P>
    <P>According to estimates with which we are provided there are approximately 300,000 people involved here. In Dublin there are some 130,000 people involved and 8,000 landlords. I cannot help but feel that whereas the 130,000 people were very important in June, it is the 8,000 who now seem to be important, because to a substantial extent they control, manipulate and exercise their influence in the Fianna F·il Party.  If the Government are serious about this measure they will respond very sympathetically to the concept of a Fair Rents Tribunal. Why is it that anybody who wishes to have a measure of justice introduced into his situation finds that the onus is put on him to go to the landlord?  It does not happen in any other walk of life.  It does not happen because of fear and the threat of eviction.  It is not good enough for the Minister to fob off people with that excuse.</P>
    <P>In the Bill which the Minister is proposing to introduce he might consider one or two other measures which <Col N="623" /> would help to bring order into the situation.  It must be accepted that the private rented accommodation sector is a legitimate part of the housing policy for the whole State, in which the Government must have an interest and maintain standards and which they must control, where necessary.  There is a decreasing land bank available to local authorities and it seems timely to consider the possibility of subsidising private rented accommodation in some cases by a subsidy to the tenant.  It is no more unrealistic or socially unwise a proposal than the subsidies which exist at present in the local authority sector.  It would encourage people to provide decent accommodation.  In some cases there is no doubt that landlords are under substantial financial pressure.  I do not weep greatly for them, but it has been pointed out to me on numerous occasions when making representations on behalf of tenants that under the present setup and with existing legislation landlords find extreme difficulty in getting a fair return for their investment or, in some cases, their alleged investment.  The possibility of subsidising private rented accommodation by a direct subsidy to the tenant would be consistent with the policy in the local authority sector of subsidising quite massively the building and maintenance of local authority dwellings, including where necessary the subsidy in respect of differential rents which allows a flexible rent which takes into account a person's financial income.  Why should people who have recourse, for one reason or another, to the private sector find that they are outside the scope of this policy?</P>
    <P>Discrimination in this regard needs to be examined.  The key area when thinking about flat-dwellers is discrimination. They are by their very nature mobile, often not very coordinated in their movements, and only in latter times have they become organised.  They have not been a force to be reckoned with, though I admit that Fianna F·il recognised them as a force prior to the election when all types of goodies were promised for which the tab is now about to be picked up.  I do not share the confidence <Col N="624" /> of some that the tab will be picked up.  I expect relatively minor amendments to existing legislation and no real grasp of the nettle.  I do not believe that Fianna F·il will ever act in any way which appears to be against the interests of the landlords.  That has been their record and that is their position at the moment.  Nothing the Miniser says in his contribution leads me to believe that anything will be different.</P>
    <P>My approach would be to suggest that in the new legislation the Minister would ensure the termination of discrimination against the tenant under the headings I have mentioned: class, creed, colour and family size.  It is abhorrent to me that young people are regularly discriminated against and turned away from doors because they are doing what they believe to be right in trying to start and maintain a family.  That is a fundamental black spot in our society.  The appeal is made that children tend to cause more trouble than single people or tend to bring down the tone of a place.  A substantial sector of our society discriminate against a couple who have a family or who are about to start one. That is morally and socially wrong and there should be legislation to prevent it.  Other areas of more subtle discrimination also exist.  In many ways we are a society riddled with discrimination.  If one's address happens to be in a certain part of the city one it automatically discriminated against in looking for a job or a flat or in seeking entry to a school.</P>
    <P>A new deal for tenants is necessary. This tribunal could ensure that justice is done and is seen to be done.  The setting up of a Fair Rents Tribunal would shake many people into a realisation that the old exploitation is no longer good enough.  I admit that &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; is an emotive term in the context of our history, but there are many landlords who are providing a very important fundamental social necessity, without which the Government and the local authorities would be in a catastrophic situation, much worse than the present situation where 5,500 people are waiting for accommodation in this city alone.  Eight hundred families feel obliged to squat <Col N="625" /> in dwellings which are not their own, the majority having done so because they are frustrated and have nowhere else to go.</P>

      <P>This tribunal would provide recourse for the tenant and, if necessary, for the landlord.  All the right is never on one side.  Justice would thus be done.  At present the only thing the tenant can do is go to the landlord and insist on his rights in some extraordinary way which the Government have no way of defending. Presumably one could go to the courts but this is never done because it is totally unrealistic.</P>
      <P>The basic need in this case is to protect the landlord and, primarily the tenant in order to ensure that he would have an opportunity of living in a dwelling which is his own with decent conditions and privacy and for which a reasonable rent is paid which takes into account inflation, investment in the property and the maintenance of that property.  On both sides there is a great deal left undone. The proposal here is not being helped by the Minister's contribution which is basically to point, as he did last February, to some unspecified date in the future and to tell us that a Bill is on the way.  Section 13 of the 1960 Act is not good enough and it is not good enough for a Minister to pretend that a tenant has the capacity to achieve his or her rights.  It does not work.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the charge in respect of rates as part of rent is no longer lawful.  If that is so, is it not reasonable to assume that a Government who are serious about their job would ensure that mechanics would be established to protect tenants against whom that illegality is being operated? All we get are pious aspirations, that it is no longer lawful and that some time in the future statutory improvement will be brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not what the flat dwellers were promised last June.  It was among a sheaf of promises that littered the <Col N="626" /> country at that time.  This is another breach of faith.  I do not believe that when they abolished rates the Government had the slightest knowledge of its implication for members of the National Flatdwellers' Association.  I do not think they had the slightest idea of passing that benefit on.  They are now seeing the necessity for it, although earlier in the year in reply to questions the Minister evaded the issue and told the House to wait for the forthcoming Bill.  That has been repeated this evening.  It would be a timely gesture of good intent and good faith if the Minister were to accept this motion in principle.  It would show us he is a man of his word.  The situation is that the only contact the Government have had with the flatdwellers association has been one brusque, brief meeting.  I look forward to seeing the Minister's Bill and hope it will incorporate some of the suggestions contained in the motion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keating has succeeded in making a case against the setting up of the tribunal suggested in the motion. He said it is not possible to rush legislation through the House.  We in the Government can see no reason why it is not possible to get legislation through in a reasonable time provided we have not the same type of filibuster from the parties opposite that we have had on the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill which has been before the House for a considerable time, a Bill solely aimed at granting relief to agricultural landowners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment was quite right when he said that the content of the motion is a non-issue, that in cases where landlords are collecting rates as part of rent, such sums were due to them during the six months at the end of last year before landlords were relieved of rates.  The Deputy knows that the establishment of a tribunal would entail considerable work.  It would also require far more time than Deputy Keating realises.  A tribunal would have to be given terms of reference, their foundation would require legislation and it would take <Col N="627" /> some time for them to hold hearings and to prepare and issue a report.  We cannot wave a magic wand to set up an organisation and lay down procedures overnight.</P>
    <P>The Minister honoured the promise to abolish rates on private dwellings on 1 January 1978.  He also acted to give rates relief to 103,000 local authority tenants.  A certain number of tenants may not have got the benefit of rates relief but I am confident that the Bill which the Minister has promised will remedy that situation.  it will deal with other matters consequent on the abolition of rates on private dwellings.  It will be technical, complex legislation and it will probably take some time to prepare and introduce it.  When it is introduced all Deputies will have ample opportunity to discuss its provisions.  Therefore, it is premature to debate the issues involved in this motion.  It would not be right or proper to have a tribunal set up while this Bill is pending.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating admitted that a heavy-handed approach to this problem could produce dire results for tenants.  He agreed with the point the Minister made that a tribunal of the sort suggested in the motion might act against tenants' interests.  It could lead to a reduction in the supply of rented accommodation and the Minister is greatly concerned to avoid such a situation.  The setting up of a tribunal is not the proper way to deal with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The net point in this motion is to ensure that the rates relief promised, and given, will find its way to tenants occupying private houses and flats.  During the election campaign it was suggested that tenants would feel the benefit of the abolition of rates on houses which they occupy. There were solemn assurances in this respect.  The Minister has said on a number of occasions that in the case of controlled houses the tenants have a remedy.  That is so, but there are many houses which are not controlled.  The vast majority of flats in Dublin are not controlled.  When we speak of flats we are inclined to associate them with <Col N="628" /> Dublin only, forgetting that in every provincial town there are people living in flats all of which have been de-rated.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to say that some time in the future when the promised Bill has been enacted, perhaps towards the end of the year, machinery will be provided to pass on rates relief to the tenants. Since 1 January last tenants have not been getting the benefits of this rates relief.  Will the Minister take steps to apply this relief retrospectively?  I doubt if he will be able to put such machinery into the Bill.  Many people have been disillusioned because the rates relief, which the Minister's party promised and granted, has not been enjoyed by the people for whom it was intended.  This promise of derating was a product of the Fianna F·il think-tank but was not thought out and they had no means of implementing it.</P>
      <P>It will be interesting to see the provisions in the Housing Bill which the Minister has been telling us about.  He does not seem to know when it will be introduced.  He says it is nearly ready. What is holding it up?  Why did the Minister not introduce a small one-section Bill months ago to ensure that this rates relief would be passed on?  His colleague, the Minister for Justice, did that in the case of ground rents.  In the Ground Rents Bill he divorced the ground rents section from the rest of the 130-section Bill which the previous Minister for Justice, Senator Cooney, had ready.  The present Minister for Justice, under heavy pressure, broke up that particular Landlord and Tenant Bill and introduced the sections here dealing with ground rents. Why did the Minister for the Environment not follow suit and introduce a small Bill of one section, two sections or even six sections, making provision for passing on this rates relief to the tenants?</P>

I am sure a Member of the Upper House will not be too perturbed by my naming him. <Col N="629" /> That letter dated 7 June 1977 was written to a Mr. A. Cassidy, Secretary, National Flatdwellers' Association, 9 Anglesea Street, Dublin 2.  It is of such historic importance that I should circulate copies of it to the Members of the House who are present.  We will give the Minister a copy.  I will ask Deputy Horgan to circulate them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter should be enshrined in the Custom House with gold-plated lettering around it.  The letter states:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. Cassidy,</P>
      <P>I acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st of May.</P>
      <P>Our Party stand on Landlord and Tenant law relating to flat dwellings, has been very fully set-out by our Deputy leader, Mr. Joseph Brennan, in an address to the Solicitors Apprentice Debating Society and reported on the front page of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is our view that legislation should be enacted to provide protection for tenants of flats or houses, but at the same time to ensure that landlords do get a fair return on their investment, and that they do have protection against bad tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We fully appreciate that the private sector provides a large part of the rented accommodation in the city of Dublin.  We would not favour a situation where these people were restricted to such an extent that they were discouraged from investing in this type of project. We would like to see a fair <Col N="630" /> balance, and would like to see the private sector being encouraged to provide good accommodation, with certain minimum standards, and at a rent that is fair to the tenant, and fair to the Landlord.</P>
    <P>I now come to the crunch paragraph in this letter.  The Rathmines Flat Tenants' Association would be particularly interested in the National Flatdwellers' Association.  There was a very good survey done in the Rathmines area in Deputy Brady's constituency. They would be particularly interestd in the next partgraph which says:</P>
    <P>We would be in favour of setting up tribunals, to which the Landlord and the Tenant could have recourse for the purpose of fixing fair rents, and deciding disputes between the parties.</P>
    <P>What could be a greater election promise than that?  There is no ambiguity there.  We remember the ambiguity we had in the correspondence regarding the abolition of ground rents: &ldquo;we will, we will not, we have, we have not, we are about to do it&rdquo;. This is quite clear-cut.  The National Director of Elections, Senator Eoin Ryan, went on to say:</P>
    <P>We would stress, however, that the rents should be fair, and we would not like to see a return to the old situation, where rents were restricted to such an extent, that landlords simply allowed their property to deteriorate to such an extent that in cases the properties become totally unhabitable.</P>
    <P>It is in the interest of those seeking accommodation, that the people providing that accomodation are encouraged to provide it to a high standard.</P>
    <P>The letter went on to deal with the question of evictions generally and expressed views in that regard.  It then said:</P>
    <P>We are also totally opposed to discrimination against tenants, on the grounds of martial status, colour religion or sex.</P>
    <P>This is the usual hoohah put into election letters of this nature.  The <Col N="631" /> second last paragraph of the letter said:</P>
    <P>We are accordingly basically in favour of your suggestion for the charter of rights, and we are prepared to introduce appropriate legislation in this field.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister that that charter of rights laid down by the National Flat Dwellers Association specifically said in the fourth paragraph:</P>
    <P>Neutral tribunals to be established with statutory power to arbitrate in landlord and tenant disputes on application with power to make binding rules.</P>
    <P>It also said:</P>
    <P>Tribunals should have power to fix fair rents and to rule on validity of notice to quit issues by landlords.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on the record, as do my colleagues here and our colleagues from the Fine Gael Party who supported us, notably Deputies Fergus O'Brien, Keating and Fitzpatrick, our feelings with regard to this promise. This is outright reneging by the Fianna F·il Party on an absolutely clear promise.</P>

      <P>Lest the Minister be under the slightest misapprehension, Senator Eoin Ryan, not a man known for ambiguity, stated that Fianna F·il would be in favour of setting up tribunals to which the landlord and the tenant would have recourse for the purpose of fixing fair rents and deciding disputes between the parties.  We submit that there are something in the region of 320,000 tenants in flat accommodation and the rates relief allegedly given to those tenants is something in the region of £9 million.  The total rates relief given by the Government was about £85 million, about 10 per cent of that, roughly £10 million, is applicable to flat accommodation.  Of that £10 million rates relief given to landlords in relation to rented accommodation only about £2 million or £3 million has benefited the tenants.  As evidence of that I have the results of a most illuminating and interesting survey which was carried out a few weeks ago by the National Flatdwellers' Association.  The Rathmines branch of the National Flatdwellers' Association dealt with 70 complaints from tenants from 1 January to 28 February 1978: and the only tenant who benefited from the rates abolition was a tenant who paid rates directly to the corporation. The other 69 tenants had rates included in rents paid to their landlords and they failed to get it.  It was decided to survey a street of houses let in flats to determine whether landlords are consistenly refusing to pass on the benefit of rates abolition to tenants by reducing rents proportionately, and to collect up-to-date information.  The survey was carried out from 28 February to 7 March this year in Grove Park, Rathmines. Sixty-seven of a total of 99 rated houses in Grove Park are known to be let in flats.  Full details on rents and conditions were obtained for 51 houses and 469 tenants.  Incomplete information was received on a further 16 houses where the surveyors failed to <Col N="633" /> gain access.  In six cases a person believed to be the landlord, claimed that the houses were not let in flats.  In one case a tenant refused to give any information and there was nobody in nine houses which were surveyed.  This information is entirely reputable and authentic.  None of the 469 tenants in 51 houses for which complete information was available received any reductions in rent due to the abolition of rates.  I will give the Minister a copy of this survey later on.</P>

      <P>The Minister said in January that he had no evidence that rates relief was not being passed on.  The Minister can have a look at this afterwards and he can check the numbers of the houses involved.  The houses involved were Nos. 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14 15, 16, 17, and right down to No. 105.  The following houses were let in flats, 5, 12, 26, 30, 34 40, 41, 46, 48 right up to 107. Virtually the whole street in that part of Dublin is in flats and it was clearly established during that week that 80 per cent of the tenants got no reduction in their rents from 1 January after the abolition of rates.  This is a serious situation.  The Government gave rates relief to the tune of about £10 million in respect of flats throughout the State and only about one-third or one-fifth of the tenants got any actual relief.  This is absolutely disgraceful.  Many people are paying exorbitant rents.  In D˙n Laoghaire, which is my constituency, it is not at all unusual to have a husband, wife and one or three children pay any-thing up to £15 or £20 a week for a two-bedroomed flat with a bathroom, or £12 per week for a one-bedroomed flat with a little kitchen and sharing a toilet with other tenants.  There are <Col N="634" /> several thousand tenants paying less than £12 or £15 a week and the vast bulk of them got no rates relief since January.  What the Fianna F·il Party have done is they have given about £6 million in rates relief to private landlords.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I challenge the Minister to refute them.  I challenge the Minister to set the situation right. The only way it can be set right is by setting up a simple tribunal system where a tenant could go before the tribunal and produce his rent book since January 1978.  He could indicate that he received no relief and the tribunal could rule that apart from inflation, repairs and normal increases in rent, the person should receive a proportionate reduction in rent.</P>
      <P>A large number of people are letting private accommodation and they do not make income tax returns on it.  I am not opposed, nor are the Labour Party, to the commercial letting of private property at a fair rent.  That is a legitimate occupation.  We are opposed to people being exploited and we suggest that the Minister extend the scope of the 1960 Rent Restrictions Act to include uncontrolled rents and that the Minister introduce a tribunal system.  I am shocked that a Minister from Clare and rural Deputies should regard this motion as being amusing.  There are hundreds of young women in the public service and young married couples from rural Ireland who come to Dublin and they are mercilessly exploited within a five mile radius of this House in private rented accommodation.  Landlords do not make any income tax returns, they dodge here and there and the register of flat tenancies of Dublin Corporation is a joke and the Minister cannot or will not introduce legislation.  It is about time we in this House ended that national scandal.  For that reason this motion was tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that Senator Eoin Ryan wrote this letter. Some people lost the prospect of winning seats in Dublin.  I believe that Senator Mary Robinson would probably <Col N="635" /> have won a seat in Rathmines were it not for the kind of promise made by the Fianna F·il Party that <Col N="636" /> they would bring in a tribunal system. They are not fulfilling the promise.</P>

Of the 1,000 odd telephone exchanges in the country only three serving some 1,300 subscribers are currently out of service but many other exchanges are affected to a greater or lesser degree by plant failures.  The position is changing from day to day and it would not be practicable in the conditions obtaining to give detailed accurate information. General statements about the state of the service have been issued as appropriate. For example, information about telephones reported faulty in the Dublin 01 Area and the main areas affected was supplied to the Press on 3 April 1978.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (2) (b), line 51, to delete &ldquo;twenty-five years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Here we are talking about the purchase price which the householder will have to pay to get his freehold. There are basically two methods of assessing the amount to be paid by the householder.  Where there are more than 25 years to run in the lease the householder will be entitled to purchase according to an automatic multiplier related to the most recent long term national loan.  If he does not qualify to purchase under that heading he must then go to arbitration and obtain agreement on a figure.  Here he can really run into trouble because of the items which are to be taken into account at such arbitration and the cost involved could be very high.  The purpose of the amendment is to reduce the term from 25 years to one year.  This has the support of the tenants' organisations. The effect of accepting the amendment would be that all those with more than one year to run on their lease would be entitled to purchase, taking advantage of the automatic multiplier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question that has occurred to me is why should one take a figure of 25 out of the air?  If the object of the Bill is to encourage the purchase of ground rents, I believe there would be far more people purchasing in this category if they were able to take <Col N="552" /> advantage of the automatic multiplier. That is the basis of my amendment, suggesting that all those with more than one year to run on their lease should be entitled to take advantage of the automatic multiplier costing rather than having this confined to those with 25 years or more to run.</P>
    <P>The difficulty that would arise in particular with somebody not able to take advantage of such a situation is that the Bill provides that the arbitrator would have to bear in mind in assessing the sum payable the amount of rent which would be reserved by a reversionary lease.  Anybody unfortunate enough to be in this situation would certainly bear in mind that the amount of rent payable under a reversionary lease where a lease is expiring could in many cases be perhaps 2,000 per cent greater than the rent already payable.  Under the 1958 Act, as amended, the rent to be fixed on a reversionary lease is the current occupational rent divided by eight.  You could have a case of an old ground rent.  In fact, if a lease is expiring it is probably an old ground rent where the figure payable might be only £5 and the purchase costing under the automatic multiplier would not exceed £40 or £50.  You could find that the amount of rent assessed on a reversionary lease could perhaps be some hundreds of pounds.  The figure so assessed would have to be borne in mind by the arbitrator in fixing the purchase money.</P>
    <P>I suggest, not as the total solution of the problem but as a way of improving the situation, that the entitlement to automatic purchase should be extended to all those with more than one year to run on their leases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 25 years is the period that the lease has to run at the time the purchase price is being determined by arbitration.  If the period is less, under subsection 2 (b) the arbitrator will have regard not only to the current rent but also to the notional rent on renewal.  Similarly, under subsection (3) if the lease has less than 25 years to run the maximum purchase price formula will not apply.  The concept <Col N="553" /> that a lease which has expired or almost expired is more valuable to the landlord who is entitled to an increased rent on termination than a lease with many years to run was introduced in the 1967 Act following a very thorough examination by the Ground Rents Commission.  This can be seen in their report in paragraphs 95 and 129.  I accept that this is fair.  The commission drew the line at 25 years and argued on the basis of the evidence received that when a lease has more than that period to run the landlord's prospect of an increased rent on termination should not be a factor in determining the price.  Whatever argument might be made about the precise cut-off point, whether it might be 20, 25 or 30 years&mdash;although the question if raised would be one for determination by objective evidence rather than by opinion&mdash;there is no doubt that a cut off point of one year would certainly have a confiscatory effect so far as the landlord is concerned and, I might add, might be held to be unconstitutional. If the Deputy's amendment were accepted subsection (6) would have to be amended also because it is consequential on the concept of the 25 years to run.  It provides that when a lease has less than 25 years to run the arbitrator will not ignore the maximum purchase price but will in effect apply it <i>pro rata.</i></P>
      <P>He will add to the maximum purchase price one-twenty-fifth of the difference between that price and a price paid on the reversionary rent for every year less than 25 years that the lease has to run.  I think Deputy O'Keeffe will agree that the figure of 25 is not one that was, as he said, grasped out of the air; it was one that came up after very careful consideration by the commission, and as well as that it is in the 1967 Act.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to look forward 25 years and envisage what the reversionary rent would be, taking into account inflation and the changing values of money.  This amendment was put down because we feel that the spirit of the Bill should be to give the most favourable terms possible to the lessee and to make it <Col N="554" /> as attractive as we can for him to purchase the ground rent.  While the Minister explained the figure of 25 years, it does seem to be looking a long way forward, certainly in so far as the person who would be considering purchasing his ground rent is concerned.  While it may not in the Minister's view be possible to accede to all of this it may be possible to have some compromise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (2), lines 17 to 21, to delete paragraph (g), and substitute the following new paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g) the price paid by the lessor in purchasing the land and the amount of the site fine paid by the lessee,</P>
      <P>(h)  the number of years in which the rent has already been paid by the lessee,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) the costs and expenses, which have been incurred by the lessee due to the failure of the lessor to maintain any local amenities such as gardens, footpaths, playing spaces which he <Col N="555" /> has covenated to do under the terms of the lease,</P>
    <P>(j) the failure of the lessor to make any demand for payment of rent over a period of years.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects to this amendment. Firstly, it proposes the deletion of section 17 (2) (g) and that clause as it stands requires the arbitrator, in fixing the amount to be paid of the purchase price of the ground rent, to take into account the costs and expenses which in the opinion of the arbitrator will be incurred by the landlord in investing the purchase money payable in respect of the acquisition of the fee simple.  It appears that including such a provision really gives an open sesame to a landlord.  In a way he has complete freedom to arrange his reinvestment of the proceeds in any manner or any place he wishes, and this is quite proper and correct.  What he does with his money is his own business and not the householder's business.</P>
    <P>It should not be the householder's business, but because of the inclusion of this clause it is very much the householder's business.  The householder in the case of arbitration will be required to include in the purchase money the figure covering the costs and expenses of the landlord's reinvestment.  This opens up all sorts of possibilities, bearing in mind that there does not appear to be a discretion here.  The word used in the clause is &ldquo;will&rdquo;, so that it is not a question of the costs and expenses which may be reasonably incurred, or any words to that effect; it is a question of the costs and expenses which will be incurred.  Think of the possibilities that might arise out of a shrewd use of that clause by an unscrupulous landlord.  He could give evidence that he intended reinvesting the proceeds in a fishingboat venture in China, and if he gave evidence to that effect he would no doubt give evidence of the considerable expense in so doing, the necessity to get exchange control regulations, the necessity to get people to deal with the problem in China and probably the expense of going to China to look after the completion of his <Col N="556" /> reinvestment.  I accept that the example I am quoting is a little outrageous, but one has at times to be somewhat outrageous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, with respect, the Minister is on the wrong track there because the question of the cost or reinvestment would not arise were the automatic multiplier applied.  It arises only where the automatic multiplier does not arise and we go to arbitration. It is one of the factors to be taken into account by the arbitrator, so that unfortunately in such a situation the trip to China could be on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not be encouraging all the landlords of the country to go on holidays to China. However, if a landlord were reinvesting the proceeds, say, in the national loan, no expense would be involved. Why then should we be, as it were, even encouraging the landlord to invest his moneys in other than the national loan?  I accept that this provision was, as I recollect, in the 1967 Act, but I do not see the need for it.  If the landlord gets his money it is up to him to do what he will with that money.  There certainly should be no obligation on the householder or tenant to have to bear any expense at all in dealing with the landlord's arrangement for reinvestment of the proceeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This clause is couched in fairly strict terms.  Even the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; is not in it.  It states that the arbitrator must take into account costs and expenses which will be incurred.  For that reason I feel fairly strongly that the Minister should consider deleting this clause entirely.  There seems to be no justification for it.  If I cannot press my <Col N="557" /> view totally on the Minister that he should delete it entirely, at least it should be modified.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects to this amendment.  I am suggesting that a number of subclauses be inserted which are not really related to this particular point.  Do you want me to continue to deal with the subclauses which I suggest might be included or do you want us to dispose of this point first?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy to dispose of the whole amendment at this stage.  We take the full amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably the more proper procedure.  We are talking about the clauses which an arbitrator has to bear in mind in assessing the purchase money to be paid by the householder in buying his freehold.  There is a list of them in subsection (2).</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the suggestion that clause (g) be deleted.  The balance of the amendment covers a number of additional items which should be considered by the arbitrator in assessing the purchase price.  These items have been suggested by ACRA and relate to the price paid by the landlord in purchasing land and the amount of the site fine paid by the lessee.  If we accept this portion of the amendment it would mean that the arbitrator would investigate what had been paid by the landlord in the past for the property and in addition the site fine payable by the lessee or his predecessors in title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could have a situation where such an investigation might disclose that many years ago the landlord had paid £1,000 for a site&mdash;that would have been a lot of money 40 or 50 years ago.  On that property over a period he might have built 50 or 60 houses and charged, on average, apart from ground rents, a site fine of £100 for the houses.  If the investigation disclosed that type of information&mdash;and I have no doubt that many developments would disclose a similar type of situation&mdash;it would clearly show that the landlord had been amply compensated over the years for the amount <Col N="558" /> he originally paid for the lands.  The view of ACRA is that such a factor should be borne in mind by the arbitrator in fixing the purchase money. They do not suggest that because of such a situation there should be acquisition without compensation, in effect a confiscation.  Their view is that this is a factor which should be borne in mind by the arbitrator and seems to be a reasonable viewpoint.</P>
    <P>The second additional item we are suggesting should be included under this section is that the arbitrator should bear in mind in fixing the purchase money the number of years in which the rent has already been paid.  I have no doubt that a householder whose father and grandfather have paid rent for their house for a 100 years would feel that that factor should be borne in mind in assessing the purchase price.</P>
    <P>The third factor I am asking to have included is the cost and expenses which the householder may have to bear because of breach of covenant by the landlord.  Whatever viewpoint the Minister might take in relation to the first two items, there can be no possible objection to accepting this provision or, if he accepts it in principle, to having the parliamentary draftsman frame it properly.  This item should be included.  If the landlord has got away with breach of covenant, that is the time to penalise him for it.  &ldquo;Penalise&rdquo; is the wrong word because it is righting the balance between himself and the householder.</P>
    <P>The last item under this amendment is that the arbitrator should take into account the failure of the landlord over a period of years to demand payment of that rent.  If the Minister accepts this in principle, it would probably have to be drafted in more parliamentary language.  The landlord must not care a great deal for his rights in his property if he has not bothered to collect his rents.  He obviously does not have any interest in it and shows very little interest in his entitlement to the ground rents out of it.</P>
    <P>The other inequity which could arise here is that arrears of rent may have been allowed to accumulate over a considerable period.  The ground rent <Col N="559" /> might be £30 which would not put the householder in severe difficulties when paying it in a year, but if he were considering purchasing the house the additional burden of paying very considerable arrears, maybe an extra couple of hundred pounds, might impose an intolerable burden. There could be a situation where this additional burden is put on the tenant when purchasing, solely because the landlord did not bother to collect his rent.  This amendment proposes that this aspect should also be borne in mind in assessing the purchase price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of our amendment calls for the deletion of sub-paragraph (g).  When reading the Bill for the first time this appears to be outlandish.  Deputy O'Keeffe made a case for its deletion and spoke about the possibilities which it could present for the landlords as being outlandish. I could say they were no more outlandish than the possibilities outlined by the Minister when speaking on the Bill in the House before the dissolution of the D·il.  Whether the landlord goes to Canada or Australia, there is no need for us to convince the Minister of this.  This is a matter which came to his notice and on which he dwelt at length when speaking in opposition to the Bill then before the House.  This paragraph should be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to our suggestions for the substitution of new paragraphs, the case can readily be made that from the lessee's point of view the site fine in many cases represents ample compensation for the site.  For many years the tenant has been paying ground rent and there is a case for taking the site fine into account when assessing the purchase price of the land.  There is also a case to be made for taking into account the number of years' rent paid by the lessee.  This varies greatly from one tenant to another.  The whole principle of buying out means paying the ground landlord in advance in perpetuity and it saves him the trouble of collecting the rent.  There is a case to be made for having regard to these <Col N="560" /> factors when assessing the purchase price.</P>
    <P>A strong point can be made in favour of taking into account expenses incurred in providing amenities in an area where the general landlord has neglected to undertake such work.  We are all aware of cases where estates have not been completed and money has been contributed by the lessees in order to make such amenities available.  From the point of view of the purchaser, allowance should be made for this; likewise the failure of the lessor to make any demand for rent over a number of years.  These are relevant matters in fixing the purchase price. We appeal to the Minister to accept our amendments or reasonable substitutes for them.  There are aspects of the fixing of the purchase price which should not be ignored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal briefly with the section which it is proposed to delete.  I cannot see any logical reason for the inclusion of paragraph (g). Rarely can one come across a similar case where the person who disposes of property is responsible for the costs of the person who obtains the money.  Taking the case of a person selling a shop, the person to whom he sells it would have to be responsible for the investment of the money paid to the shopkeeper.  Such a situation would be ludicrous.  There is no basis for it in law or in common sense.  The basic yardstick is common sense.  It is envisaged in the Bill that the tenant who buys out his ground rent must be responsible for the costs of the landlord in investing the money.  If the landlord hires a stockbroker the section appears to provide that the tenant will be responsible for the broker's fees on behalf of the landlord.  I cannot envisage this happening in any other line of business.  The point is so clear that further elaboration is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal to delete paragraph (g) would have the effect that the arbitrator would not be required to take into account in determining the purchase price the costs and expenses of the landlord in <Col N="561" /> investing the purchase money.  The phrase &ldquo;take into account&rdquo; is an important part of that sentence.  The new paragraphs proposed to be inserted would require the arbitrator to take into account various matters in favour of a reduced purchase price.</P>
      <P>The first thing to be said about section 17 (2) is that it consists of a list of considerations which are only a guide to the arbitrator in drawing up the price.  This list is not exhaustive.  The arbitrator is enabled to have regard to such other matters as are in the opinion of the arbitrator relevant to the determination of the purchase price.  Moreover, there are supervening general criteria such as the reference in the introduction of the subsection to what a willing purchaser would give and a willing vendor would accept and the operation of the maximum purchase price provision in subsection (3) which ensures that paragraph (g) of section 17 (2) cannot be relied on to justify an unfairly high purchase price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that some of the matters to be inserted by the amendment are not really relevant to the determination of the proposed purchase price.  For instance, a site fine, if any, paid by the tenant when he purchased the house is irrelevant in determining the value of the property being acquired.  The property is the landlord's interest under that lease. Similarly, the question of how long the rent has been paid or whether it has been demanded is irrelevant.  Anything that is relevant can be adduced in the arbitration.  The criteria set out in section 17 (2) can be described as a package deal.  Its purpose is to evaluate the actual interest being acquired.  It is the same as what is in the 1967 Act and it should not be news to the House that this was also in the lapsed Bill which was introduced by the previous Government.  I am quite satisfied that the package is fair to all parties and certainly has stood the test of time.  It was based on the recommendation of the Ground Rents Commission and made.  I might add, with full regard to the constitutional issues involved.  If it were to <Col N="562" /> be changed, in particular so as to tend significantly towards a lower purchase price, there is no doubt in my mind that it could be held to be confiscatory and would lead to constitutional problems.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the case which Deputies O'Keeffe and Eileen Desmond made for the amendment, I accept that there is a lot in what they said in relation to paragraph (i), which deals with costs and expenses incurred by the lessee due to the failure of the lessor to maintain local amenities such as footpaths which the lessor had promised to do under the terms of the lease.  I have great sympathy in this respect and I am in a position to accept that principle.  I will not put forward a draft here and now, but in fairness to the case made I can accept the validity of the argument.  I assure the House that if we went the whole distance this Bill might see the light of day as an Act but that is as far as it would go because of the constitutional issue.</P>

      <P>Because they are excluded. You are entitled to take advantage of subsection (3) if there is more than a 25-year run on the lease or if the ground does not exceed one <Col N="564" /> acre in area.  There would be no question of arbitration if one were entitled to take advantage of that clause, but if one has to go to arbitration because of not being able to take advantage of that clause the sky could be the limit because of the restrictions laid down in the Bill.  The maximum price, of course, could not apply because the reversionary rent might be taken into account.  Indeed it would have to be taken into account together with the other items listed.  In that context we suggest that the landlord's costs and expenses, even within the limitations suggested by the Minister, plus reinvestment money, should not be taken as a factor.  Deputy Enright quoted an example and so did Deputy Desmond, but they were not as outrageous as the one I cited.  Is there any justification for putting such an imposition on the householder?</P>

      <P>We must remember that the arbitrator will have a quasi-judicial function and it will be his job to come to a decision based on the provisions of the Act.  It is in that context that I put to the Minister the question of why the arbitrator should be bound to bear in mind in assessing the purchase money the expenses incurred by the landlord in reinvesting the proceeds.  In 1965-66 there was a suggestion that the landlord should not be put at a greater financial disadvantage than he had been in prior to the acquisition and that if he was put to the expense of reinvestment such expense should be taken into account or otherwise there was a minor confiscatory element involved.  That was the reasoning when the 1967 Bill was going through the Oireachtas.  Because of the ease and the lack of expense involved in reinvesting, for instance in the national loan, it is difficult to see how the expense can be incurred, because of absence of stamp duty and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> There is an opening whereby the landlord can reinvest the proceeds in a State security with a fair interest and with full guaranteed security.  Why then should the landlord be paid to choose a more expensive way of reinvesting the proceeds?  In the light of what I said on this point the Minister will probably see the logic of it.  Why pay the landlord to do other than to go into the bank and either lodge it in the bank or ask the bank to buy into the national loan for him?  If he has more esoteric plans for his money, that is his business; but the tenant should not be obliged to pay any of the expenses involved in reinvesting the proceeds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>If the amendment sought the cost of the landlord's fees, such as solicitors' costs, I would not consider it to be as outrageous as it is.  I am against the tenant having to pay the landlord's cost This section goes further and proposes that if the landlord gets £12,000, £15,000 or £20,000 for the sale of property the tenant should be responsible for the costs such as stockbroker's fees.  It also appears that he would be responsible for the stamp duty on the Stock Exchange documents.  It is bringing us a long way from the realm of landlord and tenant.  It is highly unusual and I cannot see any merit in it.  Let us consider the converse of the situation.  The Minister has agreed with the amendment proposed by Deputies O'Keeffe and Desmond in relation to paragraph (i).  The converse of the Minister's suggestion is that the cost of investment of the landlord's money be paid by the tenant, but it could equally apply that the landlord would be responsible for the costs of the tenant in renovating the property.  If the Minister had put forward such an amendment, the landlord would have to pay for the costs incurred by the tenant in decorating the property and it would meet with substantial opposition from people who have property.  What is fair on the one hand would appear to be fair on the other.  This section is not fair and the converse of it would be equally unfair. The Minister should seriously consider withdrawing it as there is no merit in it.</P>

However, we cannot escape the fact that costs are relevant to what the landlord is going to get out of any deal.  Even if this subsection were not included, I should ask the House to look at the last paragraph of subsection (i), which reads: &ldquo;such other matters as are, in the opinion of the arbitrator, relevant to the determination of the purchase price.&rdquo;  I cannot accept that it is illogical and should not be there, as Deputy Enright said.  In fairness, I have accepted part of what has been said in principle and I am quite prepared to ask the draftsman to insert an amendment in relation to paragraph (i) of the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8a:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8)  Where the address or present whereabouts of the immediate lessor cannot be ascertained after reasonable enquiry, or where the immediate lessor was a limited company under the Companies Act, 1963 which has been struck off the Register of Companies</P>
      <P>(a)  The purchase price shall be paid to the Registrar of Titles who shall issue a receipt for same,</P>
      <P>(b)  the person entitled to the purchase price shall be entitled to obtain payment of same on application to the Registrar of Titles and on such proof of entitlement of payment as the Registrar of Titles may require.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now we have been dealing with a most interesting section relating to the purchase price.  We are speaking of real purchase money, of a case in which there is no difficulty whatsoever in that I know Mr. X is my landlord and am paying him £100 per year and the fee simple reverts to him.  My purpose in putting down this amendment is to deal with cases where the purchase money would be very small and where the rent could be described as &ldquo;peanuts&rdquo; or a peppercorn rent, which is the legal phrase.  Rents of 5p per year, or even of £1 or £2 per year, are exceptionally small. In many instances the landlord may not be known and he may not have <Col N="568" /> bothered to collect the rents for many years.  In some instances the rents would probably be statute barred.  I am dealing with small rents which may not have been collected by landlords. I am also dealing with big building firms who have erected estates, have then gone into voluntary liquidation and have been taken off the register of companies.  I want to stress that in such instances the purchase price will be paid.  It might only be 50p or 60p.  It might be some very small amount.  The purchase money, whatever it is, is lodged with the Registrar of Titles and the person who is entitled to collect it will have power to go in, prove his title and obtain the purchase money due to him.  Once the purchase price is paid to the Registrar of Titles he will give the vesting certificate we are speaking of.  If one is dealing with a company who have gone into voluntary liquidation or have been struck off the register of companies there is nobody on whom one can serve the notice so the service of notice is entirely irrelevant.</P>
    <P>I was asked by a number of practising solicitors and barristers to put down this amendment.  There are a number of places in counties Laois, Kildare and Cork that this amendment applies to.  They consider that this matter has escaped the attention of the Minister for Justice and his advisers.  It is a small amendment and is not of major consequence.  The rent is so small that the people did not bother to collect it and all that has to be done in this instance is to lodge it with the Registrar of Titles and he will issue the vesting certificates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 17 deals with the determination of the purchase price by arbitration, whether by the county registrar under the 1967 Act or by the Registrar of Titles under section 61 of this Bill.  Accordingly, a proposal which restricts the application of section 17 to section 21 arbitrations in a case where the immediate lessor cannot be ascertained, as this amendment seeks to do, is not acceptable. Though this is only a technical objection to the amendment, I believe the amendment is unnecessary because of <Col N="569" /> an official amendment which is down to section 21, amendment No. 14.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment seeks to provide for the case where an intending purchaser cannot comply with the requirement in section 21 (1) to serve notice on his immediate lessor because that immediate lessor's whereabouts are not known or, as Deputy Enright said, where a limited company as an immediate lessor have ceased to exist, having been struck off the register of companies.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the kind of difficulty he mentioned is being met by amendment No. 14 which in effect makes it clear that the service of notice required by section 21 (1) may be made by sending that notice by registered post addressed to the person to whom the ground rent is paid at the place of payment.  That is all that is needed to set the machinery in motion and enable the Registrar of Titles to deal with the application.</P>
      <P>The provisions in paragraph (b) of the proposed amendment are in any case already met by the provisions of section 22 (7) of the Bill.  The Deputy referred to a situation which could arise where a tenant has paid no ground rent for some time and where none had been demanded and how, where and when the notice can be sent.  I accept that this can arise. Sometimes it can arise and a tenant is in no way to blame.  The fact remains that the rent is legally payable and this constitutes a property right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In drawing up the provisions of the Bill we have been very careful to avoid any measure whatsoever that would be confiscatory for the very obvious reasons we have mentioned more than once during the course of the debate.  We have been careful here not to appear to be confiscatory as, for instance, would be a provision favouring tenants who had not paid their rents.  The fact that rent has not been paid should not be any real problem in the situation envisaged in the amendment.  I believe that sending the notice by registered post to the place where the rent was last paid should suffice to enable the Registrar of Titles to start proceedings.  With regard to the safeguards Deputy Enright was <Col N="570" /> looking for, I am sure they will be provided for by the official amendment, No. 14, to section 21.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with a procedural situation here.  Deputy Enright was concerned that there might be a situation where rent has possibly not been collected for 30 or 40 years. The rent might only be 5p or you sometimes get a rent of a peppercorn or a penny, and it probably has not been collected for 100 years.  I am concerned with that type of situation as well as the difficulties where you might have a landlord who has absconded.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to amendment No. 14 which refers to section 23 of the 1967 Act.  That section provides for serving by registered post. There might not be anybody to whom one could send the notice by registered post.  It is the difficulty of the whereabouts of the landlord or an agent being unknown, or the possibility of a co-operative having been struck off the register and there is no address, that I am concerned about.  How are the wheels to be set in motion in a case like this?</P>
      <P>I know of a case where no rent was collected since the struggle for independence. An attempt was made by an agent to collect the rent in 1924 in the village of Crookhaven and I gather that the agent involuntarily went for a swim in the harbour and nobody has ever collected any rent there since.</P>

We want the Minister to accept that such a situation definitely can arise.  We want to ensure that the householder in such circumstances could start the procedure in motion, if he can show to the Registrar of Titles that he has made an effort to trace the landlord or his known agent to serve notice on him and is unable <Col N="571" /> to do so.  If he can produce a letter to that effect, the registrar would then have discretion as to the service of any further notice.</P>

      <P>It is a very wide area. The Minister has stated that if a person is over 12 years in possession and if he makes an application under section 49 to the Land Registry he can obtain a possessory title, and then if he continues on, he will over the years be able to obtain an absolute title. What I am getting at are minor rents of about 5p.  Some of the big building companies built estates of 100 houses or so in the past and they reserved a rent of 5p and put covenants into the leases.  Some of these companies went into voluntary liquidation and in these instances there is nobody on whom to serve notices.  What the Minister stated about writing to the last address is not at all satisfactory.  I suggest that they write to the last known registered office of a company or to the address of the last known residence of the agent or landlord.  A number of people are trying to get titles into order and they are prevented from doing so.  The amendment I put down will enable them to obtain a vesting certificate from the landlord.  This amendment was put down at very short notice and the Minister may not have had time to consider it.  I trust that the Minister will have more time between now and Report Stage to consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The duration will be limited to five years and I see a lot of difficulty in this.  Some years ago a move was made in regard to the conversion of six-day licences to seven-day licences and this was limited to a period of two years.  Later there was a further amendment which lasted for one year.  Only a small number of people succeeded in availing of that Act.  I have had numerous representations to have that benefit restored&mdash; to convert six-day publicans' licences to seven-day licences.  I am sure the Minister has had similar requests.  By the time people become aware of this Act only a certain percentage of people will be able to avail of it.  I envisage quite a lot of delays in the working of this Act.  If it is to last only for a <Col N="574" /> five-year period, when people realise the delays involved they will consider that it is a waste of time to bother with this procedure, they will leave it over to be done at a later stage, and then they will discover that the five-year period has run out.  Five years is a relatively short period.  I believe that the Minister wishes to get this Bill through, and working, but if he genuinely has goodwill he will have to prove it by extending the five years to a minimum of 25 years.</P>
      <P>I note that Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Mrs. Desmond oppose this section entirely.  Twenty-five years is a long time.  If people have not availed of it in 25 years, well and good.  But a period of five years is especially short.  Irrespective of the publicity this Bill receives in the press, on television or anywhere else, it takes a long time to percolate to the general public that their houses or pieces of land are of benefit to them. The Minister should strongly consider extending the period.  It will not cause the Minister, his Department or anybody else any difficulty and will allow more people avail of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal of Deputy E. Desmond and myself was to abolish the time limit entirely. Deputy Enright has put down a further amendment giving the Minister a safety valve or way out by fixing a medium term.  I do not really see the necessity for a time limit on the operation of this part of the Bill. I do not see any advantage to anybody, householder or landlord, in having such a time limit.  On that basis it seems unnecessary to include this section at all.  But if the Minister sees some justification for the inclusion of a time limit then I would endorse what Deputy Enright said.  I am aware of difficulties or problems that might arise when people might not be able to take advantage of this provision.  There might be a situation that the house in question was owned by a minor or a person of unsound mind who was not at a particular time able to take advantage of the provision.  I suppose one could say it discriminates against such people, because at a particular time they <Col N="575" /> would be unable to take advantage of the benefits but when they had attained majority, or were restored to sound health found that the provisions of the Bill could no longer be availed of.</P>
      <P>There seems to be no justification whatever for a time limit.  However, if the Minister insists, such time limit should be reasonable, and five years is not.  Experience has shown that where time limits have been placed on legislation the majority of people have not been able to take advantage of their rights within such limits.  For that reason I strongly urge the Minister to take a more liberal approach.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy O'Keeffe in that.  I fail to see the reason for the Minister imposing a time limit on this Bill.  It appears to me that what is good for five years should be good thereafter.  The reasons have been advanced for people not availing of the provisions within the proposed five-year period. But unless the Minister can give us a very good reason for imposing a time limit this section should be deleted, and I support that contention.</P>

      <P>In fairness to the profession&mdash;and I would not want Deputy Enright to think I have to defend the profession for him&mdash;I believe a lot can happen in five years. <Col N="576" /> Let us say there was a ground swell for the abolition of ground rents and for the prohibition of future ground rents within a period of less than five years.</P>
      <P>Seemingly there is a misunderstanding here with regard to the five-year period about which we are speaking. The right to buy out the fee simple will not expire after the five-year period mentioned in this Bill.  There is no question whatsoever of that.  Any person who finds&mdash;be it the minor or the person who might be ill about whom Deputy O'Keeffe spoke&mdash;after a period of five years that they cannot operate under this Bill can so operate under the 1967 Bill.  There is very good reason for this five-year period being spelled out in this Bill.  I gave that reason, in fairness to myself, during the course of the Second Reading. It is an encouragement to people to do something about it reasonably soon. We are giving them five years within which their legal costs are substantially reduced.  I believe that little bargain they are getting in the way of legal fees will be seen by these people anxious to buy out their ground rents, when they know, as they will know, that that is in operation for a five-year period they will want to avail of it.  Other difficulties could be encountered.  If we tried to keep a section of a Department there waiting for people to come in any time over the next 25 years that Deputy Enright mentioned, that might not be the right approach to the problem at all.</P>
      <P>I was very definite that this scheme for the buying out of ground rents at this greatly reduced bargain will be in operation for five years.  If the people want to avail of it, I am sure they will. If, for some reason, they cannot&mdash;as was mentioned by Deputy O'Keeffe&mdash; then they will have to rely on the provisions of the 1967 Act.</P>

I am trying to <Col N="577" /> cater for the people who are slow in getting things done.  People should get things done quickly, but I would be inclined to look after the people who never seem to get round to looking after themselves.  That is human nature. It is those people I should like to try to help.  The Minister is setting up a section of his Department specifically for this purpose to which a very large section of the community will come over the next four years or so and there will probably be an influx at the beginning.</P>

Would the Minister be prepared to put on record that, in the event that there are substantial representations to have this part of the Bill extended in years to come and on the basis that the Minister still holds the portfolio he does at present, or is in a position to influence such a situation, he would agree that this simplified procedure should be available in the future if there is a substantial number of householders who could avail of it?</P>

I put it in deliberately and I spelled out the reason why very definitely during the Second Reading. I think my argument then was accepted. Certainly Deputy Barry Desmond agreed with me this was the right approach.  If I were to say I will have regard to the situation at the end of five years I should be taking away from the value of it new.

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 23, to delete &ldquo;constructed for use&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;used&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section deals with the situation where permanent buildings are constructed for use wholly or principally as a dwelling and such land is referred to in this Act as a dwellinghouse.  This confines this part of the Bill to dwellings and I am not entirely satisfied as to how we define a dwelling. According to the Bill as it stands a householder would have to prove for what purpose the dwelling had been constructed.  I have sought the views of a number of people who have had experience of the 1967 Act and I have been told that in the main, and I suppose the same thing applies here, most of the properties will be fairly old, maybe 100 or 200 years old, and how could anyone say for what use such properties were constructed. <Col N="579" /> Many premises now used as offices were originally constructed as private residences and <i>vice versa.</i>  How could one prove or rebut claims?  This could provide considerable scope for disputes and arbitrations.  My suggestion is that instead of saying &ldquo;constructed for use&rdquo; we simply say &ldquo;used&rdquo;.  If the premises are used as a dwellinghouse surely the householder should be able to take advantage of this provision. Why would it be necessary for him to prove that 100 years ago the premises was constructed as a dwellinghouse? It might have been constructed as a store and converted so that it is now a dwellinghouse.  The section is unnecessarily restrictive and it could provide a basis for dispute, arbitration and litigation.  My amendment is designed to relate the section solely to existing use.  If a householder is using a dwelling as a dwellinghouse he should be entitled to the benefit of the section without having to prove the building was constructed for use as a dwellinghouse. We are discussing the Minister's amendment with my amendment.</P>

      <P>The difficulty about the Minister's amendment is that the solution he proposes is to include the words &ldquo;and are so used&rdquo;.  His amendment makes the situation even more restrictive.  If it is accepted it merely illustrates the point that the dwelling must be used as a dwelling and at the same time one must prove for what purpose it was constructed&mdash;in other words, one must prove it was constructed for use as a dwelling.  The Minister's amendment makes the situation even more restrictive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of the opinion that the difference is only a question of drafting.  The wording of the official amendment is preferred.  Section 19 confines the application of the new scheme under Part III to dwelling-houses and this is expressed by reference to permanent buildings which are constructed for use wholly or principally as a dwelling.  By using the <Col N="580" /> present tense here it was intended that the present character of the building rather than the purpose for which it was erected would be the determining factor.  However, in the light of the Deputy's amendment, it is thought desirable to clarify the position and the amendment will ensure that before the tenant will qualify for Part III benefits the building must not only have been put up originally as a dwelling but is still used as such.  A ground rent tenant of offices in Merrion Square, for example, which had at one time been a dwelling will not be able to avail of Part III.  He will have the alternative procedure under the 1967 Act available to him.  That does not involve any subvention from the State. I think there is no difference between us really.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is jumping ahead of me.  I am not accepting his amendment.  I would refer the Deputy to what the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said.  In circumstances like this the Leas-Cheann Comhairle held the view the Deputy would withdraw his amendment and accept mine.  I would like to refer the Deputy to the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1977.  The Deputy may not have this readily available to him but section 2 provides:</P>
      <P>Subject to subsection (2) a lease of lands made after the passing of this Act shall be void if the lessee would, apart from this section, have the right under section 3 of the Act of 1967 to enlarge his interest into a fee simple&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Here now is the relevant part.</P>

      <P>The ministerial amendment relates to the present use. The Minister referred to the use of the words &ldquo;are constructed&rdquo;.  I do not see how that can be defined other than by going back to the time it was built. Why should somebody who wants to take advantage of this section have to prove how a 100-year old or a 150-year old building was constructed? Why should he be restricted from taking advantage of this section because of the fact that 100 years ago the building may have been constructed for another purpose and that was subsequently converted to a dwellinghouse? I will not push the case further than that.  I do not see the logic of including the word &ldquo;constructed&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In page 11, lines 29 and 30, to delete &ldquo;Registrar of Titles&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;County Registrar for the relevant area&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very conscious of the importance of this amendment.  It goes to the root of the Bill.  The Registrar of Titles who will take over the working of this Bill is the person who is in charge of the Land Registry offices attached to the Four Courts in Dublin.  The Minister for Justice should visit those offices.  The staffing situation with regard to overcrowding is something that has to be seen and experienced <Col N="583" /> to be believed.  The staff are working under the most difficult conditions. The situation is reaching chronic proportions with regard to the workload they have to carry and to ask them to take on extra work and to try to accommodate additional staff could have very serious effects.</P>
    <P>Nowadays practically every person has the expectation of owning his own home.  Therefore, these people must obtain title documents, Land Registry certificates and maps and other documentation.  All this work goes through the Land Registry offices in Dublin.  Previously much of the property in areas throughout the country was vested in the local authority and the data was on one key map. Nowadays it is entirely different.  The amount of additional work in the Four Courts has caused considerable delays.</P>
    <P>I visit the Land Registry quite frequently and the staff are as courteous and as efficient as one could find.  To lumber this additional work on them will create a situation where there could be a complete breakdown in the system.  I will give the House one example of the overcrowding in the Four Courts and it is no pleasure for me to have to say it in the House. I hope that it will not be taken out of context by anyone.</P>
    <P>The taxpayers are paying for ten High Court judges but there are only eight courtrooms available in the Four Courts for those High Court judges. Occasionally the eighth judge has a second court available but the present situation is that one High Court judge has to say at home because there is no room available for him to hear cases in the Four Courts.  The salary of a High Court judge is in the region of £12,000.  It is beyond comprehension that the question of accommodation has not been remedied.  It worries me to think that we will now have more people going down there.</P>
    <P>If a High Court case is put down for trial to-day it is generally accepted that it will not be heard in 1978.  The backlog of High Court cases in the Four Courts is so great that it takes from nine to 12 months for one to be <Col N="584" /> heard.  Because of that the Minister should have another look at this section because there is not sufficient room for registrars attached to the High Court in that building.  There is no room to take on additional registrars for High Court judges.  The fact that a High Court judge who is paid for out of public funds has nowhere to work is beyond my comprehension. We have now reached the stage where about 50 more people will be seeking accommodation in the Four Courts.  It should be remembered that those 50 people will be seeking accommodation in a building where there is not sufficient room to conduct normal business.</P>
    <P>If the Minister proceeds on this basis he will only have about 10 per cent of the cases through inside five years.  He will be left with such a backlog that people will lose interest in trying to purchase their ground rent. The passing of this Bill presents the Minister with a glorious opportunity to continue with decentralisation.  We have had forced decentralisation and we have had the decentralisation of sections of the Department of Lands to Castlebar and sections of the Department of Education to Athlone.  In relation to this Bill staffs are available in all counties in county registrars' offices to deal with the cases that will arise.  At present they deal with rent cases arising out of the 1967 Act.  It is possible that it will be necessary to employ some additional staff but the employment of extra staff would be of benefit to the various towns.</P>
    <P>One thing that annoys me about this Bill is that the people from Cork, Mayo or Donegal who have difficulties in relation to ground rent cases must travel to Dublin to the Registrar of Titles to explain their case.  That is not good enough.  I seriously question the wisdom of putting in such a provision. Those cases could be dealt with locally.  The Minister may say that I am being political in raising this matter but that is not the case.  I want the system to be fair to all people and I want it to work.  I do not want to see more congestion in the Four Courts.  I can assure the Minister that in five years' time he will tell me that I was correct.  In proceeding in this <Col N="585" /> manner the Minister is making the Act unworkable.  I understand that in Cork every year 75 applications in relation to ground rents under the 1967 Act are heard.  I am sure a similar situation exists throughout the country but those cases must now be heard in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what Deputy Enright has said.  We are talking about changing from county registrars dealing with ground rents, as they have done under the 1967 Act and as it was proposed they would do under the National Coalition Bill, to their being dealt with by the Registrar of Titles.  The Minister must know of the problems that exist in relation to the state of the Land Registry which, through no fault of the staff, is on the verge of a breakdown.  The delays in the Land Registry at present are dreadful and it is very difficult to envisage how, because of its present difficulties, it can be the base to assist in a large-scale purchase of ground rents by householders.  The work there is very heavy and increasing.  The office is understaffed and the accommodation is totally inadequate, and that is the institution we are asking to implement this Bill.  It is a vehicle with a very flat tyre.  Its condition is so bad that merely replacing the tyres is not sufficient and I suggest we should replace the vehicle with the tried and trusted one of the county registrars' offices scattered throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a rural Deputy, I can clearly see the advantages of having the county registrar available to people in their <Col N="586" /> own counties.  Whatever we say about the simplicity of this Bill, I can say as a lawyer, having studied the Bill and amendments to it, it is not so simple. It is a very complex measure, as any Bill dealing with landlords and tenants is, and probably must be.  We are on top of the Bill here today because we have studied it and we are in the white heat of discussion about it but the ordinary person will not be able to understand the ins and outs of it unless he puts a lot of study into it.</P>
    <P>This is important to somebody in a rural area.  Let us not make it political, the 1967 Bill was brought in by the Minister's own party predecessor and he provided that arbitration would be held before the local county registrar.  The National Coalition Minister, Senator Cooney, was in fact extending the use of the county registrar rather than introducing a new concept.  So, we are not being poltical in suggesting that the Minister should go back merely because it was a National Coalition Bill.  Quite genuinely, as a rural Deputy I have no doubt that having the facilities available to people in their own counties will be far more convenient, far less expensive and will probably involve far more people availing of the facilities.</P>
    <P>The question of decentralisation arises.  People will have to be employed in relation to this measure. With the swelling numbers in this capital city every effort should be made to decentralise and have additional people employed in the country areas, in the other towns and cities, rather than add to the problems of an already overcrowded Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is another major point I must ask the Minister to consider.  I have had it looked into fairly extensively and obtained some advice on it.  It is whether the whole question of having the Registrar of Titles deal with this part of the Bill and in particular with arbitrations under it is constitutional. I am quite serious about this.  I am not raising any scares about it and I want the Minister to look into it very carefully. Section 21 (1), (2) and (3) provide for the appointment of the Registrar of Titles as arbitrator to determine <Col N="587" /> (a) the legal rights of an applicant to require the fee simple, (b) the price to be paid by the applicant for that acquisition and (c) the vesting of the fee simple in the entitled applicant. Further, section 25&mdash;I am dealing with the whole question of the Registrar of Titles rather than the county registrar &mdash;provides that all the powers and duties under the Act of the Registrar of Titles may be exercised and performed by such of his officers as the Minister may authorise.  That would imply that civil servants in the Department of Justice would be doing this or alternatively some people in the Land Registry.  I am not sure what is involved but it certainly involves some people in a civil service capacity being authorised to deal with these applications.</P>
    <P>I am raising a point on the constitutionality of the Registrar of Titles dealing with this part of the Act and particularly with arbitration.  I do so bearing very much in mind that the question of constitutionality was raised when the 1967 Act was under discussion in this House as a 1965 Bill.  The contributions that were made then are very relevant in the context of this discussion. At that time it was agreed on all sides that in fact the county registrar would, in carrying out arbitrations, be carrying out judicial functions, and it was maintained after much discussion that this would not cause any problem because the county registrar was a judicial officer.  If that was the basis of the constitutionality of the county registrar carrying out arbitrations under the 1967 Act, is it now suggested that the Registrar of Titles is a judicial officer?</P>
    <P>What is the position of the county registrar as opposed to the Registrar of Titles?  The county registrar and his predecessor who was Clerk of the Crown and Peace was authorised by Acts of Parliament to carry out judicial and semi-judicial functions.  He was a court officer as defined by the Court Officers Act, 1926 but the registrar of the Land Registry is not a court officer.  He is appointed under the Registration of Titles Act.  One must look at the qualifications for a county registrar.  He must before <Col N="588" /> appointment be somebody actually practising or who has previously practised as solicitor for not less than eight years.  To be appointed Registrar of Titles I accept the candidate must have practised his profession for ten years but that period can include service in a civil service situation, so that in fact the Registrar of Titles may never have had any court practice.  I imagine that he never had such practice&mdash;I am not quite certain; I am not talking of the individuals involved. I do not even know personally the present Registrar of Titles but under the terms of his appointment he need not necessarily have had any practice as solicitor or barrister.  How then can this be a person capable of conducting arbitrations if he has never had any expertise in that field?</P>
    <P>Going back to the type of work involved we must bear in mind that very complex issues can arise in these arbitrations.  In this Bill we try to cover the ground as best we can but there are types of issues that the Minister possibly has not even considered, complex legal issues relating to whether the land is ancillary or subsidiary, whether buildings were improvements, whether buildings were erected in breach of covenant, whether buildings were erected by the person at the time entitled to the lessee's interest.  At the moment oral evidence under the 1967 Act has to be taken in many cases from architects, engineers, surveyors, valuers and all types of experts.  Inevitably, this has resulted in involved legal argument and interpretation of legal documents.</P>
    <P>Generally then it seems that at the moment the right of the county registrar to conduct arbitrations under the 1967 Act is unchallenged; it is accepted that as a court officer he is constitutionally clearly entitled to carry out his functions under the 1967 Act and would be clearly entitled to carry out the functions under this Bill.  What is the situation?  The county registrar, as I know the working of it, has to carry out these functions in person, but we have a county registrar in every county and because of that the work-load is spread under the existing Act and he is able to carry out these functions in <Col N="589" /> person.  I cannot under any circumstances envisage that the Registrar of Titles, with all the work concentrated here in Dublin, would be able to carry out the work in person even if he were constitutionally entitled to do so. Section 25 provides that his powers can be delegated to somebody else without, apparently, any qualifications of any description.  It states:</P>
    <P>All or any of the powers and duties conferred or imposed on the Registrar of Titles by this Part may be exercised and performed by such of his officers as the Minister may authorise in that behalf.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the word &ldquo;his&rdquo; relates to the officers of the Minister or the officers of the Registrar of Titles, but irrespective of that it would be to a civil servant directly under the Minister in his own Department or indirectly in the Land Registry.  That person would be carrying out a judicial function if he is hearing arbitrations.  I accept that other aspects would not involve judicial functions.</P>
    <P>In the main I have to ask the Minister to give very serious consideration as to how this is going to be done and to consider whether it is constitutional to have the powers, particularly powers of arbitration, exercised by the Registrar of Titles.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with the question whether it is the county registrar in the area or the Registrar of Titles in Dublin who is going to deal with the matter.  I have covered the ground but at this stage I am referring to the question of constitutionality, apart from the other points that have been raised in relation to the existing situation in the Land Registry, the principle of decentralisation and so forth.  It is a very serious point and must have very serious consideration. Apart from the constitutionality of the situation, I suggest it is best to go back to the tried and tested way, to decentralise the work by giving it to the county registrar in the county in question rather than place the entire work on the Registrar of Titles in the Land Registry in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to this debate with no rigid views as to whether the Registrar of Titles or the county registrar is the more appropriate for the purposes of the operation of this Bill.  I am prepared to accept that the expert advice available to the Minister led him to the view that the Registrar of Titles was best fitted to deal with it.  However, Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Enright raised very serious questions and they have brought their own professional expertise to make their case very forcibly in favour of the county registrar's office.  I do not attempt to improve on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am concerned about is the additional staff which the Minister has told us he will make available.  I hope that the facilities, the space and so on in the office of the Registrar of Titles will be such as to make for comfort and proper working facilities for the civil servants engaged in the operation of this provision in the Bill and that a proper service will be provided for the people availing of the terms of the Bill.  In the past we have not had a good record of providing facilities for the work which increased legislation brings about.  I am thinking now, for instance, in terms of recent legislation in the area of family law where facilities are still not available to ensure that the Act is operated as it should be.  I <Col N="591" /> want to ensure that we do not have a similar situation with regard to the operation of this Bill.  Other Deputies have said that delays in the office of the Registrar of Titles have in the past been as long as three years.  When I first came into public life we had three-year delays in that office with regard to ordinary dealings and I want to ensure that this will not happen again.  Are we to take the Minister's word that he will increase the staff according to the needs of the volume of work created by this Bill?  I would like to ensure that the facilities required for that staff will be made available to the office, and I would like to ensure that there will be no undue delay in so far as the proceedings of the applicants under this Bill are concerned. If the Minister will assure me of this I will be prepared to accept his view that the Registrar of Titles is the appropriate officer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): As I understand this Bill, the object of it is to facilitate the purchase of ground rents by occupier-tenants and to simplify the legal machinery for vesting the ground landlord's interest in the occupying tenant.  In my opinion the procedure under which the officer who will implement the legal procedure and vest the landlord's interest in the tenant is to be the Registrar of Titles in Dublin will not in any way simplify or cheapen the legal procedures involved.  I ask the Minister to listen seriously to this side of the House on this topic.  I am speaking as a person with considerable legal experience but I am also speaking as a rural Deputy familiar with country people and with very considerable experience of the capacity of country people to grasp legal problems and to explain them to legal men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say with all due respect to the Minister that, in the immortal words of a former Deputy of this House, the procedure to change over to the Registrar of Titles in Dublin is daft, and daft in the extreme.  Instead of simplifying procedure it will complicate it. I believe that the Minister has in mind that the Registrar of Titles will take over from the solicitor and that it will <Col N="592" /> no longer be necessary for the tenant who is buying out to instruct a solicitor and in that way he will save a fair amount of legal costs.  I am convinced that the procedure which the Minister has adopted will make the employment of a solicitor absolutely essential.  What the Minister is asking the tenant to do is to go up to Dublin, find out where Chancery Place is, go in to the Registrar of Titles, start talking to an individual he has never seen before, explain his business to him and transact his business in Dublin.  That is simply not on.</P>
    <P>Many country people rarely come to Dublin.  Some of them come to Dublin only a few times in their lifetime.  They find it difficult enough to find their way to Dublin but to put on them the burden of finding Chancery Place, going into the huge building where there are hundreds or even thousands of people employed, but still not half enough, and find out the section in the Land Registry which will deal with their business, make an appointment, stand in a queue, eventually find the Registrar of Titles or his deputy and start explaining and transacting their business with him, is not on.  The Minister is going to drive the purchasing tenant into the office of a local solicitor. Maybe, as a solicitor, although I am not practising now, I should not be objecting to that but let us be clear and approach this thing in a common-sense way.  What is going to happen? Is there any hope of somebody in Bunbeg, Blacklion, Newcastle West or some place in Cork, getting on a train or bus, getting his title deeds out of the bank or wherever they are and going to the Registrar of Titles in Dublin to do this job?  There is not a hope of getting that job done the same day.  He will go to the local solicitor, instruct him and this will not be cheapened one bit.  If this was necessary I could understand it but it is not.</P>
    <P>In every county town there is a land registry which contains the folios of every bit of registered property in that county.  There is also a county registrar who invariably is a solicitor who has practised in that county, who is familiar with the type of people living there and has, perhaps, for over <Col N="593" /> 20 years or more been dealing with them as a solicitor.  He is there to perform many functions.  Sometimes he is the probate registrar, he is invariably the local sheriff and he is the registrar of the Circuit Court.  He does all this kind of work because it is his job.  His office is usually situated in a central place in the county.  I cannot understand why the Minister does not follow the precedent set by his Fianna F·il predecessor in 1967 and the National Coalition Minister when he more recently drafted the Bill, and leave this to the county registrar.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this is the Minister's idea.  I believe he is being advised by somebody or some group of people that this is the way to do it, for one reason or another.  I am convinced that whoever is advising the Minister is not taking into account the convenience of the people of Ireland who will have to get this work done.  They are not taking into account the expenditure that will be imposed on these people.</P>
    <P>We are told that the fee will be £5 and £12.  What is the return fare by train or bus from Cork to Dublin?  Is there any guarantee that when a person comes from Cork or Donegal he will get his business done that day, that the person he wants to see will be available or that he will have all the information needed for that man?  Is it not quite likely that the first trip to the great city of Dublin and Chancery Place will be in the form of a preliminary skirmish or investigation and the most he can expect to get that day will be a list of requirements?  He returns to Cork or Donegal and sees his bank manager, the rent agent or somebody else and gets the rest of the information he needs.  He then comes back to Dublin and as likely as not he will find that the officer dealing with his case is out sick, or is at his grandmother's funeral, or for some reason or another he is not available.  If he hangs around the office until closing time he will miss the bus and will have to stay overnight in an hotel in Dublin, if he is familiar enough with the city to find an hotel.  He might even spend the night walking around.  That may sound funny but it would not be very amusing for the poor man who finds himself in this predicament.  When you <Col N="594" /> pursue this to its logical conclusion I concede that it becomes farcical.</P>
    <P>If people from rural Ireland have an appointment to see a specialist in Dublin they are brought up in an ambulance.  Why?  First, because of the cost and, second, if they were left to their own devices it could take them two or three days to find the place they were looking for.  This section is absurd in the extreme.  I respectfully suggest that the Minister should not be so concerned about the convenience of officers who are well paid to do this business but should have more consideration for the ordinary plain people of rural Ireland who will have to avail of this service.  The people of Dublin will not have to go to Cork, Cavan or Donegal.  They will transact their business within a bus ride of the Land Registry while the rural people will be dragged up to Dublin.  I am as certain as I can be of anything that the best way of making the legal profession indispensable in this business is to centralise it and to say that everything will be done in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We all have experience of the Land Registry in Dublin.  I do not find fault with the Registrar of Titles or his staff because they are doing their best but they are years in arrears.  Even when country solicitors are dealing with the Land Registry delays can be interminable. Questions and queries can be raised and the business goes on and on, but for the ordinary layman to transact this business with the Land Registry in Dublin is daft in the extreme.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Mrs. Desmond said there are delays there of three years.  It takes a long time to get a map.  I cannot give the exact times of the delays but people are coming to me in my capacity as a TD asking me to make representations to get things hurried up in the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that although the Government are paying lipservice to decentralisation there is some agency within the Government determined to centralise everything.  I will give an example of this.  We recently dealt with the European Elections Bill and argued it out for several days.  The principal suggested amendment was to have a <Col N="595" /> count in each county instead of centralising the entire count in one place in a huge constituency such as Munster, Connacht or Ulster, the last two in particular.  The Minister for the Environment would not yield on that.  He insisted that the count would take place in one huge centre rather than according to the method provided for presidential elections where the count is held in each county.</P>
    <P>I believe&mdash;and I have good information on this&mdash;that already the Custom House has realised that the holding of two elections on the same day has become impossible.  This is why the Taoiseach said yesterday that two elections should not be held on the same day.  It is now realised that ballot papers would be mixed up, that there would be confusion and that someone might be defeated in a local election while two or three ballots in his favour might be 60 or 70 miles away.  The Government would not accept our advice and we will be forced to have only one election on one day.  I am asking the Minister to reconsider this.  This is not a political matter; it is a matter of the convenience of people who will be availing of this Bill and whatever money will be saved by the procedures laid down in the Bill will be wasted on bus fares between Cork and Dublin and by overnight stays in Dublin and by the waste of the time of a tradesman or farmer or some other gainfully employed person.  This procedure would not stand up to any serious consideration.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to tell us what virtue he sees in shifting the venue from provincial Ireland, from the county town where machinery exists, as it has done since 1898, to one big office in Dublin which is already overworked and understaffed and which has not sufficient space?  I should like to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Deputy Enright and Deputy Fitzpatrick and the other two Deputies said with regard to this being non-political. <Col N="596" /> There is no question of politics in this. It is obvious from the approach of the four Deputies that we are poles apart in our thinking as to how best the Bill can be put into operation.  Before I go into detail I would say to Deputy Enright regarding his comments on the Land Registry that I accept that it was understaffed.  However, I provided a large number of staff at the first opportunity to deal with arrears of work.  I have not the exact figure but a substantial number of additional staff were brought in by me shortly after I assumed office.</P>
      <P>With regard to the additional staff required to do the work envisaged in this Bill, I have already said that sufficient staff will be made available.  I appreciate that overcrowding exists in the Land Registry at present, but the additional staff who will implement this Act will have separate accommodation and this is being arranged.</P>
      <P>Regarding comments by Deputy Enright in relation to the courts, High Court judges and so on, I recently had meetings with the President of the High Court and he did not tell me that because of lack of facilities any judge of the High Court had to go home and work there.  I recently had meetings with the staff association representing registrars and neither did they tell me that they had not offices in which to work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling the House the situation as I see it.  I have no doubt that Deputy Enright spoke in good faith.  There is a certain shortage of accommodation and it is hoped that an additional courtroom will be available within six or eight weeks for High Court work.  This should ease the situation somewhat, though I am not sure that the situation is as bad as Deputy Enright was led to believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope we do not give the wrong impression to the public at large that High Court judges earning £12,000 a year have no place to work and must go home.  That would not be fair to the judiciary.  I know the Deputy did <Col N="597" /> not mean it in that way but one has a responsibility in talking about these things.  I think there is a question on the Order Paper from Deputy O'Keeffe regarding this matter and we will go into it in more detail then.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with staffing and accommodation. I might mention the output of work of those already in the Land Registry.  I am presently trying to establish the additional work in the Land Registry as a result of representations by various people, including Members of the Oireachtas, to have cases dealt with speedily.  I venture a guess at this stage&mdash;I deliberately use the word &ldquo;guess&rdquo;&mdash;that at least 25 per cent of the delay in the Land Registry is probably due to the fact that they are replying to and dealing with representations.  When I have the result of that examination I will make it known to Deputy Fitzpatrick and the House.  It was with this in mind that on Second Stage I spelled out clearly that there would not be any queue jumping as far as buying out ground rents is concerned, that they will be dealt with in order as they come in.  There is a great deal of time being wasted because of queue jumping in land registration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright referred to 75 cases dealt with in a particular year by the Cork County Registrar under the 1967 Act.  The situation is that in the first two months after the commencement of that Act there were only 24 applications in Cork and in 1974 there were only 17.  That is hard information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can find out the figures.  It is only right to say that the case made by both parties opposite was <Col N="598" /> extreme.  Indeed I might say it was bordering on the ridiculous because of the examples given.  It is not necessary for anybody to travel from west Kerry or west Donegal to Chancery Street. The price of a postage stamp is no different in those areas from what it is in Newbridge in County Kildare.  Perhaps other measures could be taken to see that the arbitrator would be in a position to move to centres like Limerick, Cork and Sligo.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy O'Keeffe that I am a rural Deputy and as much concerned with decentralisation as anybody.  I replied to that argument on Second Stage.  I am interested in any efforts to bring about decentralisation but that is an extremely delicate issue of more than ordinary concern.  My entire approach to the machinery of the Bill is that it will work, and having examined the structures concerned I have reached one conclusion, that the county registrars could not possibly cope with the expected response to the scheme.  When the Bill was introduced by my predecessor, Senator Cooney, I said on Second Stage that I would doubt that using the county registrar's offices was the proper way to operate the scheme.  I said I had grave reservations that they would be able to set up the necessary machinery. Since assuming office I have had plenty of opportunities to examine the matter and I am convinced that the county registrars could not possibly cope with the potential number of applications, which could run to a quarter of a million cases.  Perhaps when the last Government were preparing the Bill they believed the county registrars could operate it because there would not be such a response.  I am not trying to make politics out of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was replying to the Second Stage debate I got the impression that a number of Deputies did not appreciate that the use of county registrars' offices would require the availability of the county registrars' office staffs.  Such staffs, general service personnel, are not legally qualified and indeed I understand that some county registrars' offices have very serious arrears of work.  The task of examining <Col N="599" /> title in a fee simple purchase or of acting as arbitrator is one for experienced and qualified personnel and in circumstances such as this it would be difficult, if at all possible, for large numbers of applications to be dealt with in county registrars' offices.  Today it would not be easy to recruit qualified staff and even if it were possible to do so it would be grossly uneconomic.  I believe the expertise and qualifications necessary to operate this Bill are all available in the Land Registry and I have already taken steps to provide additional staff to deal with applications under this scheme.  There is no twisting my arm in regard to the operation of this scheme.  I have said I am concerned about decentralisation but I am convinced the system provided for in the Bill is by far the best.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  With regard to that very important point, I have taken advice in regard to constitutionality and it is that we are not contravening the Constitution in any way.  I double checked on that because of the importance of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come back on a number of things.  I have no doubt that there is a serious question of constitutionality involved here.  It is not just the workings of the ordinary buying out.  In relation to the arbitration section, an arbitrator is carrying out judicial functions.  I believe that constitutionally an arbitrator must be a judicial officer.  Section 25 deals with conferring powers, which can be performed by such of his officers as the Minister may authorise.  I am not quite sure whether the &ldquo;his&rdquo; relates to the officers in the Land Registry or officers of the Minister and the Department of Justice.  This could involve the messenger boy in the Department being authorised to carry out arbitration. That is an outrageous example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can tell the Minister that every arbitration under the 1967 Act has to be carried out personally by the county registrar.  If there are to be 250,000 <Col N="600" /> people, according to the Minister's estimate, using the benefits of this Bill there will be a substantial proportion of them who will have to arbitrate to secure their rights.  It is not possible for the Registrar of Titles, a man already overworked in other areas, to personally carry out those arbitrations.  We are then left with a situation that we are providing for a procedure which is physically impossible for the Registrar of Titles to carry out, and it is unconstitutional if it is carried out by somebody else.  It may be unconstitutional to have a Registrar of Titles carrying out this function, because he is not a judicial officer.  That would wipe out the whole arbitration section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the question of dealing with arbitration&mdash;the Minister and his postage stamp and the £12 fee&mdash; the Minister seems to have overlooked the fact that in arbitration you have to produce evidence.  If you have to produce evidence you must bring witnesses. As a west Cork man, I can tell him that it is far cheaper to bring witnesses into the city of Cork or to the local courthouse, to which the county registrar travels, rather than bringing architects, surveyors and valuers up to Dublin.  The enormous cost involved in doing this is an additional imposition on the householder.</P>
    <P>This is a further point in favour of having this power exercised by the county registrar in his own county. Under the 1967 Act the county registrar travels around to towns in his county.  I have seen him travelling to the towns in my county and conducting arbitrations under the 1967 Act.  I have appeared before him in arbitrations in the town of Skibbereen and I am aware that he has gone to arbitrations in many of the other towns in the county.  I cannot envisage that the Registrar of Titles, with all his other duties, could physically cope with the job of going as a journeyman arbitrator all over the country.  If he is constitutionally entitled to do this job, if the mountain does not come to Mohammed the reverse must apply.  Additional expense is being put on the householder. This is an additional argument in <Col N="601" /> favour of decentralisation.  I feel very strongly about this section.  The Minister is badly advised to centralise all those powers in the Land Registry and I strongly oppose this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Nothing could be clearer than that this proposal to centralise the administration of justice and the administration of this Act in Dublin is contrary to the whole trend in the administration of justice in this State for the last 40 years.  After the establishment of the State appeals from the Circuit Court were heard in Dublin only.  That was regarded as unsatisfactory. In the late thirties the procedure was changed and High Court judges and Supreme Court judges started to go out on circuit to every county town in Ireland and to hear circuit appeals there for the convenience of the litigants and the legal profession and in the interests of economy.  That was a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>In the last ten to 15 years the High Court started moving out from the city of Dublin and sat in Limerick, Cork, Galway and several other venues throughout the State in the interests of the litigants involved and in the interest of economy.  Up to a few years ago the court of the Land Commission, the lay commissioners, rarely sat outside Dublin.  In the last few years the trend has been for them to go out and sit in practically every county town in Ireland where cases are to be heard for the convenience of the people.  We have here a complete reversal of that policy and a return to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks about the difficulty involved in setting up machinery in the provincial towns to do this work. The machinery is already there, because in 99 per cent of the cases the local county registrar is also the district registrar of titles and has custody of the folios of every bit of registered land in his county.  It may be that he will have to get more staff.  In pursuance of the policy of bringing justice nearer to the man affected, the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was increased in my time from something like £300 to £600 and from £600 to £2,000. I hear the Minister is talking about <Col N="602" /> further increasing it in order that as many cases as possible may be heard in rural Ireland for the convenience of the people concerned.  There is a complete change in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I may have provoked a bit of amusement when I last spoke.  However, although the incidents I gave may seem funny and may seem unreal, I am convinced the Minister will live to see the day, if this Act operates, that if people are to operate it without a solicitor they will come to Dublin to get their work done.  There will be affidavits and deeds will have to be inspected.  The people will come to Dublin, even when there is no arbitration. I am satisfied that the people will come to Dublin to see the person they are dealing with.  If you come without an appointment the official may be busy and may not be able to see you. Anybody who has any experience of going to the Estate Duty Office or the Land Commission without an appointment knows that frequently the person one wants to see is not available.  I am convinced that if this Act is to be operated without a solicitor it will be operated on a person to person basis, on an across the counter basis, between the client and the official dealing with it.  But if there is arbitration, as Deputy O'Keeffe has quite rightly pointed out, and if there are arbitration provisions in this Act, how is the Registrar of Titles to arbitrate without the individuals concerned appearing before him and giving evidence?</P>
    <P>This is the craziest thing ever.  We are told that the Minister visualises something like 250,000 people involved in this.  Did it strike the Minister that a big percentage of these will already be in the city of Dublin?  The vast amount of ground rent transactions is already concentrated in Dublin.  At any rate, one-third of the population of the country is within ten miles of Chancery Place.  They will be all right because they are already in Dublin.  I do not know what percentage.  If the Minister says there are 250,000 people, I have no way to dispute that.  However, I would say that a substantially bigger number will be already catered for in and around Dublin city.  It is the people living 50 to 200 miles away <Col N="603" /> from Dublin I am concerned about and the Minister, as a rural Deputy, should be concerned about.  If we take the people who will be dealt with in Dublin and if we divide the remaining people by 25 or 26 we will not find that there will be an insurmountable task for the 25 or 26 county registrars throughout the country.  If the Minister or his colleague or somebody is going to increase the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court substantially, further staff will be needed there anyway, and why not employ them full time?</P>
    <P>The Minister has not provided an acceptable argument against this.  He said that, having considered the structure available, he is satisfied that it would not work.  The Minister's 250,000 does not hold water.  There will have to be more staff in Dublin to deal with the people there, but the Minister must cater for the ordinary plain people who will have to travel long journeys from the four corners of this island to Dublin.  The Minister, as a rural Deputy, knows as well as I do the country approach to matters like this.  He knows full well that no number of postage stamps will get a case dealt with.  No case will be dealt with except through personal contact across the counter.  The Minister is making a provision whereby the city people, because they are only a few miles away, will be able to get their cases dealt with without a solicitor: they will be able to come into Chancery Place. They are more sophisticated and more accustomed to dealing with Dublin people, whereas the country people will be put to the expense of employing a solicitor or paying bus fares, train fares and hotel fares.  There is no argument in favour of this.  The sooner the Minister has second thoughts about this and lets common sense prevail, the better.</P>

      <P>In relation to what the Minister stated in reply to me, the number of High Court judges is ten and the number of courts available is eight.  One of the judges normally sits in the Central Criminal Court as well, <Col N="604" /> but there is one judge who has no accommodation.  There are eight courts available for High Court judges in the Four Courts, four in the round hall court, five in the president's court, court six is beside the Supreme Court, and courts seven and eight are on the first floor in the Four Courts.  This is not a criticism of the Judiciary, but I must criticise a system which permits a situation to arise where a judge of the High Court, who is being paid £12,000 a year, has no place to work. The sooner it is rectified the better.</P>

      <P>It arises indirectly. The Minister said that separate accommodation had been arranged in Chancery Place for staff to carry out this new work.</P>

      <P>It is all right in relation to staff, but it has nothing to do with the High Court or the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Separate accommodation is to be provided in the Four Courts where already there is not enough room for existing staff.  It is unwise to consider putting more people there at the moment.  The Four Courts is overcrowded already.  If 250,000 cases are to go through inside of five years, and if there are to be 40 or 50 extra people on the staff to work the system, the position in the Four Courts will become critical.</P>
      <P>The Minister also stated that what we proposed in our amendments would mean the employment of additional staff in the county registrars' offices throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.  That would be a good thing for employment in rural areas, instead of bringing people into a city already overloaded with people.  We are almost through this Bill and we had no reason to vote on any matter up to now. However, this matter is so important that we cannot allow this section to pass without strongly opposing it on a vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Minister has insisted that the officer to implement the legal proceedings under this Bill will be the Registrar of Titles, Chancery Place Dublin.  I think the Minister is very wrong in doing that.  It will lead to great inconvenience, very considerable expense and unnecessary journeys from far corners of this island to Dublin.  I <Col N="607" /> gave some examples on a previous occasion in regard to the cost of travelling&mdash;bus fares, for example, from Cork and Donegal, and overnight stays.  The Minister seemed to think overnight stays would not be necessary.</P>
      <P>May I gave an example of how country people can find themselves involved in unreasonable expense because they are not familiar with the city, do not know their way about and are not able to differentiate between one hotel or restaurant and another? Within the last couple of years I knew of a man and his wife who came to Dublin to see someone in a Government Department.  They were simple people who rarely dined out.  They were told in the Department to come back after lunch.  The officer concerned would be back at half past two.  They went out and looked around for a hotel or restaurant.  They found one, went in and ordered a meal, which they enjoyed.  When the bill came it amounted to £12.  They were not familiar with the hotel and restaurant scene.  Might I suggest that if the people who come up to Dublin to have this Bill implemented find themselves presented with a bill for £12 for lunch on even a few occasions the savings the Minister says he has written into the Bill will soon disappear and they would be better off with the old procedures rather than the promised one.  This sort of nonsense could be avoided if the Minister would even reconsider between now and Report Stage his proposal to centralise all this in Dublin.</P>
