      <Col N="2" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week when I reported progress I was endeavouring to explain to the House that the Minister for Justice and Fianna Fáil speakers on this Bill did not seem to be at one in their views.  In support of my contention that they were not at one I wondered which would be the correct view with regard to this ground rents problem: were we to take the view of Deputy Raphael Burke, now Minister of State, when he stated his attitude in this matter on the ground rents motion in this House on 9 and 10 December 1975?  He said, as quoted in the Official Report of 10 December 1975 at column 1359, that the ground rent problem would remain until some Government decide to abolish it.  He then went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But some Government must produce a solution to the constitutional <Col N="3" /> difficulty.  This Government have a responsibility to use all the legal expertise available to them in the civil service and courts to devise a scheme that will get around this constitutional difficulty.</P>
    <P>That was the view of Deputy Raphael Burke, as he was then&mdash;that it was the duty of the Government of the day, which was then the National Coalition Government.  I am sure that Minister of State would regard it still as the duty of the Government of the day to get around this constitutional difficulty.  No such attempt has been made by the present Government and there is no indication that they intend making such an effort.  Or could it be the view of Deputy Dr. Woods, who was the prominent back-up Member of the Fianna Fáil Party in formulating their manifesto?  Speaking in this debate on 8 February 1978, at column 822 of the Official Report, he had this to say:</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe's criticism is hypocritical and I, as a reasonable person, would not accept it as a reasonable criticism of the Minister, especially a criticism of the Minister who said that within six months he would cover both aspects of the Bill in abolishing future ground rents and in providing a scheme for the abolition of ground rents.</P>
    <P>Mark you, he did not say a scheme that would lead to their abolition. Speaking in this current debate Deputy Dr. Woods said that the Minister was producing a Bill for the abolition of ground rents.  Is that the Government view?  Or are we to take the views&mdash;and I presume we should&mdash; of the present Minister who, when asked straight and fair if he thought this Bill would lead to their abolition, he replied honestly that he had not a crystal ball, he did not know if it would, but he hoped so?  There there are three different views.  Even the Minister is not at all sure that this Bill will lead to the abolition of ground rents.  Those are his own words. He gave no definite assurance that it will lead to their abolition.  How then can he expect Opposition Members to <Col N="4" /> believe that it will lead to their abolition?</P>
    <P>Deputy Niall Andrews, speaking on the last day this matter was discussed here, mentioned Fianna Fáil's intention to have this Bill that would lead to their abolition.  He seemed to collect together other definitions of the word &ldquo;abolition&rdquo;.  He referred to the fact that Fianna Fáil had mentioned the abolition of car tax, of rates on domestic dwellings and of ground rents.  If we take the meaning normally attributable to the word &ldquo;abolition&rdquo; when used with regard to car tax, domestic rates or indeed when used by the previous Government in relation to the abolition of VAT on foodstuffs and the abolition of death duties, in all of these instances I submit that it meant doing away with something completely. It did not infer in any way that such abolition would have to be paid for.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are adopting a new meaning for the word &ldquo;abolition&rdquo; in this instance.  The Bill does no more for the abolition of ground rents than did the Bill introduced by the National Coalition. The multiplier to be used in this case is higher than it was under the National Coalition Bill and the fee of £5 which is to be charged by the Land Registry under this Bill was not fixed in the previous Bill.  Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned that normal applications in this line to the county registrar cost £2 at present.  The Minister shakes his head as much as to say that that is not so.  Does the Minister know what the charge is? If the Minister has power to fix a fee of £5 chargeable by the Land Registry has he not power to fix the fee charged by the county registrar? That is a fair question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy accept that where I set out the charge to be £5 my predecessor said that the very least it could be under his Bill was £25.  That is in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is leading us astray, perhaps inadvertently.  My recollection is that when the previous Minister was introducing the Bill he <Col N="5" /> did not mention anything about £5, it is only in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy go to the trouble of reading the report to find out what I said about fees? That was one of the major weaknesses in the legislation that lapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That it was not fixed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am fixing it at £5 and that is the maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Through the Chair, if the Minister has the power to fix the fee chargeable by the Land Registry, has he not also the power to fix the fee chargeable by the county registrar? A difference in this Bill which was not in the National Coalition's Bill is that this gives the power to local authority tenants to buy out their ground rents.  The Government said that this is an important inclusion in the Bill and I agree.  While that was not included in the previous Bill some of us who are also members of Dublin Corporation were very much aware of the omission.  We mentioned this omission to the then Minister who indicated that he would be favourably disposed towards an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy not aware that last week or the week before in the Seanad, Senator Cooney said that he still did not favour putting in local authority tenants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator, then Minister, Cooney said to those who approached him that he would favourably consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going on what Senator Cooney said to me.  The National Coalition, to their credit, never claimed that their Bill would lead to the abolition of ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It could have, as much as the present Bill.  All they said was that it would simplify the method and reduce the cost, and that is what this Bill does.  I would agree with the Minister if he said that this Bill would simplify the method of buying out ground rents.  I would agree that it would lead to the abolition of ground rents if the Minister would say that once this Bill is passed, without any further action eventually ground rents will be abolished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to prove to the Minister that it is not.  If, for instance a person decided not to buy out his ground rent will this Bill lead to the abolition of that ground rent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will this Bill, by being passed, lead to the abolition of ground rents?  I submit that this Bill will not abolish ground rents unless the person who is paying the ground rent takes the necessary step to buy it out.  Will ground rent be abolished for an unemployed person who cannot afford to buy it out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will not lead to the abolition of ground rents in the case of a widow who is left on her own in a house and is unable to raise the cash to buy out the ground rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The ground rent will be abolished if she wants to buy it out.  She can afford the £5 legal costs so she can buy it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the widow afford eight times the capital sum of the ground rent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be that figure.  I am providing a scheme that will lead to the abolition of her ground rent if she wants it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister can give an assurance that this will lead to the abolition of ground rent in the case of the widow I would agree that it will be availed of, but it will not. Under this Bill it will be far more costly to buy out ground rents than it is at present.  Recently I met a deputation of people from a housing estate in the north side of Dublin and they told me that they had purchased their ground rent which was £15, for £80, including legal fees.  They bought out the ground rent without this Bill being passed.  Under the Minister's scheme the cost could be eight-and-a-half times £15 or £127.50 plus the £5 fee.  I do not think those people would agree that the Minister's Bill would lead to the abolition of ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>But it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Another difference between this Bill and the one introduced by the Coalition is the proposed method of administering the legislation. Our proposal was that this operation be dealt with through the county registrars of whom there are about 27, but Fianna Fáil propose to have the legislation administered through the Land Registry.  Regardless of which method is used, there will be extra employment involved and we contend that it would be better and more feasible to create this employment in the various offices of the county registrars throughout the country.  There are a number of reasons for this.  One is <Col N="8" /> the consideration of the congestion in this city.  When presiding at the opening of the new bridge last week the Minister for the Environment said that if steps are not taken to ease the traffic congestion there will be stagnation. In other words, he was showing his awareness of the need for decentralisation, a concept which the Government, at one stage anyway, advocated.  The spreading out of the administrative work in connection with this legislation would be an indication of their sincerity in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill about decentralisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so but there are references to the method to be adopted for the putting into operation of the legislation.  Another consideration is the workload of the Land Registry.  I understand they are much behind in regard to their normal routine.  The Minister has said that the staff there will be increased and that a new section will be set up for the purpose of dealing with this legislation. As a Dublin Deputy it is not often that I have dealings with the Land Registry but in December last they had occasion to send me some documentation.  This was dated 15 December and carried a notice to the effect that it would be presumed to be delivered within ten days.  The envelope was postmarked 23 December and I did not receive it until 28. Fortunately, there was no question of an affidavit because by then the time for the return of such would have expired.</P>
      <P>Another consideration in favour of having this work executed through the offices of the county registrars is that people generally would prefer to deal with a local office where they are known rather than with a bureaucracy in Dublin where they would be merely a number.  These, then, are very good reasons for the work being spread throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is in a position to tell us yet whether he has power to fix the fee charged by the Land Registry.  Perhaps even <Col N="9" /> at this late hour and without loss of face he will consider reverting to the scheme envisaged by the Coalition of allowing county registrars to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has merely expressed the hope that the Bill will lead to the abolition of ground rents.  I do not think it will.  However, we welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>One would not think that from listening to the contributions from the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have pointed to the defects in the Bill and we trust that the Minister will consider the points we have made.  Our purpose in offering constructive criticism is by way of wishing to help the Minister improve the legislation.  We advise everybody concerned to avail of the opportunity of the legislation to buy out their ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, the Bill will have the same effect as that envisaged by the Coalition in their Bill.  The Minister may shake his head but we set out to do basically the same as he is doing although in a more simplified way and in a way that would have allowed ground rents to be bought more reasonably.  Our Bill envisaged the abolition of ground rents but I expect the Minister, who is a reasonable and sincere man, to admit that this Bill in itself will not do this.  It cannot be said it is abolition.  Anyone could say he abolishes a debt by paying it.  If I owe £1,000 and make provision to pay it, that is the same as what this Bill does.  There is payment being made for the ground rent.  No matter what sum a person may owe, if he agrees to make payment, that naturally, will lead to abolition but the Bill of itself does not abolish.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to speak in support of this forward-thinking and progressive social legislation. In order to get to the stage where legislation is introduced for the <Col N="10" /> abolition of ground rents, planning on a long term has had to be done.  We in Fianna Fáil were conscious very many years ago of the need to amend the legislation in relation to ground rents.  Before anybody was thinking in a forward way in this respect, it was realised, particularly by former Fianna Fáil Governments, that the existing law in regard to ground rents, particularly in city centres, helped town planning and protected tenants' rights in regard to their property when it was properly exercised.  Dublin city in many areas has a legacy of very fine buildings which would not be there if certain estates could not derive ground rents in respect of them. Some of them, unfortunately, are owned by regressive landlords from across the water.  The fact is, we have a heritage in the centre of Dublin which is due to terms within leases which could not have been exercised if ground rents had not been in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking this into account, Fianna Fáil first cleared the way for a Bill of this type, by introducing planning and orderly development of city and county areas.  We took this on a national basis, not just on a narrow estate basis, or narrow street basis or on an area of a street or town basis or, as perhaps in certain areas of Northern Ireland, on the basis of small towns that were established as the forerunner of proper development and planning of an area for the benefit of its citizens.  So, in order to clear the ground to get this progressive legislation enacted, we in Fianna Fáil initiated and carried through the various Acts in relation to open Government planning and thereby enabled this progressive legislation to come before the House.  I can remember three other Coalition Governments, not one of which took the slightest trouble to examine the problems involved in getting this type of legislation into operation for the benefit of our country.  When in Opposition and in power, the build-up that had been achieved was thrown away and totally ignored, was not availed of. This is very evident from the discussion that has taken place here since the introduction of this legislation. From the previous speaker, it is perfectly <Col N="11" /> obvious that there are deep divisions in Fine Gael as to whether they want this legislation at all or not. The performance of the Fine Gael Members, in particular, in relation to this Bill could only be described as regressive. One might wonder if there is something more sinister behind this.  Do they, in fact, want this legislation at all or are they, in fact, trying to perpetuate some of these ground rents for the benefit of certain people?</P>
    <P>The performance of Senators Cooney and Robinson in the Seanad are in the same vein and their attitude towards progressive legislation of this type can only be described as totally negative. A great example of this was given when, as the Minister said a few minutes ago, the former Minister, now Senator Cooney, stated, apparently categorically, that it would cost at least £25 to do what the Minister is now doing for £5.  Can anybody honestly say that even a widow on a widow's pension cannot afford £5 in order to buy out her ground rent?</P>
    <P>Conscious of our commitment to the less well-off section of the community, we in Fianna Fáil have created a situation where the least among us can enjoy the benefits formerly associated with the wealthiest among us.  This is in line with our progressive policies in creating a rising tide that will benefit everybody and is totally in line with the budget we have just had and is an expression of our social obligations to every citizen.</P>
    <P>The most important part of this legislation from a social point of view is the totally new concept of allowing local authority lessees to purchase the freehold.  The implications of this are very much greater than has been suggested on any side of the House.  We in Fianna Fáil, over the years, created a ladder, whereby anyone can change from paying under the differential rent scheme to purchasing the property and now, for the first time, can purchase the freehold in that property.  It means that a man can improve the value of his council house in the knowledge that he will get the benefit of that improvement. I would seriously suggest that this is a major breakthrough in <Col N="12" /> social thinking in that the local authority does not retain, through the leasehold system, the value of the improvement a man would do to a local authority house by stipulating that he could sell the house only to a certain type of person.  Now, for the first time, through this progressive legislation, the Minister, Deputy Collins, has enabled anyone, without fear or favour, to improve his house, to get the benefit of that improvement and so create more wealth for himself and for the country.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this legislation will not prevent or inhibit persons without houses from obtaining houses. It is not regressive in that way.  The position will not be reached where the local authority will say that only persons within certain income limits can purchase a local authority house. Allied to the position that a man can buy out his own house is the situation that house building operations are proceeding without fear of the creation of ground rents.  The ladder is there to be climbed and a wide spectrum of house building is in progress instead of encouraging only one type of house building which meant a restriction in the availability of the type of houses people wanted.</P>
    <P>Over the last 20 years a great number of ground rent portfolios have been created.  Initially it was suggested that the creation of a ground rent meant that the value of the house could be made more attractive to a purchaser, that the ground rent reduced the capital cost of buying the house.  Unfortunately, this benefit went by the board and it became a racket to create more money for builders, not necessarily for the benefit of the householder. Certainly it was seen to be regressive in its action and not socially desirable.  Recognising that, Fianna Fáil introduced the Local Government Planning Acts and then this legislation to enable people to own without fear or favour the ground on which their houses stand and in order that they might not have socially detrimental leasehold clauses which do not benefit the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Listening to the debate on this legislation and to the divisions of opinion on the other side of the House, one <Col N="13" /> can only conclude that the Opposition do not want people to own their own houses.  This is the conclusion on this side of the House.  There has been long and acrimonious argument about paying £25 for buying out something which we have said quite categorically will cost only £5.  This is not progressive or constructive debate; it is merely dragging the feet and trying to prevent something which is definitely for the good of every householder.  We have always held it as the fundamental right of anybody to buy his own home should he so desire and in this legislation we are providing that he also has the power to buy out his own ground rent.  This must be an incentive for people to buy their own houses.</P>
    <P>This legislation will also have a stimulating effect on the transfer of property.  This can be very expensive under some leasehold arrangements and people who have their own freehold find it very much easier to transfer that.  In this context I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that the progression from this great advance should be towards a position where it would be possible to transfer a house with the same ease that it is possible to transfer the ownership of a car.  I should like to see a system whereby the registry of property is made so simple that it is not essential to go through long and tortuous channels in carrying out searches and worrying about what might have happened to a certain property two generations earlier.  This would be another leap forward, almost as big a leap as the Minister for Justice has taken with the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill has given an opportunity for social advance which was wasted by the previous administration.  They paid lip service throughout their term of office to the question of the abolition of ground rents but it was only in the latter days of their administration that legislation was introduced and it was not of an all-embracing nature.  It did not allow everyone an equal opportunity to buy out ground rent and inhibited people who were the victims of some leases which did not allow them freedom of mind.  Coming <Col N="14" /> up to the end of a lease such people worried about whether they would still own their homes within a few months.  There was ample opportunity for the Coalition, the so called &ldquo;Government of all the promises&rdquo;. Ironically, within the dying days of that administration a half-hearted measure was introduced which could not have been brought in if Fianna Fáil had not previously introduced the Planning Acts and cleared the decks.  The opportunity given by Fianna Fáil was not taken. The measure introduced in the dying days of the Coalition Government could not have been anything but an election gimmick and was seen as such by the electorate.  This has been proven during the debate by the contributions of the Fine Gael speakers, in particular.</P>
    <P>This is necessary legislation because we must progress in an orderly way to enable people to own their own homes. This will speed up the process for anyone who wishes, for the first time, to own his house or who wishes to sell a property in order to buy a better one. In regard to local government houses, this legislation will have the effect of raising the value of such property.  This type of property has for too long been the Cinderella of the property market and this Bill will enhance the value of every local government house.  Anyone living in such property will be able to hold his head higher.  He will know that he owns his own house completely and that no one can look over his shoulder and tell him what he can or cannot do.  He will have the opportunity to improve the house and progress in a social manner and if he decides to sell the house he will have the benefit of the value he has added to the property.  It will also enable the mix of housing to progress in a more orderly manner in line with Fianna Fáil social thinking and will bring about a mixture of social values and levels which has not previously taken place in regard to local government building.</P>
    <P>This progressive Bill is not worthy of criticism; it is worthy of constructive acceptance and should not be given a half-hearted welcome.  I would <Col N="15" /> seriously suggest that the Opposition would discharge their duties to the electorate in a much more responsible manner by extending a welcome to this Bill and getting it through as quickly as possible in order that the people at whom it is aimed can take advantage of the methods provided for buying out their ground rents.  The tactics of delay are not in the best interests of anyone who has a ground rent problem.  An urban-rural sprawl has taken place and the people living in these houses and owning their own ground rents can, through their community associations, take responsibility for up-grading their own estates, without fear of a ground rent situation where they might be inhibited in planting trees along verges or in laying out their gardens in a more attractive way. They will not have to worry about adding an extra bedroom to their homes or otherwise altering them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I commend this Bill to the House and respectfully suggest to the Members on the other side that they would be doing a greater social service to the people by making shorter and more constructive speeches rather than the lengthy, obstructive and destructive speeches we have heard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with Deputy Fox's exhortation I shall endeavour to be brief and more constructive than he was.  As regards this Bill we may say &ldquo;A rose by any other name...&rdquo;. This rose still carries the thorn that you still must pay.  Despite what people thought or were led to believe this Bill still says &ldquo;Pay up, or shut up.&rdquo;  That is vastly different from what was being said by the Minister's party, his supporters and by the supporters of the previous speaker at great length and on many occasions in his and my constituency during the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall that on the night before the general election all candidates were invited to attend a residents' association meeting to discuss ground rents and their abolition without compensation. I was the only candidate who attended and I did not notice either the presence of or an apology from the previous <Col N="16" /> speaker on that occasion.  He did not turn up or speak up then.  His colleague, the senior Deputy, sent along a copy of the manifesto and left that to represent him.  If proof were needed that people thought that the manifesto meant payment without compensation, I got it that night for two hours.  At least I have the consolation of knowing that the situation as I outlined it to that group then will be proved correct when this Bill becomes law. Deputy Fox and his colleagues may go back to those people and try to explain to them what I then tried to explain to them.</P>
    <P>I am a little taken aback at the previous speaker's rather simplistic view of politics.  I wish politics and public life were as simple as he seems to think they are and that, as he suggests, a woman on a widow's pension would not resent paying £5 in order to own her ground rent.  Is he not talking about £5 suggested legal fees as well as the purchase price of her ground rent?  Or is he suggesting that if we come across any widow who pays the £5 legal fees, he will pay the purchase cost of her ground rent?  Let us not be carried away; we are still talking about the purchase of a ground rent based on the terms of the most recent long-term national loan&mdash;a higher cost now than it would have been two months ago, incidentally.</P>
    <P>The Deputy seems to think that any social change in the area of ground rents emerged with the arrival on the scene of the 1963 Planning Act.  It goes back much further, back into the 19th century.  As regards change in this century, social concern and effort to protect the lessee, it began in 1928 with the Meredith Commission followed in 1931 by the Landlord and Tenant Act, known as the &ldquo;tenants' charter&rdquo; and it was not introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government.  In 1954 there was a commission which was not set up by and did not report to a Fianna Fáil Government, followed by the 1958 Reversionary Act.  In 1964 there was a commission after which the faulty, unworkable and unenforceable 1967 Landlord and Tenant Act was introduced by Fianna Fáil.  It has caused tremendous headaches, annoyance and <Col N="17" /> frustration for landlords and tenants and resulted in fees going into the pockets of the legal men in the ten ensuing years.  That is what the Deputy's Government introduced.  That was the most recent piece of legislation introduced by his colleagues.  If I were he I would not be so proud of them; I would not refer to or boast about them. Neither would I suggest that the Planning Act was what helped to bring about this social change.  The 1963 Planning Act required to be amended in large measure by the 1976 Planning Act which again was not introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government, a major Act which required to be introduced because of the coach and four that could be driven through the Principal Act of 1963 which was certainly introduced by somebody who was at that time, but is not now, a member of Deputy Fox's party.</P>
    <P>Our constituents were told or led to believe, because it suited the people who said it at the time, that if the present Government were returned to power people would never again have to pay ground rents on their homes.  I do not suggest that the Minister personally categorically stated that or that any Deputy in the House deliberately and categorically led the electorate astray&mdash;far be it from me to do so&mdash; but they had many and varied supporters who certainly made it their business to give the impression on the doorsteps to the electorate that following 18 June if there was a change of Government they would never again have to pay ground rent.  Nobody in the House on any side can honestly say that what I have just said is not true because we all know it is true.</P>
    <P>The dictionary defines &ldquo;abolition&rdquo; as annulment or abrogation; it defines &ldquo;annul&rdquo; as &ldquo;to make void as a law; a decree or a contract or to invalidate&rdquo;. It defines &ldquo;abrogate&rdquo; as &ldquo;to abolish, to annul or to repeal by authority&rdquo;. Surely the Minister who was for a long time Opposition spokesman on this matter and vocal at the time is now in a position to repeal by authority?  If &ldquo;annul&rdquo; means &ldquo;abrogate&rdquo; which in turn means &ldquo;to repeal by authority&rdquo;, I think nobody here suggests that this legislation is repealing by authority <Col N="18" /> ground rents on private dwellings.  If it is not, all I suggest is that there was a great body of public opinion, the silent people who do not take to the streets, write to newspapers or create mass demonstrations outside the RDS, who genuinely believed and were influenced in voting by that belief that Fianna Fáil would wipe out ground rents and that they would not have to pay to enjoy that benefit.</P>
    <P>The whole matter of ground rents is a strange one.  When you look back at their history you discover the original ground rents were collected by the landlords who were the only planning authority then existing.  In a way, like many other anachronisms in legislation, they were probably socially necessary and perhaps desirable in the 19th century because at least they had the effect of bringing some semblance of order and planning into urban areas especially.  They ensured that one's neighbour could not decide to build a folly or open a bawdy house or set up some other practice in the house next door because the ground landlord would arrive in his coach and four with footmen and attendants and very quickly deal with the person who stepped out of line and broke the terms of the lease.  We have come a long way from those days and, as Deputy Fox says, through the activities of various Governments and changes in planning and other legislation we have moved away from control being exercised to some extent for the public good under the ground rents system.</P>
    <P>In the earlier part of this century when speculative building became popular, for some time the value of ground rents was taken into account by the builder in fixing the price of houses.  It is suggested that because people were not involved in the tradition of house purchase they were slow to purchase private houses which were being built in quantity.  In an effort to encourage people to purchase those houses the builders sold them at less than their actual cost price anticipating that their eventual profit would derive from the ground rent they raised on the property.  In so far as that happened it was a good thing because it encouraged people to become involved in the purchase of their own homes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> We have moved a long way from that situation.  We have moved to a stage where builders, with no justification and no adjustment to the original sale price of the house, were raising ground rents on property as well as charging the full purchase price.  They were also in a position to obtain a regular income from the ground rents.  Another type of person owns ground rents.  I endeavoured to be honest and point this out to people in my constituency. I pointed out that ground rents were until recently regarded as a gilt-edged investment or the gilt-edged part of a portfolio and as such major assurance and insurance companies, pensions trusts and small investors over the years became involved in the purchase of large blocks of ground leases.  As such, I pointed out, it would be ridiculous to suggest that ground rents be wiped out without compensation being paid by somebody to those genuine investors. It was never on, and anybody who approached politics in a practical and honest way knew it was never on, to suggest that ground rents were going to be abolished without compensation. I am afraid certain supporters of the Government did that.  It was never on to suggest that there should be abolition of ground rents without compensation, as certain members of residents' associations did and as was suggested by certain officers of ACRA.  I make that statement in spite of the remarks of the Minister and officers of that association.  I heard senior officers of ACRA&mdash;one of them is now an elected representative at local level&mdash; demand at public meetings that ground rents be abolished without any compensation being paid by the lessee.  In fact, I heard those officers go further and suggest that compensation be paid by the ground landlord to the householder on foot of the unfair payments which they had made traditionally over the years.</P>
    <P>It is well to realise that that is the extreme situation which faced the previous Government from certain quarters.  Not only was abolition of ground rents without compensation being demanded but certain people were suggesting that compensation be <Col N="20" /> paid to the householder because ground rents were an unfair imposition which he should not have been asked to pay from the start.  I asked those people whether they had been coerced or forced into signing the contract to purchase their house on which they knew there was a ground rent clause, and they said they had been forced to purchase their houses because there was no freehold property available at the time.</P>
    <P>For that reason they purchased the leasehold property, paid the ground rent but now felt that because that was an unfair imposition they were entitled to compensation.  That extreme situation which existed in 1974 and 1975 is a far cry from the sorrowful tears we heard ten minutes ago about social justice and about Fine Gael not wanting people to own their own homes.  It ill behoves anybody, especially when one bears in mind the experience of the last speaker, to make suggestions like that.  Anybody with even a cursory knowledge of the history of Irish politics in this century knows that such a remark does not need to be contradicted or denied.</P>
    <P>Whether the Minister accepts it or not the undertaking given by his party in their manifesto had the effect in the run-up to the election of giving the impression to ACRA and some of their members that the Minister and his party would wipe out ground rents in the way some of them had demanded, without their having to pay compensation. That is what influenced the insertion by them on a regular basis in the last days prior to the election of advertisements in the Dublin newspapers clearly indicating that they were exhorting their members to vote for the Minister's party.  That was a regrettable intrusion by any supposed non-political organisation into the realms of politics at such a sensitive time.  I would say the same if during the next election campaign they inserted an advertisement urging people to vote for my party.  That association should be in the business of realising that they represent a myriad of people of all political views, that they need to deal with public representatives of all shades of opinion and that they <Col N="21" /> would not get far if they put all their eggs in one basket.  Those baskets have a habit of falling and when they do they fall with a mighty crash.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Fianna Fáil speakers say that this is new legislation and that the National Coalition did nothing about ground rents until their last days in office.  The last attempt to regularise this was made in January 1977.  A comprehensive attempt was made then to reform the entire code governing ground rents and it ill behoves anybody to suggest that this is the first attempt at reform that has arrived in recent times.  We all know that for whatever reason, what-ever piece of cosmetics, window-dressing or public relations the Minister for Justice decided to embark upon, he took the National Coalition's comprehensive Bill and chopped it into three parts.  He is calling them a trilogy of Bills.  We have had the first, this is the second and, presumably, we will have the third shortly.  When one considers that the first and second were carbon copies of the National Coalition Bill, one can assume that the third will also be a direct copy of Senator Cooney's Bill.  When I hear the sanctimonious way different Fianna Fáil speakers refer to this legislation and the great attempts at social good being made by their party, efforts that were never before contemplated or bothered about by any other party, I wonder why the Minister did not refer to these as a trinity than a trilogy.  Had he done that he might have been able to imply that there was a divine imprimatur on them now that they have been introduced by him.</P>
    <P>I do not see any guarantee that by transferring responsibility for the execution of this measure to the Land Registry in Dublin, rather than the county registrar as suggested in the previous Bill, the method will be any more efficient.  I am inclined to think that the only reason the Minister dropped the suggestion that all these matters should be handled locally by the county registrar was for the sake of change.  He did not want to introduce a Bill which was almost identical to that introduced by his predecessor and decided to take this matter away <Col N="22" /> from the county registrar because it will have the same effect ultimately although it may take longer, it may be less efficient and more frustrating for people in rural Ireland.  I suggest that that is no more than change for change's sake.  People in rural Ireland when in their county town on business felt capable of wandering into the office of the county registrar explaining to him that they wanted to purchase the ground rent and asking him to put the matter in train, bearing in mind that the documentation in relation to the lease would have been in the possession of the county registrar. I do not think that such people in rural Ireland would consider themselves in a position to get in touch with the Land Registry in Dublin.  I am afraid many people in rural Ireland will decide that they will have to employ a solicitor to deal with the Land Registry.  I do not see any man in a remote part of the country deciding he is going to take on the Land Registry in Dublin and asking them to execute his affairs.  He will ask a solicitor to do it for him.  It is a pity that that kind of situation will arise.</P>
    <P>All of us know the difficulty that exists in the Land Registry at the moment because of shortage of staff and bad working conditions.  The Minister has told us that a number of staff have been appointed already and are working on the backlog of ordinary work but he did not say how many additional staff will be employed to handle applications for the purchase of ground rents.  It might be helpful to Members of the House if the Minister would indicate how many staff will take up duty in the Land Registry in order to service this legislation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that in the normal course of events solicitors' fees in matters such as this should be relatively small and should be fixed by scale. However, if there is any difficulty or query in relation to the title and if this involves correspondence between the solicitor in a rural town and the Land Registry in Dublin, or makes it necessary for him to travel to Dublin to sort out the matter, then in that case the fees a solicitor would be entitled to <Col N="23" /> charge could be quite considerable.  I am asking the Minister to contemplate the idea of putting a fixed maximum on the fees a solicitor might charge in such a case.  I realise that in the normal course of events the solicitor's charges would be very small but if difficulty arises in relation to the title, if there is a lot of correspondence and perhaps a visit to Dublin by the solicitor, then the charges might become quite considerable. From that point of view there should be a maximum on the solicitor's charges.</P>
    <P>With great glee the Minister has been harping on his predecessor's reference to £25 and his commitment to £5.  It is fair to point out that under the 1967 Act the arbitration fee was £1.50 and 50p stamp duty, making a total of £2.  The Minister is now setting the cost at £12.</P>

Certain items are going up, although the Minister merely referred to the £25 proposed by his predecessor and the £5 proposed by him.  If some costs are decreasing others are being increased.  That is what life is like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister need not apologise to me.  I am quite pleased he has clarified the matter.  That is why we are discussing this Bill.  My point is that it will not be as easy for people in rural Ireland to deal with the Land Registry as it was for them to deal with the county registrar.  This was amply illustrated by a speaker on the Minister's side, Deputy Ahern, when he spoke on 15 February last.  At column 1365 of the Official Report of that date he said:</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton mentioned the county registrars.  I would have thought that anything that cut down on the risk of documents or papers being lost in the post or between 26 different offices would have been welcomed, but apparently not.</P>
      <P>If unfortunate individuals in rural Ireland have to deal with the Land Registry in Dublin and have to accept the risks of &ldquo;documents or papers being lost in the post&rdquo;, is it not much more likely that those documents will be lost in relation to those individual applications than if the county registrars had been dealing with them locally?  Is it implied by Deputy Ahern that people in rural Ireland should not deal with the Land Registry by post but that they should travel to Dublin personally?  How many such people does the Minister think would travel to Dublin to the Land Registry in order to redeem their ground rents?  I do not think it is on.  I ask the Minister to consider involving the county registrars in some way.  If he insists on having staff based in the Land Registry in Dublin, perhaps he might consider the suggestion that the initial approach from the person in rural Ireland would be to the county registrar in his county and that the latter would forward the documentation to Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Belton has pointed out, the scale of payment is based on a multiplier basis, on the return from the last long-term loan in force divided into 100.  On that basis up to recently the cost of redeeming ground rent was seven-and-a-half times the annual rent. However, because of the introduction of a new long-term national loan in the budget&mdash;this struck me immediately the Minister referred to it in the budget <Col N="25" /> speech&mdash;and because of the change in interest rates, this means that instead of having to pay seven-and-a-half times the annual rent people will have to pay eight-and-a-half times their rent from now on.  Because this Bill is such a carbon copy of his predecessor's Bill there is no reason why the Minister should not have introduced it at the beginning of the autumn session.  If that had happened it would be law now and many people could have purchased their ground rents at the rate of seven-and-a-half times their rent rather than eight-and-a-half times.  I do not think the Minister can say it took him this length of time to prepare the legislation in view of the fact that it is so similar to the legislation that lapsed on the dissolution of the previous Dáil.</P>
    <P>I am glad that local authority tenants are being given the right to purchase their ground rents.  This was not enshrined in the previous Bill and is one of the few changes the Minister has made.  However, I want to enter this caveat.  I am not delighted with it, as was Deputy Fox and other speakers, and I am sure that privately the Minister is not delighted with it either.  The impression has been given here that council and corporation tenants will be able to purchase their ground rents in the same way as the private householder. That is a sham.  It is misleading the people in the same way that they were misled in June.  There is an attempt being made now to mislead local authority tenants.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that some of the speakers who welcome this concept of allowing council tenants to purchase their ground rents have even read this Bill.  Section 26 deals with the question of allowing local authority tenants to purchase their ground rents.  Sub-section (2) says:</P>
    <P>The terms and conditions specified in the instrument by which the lease was effected (other than a condition for the payment of rent) shall continue to apply in relation to the dwelling for the period of twenty-five years from the date of acquisition of the fee simple.</P>
    <P>The main reasons most people want to buy their ground rents are (a) so that <Col N="26" /> they do not have the annual payment and (b) so that they can dispose of their houses as they wish, change them as they wish and do with them what they wish.  That ought to be the attraction for a corporation tenant or a council tenant as well.  That will not be the position because for 25 years after a council tenant thinks he has bought out his ground rent from the council he will discover that all the restrictive clauses the council entered on the original document when the man went to purchase his house in the first instance, except the clause in relation to rent, will apply.  He will discover he cannot really sell his house.  One would think that if a person bought out his ground rent he could sell his house to whom he liked.  That is not the case under section 26 (2) of this Bill, lauded as it has been by everybody, including Deputy Fox.</P>
    <P>Local authority tenants will not be able to sell their houses to whom they like.  They will still, for the first 25 years after purchasing the ground rent, have to go to the council and ask their permission to sell their houses to Mr. X or Mr. Y.  If one of those tenants wants to build on an additional bedroom he will have to go to the council and ask their permission.  If such a person wants to keep dogs in his back garden or build a wall around his front garden, if he wants to do anything to improve or change his local authority house, he will have to go to the council and ask their permission.  If that person lives in a town he will have to go to the corporation and ask their permission. That is a long way from telling the purchasing tenants of local authority houses that they will be allowed to purchase out their ground rents.  I would like the Minister to deal with those points.  If I am wrong I hope he will make it very clear that I am wrong and if I am right I hope he will make it equally clear that I am right so that those people will not be deceived any further than they have been through this debate to date.</P>
    <P>There are three things I invite the Minister to consider.  The first is to devise some form of assistance for rural people who will have difficulty dealing with the Dublin Land Registry.  If he <Col N="27" /> is insistent on the additional staff being based in the Land Registry, I want him to consider having people in rural areas make their initial applications through their local county registrars so that they will have to deal with them in the first instance.  If there is any difficulty in the Dublin Land Registry the local registrars should sort that out. The second point is that if a person chooses to go to a solicitor and if the matter becomes contentious and the solicitor has to travel to the Land Registry in Dublin to sort out the matter and consequently the fees are larger than might be expected, a maximum limit should be put on those fees.  The third point is to say how many additional staff will be appointed and when they will take up duty in the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>My colleague in the constituency of North County Dublin, who is now Minister of State, Deputy Ray Burke, said two years ago the Government should grasp the nettle in relation to this matter.  I am afraid they did not do so in this Bill.  They have approached the nettle with rather heavy rubber gloves.  The Minister of State could be excused for not coming in to speak on this Bill considering he said, on 23 February 1977 in Volume 297, column 180 of the Official Report in relation to the previous Bill, which is almost identical to this Bill except the county registrar rather than the Land Registry would deal with the matter:</P>
    <P>...but I suggest that the Bill does not meet the legitimate demands made for the abolition of existing ground rents.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Bill we are now discussing does not meet the demands for the abolition of ground rents.  Apparently, so far as the promises made during the election campaign are concerned and so far as things said by supporters of this party are concerned it seems that honesty and a realistic approach to problems do not pay at election time.  At least my party have the consolation of knowing that we were consistent in what we said, we were right in what we said and the <Col N="28" /> publication of the discussion and the Minister's reply on this Bill will prove that what we said was right.</P>
    <P>This Bill is in a large measure a regurgitation of our proposals.  It is a far cry from what the many people in my constituency who knocked on doors said to people I know.  They told them they would not have to pay any more ground rent when their fellow got back into power.  What do those men who worked for Fianna Fáil think today when they see this Bill? What do the electors who answered their knocks on their doors think today when they see this Bill and see that they will still have to pay the piper and if they want to have their ground rents wiped out and become fee simple they will have to pay up or shut up?  If we were knocking on the doors of those electors today we could ask them: &ldquo;Would you buy a secondhand car from those men?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not a lot to say on this Bill as I am a rural Deputy but I have an interest in ground rents because local authority houses are included in this Bill.  The Bill seems to be accepted by both sides of the House.  The only argument seems to be what was or what was not promised. I will not debate what happened in Dublin but I will debate what happened all over the country. Nobody in my area gave the impression to anybody that ground rents would be abolished.  They were told that a scheme would be introduced which would lead to the abolition of ground rents.  That is what this Bill is doing.  As far as I know, the abolition of ground rents would lead to a change in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have educated electors now.  My area is a long way from Dublin but I would be astonished if anybody could go to the doors of the electors in Dublin and say that ground rents would be abolished without any compensation of any kind.  Neither the manifesto nor the Minister said that. I do not know what happened in Dublin and I do not know what fool went to a door and thought people would swallow the idea that with a stroke of a pen something, which was <Col N="29" /> paid for years, would be abolished.  I do not believe any canvasser said to the Dublin electors that ground rents would be abolished if there was a change of Government.  I believe the Minister will make it quite clear this was not said.</P>
    <P>I hear a lot of talk about the widow and other people with small incomes. I do not believe there is any person on any type of social welfare allowance who cannot afford £5.  I understand the maximum is £12.</P>
    <P>I would like to clarify a few points raised by Deputy Boland.  I believe this is a Committee Stage Bill.  There are a few points I would like to deal with on Committee Stage, such as legal costs and ownership of the leases.  I am certain that there will be no problem in relation to local authority houses because they are not built on any land unless the local authorities have full title and are the full registered owners.</P>
    <P>In the case of ground rent owners who have died does full title still exist? In fact, were they registered?  They probably were, I am worried about old leases in which there may not be full title now because that could cause some trouble.  However, this is a matter that can be debated more appropriately on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This Bill implements the manifesto. The Bill introduced by Senator Cooney when he was Minister for Justice went a certain distance but this Bill goes further.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill.  Everybody admits he is doing a damn good job as far as Justice is concerned.  I can be critical of Ministers but I think he is doing a good job.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to talk about what happened in Dublin but I give credit to the electorate in Dublin for intelligence.  I do not believe the Dublin electorate just swallow things. Certainly the people in my area would not swallow things.  No one gets away with anything there.  They question everything.  I would be very surprised to think the Dublin electorate would swallow something without question in this day and age.  I doubt if that kind of propaganda succeeds.  I know I have <Col N="30" /> to be very careful in my constituency about statements I make.  The day of the soap-box orator is gone when one could shout anything one liked.  There was no mass media communication in those days.</P>
    <P>Both sides approve of this Bill and all we have to do now is, if possible, make it an even better Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain for me the difference between the county registrar and the Land Registry?  I am worried about legal costs.  Does the £12 include legal costs?  I know applications have to pass through various sections of the Land Registry.  Searches have to be carried out.  Various queries arise and these are referred to the solicitor. While there is a certain delay in the Land Registry itself the greatest delay occurs with the solicitor.  The Land Registry tell you that they have sent out a query to the solicitor on such a date and they have had no reply.  You ring the solicitor and he tells you he sent the reply yesterday.  If you did not ring him I wonder would the reply take another fortnight?  The possibility is that solicitors take on too much work. That is my opinion anyway.  That is probably the reason why they are so slow.  Some are supporters of mine, but there is no excuse for slowness in answering queries about first registration and so on.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to check on private ground rents where the owners may not be registered.  The position is all right where local authorities are concerned.  Ground rents are reminiscent of the days before the farmers got the three Fs as a result of the fight made by Michael Davitt.  A local authority house, as Deputy Boland said, cannot be sold for 25 years without the consent of the local authority.  I think 25 years is too long. The idea may be to prevent speculation on the part of someone who may fancy the site.  Perhaps the Minister would enlighten us about the position.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister as I congratulated the Coalition Government for bringing in their Bill, even though it did not go far enough.  I did <Col N="31" /> not intend to speak for even ten minutes, but I get hot under the collar when I hear people talking about what the general public will swallow.  In 1978 they will not swallow anything unless it is proved to be the truth.  If any Joe Soap can go around and say that we are going to do this or that, when it is not legal to do it, nobody is going to swallow that.  There is at least one intelligent person in each household.  At one time nobody used to read the small print in contracts, but the small print is read now, and gone into in detail and interpreted. You will not cod anybody now with a written document.  Everybody goes into these documents in detail.  What-ever about the intelligence of the Dublin people, I give you my word that you would not cod the people in Galway.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I will be very interested in the Committee Stage debate.  I ask the Minister if he will refer to the legal costs.  Deputy Belton asked what the legal costs would be now.  I cannot agree that people are complaining because £5 is mentioned. If you do not mention £5 what do you say?  For anyone to complain about £5 is not realistic in 1978.  No matter what people are living on, social welfare or anything else, anybody can afford to pay £5 or £12.  I believe that there will be no ground rents in this country five years after this Bill goes through.  No matter how poor are the people who want to buy out their ground rents, they will be able to do so under the provisions of this Bill.  We have to go into the legal terms in detail to find out how to make sure that the legal costs will be at a minimum. This is a good Bill and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly I would like to thank all the Deputies who have participated in this debate and to say that I would hope that they intended their contributions to be as helpful as possible.  There have been a number of contributions, but perhaps it would be appropriate that I should commence my reply by referring to the remarks of the principal spokesman for the Opposition <Col N="32" /> party.  I regret very much that I must refute certain incorrect statements made by Deputy O'Keeffe in relation to important aspects of the Bill, particularly regarding fees to be charged. I am not suggesting that the Deputy deliberately set out to mislead the House in this regard, but the only possible alternative explanation is that he is completely mistaken with regard to the issues concerned.  I would say certainly that the tone of the debate shows that, if he did not mislead the House, he certainly misled many members of his own party.</P>
      <P>That the Deputy himself was mistaken about the provisions of the lapsed Bill, as well as the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, is perfectly clear from his remarks as reported in the Official Report of 8 February 1978, Volume 303, columns 799 and 805. There he compared the fee of £5 payable under this Bill to the fee of £2 currently payable in connection with arbitration by the county registrar under the 1967 Ground Rents Act.  The Deputy stated categorically that under the Coalition Bill, had it been enacted, the tenant would have been liable for a sum of only £2 in Circuit Court fees as compared with the £5 fee to the Land Registry under this Bill.  I say without qualification that that assertion of Deputy O'Keeffe's is totally incorrect. The £2 fee under the 1967 Act has nothing to do with the procedure proposed in the Coalition Bill.  Section 73 of the Coalition Bill set up a procedure entirely different from the 1967 Act procedure, and separate fees would be charged, but these fees were not spelled out in the Bill; they were to be left over for regulations to be made when the Bill had passed.  Even if the Deputy could be excused for not reading section 73 of the lapsed Bill correctly, it is extraordinary that he should have ignored what the then Minister, now Senator Cooney, said about fees to be charged under section 73 of the Bill.  I quote from the Official Report of 24 February 1977, Volume 297, columns 344 and 345:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore there will be an element of cost on the tenant in using the county registrar procedure.  What <Col N="33" /> the amount of costs eventually will come out at is something we cannot decide in advance because we have to see how complicated the procedure will work out in practice, how much demand there will be on it and what extra staff will be required in county registrars' offices. There will have to be an element of contribution from purchasing tenants towards these costs.</P>
    <P>A little further on he said:</P>
    <P>.... I gave an example, when opening this debate, of a large ground rent company which offered ground rents at a small number of years' purchase plus £25 to include legal costs and they had very few takers.</P>
    <P>In that Deputy Cooney was referring to an Irish company.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>That makes me wonder how much real interest there is in this.</P>
    <P>I imagine from the consideration I have given to the fees that may have to be assessed in regard to county registrars that it will hardly be possible to have a system where the fees asked from the member of the public using the county registrar system will be any less, but I would not be in favour of providing a free service in this area.  If the tenant is not involved in costs the State has to foot the bill because the landlord cannot be asked to do it.</P>
    <P>Therefore it is obvious from what the then Minister, Deputy Cooney, said that he envisaged a fee of not less than £25 under the Coalition Bill. Deputy O'Keeffe was also mistaken with regard to the nature of the £2 fee payable under the 1967 Act.  Every tenant who has looked into the question of purchasing his fee simple under the 1967 Act and every legal practitioner in the State knows that under the 1967 Act the £2 arbitration fee is only a minute proportion of the total legal costs the tenant must bear.  Under that Act, the tenant is also liable for his own as well as the landlord's legal costs.  It would be more reasonable to compare the £5 fee under the Bill with a figure of not less than £100.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> Deputy O'Keeffe and others also sought to suggest that the fees provided for in the Bill would not be the only fees charged in the Land Registry. Deputy Fitzpatrick from Cavan said the applicant would be charged the full economic cost of the transaction.  I want to say very clearly that of course this is also wrong.  It is stated quite clearly in the Bill and in the explanatory memorandum that the £5 and the £12 fees will be the only charges to be made in the Land Registry.  Yet Deputies from the Fine Gael Party said other charges will be made in addition to these fees to enable the Land Registry to pay their way.  They conveniently ignored section 22 (5) which provides that the applicant who is in possession shall not be liable for any payment apart from these fees, and section 22 (7) which provides that the Land Registry need not be self-financing in relation to their ground rents functions.  Deputy O'Keeffe's statements in this regard were repeated, unfortunately, by Deputy Fitzpatrick from Cavan, Deputy Luke Belton and others.</P>
    <P>There is a real danger that such statements might have the effect of confusing persons who are contemplating making an application under the provisions of this Bill when it becomes law.  I want to dispel any doubts which may have been created by these statements. Let us be quite clear about this. The way the question of fees is dealt with in the Bill is a reflection of the Government's commitment to the whole scheme.  As Minister for Justice, I went to the Government and got approval for a significant financial contribution from the State towards the purchase of the fee simple which will enable most tenants to obtain their rights for the nominal fee of £5.</P>
    <P>My predecessor, Senator Cooney, did not get a similar commitment from the Government of which he was a member.  There was no financial commitment in this regard at Government level during the time Senator Cooney was Minister for Justice.  If we had any remaining doubt in this regard, it was fairly and squarely hammered on the head for us and dispelled by Deputy Kelly who spoke about the State <Col N="35" /> lavishing money on this legal social service, as he called it.  While I think the Deputy exaggerated in giving the impression of vast expenditure, he was right in pointing out that this scheme, unlike that in the lapsed Bill, effectively removes the onus of legal costs from the tenant.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with other specific aspects of the Bill, I should like to say a little more about a matter which engaged most of the attention of Deputies on the opposite benches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>One specific aspect of the Bill about which I should like to say a little more engaged the attention of Opposition Deputies, that is, how the Bill relates to the undertaking in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto to introduce a scheme which will lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  To say the least of it, the debate on this aspect was erudite.  We had quotations from Shakespeare, quotations from dictionaries, semantics and even a lecture on the grammar of tenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general picture I got from the majority of the Opposition speeches was that Deputies knew precisely what we intended in the manifesto.  I did not <Col N="36" /> get this impression simply from the debate on Second Stage.  It was quite clear from the debate on the earlier Bill prohibiting the creation of future ground rents.  Fine Gael Deputies were hoping to make great play with the undertaking in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto which they sought to establish could not be fulfilled.  I was glad to note in the course of the debate that at least one Opposition Deputy had read the manifesto properly and was honest enough to say he knew precisely what it meant.  I got a similar impression from a colleague of that Labour Deputy who spoke afterwards.</P>
    <P>No amount of erudite argument can get around the plain facts.  The Fianna Fáil election manifesto promised a scheme which would lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  The question is: will the scheme provided for in this Bill lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents?  My answer is that it will.  There is no doubt that the system will be terminated.  I am absolutely convinced that, as a result of this scheme, the ground rents system will be dead within a period of years.  I do not say this for any subjective reasons.  I have already been made aware that there is a widespread intention to use the scheme when it becomes law.  The same impression came across to me from Deputies opposite who are in touch with the ground rents scene, as it were, who are dealing with the problem on the ground.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the suggestion that compulsion is either necessary or desirable to make all tenants avail themselves of the right to acquire the fee simple.  I am quite confident that what we are doing in this Bill will fulfil the election manifesto promise and will lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  Some Deputies who carefully researched the wording of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto and the record of my previous statements conveniently forgot to note the difference in the manifesto between the treatment of ground rents on the one hand and the treatment of rates on houses and the treatment of car tax on the other hand.  I am fully convinced that Deputies who were <Col N="37" /> selective were very well aware of this difference.  I shall indicate why I think the howls of protest from the Fine Gael Party on this question are completely, wholly and totally insincere.</P>
    <P>In our election manifesto we said we would abolish car tax.  The Opposition who were the Government of the day asked us to cost that proposal and we costed it for them.  We abolished car tax when we took office.  Our election manifesto said we would abolish rates on dwellings. The Fine Gael Party who were the major party in the Labour-Fine Gael Coalition asked us to cost that proposal.  We costed it for them.  We then abolished rates.  Our manifesto stated that we would introduce a scheme which would lead to the abolition of residential ground rents.  Fine Gael did not ask us to cost that, and that naturally begs the question why they did not, why they distinguished between ground rent undertakings and those relating to rates and car tax.</P>
    <P>The answer is clear.  They knew quite well what was intended by the undertaking and that it was different &mdash;they knew quite well that there was no question of payment of compensation by the State or of confiscating the landlords' interests.  I do not think it is necessary to give the House further elaboration on this point.  However, I find it necessary to refute some statements on the subject which were made during the debate, particularly about an excerpt from my earlier statements quoted by Deputy O'Keeffe.  The excerpt he picked is from column 163 of the Official Report for 23 February 1977:</P>
    <P>There is disappointment that the acceptance of the principle of the abolition of existing ground rents is not in the Bill.</P>
    <P>That is how Deputy O'Keeffe interpreted my statement.  I want to be more than fair to the Deputy because he has not been long in the Oireachtas, but I must say I am not sure whether he was making the point that I was expressing my personal disappointment in that statement.  However, Deputy O'Keeffe having made that point, it was taken up strongly by Deputy Fitzpatrick from Cavan-Monaghan, <Col N="38" /> by Deputy Belton and others from the Fine Gael benches. Whether that misleading quotation was through innocence or otherwise or whether it represented an effort by the Deputy to give a wrong impression, he succeeded in giving it to members of his own party and to Deputy Eileen Desmond who took up the point and said I was on record as having expressed my disappointment that my predecessor's Bill did not contain the principle of abolition of ground rents.</P>
    <P>That is wrong, and for the record I must say that if the quotation is read in its context it will be perfectly clear that I was referring to the disappointment of certain people and that this did not represent a personal feeling on my part.  Possibly the best way to clear this up would be to read the remainder of the paragraph, from column 163 of the Official Report for 23 February 1977:</P>
    <P>There is disappointment that the acceptance of the principle of the abolition of existing ground rents is not in the Bill.  It is fair to say that those involved in this area had great hopes that this would be catered for in the Bill, particularly having due regard to the statements made in recent times by certain members of the Government.  Deputy Richie Ryan, T.D., now Minister for Finance, in his time described the payment of ground rents as a medieval anachronism and a private tax by the wealthy on the poor.  The present Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, has described the system of payment of existing ground rents as an abomination. Having heard such definite statements from two prominent members of the Government when they were not in Government, those who are very closely interested in this legislation believed that when given the opportunity these two important men in their own political parties, Labour and Fine Gael, would come up with some scheme or system to help get rid of ground rents as they are, together with the prevention of the creation of further ground rents.</P>
    <P>The Deputies should have read on and they would have seen that I was in <Col N="39" /> agreement with the Minister at that time on the entire question of abolition but I was surprised, having regard to the pronouncements of his colleagues in Government, that he was not giving effect to calls from certain people to abolish ground rents without compensation.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill referred to by many Deputies is the way it compares with the Bill introduced by my predecessor in January of last year.  In my introductory remarks I indicated that we were following the same general line as that of the Bill which lapsed with the dissolution of the 20th Dáil.  I do not want to take away from the credit due to my predecessor and I have acknowledged during debates on the lapsed Bill and the present Bill that I was in general agreement with the principle in the last Bill.  I said that on every opportunity, and I cannot see why I have been criticised for adopting so much of the lapsed Bill, but there are differences between the two measures.</P>
    <P>There are five main differences. First, my Bill provides for a fixed low fee whereas the lapsed Bill left over the fees to be determined later; second, my Bill covers local authority lessees but the last Bill did not; third, my Bill abolishes the landlord's rights of re-entry which the lapsed Bill did not; fourth, my Bill provides a scheme to be operated by the Land Registry which the lapsed Bill did not; and fifth, my Bill contains a comprehensive description of leases which qualify for the right to acquire the fee simple.</P>
    <P>I find it particularly encouraging that every one of these points of difference between the two Bills has been welcomed by one Opposition Deputy or another.  However, I find it extraordinary that some Deputies tried to argue that these differences are of no real significance but, having tried to argue that, they went on to pick one of these differences either to be welcomed as an important addition to the Bill, or to be criticised.  It seems to me this is one more instance of Deputies trying to have it both ways.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that the proposal to have the scheme operated by the Land Registry rather <Col N="40" /> than by the county registrars was an important change.  Deputy Barry Desmond picked on the abolition of the right of re-entry as a welcome change.  Other Deputies welcomed the inclusion of local authority tenants as significant.  I believe the only logical conclusion to be drawn from all this is that this Bill is a significantly improved measure if compared with that which lapsed on the dissolution of the 20th Dáil.</P>
    <P>To my mind, by far the most important difference concerns the treatment of legal costs.  There has been a certain amount of misrepresentation in relation to the inclusion of local authorities.  Deputies Fitzpatrick, Belton and others suggested that the Bill which lapsed would have been amended so as to include local authority tenants.  That simply is not true and there is adequate evidence to establish beyond doubt that it is not true.  Before that Bill lapsed, between 100 and 110 amendments had been put down to it, the vast majority of which were tabled by the previous Minister for Justice, and there was not a reference in any of them to extending the right to purchase the fee simple to local authority tenants.  Moreover, there is no evidence that the Government then had decided to extend the Bill in that way.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, was disposed towards enabling the lessees of local authorities to secure the fee simple.  Such a proposal was simply a last-minute effort before the election and never saw the light of day. Certainly it never got Government approval and I am convinced it never could have.  I say that because as recently as Wednesday, 8th of this month, the previous Minister, now Senator Cooney, said in Seanad Éireann that he disagreed with the inclusion of local authority lessees in the Ground Rents Bill now before that House.  I should like to refer this House to volume 88, No. 3 of Wednesday, 8 February 1978 in Seanad Éireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He is entitled to hold that point of view which represents the main argument that can be made legitimately against what is proposed in the Bill.

      <P>Another general point raised on the Bill was the proposal <Col N="42" /> to have the scheme operated in the Land Registry rather than by county registrars.  I am very much aware that the question of centralisation or decentralisation can be an extremely sensitive one.  I can assure the House that it is a question about which I have more than average concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My whole approach to the question of the machinery of the Bill is to ensure that it works.  Having examined the structures concerned I can come to one conclusion only, that is, that the county registrars could not possibly cope with the expected response to this scheme.  When in opposition I very much suspected that this was the case and said so on the Second Stage of my predecessor's Bill in this House.  Since assuming office I have had ample opportunity to be completely convinced.  It must be remembered that we are speaking about a potential response of up to 250,000 cases.  Perhaps it was possible that my predecessor could justify allowing the scheme envisaged by him be operated by county registrars since that scheme may not have been expected to have shown widespread response.  Even so, many Deputies expressed concern during the course of the debate on that Bill as to the capacity of the county registrars to carry out the functions proposed.  What is not perhaps appreciated by Deputies opposite is that under the lapsed Bill, the functions of county registrars had to be discharged personally and the availability of circuit court office staff is of little relevance. Such staff are what are known as general service personnel and are not legally qualified.  Moreover, some circuit court offices also have serious arrears of work.  The task of examining titles in a fee simple purchase or of acting as arbitrator in that context undoubtedly is a job for experienced and qualified personnel.  In these circumstances it could be very difficult, if not impossible, to cater for large numbers of applications in county registrars' offices.  Recruitment of qualified staff simply would not be feasible and, even if it were, the result would be grossly uneconomic.  The structures, expertise and qualifications needed are all available in the Land Registry.  I have indicated already <Col N="43" /> that the additional staff resources necessary to cater for the scheme are being provided.  Of course, Deputies are naturally concerned&mdash;as was Deputy Callanan&mdash;about the almost endemic arrears situation in the Land Registry.  I also indicated in the course of my opening remarks that not only have I made arrangements to deal with the expected ground rents work but that extra staff are being recruited also to deal with these arrears.  I am satisfied that, as a result, the ground rents work will be efficiently discharged and that the ordinary arrears will be reduced to manageable proportions in the imediate future.</P>
    <P>There is a general point I should like to mention concerning the further Landlord and Tenant Bill I mentioned in my opening remarks.  I am very much aware of the urgency attaching to some of the proposals to be included in that Bill.  In particular, I appreciate that, following on the Supreme Court decision in the Byrne and Loftus case an amendment of the law relating to the inclusion of periodic rent reviews in reversionary leases granted by the courts has become a matter of priority.  I assure the House that there will be no avoidable delay in bringing proposals in this regard before the House.  I would hope to be in a position to introduce the necessary Bill before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>However, I do not agree with those Deputies who regret the separation of the legislation into three Bills.  I was glad to note that other Deputies expressed agreement with the course I was pursuing.  I am totally in favour of having a separate statute for the purchase of the fee simple.  In this I am very much influenced by the tenants who made their needs known to me in no uncertain manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions were raised about the limit of five years on the special low fee scheme.  Some Deputies suggested that the scheme should be open-ended. I should like to emphasise as strongly <Col N="44" /> as I can that there is no question whatsoever in my mind of making it an open-ended scheme.  I said in my opening remarks that the limit of five years is important in that it will encourage all ground rent tenants to exercise their rights as soon as the Bill becomes law.  I want to refute as strongly as I can the suggestion made by Deputy Fitzpatrick of Cavan-Monaghan that I may even now be contemplating an extension of the life of the scheme at a later stage.  That is not so and it is important that that be recognised now.  Any suggestion of this kind can only lead to confusion in the minds of tenants and give rise to delays in exercising their rights. Clearly it is in the better interest of tenants to move as soon as the Bill becomes law to acquire the fee simple. Here again there is an element of Fine Gael Deputies trying to have it both ways.  Some Deputy said, on the one hand, that the scheme would not lead to the abolition of residential ground rents while, on the other hand, Deputies like Deputy Fitzpatrick of Cavan-Monaghan said the scheme should be open-ended.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised about the determination of a purchase price by arbitration, about the case where the landlord cannot be found, about the need for a tenant to have a solicitor, about land which is not subsidiary and ancillary and about the exclusion of the State.  In addition, there were a number of drafting points.  I hope the Deputies who made these points will agree to my taking the opportunity of dealing with them on Committee Stage. I will examine the issues raised in the meantime, and where changes in the Bill are required I will only be too pleased to put down the necessary amendments.</P>
    <P>I thank the many Deputies who welcomed the Bill, despite a lot of other things they said.  Many hard things were said about the Bill and party political effort, but it came across to me quite clearly that there is a real welcome from all sides of the House for the provisions which will lead to the abolition of existing ground rents. If a man from Mars had listened to this debate he might find this surprising, <Col N="45" /> particularly having heard from Deputy O'Keeffe words like &ldquo;fraud&rdquo;, &ldquo;sham&rdquo;, &ldquo;misrepresentation&rdquo;, &ldquo;duplicity&rdquo;, &ldquo;subterfuge&rdquo;, &ldquo;cynicism&rdquo; and &ldquo;smells of deceit and dishonesty&rdquo;.  If we confine ourselves to the contents of the Bill it is more than to be expected that there would be a wide measure of agreement between all parties as to what shape the Bill should take.  This is clear from debates which took place on previous legislation on ground rents.  We may argue as to the best way of doing things, but it is fair to say that there never has been any substantial disagreement as to the broad scope of the legislation which would inevitably reach the Statute Book to solve the ground rents' problem, or about the principles upon which it would be based.</P>
    <P>For this reason I welcome the remarks made by Deputies who called for their constituents to utilise the provisions of this Bill.  They recommended to residents' associations to get into the queue as soon as possible and to exercise their rights under this measure. Those Deputies have given voice to views which I am confident the vast majority of Deputies hold.  That amounts to saying that this Bill will work.  It will provide the machinery and the resources to enable the ground leasehold system to be brought to an end as far as residential property is concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 18, Deputy Barry Desmond suggested that to ensure the concept of abolition the scheme should include a statement that ground rents will cease at the end of five years.  This re-echoes a demand of ACRA.  What is meant by ceasing at the end of five years?   One suspects that it simply means the termination of the liability to pay ground rent without compensation to the landlord. This would solve nothing.  Confiscation to take place in five years' time or at any date in the future is no different from confiscation now, either from a constitutional point of view or otherwise.  In relation to this sort of loose proposal, what would happen to the householder's legal title in five years' time?  He cannot get the fee simple unless the landlord's interest is formally acquired; or is he to be left <Col N="46" /> with some kind of emasculated leasehold title?</P>
    <P>With regard to sections 20 and 21, Deputy O'Toole and Deputy Boland suggested that a solicitor would be required to make the application on behalf of the tenant.  This is not the case.  It is clearly envisaged that the simple procedure provided in Part III will not require the services of a solicitor.  It is proposed to prescribe application forms which will be self-explanatory and instructive, and I am prepared to consider the point raised by Deputy Barry Desmond that a full and detailed explanatory leaflet should be prepared.  I am also prepared to examine ways in which these explanatory leaflets and application forms can be given to the people with a minimum of fuss, effort and delay.  In considering that point we may be able to have discussions with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The main function of a legal adviser in a transfer of the type in question would normally be to examine the documents to ensure that the client has got a good title to the interest acquired.  The title document invloved in the acquisition of the fee simple under Part III is a statutory vesting certificate issued by a State body in a prescribed form, and this does not call for examination by qualified local personnel.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 26, Deputy Mitchell suggested that since local authorities will be forced into selling land in fee simple a problem will arise in future years when redevelopment of the land is necessary and that the local authorities will have to re-acquire the land at great cost.  If the Deputy were more in touch with Dublin Corporation he would probably know more about this.  The corporation, which are the main planning and housing authority, have already passed a resolution pressing for the abolition of ground rents including ground rents on local authority dwellings.  Redevelopment is unlikely to arise to any significant degree in local authority areas within the foreseeable future. Therefore it is considered that it would be unjustifiable to deny local authority tenants the statutory right to buy in fee simple in common with other house purchasers, and the distinction between <Col N="47" /> disposals on a leasehold basis and those on fee simple is not significant in this context.</P>
    <P>In relation to Part II of the Bill, Deputy O'Keeffe asked for clarification as to whether references to &ldquo;arbitrator&rdquo; in Part II were to be construed as references to arbitration by county registrars or by the Registrar of Titles or by either of them. The only references to arbitration in Part II are in section 17, which specifically covers both types of arbitration. This is necessary since section 17 deals with the determination of a purchase price by arbitration in two different sets of circumstances.  In the case of a dwelling which will normally come under Part III of the Bill, the Registrar of Titles would be the arbitrator. In the other case, and also possibly the case of a dwelling which would come under the 1967 Act, the county registrar would arbitrate.  There is a reference in section 9, subsection (5), and elsewhere to the arbitrator, who is given special powers to determine issues relating to the erection of buildings in breach of a covenant in a lease. Since Part II covers all leases, the tenancies which are to attract the right to acquire the fee simple and not merely leases on tenancies and dwellings, it is obvious that &ldquo;arbitrator&rdquo; here must mean either the Registrar of Titles or the county registrar, whoever happens to be acting as arbitrator. This is essentially a drafting matter and the question has been put to the parliamentary draftsman's office.  If an amendment is needed I will certainly see to it.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 3, Deputy Eileen Desmond suggested that blocks of self-contained flats should be included. It is only right that the exclusion should be put into perspective. Such dwellings are not being excluded from the right to acquire the fee simple but only from the application of the special scheme in Part III which is designed specifically for dwelling houses.  In addition the provision must be read with the parallel provision in the Bill to prohibit the creation of future ground rents.  Future leases of <Col N="48" /> self-contained flats are not being prohibited in the Bill.  It would be totally lacking in logic to allow the creation of such leases in future while at the same time assisting the tenants to buy out their leases.  The purchase of flats is a relatively modern and still rare development.  There are fundamental differences between the landlord and tenant situation involved where the tenant is part owner and that involving a case where a tenant is the exclusive owner of the bricks and mortar.  The present state of the law renders it extremely doubtful as to whether one can force developers of this type of property to sell flats at fee simple.  The view is held widely that there can be no such situation as, say, four flats built one over another and all being held fee simple in relation to one area of ground.</P>
    <P>The difficulties I have mentioned would have to be cleared up, perhaps on examination by the Landlord and Tenant Commission or the Law Re-form Commission, before the No. 1 Bill in particular could be applied to this type of property.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 17 which deals with the question of purchase price, a number of Deputies have argued that the cost would have been lower had the Coalition Bill gone through, that it would have been seven-and-a-half years' purchase compared with eight-and-a-half years' purchase under the present Bill.  That assertion is not correct. The correct comparison is between the purchase price now under the Bill and that under the lapsed Bill.  In both cases it would be an eight-and-one-quarter year's purchase, that is, taking the lapsed Bill together with an official amendment that the previous Minister had tabled.  The purchase price is to be determined by reference to the yield from the last national loan at the date of the award.  The issue price of the security is irrelevant.  If the fee simple were acquired last year under the 1967 Act the price would have been lower because the current interest rates were higher then, but nobody could have bought his ground rent last year under the lapsed Bill.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the 11½ per cent development loan, 1977-1999 issued on 7 <Col N="49" /> February 1978 at 11.88 per cent is now quoted at a yield of 12.02 per cent according to releases from the Department of Finance on February 13.  This gives a multiplier of eight-and-a-quarter and not eight-and-a-half.</P>

      <P>I have tried as far as possible to cover what is in the Bill and to deal with the points raised by those speakers genuinely interested in having a proper discussion on the Bill. There were so many accusations made that I probably would need to be here until 8.30 this evening to deal with those that I should like to comment on.  I can only say that I reject completely all the allegations and accusations made by Fine Gael for party political purposes.  I compliment the three speakers from the Labour Party who contributed to the debate.  They were forthcoming and honest and admitted openly that they were not misled and knew well what was meant by our election manifesto.  They indicated that they are satisfied that the Bill I have introduced will, provided that the huge bottleneck that would have existed under the last Bill is cleared, will lead to the eventual abolition of ground rents.  I am confident that the bottleneck can be cleared by the legislation I am enacting.</P>
      <P>There was one small allegation made against me personally by my Fine Gael colleague from County Limerick who said that I used the election manifesto so far as ground rents were concerned to my advantage in the constituency. I assure the House that I accept what Deputy O'Brien said as a political accusation but I reject it because it is untrue.  I say that without rancour. The Deputy was bluffing but perhaps he knows that better than I know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I wish to comment on a statement made by Deputy Barry Desmond who said that the Government at the time of the previous Bill had not their priorities right and had not the will to put through the legislation that they introduced in January 1977, that it was shelved along the way. It is no harm that that should be mentioned.  To those people who were standing up here endeavouring to <Col N="50" /> adopt a holier-than-thou attitude, I suggest that since they were not here themselves at the time of the introduction of the previous Bill, they ask the decent people who were here then what was the position.  I say particularly to Deputy O'Keeffe, who I trust will do well in his role as spokesman on Justice for his party, that if he makes some study of what happened here before July 5 he will never again be open to the accusation by me of misleading his colleagues, of totally misinterpreting the records of the House for party political purposes and of giving a totally wrong impression. I excuse the Deputy because of his newness to the House and to the scene, but let me remind him that the man he replaces from the constituency he represents would not have acted in this way.</P>

      <P>The first part of the question relates to the confusion that has resulted from the Minister's statement about legal fees as opposed to the fees payable either to the land registry or to the county registrars. What is the explanation, in particular, for the six-fold increase in the fees payable for arbitration?  Under the 1967 Act the fee was £2 but the proposal now is to increase it to £12. Secondly, in the light of that increase and of the other circumstances obtaining here, what are the grounds for the suggestion that the Bill reduces the legal costs either to the Land Registry or to the county registrars?  How does he suggest legal costs are reduced in any way not similarly provided for in the National Coalition Bill?  and (c) in the light of those points and bearing in mind that the Minister accepted that the principle of abolition was not included in the National Coalition Bill, how does he suggest that the principle of abolition is, in fact, included in his Bill as promised by him and his party? and (d), the last point, coming up to date in relation to this Bill, the Minister has not replied to the points raised in relation to local authority tenants to whom he has grandly announced he is giving the freehold.  He has not replied to the point raised that for 25 years the conditions attached to their leases are going to be grafted on to their free-hold and the same restrictions will, in fact, apply to them.</P>

      <P>It is obvious to me that Deputy O'Keeffe would like to re-open the Second Stage debate.  He knows full well that he would not have a better opportunity again.  He had long enough.  I dealt fairly and squarely with the case put forward by the Fine Gael Deputies in particular who seemingly try to have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the fees, I have explained very fully and very clearly the difference in our legislation as from the Bill that the former Minister, Senator Cooney, hoped to get through this House and probably would have got through the House if, as Deputy Barry Desmond says, he had the political will to do it and the support in Government, which he seemingly did not have.  The big thing about the <Col N="52" /> fees is that my Bill, for £5, covers all the legal fees where there is agreement. The Bill that Deputy O'Keeffe seemingly has not even read too well, the last Bill, would not have done that or anything like that.  During the course of my reply here this morning I have spelled out very clearly the differences as far as fees are concerned and I have also explained in regard to the £2 fee which was under the 1967 Bill for arbitration costs, that this was a deliberate effort by Deputy O'Keeffe to misrepresent the situation, to belittle, to knock down, the value of the £5 fee I have in my Bill.  I say that very purposefully and very deliberately because I believe there was a certain grudging welcome to my legislation.  Many Deputies from Fine Gael knocked it; many Deputies said it was no good and I felt tempted once or twice during the course of the debate to say: &ldquo;Look here, if it is sticking in your chest that much, why do you not vote against it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the question of the fees, I am satisfied that what we are doing is right and proper.  I am satisfied that the bottleneck which my predecessor refused to do anything about as far as legal fees are concerned, will be removed and as and from the time my Bill is law, the doors of the Land Registry will be open and we will deal with the thousands and thousands of applicants in the way that they come to us.  Might I further say and I meant to say it during the course of my reply, there will be no question of any queue-jumping as far as getting work done?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £11,045,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31 day of December, 1978, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Fisheries, including sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount sought represents a net increase of £2,904,000 on last year's figure.  This overall increase is due <Col N="55" /> mainly to an increase of £783,000 for main fishery harbour works, an increase of £528,000 in the grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for administration and current development, an increase of £494,000 in the grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for capital development, an increase of £394,000 for inland fisheries development, an increase of £144,000 in the grant-in-aid for the Inland Fisheries Trust, and the provision of £300,000 as part of the cost of replacing the fishery research vessel <i>Cu Feasa</i> which had to be taken out of service in 1976 due to its poor condition arising from normal depreciation over many years' service Other lesser increases include £143,000 for salaries, wages and allowances, £26,000 for Post Office services, and £21,000 for the provision of specialised teaching equipment at the National Fishery School.</P>
    <P>The general pattern in relation to sea-fisheries is that while, in recent times, landings have been virtually static at the same time value has increased very considerably due to the increase in unit price.</P>
    <P>Landings of sea fish, excluding salmon valued at £3,289,054, in 1976 amounted to £12,864,000 as against £9,135,000 in 1975.  The corresponding quantities were 80,663 tonnes and 76,261 tonnes, so that although the quantity landed in 1976 was only marginally more than that for the previous year the fishermen gained an increase in income of over 40 per cent. There was a fall in the landings of herrings from 28,808 tonnes in 1975 to 22,012 tonnes in 1976, but the decrease in value from £3,231,710 to £3,133,000 was only somewhat over 3 per cent.  The statistics available to date for 1977 cover nine months to 30 September and these show the value of landings for that period as £11,700,000 as against £7,835,000 for the corresponding period in 1976, an increase of 49 per cent.  The quantities landed for the first nine months of 1977 amounted to 43,602 tonnes compared with 44,373 tonnes for the corresponding period in 1976.  The value of exports of all fish and fish products <Col N="56" /> in 1976 was £19,684,941 as compared with £13,646,780 in 1975, an increase of 44 per cent.  Taking into account revenue of approximately £17 million from angling tourism, the total external income attributable to our fisheries amounted to almost £36,700,000 in 1976.</P>
    <P>In 1976 there were 2,495 full-time and 4,898 part-time fishermen.  The total number of boats was 2,462, of which 819 were engaged in fishing throughout the year.</P>
    <P>The development of the Irish sea fishing industry in recent years has resulted in the addition to the fleet of modern trawlers with sophisticated technical equipment.  This in turn creates a demand for skilled men to command and crew the fishing fleet. The need to meet this demand is being given constant attention in my Department. To that end the National Fishery School at Greencastle, County Donegal, which is designed specially to meet the training requirements of the fishing industry, is owned and operated by my Department.  Full-time courses extending over 12 months, of which five months are spent at the school followed by seven months' practical training at sea on board selected fishing boats, are provided by the Department twice yearly to boys, aged about 16 to 18 years, wishing to take up sea fishing as a career.  Each course is advertised and I am glad to say that the response is good.  Eight courses for boys were held since the National Fishery School was opened in 1974.</P>
    <P>As well, two full-time courses of about ten to 12 weeks' duration are provided each year at the school to enable experienced fisherman to prepare for examination for skippers' certificates issued by the Department of Tourism and Transport.  There appears to be a reluctance on the part of experienced fishermen to avail of these very desirable courses and I take this opportunity to urge experienced fishermen who are interested in acquiring their own boats to consider participating in these skippers' training courses.</P>
    <P>I must say that I am not satisfied that our existing training facilities have kept pace with the development <Col N="57" /> of technical equipment on fishing boats.  There now appears to be a need for more advanced training techniques, especially for potential skippers of the new and larger vessels.  I have accordingly arranged for a complete review of our existing training programme by my Department, in consultation with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, to see what expansion of this programme is necessary.</P>
    <P>Since 1968 Fish Quality Regulations have been in force in respect of demersal varieties.  The regulations prescribe procedures and requirements for the proper handling, storing and transport of demersal fish so as to ensure that only fish of the highest quality reach both our home and export markets.  At present my Department are considering, in consultation with the interests concerned, draft regulations for all varieties of sea-fish, including shellfish.  In addition, existing procedures for the licensing of fish and fish products for the export market are being reviewed with a view to compliance with forthcoming international standards for fish and fish products offered for sale on the home as well as export markets.</P>
    <P>Although the establishment of fish processing plants or the expansion of existing plants is a matter in the first instance for private enterprise, it has been since 1962 an integral part of the ongoing overall plan for the expansion of the sea fishing industry to encourage, assist and maximise entrepreneurial endeavour in this sector.</P>
    <P>BIM's marketing expertise is available to assess the viability of the applicant's proposals in each case, assessment of markets for particular products and the establishment of trade contracts and so on.</P>
    <P>The Department co-ordinate the grant-aiding activities of the IDA and Gaeltarra Éireann in the fisheries sector and all grant applications are screened by the Department so that they are integrated into the overall plan.</P>
    <P>In the period 1962 to date, grants actually paid for fish processing from Irish Government sources have totalled more than £3 million most of which <Col N="58" /> was paid since 1970.  Applications for additional processing projects entail a further current commitment of £3 million from the Irish Exchequer.  EEC funds have already been approved for most of these cases.</P>
    <P>In 1977 a total of 42 applications&mdash; 29 new projects and 13 extension projects&mdash;for financial assistance were received by the grant agencies compared with a total of 33&mdash;23 new, ten extensions&mdash;for the whole of 1976.</P>
    <P>While the scale of future expansion will naturally be influenced by the outcome of negotiations for a common fisheries policy, it would appear to be a measure of confidence by the trade that the increase in grant applications in 1977 over 1976 occurred in the latter half of 1977.</P>
    <P>Working conditions for the scientific section of Fisheries have been greatly improved by the provision of a new Fisheries Research Centre at Abbots-town, County Dublin, which has replaced the inadequate and unsatisfactory accommodation at Cathal Brugha Street.  The new centre has been equipped with modern sophisticated appliances which will be further augmented during the year.  A new field station was completed at Castletownbere during the year and proposals for other field stations at Ballyglass, County Mayo, Kinsale, County Cork and Dunmore East, County Waterford, are being considered.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid to an Bord Iascaigh Mhara for 1978 for administration and current development amounts to £3,103,000 and the grant-in-aid for capital development amounts to £2,847,000.  The total of £5,950,000 represents an increase of £1,022,000 on last year's figure.  In addition to these grants-in-aid, repayable advances are made to the board out of the Central Fund, mainly to enable the board to give loans to fishermen for the purchase of boats and gear.  The total amount of these advances authorised for 1978 is £3,700,000. Taking into account a sum estimated at £600,000 to be ploughed back by the board into the industry, the board have at their disposal under the public capital programme for the current year <Col N="59" /> funds to the amount of over £7 million. As well, a line of credit is available from Irish banks to meet the demands by fishermen for loans for boats.  Drawings from this source are estimated at £4.5 million for the current year.  Many of these boats will of course be built in the board's three years which employ about 300 workers.</P>

      <P>The Employment Action Team submitted their first set of proposals to me some time ago.  The team made five proposals as follows: Community fitness programme; Work experience programme; Environmental improvement schemes programme; Apprentice recruitment by the local authorities; Employment of young people on the survey work.</P>
      <P>These proposals with the exception of that for a community fitness programme which is still being studied by the Minister for Health, have been approved in principle by the Government, and arrangements are being made to implement them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has already announced his proposals for the implementation of the environmental improvement schemes programme which will be undertaken by local authorities.  Details of the programme, which have been prepared in <Col N="60" /> consultation with my Department, will be notified to local authorities within the next few days.</P>
    <P>Regarding the scheme for the recruitment by local authorities of additional first-year construction industry apprentices the Minister for the Environment has finalised details concerning the funding of the scheme.  Detailed arrangements for implementing the scheme will be notified to the local authorities shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pursue this important matter by way of a few questions.  The question I put down asked about numbers and the Minister's reply does not give any such information.  Can the Minister tell us how many jobs are envisaged in the five categories of work which he has mentioned and how many people are now at work in these five categories?</P>

      <P>The team were set up specifically for the purpose of creating schemes for youth employment. I have outlined the different schemes.  The budget proposals implement most of them.  The overall numbers covered by the scheme are approximately 4,000, and naturally certain arrangements had to be made before the schemes could be introduced.</P>

      <P>Though I appreciate all that, it is six months since the team first met.  They have a dynamic sounding title and had a very high profile during the election and in the manifesto which put the Minister where he is.  Can he tell the House how many persons six months later are at work drawing a weekly wage in consequence of the work of this action team?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained in detail to the Deputy the present position of the schemes.  Indicative of our commitment as a new Government was the setting up of this action team which I regard as a major step forward.  The team consist of employer and trade union interests, youth interests and Government Departments. They had to examine the situation and they reported to me before Christmas the result of that examination of certain schemes.  Most of those required Government approval. In addition, finance had to be provided.  It was provided in Fianna Fáil's first budget.  As the Deputy can see, no delay has taken place since then.  There was the announcement in recent days by the Minister for the Environment of a scheme the details of which are due to go out to the local authorities.  An appalling situation obtained in the intake of apprentices by the local authorities prior to the investigation by the team.</P>

An outline of the proposals was given in the budget statement and has been included in other statements since then.  Formal publication of the team's proposals will be considered.</P>
      <P>The team have other proposals under consideration at present.

I should like to remind the House that other schemes giving employment to young people have been approved in the public sector.  This is only part of the £20 million he has mentioned.

      <P>(c)  The average length of time taken to process equal pay claims is three to four months.  A lot depends on the complexity of the claim and the extent to which the parties concerned co-operate.  I understand that in some cases the work of the equality officers is being delayed and made more difficult by incomplete claims and by delays in supplying necessary information requested by the equality officers.  In cases appealed to the Labour Court the average length of time overall has been approximately six months.</P>
      <P>(d)  Twenty-five recommendations have so far been issued by the equality officers.</P>
      <P>(e)  Of these six were in favour of employers and 19 in favour of employees.</P>
      <P>(f)  Precise information is not available on this.  I should say, however, that there is no evidence either of failure to implement recommendations. Under the Act, there is provision by which an employee may seek a remedy in any case of failure by the employer to implement a recommendation.</P>
      <P>(g)  The number of recommendations in this category is three.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister given any consideration to the fact that there is a difficulty in getting precise information <Col N="67" /> from those involved?

I understand an appeal can take as much as 13 months in some cases, although I know this is longer than the average.  Is the Minister aware of the sense of grievance of people who make appeals and who cannot get a decision?  They lose interest in the matter by the time a decision is made.</P>

The agency have the function to keep under review the working of the equal pay legislation and, whenever they think it necessary to do so, to make proposals to me for amending the <Col N="68" /> Act.  No proposals have been received from the agency so far, and I suggest that, as the body is such a short time in operation, it would scarcely be reasonable to expect them to have concluded a review of the situation or to have proposals ready for submission. The question of introducing new machinery as suggested by the Deputy does not, therefore, arise at this time.  The procedures of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 are, of course, operating.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will consider amending section 22 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, to enable the Labour Court or its servants to forward to trade unions, the IDA or other appropriate agencies, information obtained during the course of inability to pay assessments, where such information indicates serious economic difficulty on the part of the company being assessed, and which could result in remedial action being taken to protect jobs and investment in that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the National Wage Agreements, the Labour Court have a role in relation to claims by employers of inability to pay the increases provided for in those agreements.  The agreements have not provided for access by the parties to assessors' reports.  The Court are free to determine their own procedures and have decided that assessors' reports in inability to pay cases should remain confidential to themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals for a 1978 National Wage Agreement, however, provide <Col N="70" /> that the Labour Court should, due regard being had to the need for confidentiality, make appropriate arrangements to apprise trade union and employer representatives of the substance of assessors' reports.  In so far as confidentiality is concerned, the Labour Court will continue to be bound by the provisions of section 22 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, which prohibits the court from including in any report, or disclosing any information which has been obtained by them in the course of proceedings before them under the Act without the consent of the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>These arrangements have the general support of trade unions and employers and I do not propose to seek an amendment of the Industrial Relations Acts as suggested in the question.</P>

      <P>I confess to the Deputy that I have sympathy with the motives contained in his question, that is that an early warning of impending trouble, financial, job loss and so forth would be helpful.  I suggest, however, that, first of all, the proposals in the 1978 National Wage Agreement go a little bit further regarding the disclosure of information which may help. On the other hand, I do not see the Labour Court being the vehicle for such early notification.  I believe the independence of the Labour Court has to be maintained, that their function in industrial relations should be confined to that area and possibly there may be other ways and means by which the early disclosure could be given.  I sympathise with the Deputy and I share his concern about the necessity for it but I would prefer to see it handled some other way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the steps that have been taken to investigate recent allegations of exploitation of young people by hoteliers and restauranteurs in the Galway area; if the allegations have been substantiated, and, if so, the measures that have been adopted to end such practices and to ascertain whether such practices are occurring elsewhere in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the allegations relate to conditions in the Galway area in July&mdash;August last which were the subject of press publicity last December.</P>
      <P>The wages and conditions of employees in hotels outside Dublin and Dún Laoghaire are subject to regulation by Employment Regulation Order under the Industrial Relations Acts. Enforcement procedures include regular inspections of hotels.  Such inspections were carried out in Salthill and Galway in August and September last. In Salthill 29 hotels were inspected and no evidence of underpayments was revealed. In Galway 15 hotels were inspected: two were found in breach of the order and immediate arrangements were made for payment of arrears of wages.</P>
      <P>The press publicity referred also to the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, and the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977.  There is no record of complaints of breaches of the Holidays Act in respect of young employees in this area at the time.  As the Young Persons' Act had come into operation as recently as 5 July 1977, some employers may not have been fully aware of its provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have publicised the Young Persons' Act through press advertisements, explanatory leaflets, issue of an abstract of the Act and other publicity measures.  Various inspections <Col N="76" /> have also been made as a result of complaints.  Over the Christmas holiday period a survey was carried out of hotels, licensed premises, shops and supermarkets to ensure that employers were aware of the Act and of the need for strict compliance.  The survey also covered a number of hotels in Galway.</P>
    <P>Where there are breaches of protective labour legislation prosecutions are undertaken, where appropriate.  The policy has been to allow employers an initial period to familiarise themselves with the Young Persons' Act during which prosecutions will be undertaken only where there are serious breaches.  It is my intention after the initial period of grace to have more rigorous enforcement.</P>
    <P>Investigation of the allegations in the December publicity was made difficult because so much time had elapsed and no particulars of employers or employees were given.  Organisations or individuals which consider that breaches of protective labour legislation are taking place should give full information immediately to my Department which will investigate the complaints and take appropriate action.</P>

      <P>My attitude is that the Act should be implemented. At the same time I think it desirable that there should be a period of time to enable people to familiarise themselves with the provisions of the Act. The Act became law on 5 July last and then inspectors either had to be appointed or given authorisation to <Col N="77" /> operate the Act and a good part of the summer was gone.  I would hope the position would now be well known in advance of next summer and that people will comply with the regulations under the Act.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he has seen the <i>Newsletter</i> of the Confederation of Irish Industry of 17 January 1978 which states that the introduction of the UK temporary employment subsidy of £20 per week for 12 months has more than likely resulted in the loss of 3,000 to 4,000 jobs in Irish labour intensive industries and that the subsidy does not conform with Article 92 of the Treaty of Rome; and if he will give consideration to a scheme which will enable Irish industry to counter the effect of the British subsidy while payments continue to be made under the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the article in question.  The Deputy will now be aware that the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement on 1 February 1978 announced that the Government had decided that firms engaged in the clothing and footwear industries and some areas of the textiles industry which were particularly affected by the UK Temporary Employment Subsidy would be assisted by a payment of £5 per week in respect of each worker on their payroll.</P>
      <P>It is considered that this payment should help appreciably to offset the worst effects of the British subsidy in the way of increased and unfair competition in these sectors of the Irish market.</P>
      <P>The scheme will come into operation from the beginning of April 1978. Details are being worked out and will be announced as soon as possible.  A sum of £5 million has been allocated for this purpose in the current financial year.</P>

      <P>The Gweedore Industrial Training Centre was established specifically for the purpose of providing industrial training in Irish for native speakers from Gaeltacht areas.  When training courses are being arranged in the centre preference for admittance to these courses is given to applicants from the Gaeltacht and applicants from non-Irish-speaking areas are not accepted until all applicants from Gaeltacht residents have been accommodated.  The majority of trainees at the centre are native Irish speakers.</P>
      <P>There are 31 instructors employed by AnCO at the Gweedore Centre, 26 of them native Irish speakers and the remaining five having a proficient knowledge of Irish.  All instructors employed there are competent to instruct through Irish and this is the usual medium of instruction employed.</P>

      <P>However, special regulations for the safety, health and welfare of workers who may be exposed to particular risks, are provided for in various sections of the Factories Act, 1955 and the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965.</P>
      <P>Provision for medical supervision of the workers concerned is normally included in such special regulations. Section 20 of the Factories Act, 1955, empowers the making of special regulations for medical supervision of persons who are, or are about to be, employed in work which may cause risk or injury to their health.  Regulations to the same effect are made under the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965.</P>

      <P>One of the proposed schemes presented to me by the Employment Action Team, and subsequently approved by the Government, related to a census of the Ballyfermot area.  The proposal arose from discussions between the team and representatives of Ballyfermot Community Association.  The team recommended that a grant be provided towards the cost of a census aimed at providing statistical information needed by the association's employment action group.  It is estimated that the census will provide short-time employment for about 50 people at a cost of about £10,000.</P>
      <P>As recommended by the team, I intend to have this census carefully monitored with a view to determining the possibilities for similar community-based surveys elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for contact to be made with the Ballyfermot Community Association and a meeting of interested parties is being arranged to discuss the details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The training needs of North Tipperary are served by the AnCO Training Centres at Limerick and Shannon where there are 422 training places in a wide variety of adult and apprenticeship courses which will allow some 1,400 persons to be trained during 1978.  In addition, special courses are provided by AnCO from time to time, as required, in mobile centres and vocational schools in various towns in North Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the training needs of the area are at present adequately met by the existing arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Minister's report as being adequate in covering the needs of the region, would he not agree, in view of the fact that Limerick and Clare have separate AnCO training centres, that North Tipperary, which forms part of the mid-West region with Limerick and Clare, is not being fairly treated, that there should be a permanent AnCO training centre there either in Nenagh or Thurles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy says that North Tipperary is being treated unfairly I think he is referring to the location rather than that they are not being fairly treated in Limerick and Shannon.  I understand the Deputy's concern, that he would like to see a training centre in his country.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is probably from the courses available in both the Shannon <Col N="86" /> and Limerick centres&mdash;and the availability of mobile training or part-time training in some towns in North Tipperary&mdash;that a better service is available in the area as a result.</P>

      <P>As the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance announced in his Financial Statement on 1 February 1978, the Government have accepted a number of proposals from the Employment Action Team including a proposal for a Work Experience Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Manpower Service of my Department will be responsible for the implementation of this programme and the service is currently making the necessary arrangements in consultation with the Department of Education and other agencies involved for <Col N="87" /> the introduction of the programme at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Until such time as the final details of the programme have been formulated, it will not be possible to provide definitive answers to some of the questions raised by the Deputy.  However, in its proposal the team envisaged that under the Work Experience Programme young unemployed persons would be placed with private and public employers to obtain practical experience of different jobs.  During this period the young people would receive a weekly allowance from the State.</P>

After 660 hours formal instruction he then took his junior trade certificate. <Col N="94" /> Under the new apprenticeship system, which applies to 12 boys in Cabra, an apprentice receives 46 weeks off-the-job formal instruction in his first year as follows.  In an AnCO centre he has 36 four-day weeks of eight-hour days, totalling 1,152 hours; ten weeks of five-day eight-hour days; and, in addition, in Kevin Street he has 25 weeks of 11 hours, which is the 275 hours referred to in the reply.  He has a total of 1,827 hours of formal off-the-job instruction now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced some months ago changes in the board's marine credit plan.  The main changes were a reduction in the deposit for vessels between 66 and 90 feet and an extension of the repayment period for loans for these vessels from eight to 12 years.  Another feature was an increase in the rate of grant from 25 per cent to 50 per cent of the cost of adapting vessels to new methods of fishing.  The purpose of these changes was to help to generate more work in Irish boatyards and I am pleased to be able to tell the House that these changes are having the desired effect.</P>
      <P>A number of fishermen have recently displayed an interest in vessels in excess of 90 feet in length which do not at present come within the ambit of the marine credit plan.  I have asked An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to examine the question of the extension of the plan to these vessels as a matter of urgency but before approving of such an extension I will have to be satisfied that these vessels will be capable of and used for catching fish well offshore and not operated in grounds already being fished successfully by our existing fleet.</P>
      <P>In addition to their function, connection with the development of the fishing fleet, the board continue to operate the various advisory services to fishermen, fish processors and exporters and, much of the credit for the increased exports must be attributed to these services.</P>
      <P>Steady progress is being made in providing improvement works where they are needed for fish landings, berthing of boats and other necessary facilities at fishing ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At Killybegs, proposals are in hands for the installation of a syncrolift and <Col N="110" /> boat repair facilities, the provision of an auction hall and port offices, the development of the White House property, the re-siting of the oil tanks, additional dredging where needed and the building of a harbour master's house.</P>
    <P>At Castletownbere, works this year include site development on Dinish Island for fish related and general industries, the provision there of an electricity supply, an effluent disposal unit and roads and surface drainage. The surfacing of the mainland wharf will also be undertaken and a net store and box store will be provided there.</P>
    <P>At Howth, work is expected to commence this year on the dredging of the west side of the harbour as the initial part of a major development scheme for the harbour.</P>
    <P>My Department have in hands also for this year proposals for development works at 29 other landing places around the coast including major works at Greencastle, Burtonport, Caherciveen, Skerries and Clogher Head.</P>
    <P>Deputies have had ample opportunity in recent times to indulge in a wide-ranging debate on fisheries aspects of our membership of the European Communities and in particular on the proposed review of the common fisheries policy.  The Government position in relation to a final agreement and to the interim arrangements for this year was made clear by me then and I do not propose to go over the same ground again here to-day. I would like to stress, however, that in the Government's view it is not a realistic proposition to press the policy of a 50-mile exclusive limit at the present time.  We have at present an opportunity to secure substantial benefits for our fishermen under a system of fishing plans which can be negotiated with our partners in the Community and implemented as a national measure as an interim arrangement for 1978.  Such plans will involve a special preference for Irish fishermen in our waters and will secure a reduction in fishing effort on the part of our Community partners in these waters.  I am proposing to set up <Col N="111" /> a working group and to invite the two fishermen's organisations, the IFO and the IFPO, to work with us in co-ordinating an agreed national approach on these plans and to supervise their operation.  I must point out, however, that these arrangements have yet to be finalised but in the absence of agreement on a revised common fisheries policy my main concern must be to prevent a free-for-all situation in 1978 which would be so completely disastrous to the Irish fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I now turn to our inland fisheries the most important of which is, of course, our salmon fisheries.  The overall catch for salmon in 1977 again showed a drop on the 1976 total which was 30 per cent lower than that recorded in 1975.  The market value in 1977 was maintained at a satisfactorily high level.  Based on provisional figures now available the total weight of the catch for the year 1977 by all fishing methods was 1,259 metric tons, valued at £4,531,000 as compared with 1,492 metric tons, valued at £5,302,000 in 1976.  These figures do not include those for sea trout which, however, are of relatively minor importance.</P>
    <P>The estimated quantity of salmon exported in 1977 was 945 metric tons valued at £3,482,000 compared with 1,209 metric tons valued at £4,633,000 in 1976.  Some of the salmon was, of course, exported in processed form which increased the export value compared with the landed value.  Officers of my Department continued to keep a check on the standard of Irish salmon exported.</P>
    <P>As to salmon fishing in general, we are now facing a very serious problem that calls for prompt and effective action.  Catches which had been on a high level for quite a number of years dropped considerably in 1976 and this trend continued in 1977.  Additional conservation measures were introduced in 1977 limiting the depth of drift nets and requiring all boats and nets used in salmon fishing to be numbered to correspond with the licence numbers held by the fishermen.  The ban on the use of monofilament nets in salmon <Col N="112" /> fishing was also reintroduced.  Despite these measures, however, the stocks continued to decline due mainly to illegal fishing which has now reached alarming proportions.  The various controls are being flagrantly ignored by many of the fishermen and there is clear-cut evidence that large vessels using nets grossly in excess of the maximum length permitted, and in many cases with their owners not even holding fishing licences, are taking very substantial amounts of salmon.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the illegal fishing be stamped out if there is to be any hope of achieving the required level of escapement to freshwater.  For the 1978 season, I have arranged that the funds available for the various boards of conservators will be considerably increased in order to allow them to recruit extra staff.  I am also seeking the co-operation of the navy in enforcing the fishery laws at sea where the greatest damage is being done by illegal fishing.  The Garda, who have always co-operated with the fishery protection staff, are also being asked to step-up their vigilance.</P>
    <P>The work of protection and development of the fisheries in the various fishery districts rests with the boards of conservators.  Apart from the enforcement of the various fishery laws which is a most difficult task, the conservators have to deal with the threat of pollution which arises from effluent discharges from industrial and agricultural sources and from town sewage.  Pollution officers employed by the boards have made considerable progress in pin-pointing sources of pollution and in persuading would-be polluters to take remedial action. Where co-operation has not been forthcoming, boards have had to resort to court action and in many cases the polluters have been successfully prosecuted.  With the enactment of the Water Pollution Act, 1977, which places overall responsibility for clean water on the Department of the Environment and the local authorities it is to be hoped that a new era in pollution control is dawning.  The responsibility for the protection of fish and fish life will, however, continue <Col N="113" /> to be the responsibility of my Department and of the boards of conservators.</P>
    <P>On the development side, boards of conservators, often in collaboration with angling associations, continue to promote suitable work by arranging for removal of obstructions to fish movement in rivers and clearing the spawning beds for better propagation. For such situations, river improvement works grants are available to cover most of the cost.  In any case in which technical advice is required, my Department give every assistance in the design and execution of the works.  In addition, extensive research work with a view to conserving and developing our salmon stocks has been carried out by my Department throughout 1977 and will be intensified in 1978.</P>
    <P>In order to bridge the growing gap between the expenses of conservation and the statutory incomes of the boards of conservators, the Exchequer grant to the Salmon Conservancy Fund has to be increased each year and £745,000 has been allocated for this purpose in 1978.  By far the greater part of the grant is required to supplement the direct income of boards of conservators from the sale of licences and from fishery rates, the total of which income fails to keep pace with the steadily rising level of salaries, wages and incidental expenses.</P>
    <P>A sum of £75,000 is included in the estimates to meet our contribution towards the expenses of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  A similar contribution is being made by the Department of Agriculture in Belfast.</P>
    <P>In recent years the commission's operations have resulted in annual deficits.  These are due to the fact that while their outgoings&mdash;principally wages&mdash;are increasing each year, revenue, by way of licence duties and profit from their commercial fishery, has not succeeded in keeping pace with the increasing expenditure.</P>
    <P>I am very much impressed by the excellent co-operation which exists in this North/South body and I desire to record my appreciation of the excellent work being accomplished by the commission and their staff.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Fisheries Vote for the payment of a substantially <Col N="114" /> increased grant-in-aid of £750,000 to the Inland Fisheries Trust.  This sum includes a provision for the creation of new posts and reflects the Government's confidence in the work of the trust.  The trust carried out a highly successful programme of investigation and development of brown trout, coarse fishing and sea angling waters during the past year.  In this connection I would like to thank the council of the trust and their staff for their dedication and hard work not just in the past year but indeed over the years.</P>
    <P>A grant-in-aid of £11,000 to the Salmon Research Trust, which is funded jointly by my Department and Arthur Guinness Son and Co. Ltd., has been provided in the Estimates.  During the year the trust continued their specialised work in relation to salmon and sea trout.  I would like to pay tribute to the director and his staff for the research work carried out over the years.</P>
    <P>Following a review of the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1974. at the end of the 1977 fishing season. I considered that the exclusion by the terms of that order of certain fishermen who derived their livelihood mainly from fishing was inequitable.</P>
    <P>Accordingly I made provision in the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1977, whereby fishermen who derived their livelihood mainly from fishing and who in the opinion of the board of conservators are persons to whom a licence should be issued may be considered for the grant of a licence.</P>
    <P>Although the work of the Electricity Supply Board in relation to fisheries is not provided for in the Fisheries Estimate I would like to express my appreciation of the excellent manner in which fisheries under their control are managed and developed.</P>
    <P>I would now like to say a few words about a provision that is appearing for the first time in the Estimates for Inland Fisheries, namely, a sum of £250,000 in connection with the acquisition of fisheries.  It is desirable that it be made clear at the outset that there is no question of our embarking on a nationalisation process which will involve the complete acquisition of all private fisheries. <Col N="115" /> What is proposed is that, where a need is seen to take over a private fishery for the better management of the fisheries generally of that area or for scientific purposes, there will be no obstacle to such a course of action being taken.</P>
    <P>This is in line with one of the recommendations of the Inland Fisheries Commission relating to the purchase of fisheries on a voluntary basis.  In addition, I am proposing to take power of compulsory purchase under new legislation which is at present in course of preparation and which will shortly be brought before the House.  Naturally, I would envisage that this power would be invoked only in the most exceptional case and would be subject to the owner's right of appeal and to the payment of fair compensation.</P>
    <P>I should at this stage inform the House that my Department have recently acquired on a voluntary basis the Galway Fishery, which constitutes one of the most important private salmon and eel fisheries in the country. The management of this fishery will now be planned primarily for the benefit of the fisheries of the area but will include a rational degree of commercial utilisation.  As it constitutes a new venture by my Department it will serve somewhat as a pilot scheme which will help enormously in setting our future policy in regard to the acquisition of private fisheries.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of the whole structure of Inland Fisheries which was recommended by the Inland Fisheries Commission is now the subject of the proposed legislation to which I have already referred and which I hope to introduce in the Dáil shortly.  This legislation will make provision for the establishment of a central board and seven regional boards to replace the existing 17 boards of conservators and the Inland Fisheries Trust.  The legislation will also provide for vastly increased penalties for fishery offences, for the acquisition of private fisheries and for stricter controls on sales of salmon. It is expected that the new structure will be set up by October of this year. It is my intention that the central <Col N="116" /> board will have the responsibility for directing the regional boards as to their functions, duties and activities in the context of policy as laid down by the Minister for Fisheries.</P>
    <P>With this proposed comprehensive restructuring, allied to an increased financial State commitment, I am confident that we are entering a new era in our inland fisheries administration which will in a relatively short time prove of immense benefit to our own fishermen and to tourist anglers.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>

      <P>We will now take Forestry.  Deputies will understand that we are debating Fisheries and Forestry together.  At the conclusion, separate decisions can be taken on both Votes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>Turning to the Forestry Vote, the net estimate is £13,866,000, an increase of £396,000 on the 1977 estimate, due in the main to higher salaries and wages arising from awards under national wage agreements and to price rises partly offset by an increase of £1,400,000 in Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>In the course of what follows I do not intend to examine in detail certain subheads of the Vote which provide for about the same level of activity as last year.</P>
      <P>These are: subhead A.1&mdash;Salaries, wages and allowances at £4,621,000; subhead B.1&mdash;Travelling and Incidental Expenses at £937,000; subhead B.2 &mdash;Post Office Services at £189,000; subhead B.3&mdash;Office machinery and other office supplies at £61,000; subhead C.3&mdash;Sawmilling at £145,000; subhead E&mdash;Forestry Education at £85,000; subhead F&mdash;John F. Kennedy Park at £88,000; subhead I&mdash;Agency, Advisory and Special Services at £127,000.</P>
      <P>I will be happy, of course, in the course of my closing speech to go into such detail as Deputies may require in regard to any of these heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subhead A.2 a provision of £20,000 has been made for consultancy services.  This is a repeat of a provision <Col N="117" /> made but not utilised in 1977. The Forest and Wildlife Service is co-operating with the Industrial Development Authority in a sectoral study of the timber industry.  It is possible that in the course of the study it may be desirable to engage outside consultants and the present provision is made for that purpose.</P>
    <P>On subhead C.1&mdash;Grant-in-Aid for the acquisition of land&mdash;the balance in the fund at 1 January 1978 was £436,268.  I am providing in this estimate for £1,000,000, giving a total sum available for land acquisition for the year 1978 of £1,436,268.  This should be adequate for the purchase of land likely to become available in 1978.</P>
    <P>The productive or plantable areas available in the total lands acquired in 1976 and 1977 were as follows: 1976&mdash; 9,093 hectares (22,469 acres); 1977&mdash; 8,275 hectares (20,448 acres).  These additions to the plantable reserve are not adequate to maintain an effective planned planting programme of 10,000 hectares.  The continuing inflation, the increased prices for agricultural produce and the unprecedented escalation of land prices, with the consequent reluctance of land holders to part with any land, are all factors which militate strongly against any significant improvement in land acquisition prospects.</P>
    <P>During the past year we have introduced a substantially improved scale of prices for the purchase of land for forestry and we hope to arrest the downward trend in our acquisition figure.  The increased prices are, of course, so scaled as to avoid competition for land which should more desirably be utilised for agricultural production. Our objective must be to acquire sufficient land to service and annual planting programme of 10,000 hectares and I can assure the House that my Department will spare no effort to attain that objective.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.2&mdash;Forest Development and Management&mdash;at £11,333,000 is, as usual, the main expenditure subhead of the Vote and represents an increase of £665,000 over the 1977 provision.  Deputies will be aware that this subhead caters for <Col N="118" /> many aspects of the development and management of the current forest estate of 357,000 hectares&mdash; almost 900,000 acres&mdash;and includes such matters as the raising of nursery stock, the establishment, maintenance and protection costs of State plantations, public recreation facilities, the purchase and maintenance of machinery, building of roads and the cost of timber felling and conversion in so far as these are undertaken by the Forest and Wildlife Service&mdash;in short, the many items that must be catered for to ensure the smooth running, consistent with economy, of the overall afforestation programme.</P>
    <P>The main subhead is broken down into seven subsections, C.2 (1) to C.2 (7), each catering for a convenient grouping of the development/management aspects I have mentioned.  Here again I do not propose going into each of these seven heads in detail because in general the money provided covers much the same level of activity as in previous years but inevitably reflects increases in wages and prices. Thus I will pass over C.2 (1) at £520,000 for nurseries, C.2 (2) at £2,356,000 for establishment of plantations, C.2 (3) at £791,000 for roads and buildings, C.2 (5) at £2,346,000 for mechanical equipment, and C.2 (6) at £3,680,000 for general forest management. Here also should Deputies wish to raise any points of detail I will cover these as necessary in my closing speech.</P>
    <P>Head C.2 (4) of subhead C.2 provides for amenity developments in the State forests.  The figure sought&mdash; £466,000&mdash;is an increase of £57,000 on the 1977 provision of £409,000. The increase is mainly due to rising costs of maintenance at the several hundred locations opened up to the public and which last year attracted some 1.5 million visitors.  The provision sought will also be utilised for continuing large-scale developments on planned State forest parks at Currahchase. County Limerick, and Doneraile, County Cork, and for completion of additional facilities including a visitors' centre at Portumna Forest Park, County Galway.</P>
    <P>On-going plans in the amenity and recreational fields will be aimed at <Col N="119" /> keeping abreast of continuing public demand in this important sphere of my Department's activities.</P>
    <P>The provision is, I feel, modest in relation to facilities provided for and enjoyed by an ever-increasing number of our people and of the visitors to our shores.</P>
    <P>The provision under subhead C.2 (7) is designed to cover the cost of an addition of 100 to the labour force employed on harvesting.  While the bulk of material removed from State forests will continue to be harvested by private enterprise, it is necessary to increase the service's own harvesting facilities to cope with increasing supplies of wood from the State forests.</P>
    <P>The provision for grants for afforestation purposes under subhead D has been increased from £25,000 to £30,000.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, I have recently introduced substantial increases in the grants for private planting. The basic grant for planting on areas of up to 40 acres has been increased from £35 to £90 per acre.  The provision for larger areas which qualify for grant will be increased to £50. Substantial increases have also been made in grants for the planting of broadleaved trees, for scrub clearance and for popular planting.</P>
    <P>Again, in fairness to those who undertook planting in the current planting season before the commencement of the increased grants, I have decided that the revised grants should be made retrospective to 1 October 1977.</P>
    <P>Further, I have decided that, because inflation has eroded the value, I am doubling the second instalments of grants falling normally due this season and in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>The increase in the provision on this head may seem modest in relation to these increases.  It is expected however that, as much of the current planting season has passed, the full impact of the improved grants will not take effect until later this year and the main expenditure increase will fall to be met in 1979.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with subheads G and H, which relate, respectively, to <Col N="120" /> game development and conservation projects, I should like to refer briefly to the new legislation, namely the Wildlife Act, 1976, which is now being operated by the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department, and to highlight some of its more important provisions.</P>
    <P>This Act came into operation on 1 June 1977 and provides a much-needed statutory backing for my Department's work on wildlife conservation and game development by up-dating hunting laws and affording protection for our wild fauna and flora.</P>
    <P>Under the Act new game hunting controls were put into effect in time for the 1977-78 open season.  Basically these require that persons, including visitors to the State who wish to engage in game shooting, must show that they have lawful access to shooting rights and must also possess a licence to hunt in addition to their firearm certificates. The main objective is to eliminate poaching.  In this context I have recently, by way of regulations, declared some 670 named game conservation clubs and associations throughout the country to be recognised bodies for the purpose of enabling them to prosecute offences for trespass on their own preserves.</P>
    <P>New regulations have also been made under the Act to control commercial exploitation of protected species of wild birds and animals, including game species, and persons such as game dealers, hoteliers, restaurant owners and taxidermists engaged in buying and selling such species must now have a wildlife dealer's licence, the concept of which is much broader than the game dealer's licence which previously obtained.  To meet the growing menace of indiscriminate and cruel methods of trapping and snaring wild animals&mdash;usually for profit &mdash;new controls are now in operation and these will be supplemented later by restrictions on the export of certain wild birds and wild animals and, in some cases, their skins.</P>
    <P>My Department have currently under consideration the appointment, in accordance with section 72 of the Act, of a corps of &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; whose functions will include the enforcement <Col N="121" /> of its control provisions. They would act in the wildlife sphere more or less as an arm of the Garda Síochána, who will of course continue to be actively involved in dealing with offences under the Wildlife Act.  I hope to make a number of these appointments in the course of the year.</P>
    <P>The Wildlife Advisory Council, provided for in section 13 of the Wildlife Act, will be established by me shortly. It is my earnest hope that by virtue of their experience and practical knowledge a broadly representative council will be a productive source of advice in the development by my Department of effective policy and programmes for wildlife conservation.</P>
    <P>All in all we now have in the Wildlife Act itself and in the regulation process provided by it a sound basis on which to undertake worthwhile programmes in the game development and wildlife conservation sectors, aimed at safeguarding and conserving these important aspects of the national heritage.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, while on the subject of the Wildlife Act&mdash;a very complex and comprehensive piece of legislation&mdash;I should mention that as part of their continued efforts to meet demands from the public for literature on wildlife matters my Department have produced a special booklet entitled <i>Wildlife and the Law</i> which sets out to explain in layman's language the various provisions of the Act.  Some time ago I had a copy of this booklet sent with my compliments to each Member of the House and I unhesitatingly commend it to them.</P>
    <P>Against that general background I can now deal more specifically with subheads G and H of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>As in previous years, the main expenditure under subhead G&mdash;£230,000 &mdash;is on grants to regional game councils to assist their development schemes, which are formulated and operated in consultation with the advisory staff of the Forest and Wildlife Service.  These schemes relate principally to programmes of restocking of pheasant and duck as well as habitat improvement and some educational projects.  The subhead also contains provision for projects sponsored by <Col N="122" /> a joint committee, representing the Forest and Wildlife Service and Bord Fáilte, for the development and control of game shooting facilities for visitors.</P>
    <P>The substantial increase in the current year's provision under the subhead is intended to defray the cost involved in appointing authorised persons to assist in the enforcement of the Wildlife Act, not only in relation to game matters but also in the context of the entire wildlife spectrum.  As already indicated, I hope to see a number of these appointments made during the year.</P>
    <P>Subhead H is a conservation grant-in-aid which, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, is used to meet the cost of conservation projects&mdash;as distinct from game development programmes&mdash;approved of or engaged in by my Department or any other Department.  There is already a substantial balance from previous years in the grant-in-aid which should be sufficient to meet the needs of the current year's on-going and projected programmes relating to wildlife conservation; hence the absence of an input of funds to the subhead this year.  Much of the current work is related to surveys and research, essential to any conservation programme.  These include surveys of wetland vegetation, plant communities and so on, as well as distribution studies and research on a wide variety of fauna such as deer, pine marten, squirrels and some game species.</P>
    <P>More tangible evidence of my Department's wildlife conservation activities is to be found in the management of valuable habitats such as the internationally important Wexford Wildfowl Reserve, the barnacle goose sanctuary at Lissadell in County Sligo and a number of semi-natural oak woodlands, amounting in all to about 2,000 hectares, located throughout the country.  It is my intention to use the powers under the Wildlife Act, 1976, to intensify the habitat conservation programme with a view to converting as many sensitive areas as possible into nature reserves for appropriate management.</P>
    <P>When speaking earlier about the booklet on the Wildlife Act, I alluded to the educational side of the wildlife <Col N="123" /> scene&mdash;a feature which I regard as most important.  I am happy to record a sustained interest in wildlife conservation by the general public and especially by the schools.  This is reflected in the well-supported residential weekend conservation courses for youth leaders and primary teachers held during the summer months at the Avondale Forestry Extension School and in the regular demand for the Department's expanding stock of literature on wildlife and nature conservation matters.</P>
    <P>Another recent important and informative publication by the Forest and Wildlife Service was a booklet entitled <i>Wetlands Discovered</i> which describes the various types of wetland habitats in Ireland including historical, geographical and ecological aspects. This was a major contribution to the 1976-77 international publicity campaign on wetlands undertaken by the Council of Europe's Information Centre for Nature Conservation for which the Forest and Wildlife Service acts as the Irish national agency.  These biennial Council of Europe campaigns are extremely valuable in stimulating and maintaining public awareness of specific elements of nature conservation. The council's next campaign, scheduled for 1979, will deal with conservation of wildlife and natural habitats and my Department will contribute as fully as resources permit.</P>
    <P>Under subhead J&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid at a figure of £5 million represents an increase of £1,400,000 over last year's figure.  This increase is due to a rise in the estimated receipts both from sales of timber in the round, £4,640,000, and from Department's sawmills, £185,000.  The four main processing mills, which utilise small-sized timber for the production of woodpulp, chipboard and fibreboard, have been experiencing some trading difficulties since the latter half of 1977 due to a general trade recession in European countries which has resulted in the closure of several large concerns engaged in similar manufacturing processes. This in turn has depressed the sales of small-sized timber in the round and there is reason to believe that the <Col N="124" /> depression will continue for some time during the current year.  I am confident, however, that any slight loss of income in this regard will be more than compensated by a marked increase in sales of sawlog timber for which there is a continual demand from sawmillers and timber merchants. As regards the processing mills, the Government are aware of their difficulties and are doing everything possible through the medium of the Industrial Development Authority, Fóir Teoranta and the various Government Departments concerned to lessen the burden on them as far as possible.</P>
    <P>State forests represent a very heavy investment of public money and it is in everybody's interest that they grow to maturity with the minimum loss through fire or other damage.</P>
    <P>Substantial sums of money are provided each year for the protection of forests from fire&mdash;our spending on protection in the current year is of the order of £300,000&mdash;but there is, of course, a limit to what can be spent economically on such protection.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis the protection of the forests from the greatest enemy, the fire hazard, depends on the care, good sense and goodwill of our citizens. It is, after all, their money that has been invested by successive Governments in State forestry.</P>
    <P>I know that there is a great deal of goodwill towards State forestry and I appreciate very much the fact that the opening of our forests for recreation has not involved significant increases in damage to the plantations.</P>
    <P>There are, unfortunately, with us the careless and the selfish who, through failure to take reasonable precautions, put our plantations at hazard. Last year more than 3,000 acres of plantations were destroyed.  In one fire alone 1,300 acres were lost.  Practically all of these losses were avoidable.  One cannot emphasise too often the need for care in the vicinity of young plantations. People should avoid lighting picnic fires near plantations if at all possible.  In any event, all fires, matches and cigarettes should be carefully extinguished before being left or discarded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> Moor burning by farmers to improve grazing is another serious cause of forest fires.  Under the new wildlife legislation burning of vegetation is completely prohibited during the period 15 April to 31 August each year.  Outside that period, the procedure is simple.  If a landowner proposes to burn vegetation within a mile of a plantation he should notify the local Gardaí and the State forester&mdash; or, in the case of private estates, the estate owner&mdash;at least seven days before undertaking such burning.  In the case of State forests, if the forester feels that the burning is likely to endanger the plantation he will contact the landowner with a view to agreeing on a suitable date on which he can arrange to have staff available to protect the forest.</P>
    <P>Failure to comply with these simple rules can involve a landowner in heavy fines and payments for any damage done to the plantations.  Compliance with these simple rules can avoid this danger.  When a landowner complies with these procedures and arranges for burning in agreement with the forester, then, so far as State forests are concerned, he need not fear prosecution or any claim for damages should the burning unhappily get out of hand and damage State forest property.  I feel that the message of ensuring the safety of forests cannot be repeated too often and I have no doubt that Deputies from both sides of the House will lend their support to putting this message across as opportunity offers.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like, in presenting these two Votes together, to draw attention to the affinities between the two divisions of my Department.  Both are concerned in the first instance with the harvesting and development of national resources, both of fish and wood, which can on the one hand substitute for costly imports and on the other provide the potential for additional employment in the harvesting and processing of fish and wood.</P>
    <P>Apart, however, from the economic value of these contributions the forestry and fishery interests and particularly the inland fisheries side share with the wildlife conservation arm of my Department responsibility for the <Col N="126" /> improvement of the natural environment and the enhancement of the quality of life in this country.</P>
    <P>It will be the aim of my Department to continue to pursue these complementary objectives and thus make the greatest possible contribution both economically and socially within the resources available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The country is still reeling from the effects of the Letterkenny debacle.  There is reference in the Minister's speech to the common fisheries policy negotiations and, though I do not intend to dwell on the point, I must mention recent happenings in passing.  They reminded me of a colonial reconquest with Gundelach acting in the role of conqueror being aided and abetted by our Minister for Fisheries.  It was an extremely sad occasion and I cannot blame the leaders of the fishermen or the Leader of Fine Gael for their extreme bitterness at the somersault that has taken place.</P>
      <P>I regret that all those Fianna Fáil speakers who came in here a year ago and nailed their colours to the mast and raised their flag of support for the proposal for a 50-mile exclusive limit have not seen fit to apologise to the public, particularly to the fishermen. Their absence this year from debates on fisheries has been most noted&mdash;not one of them appeared.  They showed complete cowardice.  People who told us they would not give an inch on a 50-mile limit less than 12 months ago now refuse to say anything about the issue.  Of course the public expect politicians to be a little twisted&mdash;poetic licence it might be called&mdash;but it is not an excuse and we would not be doing our duty if we did not say so here. This has lowered the level of political debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be realistic.  The 50-mile limit has gone and the Minister in suggesting that the option is still there is not being truthful.  The option is not there.  We have caved in and we must take the best we can out of the proposed fishing plan which has been put forward by the Council of Ministers.  I should like to see the Minister, although he is in a very weak position, trying to salvage <Col N="127" /> some little hope of prosperity for the Irish fishing industry.  The fishing plan idea is not completely new and I will not be so dishonest as to say that the Coalition Government would not have gone along with some such idea.</P>
    <P>However, the whole outcome depends on who operates this plan, who controls conservation within the 200-mile limit.  If the Minister can get agreement that Ireland will operate conservation in that area there is still hope for our fishing industry.  On the other hand, if, as I suspect, the political power of the Europeans will prove superior and if they get their way and they dictate the terms, our fishing industry will face ruin.  There are to be fishing plans, but let us control conservation in our area.  Any of us who have seen those people operating in previous years know what will happen if they get control.  They do not give a damn about conservation.  I have seen the Dutch and the French operating within 100 yards of the Irish coast and I can assure the House that there will be no fishing industry left if they are allowed to dictate those plans.</P>
    <P>We must be allowed to control conservation in our own waters.  That should be the Minister's definite line when those plans will be presented in the next couple of weeks.  We have been told they will come into operation on 1 April next and that if they have proved satisfactory they will become permanent as from 1 January 1979.  The 50-mile limit concept has gone because those people are not fools.  They outwitted the Minister and they will try to do it again.  They know that if they behave themselves in the next nine months the fishing plans will remain for eternity.  Would they not be fools, therefore, if they contravened the rules and regulations that will accompany these plans before 1 January 1979?  They would be cutting their throats.</P>
    <P>So we can expect them to play ball with us during the next nine months, but after that bedlam will reign.  I will not go into what they have done in the past.  I will go further afield to see what other countries have done.  I will <Col N="128" /> refer specifically to Canada and Norway, both of whom have declared a 200-mile limit.  They allow other countries to fish in their zones but on their own terms, but they rigidly control conservation.  Any foreign boat entering Canadian waters fishing under licence must first go to a certain port and collect a fisheries officer who supervises the fishing carried out by the crew of that boat.  When the boat has completed its tour of duty the fishery officer is taken back.  The whole exercise is at the expense of the country whose boat is in Canadian waters.  That is a very effective control mechanism.</P>
    <P>Norway does not work in as rigid a fashion but coastguards freely come on boats that have a licence to fish in their waters.  We must have some such scheme.  I do not trust the Dutch or the French; I never have.  I could not, and I think my suspicions will be borne out if they are allowed a free-hand.  Let us have a rigid control over anybody who is going to fish within 200 miles of our shores.  Let them bear the cost of any inspection duties carried out by our fishery inspectors.</P>
    <P>The Minister came back from Brussels a few weeks ago and made a great song and dance about the fact that he had secured £30 million to enlarge our naval protection service. He told us that not only were we going to get five or six new protection boats but that we would get five or six planes as well.  Against whom are we going to use those vessels and aircraft? I have great faith in third countries. I do not think they will break the limit.  The Russians, with one exception, have invariably kept outside the limit.  They abide by the laws. We have nothing to fear from these third countries.  Our present naval protection service is quite sufficient to look after our fishing zones.  The Icelandic people have proved that with their meagre protection service.  They do the job properly and do not have any great problems.</P>
    <P>The people we need protection against are our partners in the EEC and that is where we should get the money.  We should have some provision <Col N="129" /> whereby we could put fishery officers aboard their vessels.  I would not let any of their boats inside our limit and accept their word that they were fishing for a certain type of fish and would catch only a certain quantity. I would not accept their word.</P>
    <P>It has been said that our industry is grossly underdeveloped.  Of course it is.  In addition to conservation measures the Minister should stand out for a deal that would make the continentals land a certain proportion of fish in Irish ports.  This would boost employment by giving us more processing industries, which are sadly lacking at the moment.  It is imperative that a sizeable proportion of what they catch in our waters should be landed here.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in reply to a question by Deputy Begley the Taoiseach gave a figure of £8,500,000 for imported fish. That is a very sizeable sum and is approximately half of the value of our fish exports.  We have a very poor record when it comes to processing industries and giving employment in this area.  If one goes into any super-market one sees shelves of canned fish.  Invariably they are from other countries but more often than not the fish were caught off our coasts.  For instance, mackerel is being sold in tins at the moment and it is one of the most common type of fish off our coasts.  Sardines and brisling primarily come from Norway but they are being caught off the south coast in enormous quantities at the moment in the form of sprat.  In the tinned form they are known as sardines or brisling.  We are exporting an enormous amount of fish in the raw state and we are importing a considerable quantity in processed form.  We should get the continentals to help pay for the development of our processing industries.</P>
    <P>Our harbours need to be modernised and we need many new harbours. There was an interesting statistic in the Minister's speech where he stated that in 1976 there were 2,495 full-time fishermen in Ireland and 4,898 part-time fishermen&mdash;almost exactly twice as many part-time as full-time fishermen.  There is a simple reason for that, namely, we do not have <Col N="130" /> enough harbours that are capable of being used in all kinds of weather.  I have no doubt that the majority of those part-time fishermen would be full-time fishermen if the facilities were available.  We should look to our partners in the EEC for considerable financial aid to provide proper facilities in our harbours.</P>
    <P>Many fishermen in my area are clamouring for better facilities in harbours but they are told the money is not there.  They can fish for salmon and lobster for about four months of the year but for the other eight months they have to draw the dole because there is no work available for them. We need not only to improve our processing industries but also to improve our harbours so that fishermen can fish throughout the year.  There is an interesting comparison between the number of people engaged on shore in our fishing industry and in continental fishing industries.  For every ten people in this country who are fishing at sea there are eight employed on shore in the processing industry. On the continent for every one man fishing at sea there are four people working in the processing industries. Those statistics are very revealing and they show the underdeveloped state of our processing industries.  We must do something concrete to reverse that trend.</P>
    <P>The history of our fishing industry in recent years has been a downward trend in catches.  It is a sad state of affairs, but the point is emphasised in the Minister's speech.  He said that in the first nine months of 1976 we caught 44,373 tonnes of fish but in 1977 this had dropped to 43,602 tonnes.  This was at a stage when our fishing fleet had expanded enormously.  Every year there has been an increase not only in the number of boats but in the size and in the horse power, which is the greatest criterion of all.  We are told that the catching power depends on this factor.  While our techniques improve and our boats get larger, our catches drop.  This is a most serious trend. It is the lever the Minister should use in his discussions with EEC members. The fish are just not there.  The catches decrease although our boats are larger <Col N="131" /> and our techniques improve.  That is the point we must drive home.</P>
    <P>Of course, the continentals will look for increased quotas.  They will look for more and more fish, but the fish are not there.  I could give a lot of statistics on those lines.  The continentals are notorious for inventing paper fish.  They demand higher quotas. They ruined fishing in the North Sea by working along those lines and they have ruined the herring fishing in the Celtic Sea by the same attitude.  They will continue to do so unless we put a stop to them.</P>
    <P>In 1974-75 the North-East Atlantic Fishing Commission estimated that 25,000 tonnes of herring could be taken from the Celtic Sea without harming the stocks, but the continentals demanded that they take 32,000 tonnes.  In 1975-76 the quota set by this commission was 25,000 tonnes but the continentals demanded more.  Despite their best efforts all they could catch on this occasion was 18,000 tonnes.  They could not catch what they set out to catch because the stocks were not there.  The end result has been that the Celtic Sea has been closed completely to herring fishing.</P>
    <P>The position is similar in area 6A off the Donegal coast.  In 1975 the quota for herring was set at 156,000 tonnes, but as a result of political pressure from the very same people, our partners in the EEC, the figure was eventually fixed at 205,000 tonnes.  The result was that in the following year the quota had to be reduced to 66,000 tonnes because gross overfishing took place in 1975.  This is the history of those people.  There is gross overfishing and an invention of figures to suit themselves so that they can get everything that is there while the going is good.  There is no interest in conservation.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister, in the discussions on the fishing plans, to make sure that any quotas based on fishing plans coincide with the views of the biologists in the Department of Fisheries.  Our biologists must know how much fishing the stocks can stand up to.  There are some wonderful people in the Department of Fisheries. <Col N="132" /> I have seen some of them working. They told us in the early seventies that the Celtic Sea over-fishing was chronic and that the stage would be reached where nothing would be left.  They were right.  Mr. Molloy in particular, a young biologist, was very definite about this fact, which unfortunately proved to be correct.  People like that should be allowed dictate the amount of fish that can be caught.  The continentals should not be allowed call the tune on that point.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of our fishing industry that need attention, especially marketing.  There is something drastically wrong in the fishing set-up here when the price the fishermen get is so low and the price paid by the consumer is so high.  We see reports every day from the Dublin fish market of fish fetching 10p, 20p and 30p a pound.  When one goes to buy the same fish one has to pay the best part of a £1 for a pound of it.  The fisherman is not getting a proper return for his produce.  Some middlemen along the line are making fantastic profits.  The Minister should introduce some mechanism to ensure that this profiteering is not allowed.</P>
    <P>People in various parts of the country, particularly inland areas but also some coastal areas, cannot get fresh supplies of fish when plenty of fish are being caught.  The marketing system is haywire.  I cannot understand why something cannot be done to make fish freely available in inland towns throughout the country.  I have been told that fish consumption in Ireland is less than in the city of Manchester. If that is true it is an astonishing indictment of our marketing system.</P>
    <P>There is a great demand for fish if people could get it.  Something should be done to rectify this.  There is something drastically wrong with our marketing system when a fisherman on the quay at Killybegs at the moment will get only £360 for a ton of herring. If he is lucky he will get about £65 for a cran.  I believe in Castletownbere last week they were getting only £50 a cran.  The most he will get is about £360 for a ton of herring, while in Holland a fisherman will get £4,500 <Col N="133" /> for the same amount.  Is that not an incredible breakdown in our marketing system?  We are equal in the EEC. There are no tariffs, import duties or anything else on such commodities, but there is that colossal difference between £360 given to the fisherman here and £4,500 given to the fisherman in Holland for the same quantity of fish.</P>
    <P>All our ills are not because of foreigners, their over-fishing and foul methods.  Many of the problems in the Irish fishing industry are of our own making.  It is a pity the Minister could not wait to hear all the speakers at the seminar in Letterkenny last week because he would have got some valuable information from some very able people in BIM and the Department of Fisheries.  Are they being listened to by the Minister or are they getting the finance to put their ideas into being?</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the script of Mr. McGrath, the senior engineer in the Department of Fisheries.  He reinforced some information I previously received.  This concerns the lack of training which our fishermen are getting.  It would seem that a large proportion of our fishermen, in particular our skippers, are not fully versed in manning the vessels which they operate and are not fully versed in using the sophisticated equipment which those vessels contain nowadays. Courses have been provided in the National Fishery School in Greencastle. It is a sad thing to relate that they are not being properly utilised. There are two different types of courses conducted at this school.  One of them is for trainee fishermen, young men of 16 to 18 years of age. They are usually fully taken up. There are plenty of applicants.</P>
    <P>However, there is a second course conducted by the National Fishery School which is called the skippers' course.  It only takes something like ten weeks but there are very few applicants to utilise the facilities provided. Mr. McGrath tells us that in 1974, while there was room for 46 people to be trained, there was only one applicant.  In 1975 there were two applicants.  In 1976 there were nine <Col N="134" /> applicants and, in 1977, there were 11 applicants.  I was up at the school about two months ago and there were only two people attending the trainee skipper's course while there were places for 23.  The course is run twice yearly.  This is an extremely sad state of affairs Our fishermen are not availing of the courses designed to teach them the type of techniques essential for the operation of modern trawlers. It has been stated&mdash;I do not know how true it is&mdash;that many people are getting very sophisticated equipment just for the sake of having it.  There is a certain prestige attached to it.  They do not know how to use it.  If that is true there is something radically wrong.</P>
    <P>We know our fishermen catch much less fish than other countries do. The catch per fisherman is extremely low in comparison with countries like Holland.  Perhaps the fact that they are not capable of utilising the sophisticated equipment they have is to blame for this and the Minister might set about ensuring that every fisherman is trained to the utmost in the techniques necessary.  Not alone should there be one man on each vessel capable of handling this equipment but there should be at least two so that one can relieve the other.</P>
    <P>Mr. McGrath also says:</P>
    <P>There is also need for obtaining uptodate information about new methods of fishing or about improved techniques.  Efforts to introduce such a Scheme at the School in Greencastle in the last year or two failed due to the inability to persuade the person selected to come to Ireland for the purpose at that time.</P>
    <P>Basic training in the use of Decca, Radar and Echo-Sounders is now being provided at the School at Greencastle.  Arrangements are in hand to provide instruction and training also in the use of Sonar. But even more will have to be provided to meet the needs of the fishermen.</P>
    <P>We obviously need a great deal more training and we probably need several more schools.  One of the speakers at <Col N="135" /> the seminar in Letterkenny made the point that the regional technical college there should be utilised for training fishermen in electronics.  I go so far as to say that a number of regional technical colleges around the country should be used for this purpose because the training facilities at the moment are obviously not sufficient. The money paid to the trainee skippers is not sufficient to entice them away from their work and that is probably the most likely reason why these courses are not being utilised.  One or two utilising the facilities in a year is absolutely ridiculous.  I would like the Minister to refer to this when he replies because it is a great drawback. Our industry will not progress if we do not have people properly trained in the necessary skills.</P>
    <P>The second part of this Estimate deals with the inland fisheries and primarily with the salmon industry. The Minister talks about poaching and pollution and other illegal practices taking place at the moment.  Last October the Minister promised he would introduce legislation early in 1978 to implement the main recommendations of the Inland Fisheries Commission. It is now early 1978.  Another salmon season has commenced and there is no new legislation.  I do not know if new legislation will be the answer to the wrongs perpetrated at the moment, but new legislation is imperative.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely emphasising the fact that legislation is needed. We have been promised legislation and I would like to see it in a matter of days or weeks because our salmon industry, a major industry and a very valuable one, is greatly in danger of extinction.  There will have to be drastic measures to deal with a drastic situation.  What has been happening along the west coast over the last number of years can no longer be tolerated. What measures is the Minister taking <Col N="136" /> to eliminate the wholesale illegal fishing?  I am referring to drift netting at sea with trawlers using miles of nets. Not all of these trawlers have got licences but they are getting away with it.  Last year some of these boats were challenged by water keepers in inferior craft and with inferior equipment and the water keepers were absolutely intimidated. So far as I know none of these people has been apprehended. Drift netting, if properly controlled, can be tolerated and can provide a very lucrative living for thousands of people but, if abused, the whole structure of the industry will collapse.  It has been abused and I would like the Minister to tell us what he is doing to stem the dreadful overfishing and poaching going on on the west and south-west coast.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister on an earlier occasion if he would provide more salmon licences and he said &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash; there were plenty in existence.  In the Minister's introductory statement, under the heading <i>Control of Fishing for Salmon</i>, he says:</P>
      <P>Following a review of the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order 1974, at the end of the 1977 fishing season, I considered that the exclusion, by the terms of that Order, of certain fishermen, who derived their livelihood mainly from fishing, was inequitable.</P>
      <P>Accordingly I made provision in the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order 1977, whereby fishermen who derived their livelihood mainly from fishing and who in the opinion of persons to whom a licence should be issued, may be considered for the grant of a licence.</P>
      <P>Do I take it that means an additional number of salmon licences will be granted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are great pressures on Deputies on the south coast, where we have a great many licences, and on the west coast also for the granting of more licences, because it is a very lucrative form of fishing.  I am pleased to learn that there will not be additional ones granted.  What is happening at present must not merely be curtailed but stamped out.  I am pleased to note that the Minister has made additional moneys available to the present boards of conservators for the employment of more water-keepers.  It was brought to my attention recently that there is one waterkeeper only for approximately 150 miles of the west coast.  Is that possible?  From what we read in the newspapers this is where there are literally dozens, if not hundreds, of boats fishing illegally each season.</P>
      <P>There must be some drastic measures taken.  I agree with the Minister that the Naval Service should be employed to eliminate this.  Apart from the damage it is doing to the fishing industry generally and to the salmon stocks, it is very unfair to the genuine salmon fisherman who has a licence and who is dependent on it for his living.  He is becoming tired of reading articles in the newspapers by certain interests who want to stamp out drift-netting completely.  He feels he is carrying the can for the poachers. There is plenty of ground for retaining the number of licences we have as long as they are properly controlled.</P>
      <P>Too much emphasis is being placed on the effects of drift-netting on stocks. There are two other practices doing considerable damage, both of which are illegal and should be eliminated. One is poaching up the rivers.  In many cases district justices are far too lenient when dealing with persistent poachers. Some people are up in court several times a year and seem to get away with fines of a couple of pounds each time. The damage caused through this up-river poaching is immense and should not be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="138" /> The other source of danger to the industry is pollution.  In this respect we are not doing justice to the industry. Fishermen tell me there are considerable quantities of salmon out at sea. They feel the salmon are not going up rivers because they are too highly polluted.  The salmon, just like any other creature, is sensitive.  When it senses that a river is too toxic or has some repellant substance in it that does not agree with its constitution, it will not go up that river.  It appears that there is an enormous amount of pollution in our rivers.  Now and again we hear of thousands of trout and salmon being killed.  But there must also be that in-between stage in which salmon will not go up river, will not spawn and, therefore, there is a considerable reduction in stock.  Pollution is not being tackled as it should be.</P>
    <P>While the Minister tells us that under the Water Pollution Act, 1976, a whole lot of officers have been appointed to monitor estuaries and rivers, I still believe sufficient action is not being taken.  Nobody will convince me that the matter is being attended to in the manner warranted.  I know that local authorities recently gained power to employ engineers and clerks to monitor waterways in their areas.  I hope this will be successful, because I honestly believe the pollution aspect is being played down.  There is the old concept here that industry is more important than scenery, tourism and so on.  That is ridiculous because good fishing rivers attract an enormous number of tourists, who in turn provide money and employment. Pollution constitutes a retrograde step and allows industrialists to lobby people in an endeavour to avoid being prosecuted.  Such people should be laid on very heavily if proven guilty of polluting rivers.</P>
    <P>We look forward to the reorganisation of the inland fisheries.  Perhaps the Minister could give us some idea when that legislation will be introduced.  The present boards of conservators have a pathetic financial set-up.  They are making the best of a bad job, but that is not sufficient.  While on that subject I should like to refer to a particularly ill-advised Bill introduced by the Minister some months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an amount of agitation for the introduction of a deeper net in a certain part of the south coast.  While there was historical justification for such an extension in one area, the Minister allowed the extension of the net to cover the whole fisheries district.  This has engendered very bad feeling in neighbouring districts.  Now there is the anomalous situation in which people fishing out of the same port have to do so under different conditions.  For example, half of the fishermen at Helvick Head, which is the major fisheries port on the south coast, have licences in the Lismore area and the others have licences in the Waterford fisheries area. While the Lismore people can fish with nets of 45 meshes the people in the Waterford area have to fish with those of 30 meshes.  This had led to considerable ill-feeling.</P>
      <P>This is definitely a case of discrimination against one group.  I wonder will the Minister do anything to rectify that anomalous situation. Either we should have 30 meshes or the whole lot or 45.  There may be a certain historical case for the Lismore fishermen who always used a deep net but there is justifiable ill-feeling on the part of people who can use nets of only 30 meshes in the same area.  The Minister made a serious error there.  Either he should have confined it to the traditional area or made it 45 for the whole coast.  I am sure the Minister will hear a lot more about it from time to time.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the Inland Fisheries report acted on immediately. I should also like to see legislation introduced under which foreign fishing boats will be fined an adequate sum when apprehended in Irish waters. The loophole obtaining there at present cannot be tolerated.  I do not see why the Minister cannot bring in legislation overnight to plug that loophole.</P>

      <P>What is happening at present is that a Spanish or any other foreign boat can come in and catch hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of fish right in around our coast and the maximum fine is £100, whereas I believe in Britain for a similar breach of the law the fine is £50,000.  In the Isle of Man, apart from the fine of £50,000, the skipper and mate of such a boat can be sent to prison.  Certainly we need something to plug the existing loophole.</P>

      <P>The Spaniards seem to be making hay while the sun shines. They were getting caught at the rate of one a month.  Recently they were getting caught at the rate of one a week and now it is two a week.  I would ask the Minister to seriously consider withdrawing the concessions that are being granted to Spanish fishermen, because they are abusing those concessions wholesale and are doing immense damage to our fishing industry.  Like the French they persist in catching under-sized fish.  They have a concession to catch hake, one of the most valuable species off our coast. We should not tolerate their antics. Their methods are foul and they do not seem to give a damn about our existing laws.  Not many would give a damn if they knew they could catch up to £100,000 worth of fish and the maximum fine is only £100.  Something drastic needs to be done to plug this loophole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Forestry Estimate it is pleasant to see that instead of a drastic increase the increase is relatively small.  This seems to stem from the fact that the value of our forestry products has increased substantially. As a rural politician I get requests from progressive and small farmers, that land which the forestry section <Col N="141" /> have acquired for reafforestation, should be given to them for agricultural use because it is arable.  The question of what is fit and what is not fit for afforestation will be a great bone of contention as time passes. It is a difficult question to answer. People who are quite convinced that they can use land for agricultural purposes feel very sore at the fact that the Forestry Department went ahead and planted that land.  With the value of land and the thirst for land it will be difficult for the Minister to meet his target of 10,000 hectares annually for afforestation, and I can see the problem becoming more and more difficult. I do not see how the Minister can meet his programme as he will have to pay huge prices for what was formerly very cheap land.  Not so long ago people got thirty shillings an acre from the Forestry Division for land.  Now even the worst mountain land will fetch £200 an acre.  I would like to see the Minister follow up an idea that has been bandied around with regard to afforestation, that is that people should be heavily subsidised in return for allowing their land to be planted.  The land should not be purchased for afforestation, but it should be planted by the Forestry Division and the owner of the land should be compensated for the use of the land right through the 20 years or so that it takes a tree to mature. Not many farmers would agree to wait 20 years to reap the benefit of their work.  This is a practical way of overcoming the shortage of land for afforestation.</P>
    <P>I have always been intrigued by an anomaly in the planning law which affects the Forestry Division.  If one has a marvellous scenic view one cannot build a house between that view and the public road or between the sea and the public road, depending on the location.  However, the Forestry Division seem to be able to come along with impunity and plant miles of trees blocking off fantastic views. Surely there should be some regulation whereby trees would be planted so far back from the public road that that view would not be impeded.  Trees planted right beside a public road can <Col N="142" /> have another effect in weather such as we had recently.  The greatest trouble when driving along frost or snow covered roads is that trees obliterate the sunshine for weeks and months thus the frost or show does not melt and skids are likely to occur. Trees should not be planted where they block a view or where they overhang a road so as to obliterate the sunshine.  I know that trees in themselves are beautiful but there is no great beauty when they are overhanging a road.  While the Forestry Department are probably exempt under some regulation, they should see to it that this type of obstruction does not occur and that they do not create grave traffic hazards by helping to keep roads frost-bound in difficult weather.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his report spent a considerable length of time referring to the Wildlife Bill enacted last year many parts of which became law last June.  The Wildlife Bill was one of the most wonderful pieces of legislation introduced in this House for many years.</P>

    <Title>Veterinary Inspection Fees Regulations: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935 (Part II) (No. 6) Regulations, 1978, and Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930 (Exporter's Licences) (Fees) Regulations, 1978 <Col N="143" /> copies of which were laid in draft before the Dáil on the 14th day of February, 1978.</P>
    <P>The effect of the regulations before the House in draft would be to raise the level of fees payable in respect of animals presented for veterinary inspection under the Fresh Meat Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Acts.  The increases would vary according to the type of animal.  The fee for cattle would be increased from 45p to £1 per head and for sheep from 8p to 17p per head.  In the case of pigs the increase would be from 12p to 25p per head.  I propose to bring the increases into effect on 6 March 1978.</P>
    <P>Due to increases in salaries, inflation and the need for more intensive supervision of procedures at meat and bacon factories, the cost of veterinary supervision has risen continuously.  In recent years the cost has risen steeply with the result that receipts from fees&mdash;currently about £700,000 per annum&mdash; cover less than half the cost of providing the veterinary inspection service. The proposed increases which have been cleared with the National Prices Commission, would redress the imbalance somewhat but would still not go the full way towards recouping the cost of the service, which is currently in excess of £2 million per annum.</P>
    <P>There has been a great expansion in our meat industry in recent years and the volume of animals presented for veterinary inspection has increased. While this resulted in an increase in receipts from fees there was also a corresponding increase in veterinary inspection work and, therefore, in the cost of the service.  Furthermore, EEC membership has brought stricter requirements and has imposed more intensive supervision procedures.  Greater diversification into processed products has been a further factor requiring the strengthening of the inspection service. At the new rates proposed, the fees are calculated to yield £1.6 million in a calendar year.  The recovery of the full cost of veterinary supervision must be the ultimate aim and in the circumstances I consider the increases now proposed go a reasonable <Col N="144" /> part of the way.  Also, when the level of fees is considered in the context of present-day livestock values, the fees must be regarded as modest.  The average price of cattle slaughtered at meat export premises is probably about £330, and the new rate of fee represents 0.3 per cent of that price. A fat bullock would, of course, be worth a good deal more.</P>
    <P>The veterinary inspection service is a vital element in our meat export business.  Without satisfactory veterinary supervision and certification our products simply will not be accepted abroad; and as major meat exporters we must ensure that our products meet the highest standards of hygiene demanded by the customer.  It seems only reasonable that those interests which benefit directly from the service should bear the cost.</P>
    <P>The proposed fees do not apply to animals slaughtered at premises catering for the home market only.  Those premises are under local authority supervision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to make it clear that the service which this levy goes some of the way to pay for is obviously very desirable and that it is of great importance to our exporters that there be adequate inspection so that the standard of Irish beef, mutton and pigmeat will retain its reputation of being among the best in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not my wish to be taken as being opposed in any way to the service being carried out.  It is a service that should be provided as efficiently, as effectively and as conscientiously as possible.  However, the question is that of the method to be employed and of how the service should be paid for. The proposal before the House will add in effect another £1 million to the costs of the farming community or, to put it another way, will take from them £1 million in income because obviously these fees that are being borne by the factories will be reflected immediately in the prices paid to farmers.  Therefore, there will be £1 million less available to pay farmers for their pigmeat, mutton, and beef. Such an increase must be considered <Col N="145" /> against the background of similar steps taken by the Government, for example, the removal of the fertiliser subsidy at a cost to the farmers of £4 million, the removal of the cheese subsidy and the change in the assessment in relation to rates, plus the failure to increase thresholds for inheritance tax under table 1 and a variety of other measures which are taking money from the farmers in a backhanded way.</P>
    <P>The regulation before us is another instalment in a plan, the duration and extent of which we are not yet aware. It would be well for the Government to state clearly what other measures they have in mind for taking money from agriculture.  Each measure is presented as if it were on its own.  The change in the fertiliser subsidy, for instance, was presented as being one measure and farmers may have taken the line that in such circumstances it was not necessary to create a great fuss about the change, but then there was the change in the cheese subsidy followed by the change in rates assessment as well as the failure to make the adjustment in the inheritance tax threshold.  Therefore, each measure seems to be one of a succession of measures.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has any other such measure in mind he should tell us so now so that farmers when being asked to pass judgment on the budget and on the Government's attitude to agriculture will have all the facts at their disposal. The Government should not be surreptitious in their approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>There are dangers inherent in increasing fees which must be borne by people seeking to slaughter cattle, pigs or sheep within the State.  There are alternatives to having the animals slaughtered in the country.  It is possible to export the animals live.  In the event of their being exported by sea to Britain there is some check and the levy can be collected, but it is not possible to have similar control in relation to the live exports of cattle across the land boundary within the island.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal, too, that a similar levy should be initiated to pay for the cost of the operations of CBF, <Col N="146" /> the body responsible for promoting and perhaps trading in Irish beef exports in other parts of the world.  It is proposed that part of their costs be defrayed by the imposition of another levy on the slaughter of cattle within the State.</P>
    <P>We have suggestions that perhaps at some stage some aspects of research might be paid for by levy.  There is also the possibility that costs incurred in the course of implementing the beef carcase classification scheme may be separately met by levy.  We do not know this.  We hope not.  But, the consequence of this progression of increasing the levies on cattle slaughtered within the State would be to encourage live exports across the land boundary into Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>All parties in this House have been laying great stress on the need to slaughter the maximum number of animals within the State and to process the meat to the maximum extent within the State, in order to give the maximum employment.  If this process continues&mdash;and this is a significant one that we are dealing with here today and may be only part of a series&mdash;and if levies are added to the cost of slaughter, the incentive will be to export animals live and the opportunity for giving employment both in slaughtering and further processing will be lost and the very welcome trend of recent years where more slaughterings have been taking place within the State will be reversed.  That will be very undesirable from the national point of view and is a matter about which one must express the gravest concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the cost of the veterinary inspection is not being fully met even by the increased fees and the suggestion seems to be that he believes that in an ideal situation the levy should pay for the full cost of veterinary inspection.  If that is the Minister's opinion, he should say so because farmers will then know that it is his intention to increase the levy yet again.  If, on the other hand, he does not believe that farmers should pay the full cost of the inspection through the levy, he should say exactly what proportion he <Col N="147" /> believes is the correct one and, again, farmers will know where they stand. At the present time, because the Minister has said that it does not cover the full cost but has left vague the appropriate proportion of the full cost he believes should be paid in the ultimate situation as distinct from this present measure, which it may be implied by the way the Minister has treated of it is just a temporary measure, the farmer is left in the dark as to the full and final intentions of the Minister in this matter.  I should like to have a clear statement from the Minister as to his long-term intentions.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister if he would consider, if he has not already done so, having a detailed investigation of the cost and the efficiency of the service which is being carried out at the factories.  I notice he has said that this current increase was the subject of an investigation by the National Prices Commission.  It would be desirable, if this has not been done already, that the National Prices Commission be asked through their consultants to investigate the efficiency of the service to see if there are possibilities for savings and if there are possibilities for using different grades of personnel for some of the tasks involved.</P>
    <P>Obviously, whatever we do, we must employ sufficient staff and staff of a sufficiently high grade to ensure that the results of the inspection are accepted in all foreign markets.  That would be the overriding consideration in any study which would be carried out on this matter.  But perhaps it would be appropriate to make enquiries as to the type of staff and number of staff involved in this sort of work in other countries to see if there is room for greater efficiency in the inspection service here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the amount of money involved&mdash;an extra £1 million&mdash; being taken from the farming community to pay for these levies is not in itself a large amount but, when seen as part of a process of what one might call backdoor farmer taxation which has been adopted by the present Government, in addition to straight-forward <Col N="148" /> farmer taxation, the trend expressed in this motion is one which gives me the gravest concern and this motion, if the trend continues, could endanger employment in the meat processing industry in this State.  For those two reasons I express the greatest reservations about this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess to having a vested interest in this matter because I am a director of a meat factory.  I suppose that would colour my attitude towards this motion.  The increase of a further 100 per cent in the levy in relation to meat inspection about to be imposed is a harsh increase and it is most unfortunate at this time for the development of the meat industry. Up to now, by and large, a factory, when it takes in meat on the hoof does not deduct a charge from the farmer. The bill comes every half year and the factory pays it every half year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Minister is well aware of the situation in Clover Meats, for instance.  A deduction at the rate of £1 per beast is a substantial deduction.  The farmer will now be charged £1 by the factory directly for inspecting the beast simply because the charge would be too heavy for them to bear.  For instance, a large factory might have a throughput of 3,000-4,000 head of cattle a week over a period of four-five months.  That is £3,000 a week, for 12 weeks a total of £36,000.  That is an expense which I do not think the meat factory will bear and the factory will attempt to deduct an amount directly from the price paid for the animal sent in by the farmer. To that extent the charge will be passed on to the farmer and, as Deputy Bruton has said, it is a method of farmer taxation.  Because of the distinctly high cost it will be an extra tax on the farmer, whereas before the factory carried the expense themselves. That is quite clear.  The meat factories are now carrying the cost of meat inspection in boning plants, officially called cutting-up premises, which are separate from abbatoirs.  Up to now there was no levy charged for the inspection of boning and packing of <Col N="149" /> meats in boning plants which are not attached to separate abbatoirs.  To that extent there is a subsidy.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that factories are conscious of veterinary inspection, and it is to the credit of the veterinary inspection staff of the Department that the standard of the meat produced in the factories and exported is now extremely high.  I am sure the Minister would agree that a word of praise is due, and I include in the veterinary staff not only the veterinary surgeons who do excellent work but also the agricultural officers who have quite an amount of paper work.  In some factories they now inspect lambs going to France and they have successfully taken on this extra task.  They are a staff of which we can be proud.  They have done no small work in ensuring that our veterinary standards are high and that our export reputation is maintained.  Because the charge per beast&mdash;sheep or pig&mdash;is now so high, I feel that the factories will be forced to make a direct deduction from the money being paid to the farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Bruton and Collins for contributing to our consideration of this motion.  I am now reasonably certain that it is the policy of the Fine Gael Party that the tax-payer should pick up the bill for veterinary inspections in meat factories.  If this is not the case, the expressions of shock, dismay and horror to which we have been listening during the past few minutes would not have been uttered.  It is well in an important matter like this to know the attitudes of different groups in the House towards this problem.  I now know that Fine Gael wish the taxpayers to pay most, if not all, of the cost of veterinary fees.  I must assume that it is all, because if it is otherwise they did not mention the proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton asked whether it is my opinion that the total cost should be borne in due course. This is the ideal situation, but I do not think it is reasonable in a buoyant market for beef, mutton and pigmeat <Col N="150" /> to say that these should be borne by some other sector of the community.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting in passing that in the catalogue of adjustments, like the removal of the phosphate subsidy and the cheese subsidy, Deputy Bruton did not allude to other adjustments such as the reintroduction of the lamb export extension scheme which was made necessary by the failure of the Government of which Deputy Bruton was a supporter to find a market for our sheep.  This was restored by our Government at very considerable cost until a market was found for our lamb.  Deputy Bruton did not advert to the fact that the amount of money paid by the Government in reactor compensation was a great deal bigger than the alleged and factual loss incurred by farmers in the removal of the phosphate subsidy.  It was a great deal bigger in real terms.  Speaking from recollection, it was about £3½ million extra.  It is necessary and very desirable, when considering additions and subtractions, to take them all into account.  If not, one gets a false picture.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton has a false picture about this.  He went on to say that the raising of the veterinary inspection fees in meat factories would tend to produce an increase in our live exports, which in turn would lead to disemployment in our meat factories and the running down of the plants themselves.  In short, this is absolute moonshine.  I would expect from the new classification scheme when it comes into operation an increase in producer prices.  That is what it is about.  We cannot continue to sell the products of our cattle herd in an unorganised, unidentified way.  It will bring a positive result for the producers. I do not anticipate that there will be any difficulty at all.  Certainly, failure to get a good carcase grading will carry its own penalty in that the better grades will fetch higher prices. This is reasonable and has been whole-heartedly accepted by the farming organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also made a short reference to the possible desirability <Col N="151" /> of introducing other grades of personnel into the business of meat inspection. I am sorry that he did not elaborate on this because I should be glad to know the views of his party on this interesting question.  He also said that we should carry out an examination to find out if the standard of performance in meat inspection is being properly maintained.  He differed a little from his colleague, Deputy E. Collins, who said that the standard of inspection and the standard of hygiene in our factories are maintained at a very high level by the veterinary inspection staff.  Deputy Collins may be unique in his own meat plant in not lifting off the old 45p carcase inspection fee and in not passing on the real cost to the consumer.  Other factories do so.  They actually write it on the return which the producer receives from the factory.  Presumably this will be continued in the future.</P>

According to Deputy Bruton the future of the trade is being impaired.  I do not think this will present any great difficulties.  I am glad to see that the beef and mutton trades are buoyant.  If I might be permitted a certain amount of self-congratulation, I have helped to make it that way and it will be my intention to keep it in that position.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Fisheries.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the Wildlife Act which is mentioned in the Estimates we are discussing.  That legislation came into operation last June and while it was one of the finest Acts in recent years it has not been implemented.  There are a whole series of examples where it has been breached but action has not been taken.  In reply to a parliamentary question some months ago the Minister told me that the legislation would be implemented. It is a very wide-ranging measure that prevents cruelty to animals and that preserves certain species of animals. There is an onus on the Minister to ensure that immediate steps are taken to stamp out the illegal practices presently being carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago I pointed out to the Minister that the practice of using motor-propelled boats for duck shooting was illegal under the new legislation, but that it was still being done. I have not seen a single case where a prosecution has been brought against people doing this.  Snaring and trapping of animals is prohibited under the measure but this is going on to a greater extent than ever before, in particular with reference to foxes. Although some people may not worry too much about it, the country is being denuded of foxes.  They are fetching prices in the region of £14 each.  Snaring and trapping of animals is a most cruel practice.  Recently a dealer in pelts advertised for 500 foxes immediately. Of course, the method of capturing them is snaring and trapping.  Why is the Minister not implementing the law? Another instance of cruelty is catching birds by using bird-line.  It is illegal but the practice is being carried out at the moment and there has not been a report <Col N="155" /> of a single prosecution.  What is happening is that the wildlife legislation is not being implemented.  There is provision in that measure for the employment of gamekeepers to see that these illegal practices are stamped out but the Minister has yet to appoint a gamekeeper.</P>
    <P>As far as the Wildlife Act is concerned it is only a piece of paper because no action has been taken.  I know that some money has been provided in the Estimate to employ people. The sooner this is done the better because many of our wildlife species are getting very scarce.  Some species are in danger of being wiped out completely. The snaring of foxes should be stamped out.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech that he would provide more habitats for wildlife.  They are being wiped out every day because of land reclamation and drainage so that, instead of creating habitats, the reverse is occurring. The Minister should take serious steps to see that those habitats are protected and that wildlife are given a chance to exist.</P>
    <P>Will there be any need for a Department of Fisheries or a Minister of Fisheries in future?  If the Minister does not take a serious stand in the negotiations on the fishing plans in the weeks to come, some people will be completely demoralised.  The fishermen, particularly their leaders, have lost confidence in the Minister for Fisheries.  They feel he has let them down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the case at 2.30 this afternoon when I had a press conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the mood at the seminar in Letterkenny.  There was a feeling of despair that our fishing industry was sold down the river.  They felt you had retreated from the exclusive 50-mile limit.  They expect you to do something in the negotiations in relation to the fishing plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Minister's trip to Letterkenny really necessary?  He could have sent a telegram.  He made a harsh speech and then left without allowing people to ask questions.  That was a highly unsatisfactory trip and only irritated people.  I hope we can salvage something from the fishery negotiations.  If the Minister does not salvage anything there will not be any need for a fishing industry or a debate on the Fishery Estimate in the years to come.</P>
      <P>The 1976 Hague Agreement gave Ireland preferential treatment.  We were to be treated as a special case in the new common fisheries policy.  We were allowed to double our catch by 1979 and to further develop our industry thereafter.  So far we have not been allowed double our catch.  The only fish we are being allowed to catch are white fish, which are not there.  The only way they can be got is by breaking the rules and catching undersize fish.  We cannot see any expansion under the existing agreement.  We were told that we will get 96,000 tonnes in 1978.  According to the Hague Agreement in 1976 we should have 125,000 tonnes.  We were told at Question Time recently that out of the 430 boats BIM had given loans to 230 are in debt. Yet we are told we have to double our catch.  The fishermen will catch less and less because of what our partners in the EEC will do.  We depend on the Minister.  We hope he can retrieve something in the negotations in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it will be agreed by anybody who has followed this debate today that there is an air of artificiality about it.  There is something unreal about the debate on this Estimate, especially when one considers that fishing has been a national issue recently.  There has been a great debate about the fishing industry and many fundamental principles are involved. The air of artificiality about this debate is brought home to us by the fact that for the greater part of the time the only Deputies present here were the Minister, Deputy Deasy and myself.  This is rather a strange anticlimax to the fundamental issues involved, <Col N="157" /> bearing in mind what was expected from the Minister for Fisheries on this Estimate.</P>
      <P>The Estimate represents a watershed in Irish affairs.  An air of gloom and despair has existed in this Chamber during this debate.  It marks the end of an era.  It is the day of the abandonment of the principle of the 50-mile exclusive limit, the day of the broken promises of the Minister and his party. It is a black day for Ireland, a shameful day for the Minister for Fisheries and for Fianna Fáil.  It is a bad day for Dáil Éireann, because today we seem to have lost control over the destiny of Irish affairs, which should be governed from this House.</P>
      <P>We seem to have acquiesced before the dictates of Brussels.  It will be evident to the fishermen and the Irish people that so far as the future of the fishing industry is concerned the real power does not lie in this legislative assembly, which is supposed to be the voice of the Irish people, but in Brussels.  It is Mr. Gundelach who reigns supreme in this Chamber, not the Minister for Fisheries.  It is Mr. Gundelach who is dictating terms and policies to the Irish people in respect of what we shall or shall not do with the rich harvest which abounds around our island shores.</P>
      <P>I said it is a sad day.  Indeed, it is. The hypocrisy and the hypocitical approach are ended.  The bluff has been called and the Minister now acknowledges, with Mr. Gundelach, that the attainment of an exclusive 50-mile limit is just not on at the present time.  The salient sentence reads:</P>
      <P>It is not in my view a realistic proposition to press the policy of a 50-mile exclusive limit at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have the great betrayal of the trust reposed in the Minister and his party when they were elected to power because their manifesto stated that the attainment of a 50-mile limit was fundamental and every important spokesman in the party, now gracing the Front Bench over there, is on record as stating that nothing less than <Col N="158" /> a 50-mile limit would do because that was essential to the development and expansion of our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>It is a day of shame now for all those that have gone back on all that they said earlier.  They spoke here trenchantly demanding a 50-mile limit. As far as they were concerned, its attainment was as easy as taking candy from a baby.  No problem.  It was our right, they said, and we must have it. Here, today, we have the abandonment of all that they said and all that they stood for on this fundamental issue.</P>
    <P>What the Minister says in his backup to assuage the feelings of the fishermen over the betrayal of the 50-mile limit is nothing but a load of rubbish.  The Minister talks about plans which have yet to be negotiated.  No details are spelled out here.  Indeed, he goes into some slight detail in his press release, more detail than he gave in his opening statement to this House today.  He says plans will be negotiated as a matter of priority between Ireland and the other Community partners.  He proposes to set up a working group and he has the audacity to invite the fishermen's organisations to work with him and his Department in co-ordinating a policy in regard to these plans and to oversee their operation.  There is nothing specific to compensate to any degree for the losses that will be sustained as a result of abandoning the exclusive 50-mile zone.  There is a sop if you like, by way of a contribution of £30 million from the EEC towards the cost of an improved fishery protection service.  This is the bribe offered for the rape of Irish fisheries, £30 million.  It is a sell-out of the 50-mile exclusive zone.  It is a shameful bargain and it is one with which the Labour Party will not be associated.</P>
    <P>I understand there is talk this evening of throwing in the towel.  It is now acknowledged the Minister has accepted defeat.  The Minister's first act on coming into office was to denigrate the work of the previous Government and to cast reflections on what they had been doing.  It was an intimation to all of us that the Minister was giving in to Brussels.  Yet, he has <Col N="159" /> kept up this shabby pretence of purporting to maintain a 50-mile exclusive limit, to maintain that this was still on the table, to use his own words.  What table was it on?  Was it ever on any table?  Was it ever a serious issue in the mind of the Minister?  I do not believe it was.  But he kept it up.  He brought Mr. Gundelach to Letterkenny over the weekend, the Commissioner in charge of fisheries and agriculture, as a prop to help him to assuage the feelings of the fishermen and he still maintained he was for a 50-mile zone and he went on to the Ard-Fheis and there, I understand, he received a standing ovation, an act of mass hypocrisy.  He was still going to adhere to the establishment of a 50-mile zone.</P>

They are in power now with over 20 of a majority and to hell with the promises.  That is the attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the 50-mile limit?  Legislative power has gone from this House.  The Minister acquiesces in the dictates of Brussels and Mr. Gundelach is upheld against the overwhelming wishes of the Members of this House.  Ministers like Deputies Charles J. Haughey, Michael O'Kennedy, Robert Molloy, Denis Gallagher and many others are all on record as insisting that nothing less than a 50-mile zone would suffice.  That was the fundamental issue.  Today they are silent.  Today they are absent.  Promises mean nothing to them.  I prophesy that these things will not be easily forgotten by the people and we will remind the Front Bench over there time and time again of their broken promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> The Minister told us in the House that he was relying quite a lot on the support of his British colleague in the EEC to attain his ideal of a 50-mile exclusive zone.  He gave us to understand that the British and himself were at one in respect of the <i>modus operandi</i> of negotiations in Brussels on essential fisheries objectives.  He bragged about this unique support he had from his British colleague.  What happened this happy arrangement between himself and his British colleague. What went wrong that the British Minister no longer supported the Irish point of view?  Where did the breakdown take place and why?  Is it not the position that the British Minister adhered courageously, dedicatedly to the idea of a 50-mile exclusive zone for his nation, his fishermen and that our Minister was the one who backed down?  Was that not the reason that the happy arrangement broke down? The British held out and the Irish betrayed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a lot of capital out of his association with the British Minister on this issue when many of us in this House said it was unwise of the Minister to go cap in hand to the British on this issue, that it would have been preferable had we stood and been seen to stand alone fighting this issue, that we had a special case to plead in Brussels and that it would have been better in our negotiations there had we not been seen to be allied to the British or anyone else.  It was the Minister who chose his British colleague and he knows best why the relationship broke down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was posed by my colleague, Deputy Deasy, as to whether anything can now be salvaged from this sorry state of affairs.  I do not know.  This decision of the Minister must have increased the pall of gloom and disillusionment that pervaded the industry in recent months because all those vitally concerned were adamant that a 50-mile exclusive zone was a prerequisite to the advancement of the industry and its proper protection. With that gone and nothing in its place <Col N="161" /> but a lot of woolly sentiments expressed here by the Minister the future of the industry is indeed gloomy.</P>
    <P>In earlier debates I have placed on the record of the House the sentiments expressed by certain Fianna Fáil spokesmen on this fisheries issue, but I deem it appropriate to repeat them on this occasion.  Lest there be any ambiguity or doubt as to where the party stood, the Minister for Defence, then Deputy Molloy, speaking on 27 October 1976, at column 449, Volume 293, of the Official Report, said:</P>
    <P>On behalf of the people in my constituency we will not deviate from our insistence that a 50-mile limit exclusive to the Irish fishing fleet shall be established.  That is the attitude of my party in this House and we represent 50 per cent of the electorate.</P>
    <P>On the same day the present Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Haughey, at columns 432 and 433 of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>I believe that our national interest, the development of the fishing industry, the livelihood of our fishermen, can only be secured for the future by our insisting on a 50-mile fishing limit exclusive to Irish fishermen...We intend to press this Dáil to make a clear and unequivocal demand for an exclusive 50-mile limit for Irish fishermen.</P>
    <P>On the same date the Minister for Foreign Affairs, then Deputy O'Kennedy, made it clear that he too emphatically favoured a 50-mile exclusive limit, as did the Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Gallagher, the then spokesman on Fisheries who is on record on numerous occasions as insisting that we must, at all costs, secure such a limit.  Indeed, on 14 December 1976 the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, then Deputy Haughey, speaking on the Second Stage of the Maritime Jurisdiction (Amendment) Bill, 1976&mdash;one of the effects of which, had it been passed by the House would have been to reserve the first 50 miles of a 200-mile coastal band exclusively for Irish vessels operating from ports <Col N="162" /> in the State&mdash;said, at column 633 of the Official Report of that day:</P>
    <P>It is clear to anybody who considers the situation that the only way in which the future of Irish fishing can be secured and guaranteed is by this country declaring that the first 50 miles of these new limits will be reserved exclusively for Irish fishing.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is crystal clear that the present Government's attitude then was that they favoured a 50-mile exclusive limit and opposed vigorously the approach the then Government adopted towards the achievement of that objective.  Despite the Minister's attitude I must say it is still the attitude of the Labour Party in this House that a 50-mile exclusive zone is the proper thing for this country, proper for the preservation and advancement of the Irish fishing industry, and we will not condone its abandonment.  We repudiate its abandonment here this evening.  We are convinced that it is the right thing.  I am sure the Minister must have been convinced also at some stage but what led him to betray us all in this matter is difficult to understand.  He went to Brussels with the unanimous support of this House, with allegedly the support of his party and of his Ministerial colleagues, that the issue was 50 miles and nothing less. Why we have to step down and place the whole industry in jeopardy is difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have an opportunity of replying.  It is up to him to give the reasons, to indicate honestly for the first time on this issue what are his real intentions, apart from the issue of the 50-mile limit which is the essence of this debate, the nub of the affair, the cardinal point.  That is why I mentioned that this Estimate is the end of an era in which we legislated for the fishing industry.  We provided the money and said how it would be spent.  We policed our own coasts, we protected and advanced the industry as best we could.  It now seems that that important role, that right which we possessed has been filched from us and we are now being dictated to from Brussels.  The audacity <Col N="163" /> of any man to come to Ireland and tell us as Mr. Gundelach did that we would not get a 50-mile exclusive zone, and threaten that if we persisted in this battle cry, we would lose out in respect of other EEC benefits.  It is Cromwell in a new guise.  This is the man the Minister brought to Letterkenny as a prop for himself.  I say to Mr. Gundelach on behalf of the Labour Party, that this is a sovereign State, we are elected here by the will of the Irish people and we have a right to govern our own affairs particularly in respect of this important sector of our economy, the fishing industry.  We shall govern our own affairs in spite of the dictatorial attitude of the Gundelachs and the rest in Brussels.</P>
    <P>When one analyses this whole sorry episode and gets back to fundamentals, the real reason why we have failed to control the destiny of the Irish fishing industry is that in the original negotiations for entry into the EEC by the then Fianna Fáil Government no provision was made for the safeguarding of the industry.  Is that not a fact?  The fishing industry under Fianna Fáil was always the Cinderella of our economy, and the estimates of money which they provided down the years are proof that it was utterly neglected.  The fishing industry was forgotten when we were negotiating our entry into the EEC.  No provision was made in respect of such fundamental zones, protection and preservation. There is nothing in the Treaty as negotiated by Fianna Fáil which shows the slightest respect or concern for the future of the fishing industry. That is why the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was so hamstrung, so inept and so unable to cope with the situation.  His predecessor and the present Taoiseach failed to recognise the significance of fishing in the whole context of the EEC and it was not provided for in the agreement.  Be that to their eternal disgrace and shame.</P>
    <P>I wish to discuss many other aspects of fisheries but one is simply frustrated in attempting to go into detail as to how best one could develop our industry in the light of the cardinal failure to secure an exclusive zone.  Everything <Col N="164" /> hinged on that.  When we lost that we were left open to the ravages of the marauding boats from many parts of the world.  We had hopes of seeing the expansion of the processing of fish here.  We had hopes of seeing a situation whereby the large catches of fish within designated zones around our coasts would be brought to our harbours and processed, providing much gainful employment.  We wanted very much to see better landing facilities provided.  We wanted to see the establishment of ice plants and so on. We wanted to see our trawlers modernised and equipped and capable of competing with the best in Europe.  We wanted very much to see an intelligent conservation programme embarked upon.  We wanted to see our fishermen properly protected in adversity, in sickness, in unemployment and in old age by way of a proper pension scheme.  We wanted all these things but they were conditional on the protection zone of 50 miles to which I have adverted again and again.  What one can do in the circumstances is difficult to envisage.  We shall have to wait and see.</P>
    <P>In respect of inland fisheries, I have expressed my concern about the incidence of pollution which has reared its ugly head in so many rivers and lakes, particularly in respect of the river Suir which flows through my constituency in Tipperary.  We have been shocked and appalled at the number of fish kills which have been in evidence there in recent years resulting from pollution.  I have also expressed concern that the responsibility for the elimination of pollution lies with the board of conservators.  We know full well how limited they are in respect of the tools, equipment and finance to deal with pollution.  We only hope that the legislation to which the Minister has adverted will take care of that situation and will enable the board of conservators to continue to have the responsibility to deal with pollution and to have the necessary finance and equipment to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Naturally we support the Minister in his efforts in the area of the elimination of unfair practices in respect of the catching of fish, whether in the sea, in the rivers or in the lakes.  The <Col N="165" /> element of poaching should be dealt with.  At the same time one is concerned to find that members of boards of conservators, especially men who have held high positions on the boards &mdash;in some cases chairmen&mdash;and who have given long and devoted service to this State in carrying out a thankless, difficult and sometimes dangerous job, should find it necessary now to resign. There have been reports in the Press recently in regard to the resignations of important personalities&mdash;in the Lismore area of County Waterford, for instance&mdash;who have given tremendous service but who because of differences of opinion concerning the attitude to adopt in dealing with the various problems are resigning from the board.  I do not claim to be <i>au fait</i> with the intricacies of issues involved but I trust that the Minister and the people concerned will reach a mutual understanding so that goodwill and co-operation may again be established.</P>
    <P>I shall turn now to the Forestry Estimate.  I take this opportunity of paying a sincere tribute to the Minister, to the Department and to all concerned for the wonderful work being done in the various areas of forestry work.  I refer in particular to the opening up of our forests to the general public.  This amenity is being availed of widely and is affording many people the opportunity to engage in nature studies.  The Forestry Division have done a very good job in providing more roadways through the forests and in providing picnic areas, thereby encouraging people to visit those beautiful woodlands and to observe there bird life, animal life and so on.  Some very fine brochures have been provided detailing various forest walks. In addition the foresters have given of their time to take groups of people through the forests, pointing out items of interest.</P>
    <P>I need hardly emphasise the importance of accelerating the drive for more forest areas.  I have always contended that investment in forestry brings a rich reward not merely in terms of finance but in terms of the better life to which I have adverted briefly.  I am hoping that the Minister will see his way to pay a reasonably fair price for <Col N="166" /> land suitable for afforestation.  No doubt greater areas of mountain land would be made available to the Department if they were prepared to offer better prices for it.  Those of us in public life have been involved from time to time in what one might call negotiations between the Department and the owners of mountain or turbary rights.  On many occasions we were saddened when negotiations broke down because of a difference of a few paltry pounds per acre.  The whole area of afforestation is one in which there is tremendous scope for putting people to productive work.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to find that in regard to the timber yards under the aegis of the Department there has been difficulty in regard to expansion.  One of these factories is located at Dundrum in my constituency.  I know of the valuable employment provided there and of the great service the factory is providing for the people in the neighbouring districts.  I trust that these factories can be protected and expanded and that the Minister will take a personal interest in them and endeavour to ensure that the difficulties being experienced can be overcome.  The factories provide much needed employment for local communities.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to note that the conditions of forestry workers have been improving considerably in recent years. We recollect that a number of years ago these people had very bad working conditions in terms of wages, pensions and so on.  They work in conditions that are arduous and in some cases very dangerous.  Their wages can now be said to be fair and they are protected in their old age by being paid reasonable pensions, a facility that was not available to them up to a few years ago.  They are looked after also at times of sickness or infirmity.</P>
    <P>However, there is room for improvement. In this regard I appeal to the Minister to convey to all those in charge of forestry workers the need for more concern in respect of the provision of, for instance, protective clothing, proper implements and adequate shelter from the elements.  Unfortunately, one finds from time to time that there is a niggardly approach <Col N="167" /> in this area.  But let us hope that such an attitude will no longer prevail and that every effort will be made to ensure good conditions for the workers. These people are producing a very valuable asset.  Like any other section of workers, they deserve humane and fair treatment as well as being provided for in old age or in times of sickness or infirmity.</P>
    <P>I have been sincere in my criticism of the attitude of the Minister to the main issue involved in this debate, that is, the 50-mile exclusive zone for the advancement and protection of the Irish fishing industry.  I am not the only one who feels that we have been let down in a big way.  The situation in so far as the Minister personally is concerned is such that, having regard to the great loss sustained to Ireland, its people and its economy, having regard to the clear abandonment of his responsibility, his abject dereliction of duty in regard to this issue of fisheries, on behalf of the party that I represent in this House I say that the only honourable course for the Minister at the present time is to resign.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was almost crying salt tears when Deputy Treacy was speaking about the 50-mile exclusive limit. I thought the Deputy might even start crying himself.  The Minister has been doing an excellent job in trying to improve the lot of the Irish fishermen through negotiations at Brussels.  Since the European Court has decided the issue, a 50-mile exclusive limit is no longer a feasible proposition.  One wonders, when Deputy Treacy talks about going it alone, how long it would last when already the European Court has decided that we just cannot have a 50-mile exclusive limit.  Are we to throw open our waters up to within six miles of our coast to our eight partners plus all the other countries who can come in and fish up to within six miles?  Certainly, the wise decision has been taken by the fishery organisations to support the Minister in order to ensure that the best deal can now be got in so far as quotas are concerned to protect and develop our fisheries. There is no point in facing disaster. <Col N="168" /> With the fighting capabilities of our present Minister, I have no doubt that the quotas and the agreement that will be drawn up finally will be quite adequate and that the fishermen will be happy with whatever agreement is finally arrived at.  It is encouraging that two fishery organisations are joining with the Department and the Minister to negotiate a fair and adequate deal.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to intervene to some degree to alleviate the hardship that has been caused to a number of fishermen with regard to repayments to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  There are a number of hardship cases.  This matter was brought to my notice a few years ago when the previous Government were in power.  Unfortunately, they could not at that time see their way to alleviate the problem.  I would ask the Minister to examine this matter again to see if the hardship cases can be dealt with so as to ensure that these fishermen will not have to dispose of their boats or have them taken back from them.</P>
      <P>The south-east coast is not mentioned in regard to further harbour development.  There is one harbour which certainly has potential for further development in my constituency, namely, Kilmore Quay.  The fishermen there have not sufficient berthage if all boats are in operation simultaneously.  I would ask the Minister to see if extra money could be provided for the cleaning out of the inner harbour at Kilmore Quay.  If something can be done by the Minister I shall be very grateful.</P>
      <P>In regard to forestry and wildlife there is a provision of £8,000 under subhead F. for the John F. Kennedy Memorial Park.  The Minister did not refer to that in his speech.  The significance of the John F. Kennedy Park should have been highlighted.</P>
      <P>In regard to afforestation, a big problem in connection with the area planted is the availability of land. Land has not been made available to the Department and will not be made available even with the substantially improved price.  In many areas the land is not suitable for anything except afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> There is scope within the Forestry Division for the creation of employment. Forests are not being properly maintained.  Fencing is not properly maintained.  Trimming of trees is not carried out.  I have seen fine stone walls around forests decaying from lack of maintenance and proper care. Near Courtown there is a very nice forest with very fine stone walls around it which are decaying through lack of maintenance and proper care.</P>
    <P>The provision of open forests is commendable.  The Minister has referred to the number of visitors over the last year and that certainly is encouraging. There is great scope for the development of forests by the provision of walks and driveways.</P>
    <P>Some work was done last year in opening up the forest in Courtown but more work needs to be done in the provision of walks and picnic areas. This could be said of many areas in Wexford.  There are a number of forests near Wexford town which people can avail of on Sundays.  There is scope for development in this area.</P>
    <P>There is a substantial increase in grants to private planters.  Greater emphasis should be laid on private planting and farmers should be encouraged to plant trees.  Committees of agriculture should get their instructors to encourage farmers to plant areas of land which cannot be drained.</P>
    <P>We have only got started with regard to the implementation of the Wildlife Act.  This was mentioned earlier.  I agree with Deputy Deasy regarding the trapping of foxes.  I know some people who have snared or trapped over 100 foxes in the past year.  If the Wildlife Act is to be implemented as it should be we must eliminate poaching of all sorts.  This will not be easy.  I would hope that the people who will be appointed to supervise areas in which poaching is being carried on will have a knowledge of those areas.  An advisory council is to be appointed by the Minister and the appointment of people with experience will be of assistance to the Department.</P>
    <P>In Wexford we have one of the finest nature reserves in Ireland.  I have <Col N="170" /> reservations about whether the Department secured enough land in this area. It is my opinion that they did not. Regarding the preservation of other habitats, it is important that the Minister should take great care in ensuring that there is greater consultation with gun clubs and other local bodies with an interest in this matter.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that the officials of his Department will keep this point in mind.</P>
    <P>On several other occasions I have brought before the House the matter of the sale of forestry timber to farmers and small sawyers.  The Department are inclined to sell large quantities of timber and this does not become available to farmers and small sawyers.  It is important that these people should be given the opportunity to purchase smaller lots of timber.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on reaching an agreement with the fishing organisations and I wish him success in the negotiations in Brussels.</P>

That expresses quite clearly the fact that the criticism directed in recent months at the Government, and at me in particular, in regard to fishery affairs and the handling of our negotiations in Brussels has been largely a façade with no realistic basis.  I would far prefer the sort of realism I have encountered today from the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, whose chairman attended a press conference with me this afternoon in Leinster House and expressed his wish to co-operate closely with me in the formulation of fishing plans in the course of discussions with officials of the Commission and of member states during the coming weeks.

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Energy Policy: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy B. Desmond on Tuesday, 21 February 1978:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, recognising the prospect of a serious gap in our future energy resources, aware of the need to acquaint itself with up-to-date knowledge of the economic, technical and environmental issues associated with nuclear and other sources of energy and in view of its need to determine an appropriate energy policy for the country in the future, deems it expedient:</P>
    <P>(1)  That a Select Committee consisting of 12 members of Dáil Éireann be appointed to be joined with a Select Committee appointed by Seanad Éireann to form the Joint Committee on any proposal to construct a nuclear power station in Ireland, to examine such proposals and programmes and to report thereon to both Houses of the Oireachtas;</P>
    <P>(2)  That the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such reports, proceedings and submissions together with such related documents as it thinks fit; and</P>
    <P>(3)  That the Joint Committee shall be empowered to hold public <Col N="173" /> hearings and commission expert evidence on such proposals, including national energy resources and alternative sources of energy supply to the nation.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; in line 1 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;has full confidence in the Government to determine an appropriate energy policy for the country, having regard in particular, to the necessity, because of the long lead times involved, for the taking of urgent decisions on the ESB's generation plant programme to meet the expected demand for electricity throughout the 1980's, and the necessity to diversify as far as possible energy sources while at the same time, giving adequate consideration to health, safety and environmental issues associated with nuclear and other sources of energy&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I briefly outlined yesterday the attitude of the Fine Gael Party towards the Labour Party motion calling for an inquiry.  I explained the reasons that were uppermost in our minds and in particular that we were not all that concerned as to the safety and environmental aspects because we have faith in the people who are charged with this area of our life.  We were concerned with not making an immense investment without being certain that no other options were open to us.  We urged, and again urge this evening, that the Minister should hold a public inquiry.  It should not be a problem to think of a proper structure for this inquiry.  I would remind the Minister that in an interview in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on 18 January the chief executive of the ESB stated that not only would he welcome such a public inquiry but that he thought such an inquiry was inevitable.  He was prepared <Col N="174" /> and willing to have an inquiry which the Minister is now denying us.</P>
      <P>The Minister refers the public to the ESB.  The ESB have made up their minds, and to refer us to the ESB for the purpose of debate is not giving an opportunity for a debate at all because the ESB have already made up their minds.  It would be a debate only in the sense that the Bill in respect of ground rents means the abolition of ground rents.  If that provides for the abolition of ground rents, then a debate with the ESB on whether we ought to have a nuclear station would be a debate.</P>
      <P>The body with the statutory duty to inform the public and to advise them and the Government in regard to nuclear matters are the Nuclear Energy Board, but that board have kept a remarkably low profile since this issue was raised.  That board are supposed to disseminate information to the public on nuclear matters.  Have that board spent 6p, have they been let spend 6p by the Minister, since they were appointed?  As far as I know they have not spent any money doing what is supposed to be their job.  Assuming that they are impartial, they are the body that should be conducting this inquiry and it is by that board that the public should be directed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw attention to a further advantage that delay would have in this matter.  I do not advocate excessive delay, but I suggest a year or 18 months during which a proper inquiry can be held, in which people who are technically qualified but not fanatically committed one way or the other can give reasoned judgment which the public and Members of the House can accept.  An additional reason why delay would be positively beneficial is that if we had an 18-month moratorium it would imply two further seasons of seabed exploration which might give us a chance to see if we could strike it lucky.  If we did, it would transform the energy picture&mdash;if there were further substantial oil and gas strikes, particularly oil.  I am not saying it would necessarily make nuclear development superfluous for all time but it would transform the situation, because the basis of the argument <Col N="175" /> which the Minister put up here last night is that we are over-dependent on imported oil, a point of view with which I entirely agree.  However, that situation would be entirely transformed if we were lucky in our seabed explorations, and a delay of a year or 18 months would give us two full exploration seasons which would be an advantage.</P>
    <P>The present situation has several bad features about it which I am afraid are only to be expected from a Minister who is a by-word for finding a disagreeable way to do things if it is possible to find such a way.  He is a by-word for petulance, for making a debate personal and for bringing into it a sneering tone if he possibly can. He is the wrong Minister to be in charge of a matter like this.  He is going about it characteristically in the wrong way, and that could be seen here last night.  Deputy Desmond spoke for 40 minutes&mdash;I heard every word of what he said.  It was a temperate and in no way politically partisan speech. He did not attack the Minister.  He ladled out some bouquets to the Government and he said some critical things about the Government which he himself had served.  But the Minister got up and instantly referred to Deputy Desmond's tongue being in his cheek.  In his third or fourth sentence he spoke about the way the voting had gone on the Contraceptives Bill.</P>
    <P>That is not the kind of tone to adopt in a matter like this.  This has not been up to now a party political matter but it will become that very quickly if we get that sneering tone from the Minister.  He went on to sneer at environmentalists.  I have said that the main concern I have is not so much environment or health oriented as economic&mdash;should we think of an investment with a limited life of 30 years?  However, we recognise that environmentalists and people concerned about health hazards are sincere and genuine and that they deserve better than to be sneered at.  The tone of voice in which the Minister referred to the Friends of the Earth and the distinguished recipient of the Lenin Peace Prize in one breath will leave them <Col N="176" /> in no doubt as to what he thinks about their contribution to this debate.  It is an unworthy tone for a Minister to adopt in regard to a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke about what he called facile suggestions about wind, waves and biomass energy sources.  For his information, these &ldquo;facile suggestions&rdquo; are receiving serious attention from the EEC Commission.  Money is being spent on investigating these technologies and we are getting some of that EEC money.  Some of that money is being put into development here of mixed biomass and wind power to see if that will provide a usable quantity of energy.  At the very dawn of this technology, for a Minister to be describing it as facile is risking putting him in the same category as those who said that the Shannon Scheme was a white elephant.  I see the Minister arriving in the House now.  I would willingly have delayed these remarks but because I was short of time I could not wait for his arrival.</P>
    <P>Ten days ago it was reported that the Minister had refused to receive a deputation from Wexford County Council in relation to Carnsore Point. I know Deputy O'Malley is not the Minister in charge of planning, but he is involved with energy and it is unseemly and wrong of him to take this line with people who are officially charged and who have an official function in regard to the people of the area in which this development is envisaged.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Burke, the Minister of State, is over there because I wish to give a further indication of the level at which this thing is being treated, the lack of seriousness with which it is being treated by the Minister and the Minister of State.  Last week or the week before, Deputy Burke replied to some questions on behalf of the Minister, who was abroad. He stonewalled on this question of a public inquiry.  He persisted in pretending to the House that the only kind of inquiry which could possibly go on, one which he thought was quite adequate, is a planning inquiry.  There is an enormous difference between a planning inquiry and one into the <Col N="177" /> right and wrongs of nuclear development. If Wexford County Council, or An Bord Pleanála on appeal, were to decide this pure planning question on large issues of national policy in regard to whether we should have nuclear energy, they would be <i>ultra vires.</i>  They have no legal power or authority to make a decision of that kind on those criteria.  They can only make decisions of a planning kind on planning criteria.</P>
    <P>These things make me profoundly unhappy and uneasy, particularly the frame of mind which the Minister is bringing to bear on this matter.  He is making it into a political matter when there is no need for it.  He is giving it a tone and an atmosphere which it does not deserve.  I strongly urge him to accept the motion and not to continue with this pretence and charade that the ESB can conduct a debate on a matter on which they have already made up their minds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the motion and the amendment are couched in broad terms, not associated with any particular area in the country, but as a Deputy who has represented Wexford for three decades it will be realised that I have a special interest in this matter in that Carnsore Point has been more or less the designated area for the establishment of a nuclear energy station.  Although the proposed site of the station is in County Wexford, needless to remark I would be concerned also if the site were in any other part of the country. I am concerned about the Carnsore area, about the people who live there, about their general well-being, having represented them here for such a long time.  It is generally agreed by Members of the House that there is a need for a new form of energy.  We are informed that our requirements in energy will be doubled within the next eight years if we are to provide for the industrial, agricultural and domestic needs of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The differences of opinion centre around the type of energy to be provided, the safeguards, cost and other factors involved.  However, we are limited in the main sources.  It is recognised that oil will be scarce and <Col N="178" /> dear by 1985.  I do not know if anybody would contest that assertion but all the signs point to a scarcity of oil and a steep increase in price.  Oil will be very expensive unless we are fortunate enough to discover some of our own.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested here that coal-fired stations be used to produce energy but we will have to import coal and if oil becomes scarce and dear the same will happen with coal.  I know people have other ideas as to how we might produce energy but it appears to me that nuclear energy could provide the volume of energy that will be required here in a relatively short period.  It is a sure source of supply and does not necessitate an increase in imports of oil or coal.  To some extent turf can be written off for the purposes of the type of energy we are discussing.</P>
    <P>There is an undoubted case for nuclear energy, having regard to cost, availability and the general economics of such a venture.  Last night there was mention of hundreds of millions of pounds.  I have no figure to quote for the cost of erection of a nuclear power station.  Deputy Kelly suggested the cost would be £350 million while Deputy Desmond mentioned a figure of £500 million.  Although I am no expert on the matter, I reckon it would be good value.  An energy station would last for about 30 years and that would be an investment of an average of £10 million per year.  If this kind of investment is not put into the production of nuclear energy we will have to put up with the consequences.</P>
    <P>I know we must look further than the provision of jobs.  It was said either in the debate here last night or during the weekend that the construction of the station would provide approximately 2,000 jobs and that there would be a permanent staff at the station of some 400 or 500 people.  That is very attractive for any constituency.  I would welcome with open arms the creation of 2,000 jobs in my constituency or in any part of the country as well as the prospect of permanent jobs for hundreds of people.  However, that would not, and should not, be the reason why I would opt for the establishment of such a station in one part or another of the country.  Despite the <Col N="179" /> attractiveness of the promise of jobs, my primary concern and the concern of all should be for the environment and for the safety of life, whether human or animal.  It is clear there is no controversy about the fact that extra energy is required to create new jobs&mdash;I am not referring to the construction work or to the operation of the station&mdash;and also to maintain existing jobs.  It is of vital importance that we arrive at a decision as to the best and safest method of producing more energy in the next seven or eight years. Therefore, the question is the safety aspect of such a station.</P>
    <P>The fears of some people are understandable. Last night the Minister referred to the &ldquo;flat earthers&rdquo;.  Not all of the people involved could be so described.  Even in my constituency there are people who have fears and if the station is established their fears must be dispelled.  These people should not be written off merely as cranks or flat earthers.  Many of them are genuinely concerned.</P>
    <P>The greatest concern lies with members of Wexford County Council.  They have an important role to play in this matter.  It is regrettable, as Deputy Kelly has said, that the Minister for the Environment refused to meet the county council.  I think he referred to the Minister for the Environment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It was reported that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy refused to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Minister's pardon.  If it was the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy he should have had the courtesy to meet them.  They have an important role to play.  They will have to decide whether planning permission will be given for this venture.  This has been on their plate for quite a long time.  In 1974 there was an announcement from the ESB that a nuclear power station was to be erected at Carnsore Point and they applied for planning permission to the Wexford County Council.  That application specified a reactor, either an American-type pressurised or boiling light water reactor or a Canadian heavy water reactor.  The application <Col N="180" /> has not yet been adjudicated on by the Wexford County Council.</P>
      <P>Because they were concerned and because they did not think they had full knowledge of all the facts members of the council and officials visited Brussels in order to get further information to help them make up their minds when the planning permission came before them.  It appears to me from their last visit that their minds are not made up as yet.  All the information available should be furnished to them.</P>
      <P>If it is suggested by the county council, I would ask the Minister to ensure that there is a public hearing on the planning application.  At that hearing all sides should be allowed to present their case.  I know the Minister has no time in this debate, but perhaps he would let us know whether there would be an appeal by the ESB against a decision of Wexford County Council if they turn down the application from the ESB.</P>
      <P>At the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis the Minister seemed to suggest that while Wexford did not want it many other places would be delighted to take it.  I do not know if that is right or wrong. Apart from the function of the Wexford County Council in this matter in my view there was an important development some years ago.  This development was concerned with the Wexford creamery and the Wexford milk producers. They were concerned at the proposal to establish the nuclear power station at Carnsore Point and they expressed this concern to An Foras Talúntais.</P>
      <P>They stressed in their submission to An Foras Talúntais the risks affecting agriculture, milk and milk products in particular.  They asked that studies be made.  After several meetings with senior staff of An Foras Talúntais, the ESB, the Wexford creameries and the Wexford milk producers it was agreed that the research centre at Johnstown Castle, which houses An Foras Talúntais, would undertake an independent study of the proposal.  We must all be aware of the special concern of An Foras Talúntais for agriculture in that particular area, not just because their headquarters are located at Johnstown</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> Castle, which is about three or four miles away from Wexford town and ten or 11 miles away from Carnsore Point.</P>
    <P>This study took place over a number of years.  A report was presented by An Foras Talúntais to the Wexford creamery and the milk producers.  I would like to emphasise that this was not a local study of the problem and the work was no amateur effort. This study group consulted with and got information from various experts in Britain, some of the European countries, the United States of America and those who are experts in Ireland.  Those whom I have mentioned had experience of the operations of nuclear power stations and knew the effects of them.</P>
    <P>I do not know if many people are aware of the existence of a copy of this particular report, to which I refer. In case anybody might think it was a local investigation or a local study that was carried out I would like to give the names of the people who were consulted and gave information in that study. They were: The Director, Meteorological Service, Dublin, the Director, Central Statistics Office, Dublin, Staff of the Nuclear Energy Board, Dublin, Staff of the Project Department, ESB, Dublin, Dr. I. McCauley, Trinity College, Dublin, Dr. N. Mitchell and staff of the Fisheries Laboratory, Lowestoft, Mr. N. Villeneuvre, Canadian Embassy, Dublin, Dr. J. Carr, Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, London, Dr. R. Bruce, Letcombe Laboratory, Wantage, Berks, Mr. J. Kirkbride and others at Windscale Works, Cumberland, Dr. R. Kirshmann, SEK/CEN, Mol, Belgium, Mr. F. Luykz, EEC Health and Safety Directorate, Luxembourg, Members of the Swedish Farmers Federation/ Milleu Group, Mr. D. Morgan, Mr. J. Shrove and Mr. D. Gander of the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service, Britain, Mr. H. Waterson of the Advisory and Development Service, Scotland.  Many other people were visited and interviewed as well.  In this particular study farmers in the vicinity of places where there were nuclear power stations, such as Windscale, Hinkley Point and Berkeley and Hunterston, <Col N="182" /> were visited.  I merely mention that to illustrate to the House that this particular study is a valuable document.  I doubt if many Members have read it, possibly because they would not be as interested and concerned as some of us, particularly those who live in the particular area.</P>
    <P>This study was conducted over a period of four years.  Their conclusions are embodied in this report which is entitled Nuclear Power Station at Carnsore Point, The Agricultural Implications, published by An Foras Talúntais.  I would like to read it into the Official Report, but there is no necessity for it because I am sure it is available from An Foras Talúntais or possibly is available in the Library. Despite that there are some passages which I believe should be quoted. Most of those passages are included in the summary at the beginning of the booklet.  I would like to congratulate that study group for the manner in which they tackled their job, how positive they were in their suggestions and opinions and also how objective they were.  They were charged with inquiring into the environmental consequences of a nuclear power station at Carne.  They examined it under two headings.  This is what they had to say:</P>
    <P>The environmental consequences of a nuclear power station were examined under two headings: normal running conditions, and major and minor accidents.  Under normal conditions the radiological consequences of the proposed station we felt to be negligible.  Occasionally radioactive substances would be released through the atmosphere and the sea.  However these releases would have no effect on agriculture or man because the amounts would be very small, the releases would be monitored and rigidly controlled by law, the material would be rapidly dispersed by atmospheric and marine turbulence and because the only radioactive substances released to the atmosphere in significant quantities would be chemically inert gases which do not combine with or form part of the food eaten by man or animal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> I stress &ldquo;man&rdquo; because some people might say that this was a study done to try to discover what effect the nuclear station would have on animal life or agriculture in general.  It says here &ldquo;no effect on man&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>They were also asked to consider the environmental consequences involving major or minor accidents and had this to say :</P>
    <P>The probability of a serious accident leading to a large release of radioactivity was deduced from authoritative US and British sources. The most likely accidents involving damage to the nuclear reactor and melting of its core would probably have little direct consequences outside the boundary fence.  More serious accidents with large-scale radioactivity releases to the atmosphere are less likely; the average likelihood of an accident involving loss of one life, one acute illness, the temporary evacuation of one square mile or one million dollars of property damage to land outside the boundary fence of reactors located in the USA has been calculated as about once per fifty thousand years.  For the reactor site at Carnsore Point, the risk is probably at least ten times less.</P>
    <P>They also considered and made comments about the disposal of nuclear waste and had this to say:</P>
    <P>The disposal of nuclear wastes was also examined.  Low activity wastes would be encased in concrete or bitumen and stored in a suitable repository while highly-active spent fuel wastes containing a small percentage of plutonium would probably be stored by the reprocessing utility in Britian or France as part of a fuel supply/reprocessing contract.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it can be said that we cannot be positive where these particular risks are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is one very important aspect of which the Minister should take notice and that is the public relations aspect.  On public relations An Foras Talúntais had this to say at page 46:</P>
    <P>The probable licensing procedure for a nuclear power reactor in this <Col N="184" /> country is outlined in chapter 9.  The public relations campaign for Carnsore Point has already resulted in a considerable amount of information being given to the public in open discussion between the ESB and both community leaders and the local public in the Carne area at public meetings and even on national television. On several occasions senior officials of the ESB have publicly pledged to put all the facts before the public as decisions were being taken on the propriety of siting a power station at Carnsore Point and it is important that this be done.</P>
    <P>I would go a little further.  I think the information should be given to the public and those concerned before decisions are taken.  In that way we would allay many of the fears that have been expressed.</P>
    <P>At page 47 of the report it is stated:</P>
    <P>It is important that if and when a power reactor begins operation in Ireland, the local community be consulted at regular meetings on plans for expansion and change, be informed about all major and minor accidents on schedule repairs and leakages of radio activity, be given independent results of radio activity monitoring of the environment around the plant and be kept informed of all matters pertinent to environmental safety and protection as affected by the power station.</P>
    <P>If we were to accept what has been suggested in this document in the matter of public relations we could allay many of the fears that exist.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister spoke about the publication of a Green Paper on the production of energy in general. He also mentioned the White Paper. In that I presume we would have positive proposals about nuclear energy and I would suggest there should be a full and open public debate on all aspects of nuclear power including that contained in the Green Paper.  I know there is a risk in this.  I do not want to drag out this matter of public debate any longer than it should be. Public debates could go on for the next seven or eight years.  As was pointed out, there have been many <Col N="185" /> public debates but there are still people fearful of the consequences of the establishment of a station such as this at Carnsore Point.  We will always have people who will have doubts.  I am not saying we should take risks but, with the information from the ESB, from the Nuclear Energy Board and from this particular study I have just mentioned, we can all make up our minds. If that is not possible I suggest that in the near future there should be a full public debate.  How, when, or where I cannot say but I merely ask the Minister to consider such a debate. I am pretty well satisfied with the information I have got but there are people in south Wexford who believe there is a potential grave danger.  It is important to give them the fullest information because we do not want a conflict.  There have been conflicts, physical conflicts, in other parts of the world.  We do not want that.  We want to do the right thing for the country as far as energy is concerned.  It appears to me nuclear energy is the energy that should be developed.  Let us convince the people it is desirable to go ahead with this development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. In considering this question of nuclear energy the first question we have to ask is: Why more power?  Why do we need this extra power?  We all know we need growth in industry.  We need our economy to expand and diversify.  We need jobs for our young people and we want a future for our country.  To do all this by providing energy for industry and an increasing number of homes we need extra supplies of electricity.  The ESB have calculated they will need to more than double their output in seven to ten years if they are to meet the growth required in supplies of electricity.  They have estimated a growth rate of 8.5 per cent per annum.  This is a conservative estimate because some would regard the figure as being of the order of 10 per cent per annum.  Looking at our current generating capacity we find it amounts to a total of 2,500 megawatts and the need in seven to ten years would amount to approximately 5,000 megawatts.  The proposed nuclear generating station would provide <Col N="186" /> approximately 25 per cent of present output or 12.5 per cent of the future level of output.  There is a construction programme approved which will raise the capacity to 3,400 megawatts by 1985.  This includes Kinsale gas and an extension of existing power stations. There is urgent necessity to raise the total to 5,000 megawatts or thereabouts. The gap is approximately 1,600 megawatts.  One nuclear station would provide 650 leaving a balance of something in the region of 950 megawatts still to be provided.  Consequently there would appear to be room for further development still, including coal, if that is found feasible.</P>
      <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister that he is considering alternative projects in addition to a possible nuclear source of energy.  I also welcome his statement that, having considered all options and all possibilities, having looked at the additional hydropower and all the other sources, and at the long-term effects of the various other contributory sources&mdash;redeemable sources, as they are called&mdash;the only new source that can make a significant contribution to our needs for some time to come is uranium and nuclear power generation.  Our options therefore are somewhat limited because, apart from nuclear power, we can only fall back on traditional sources.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly said his main concern was about the cost of nuclear energy. He referred to the cost as stupendous. Deputy Corish has indicated that these large figures in regard to capital investment when broken down into annual sums are not quite so vast as Deputy Kelly suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition we must face the fact that nuclear energy would be our cheapest source of energy.  We might refer to the comparative United Kingdom costs for energy.  Here Deputy Kelly suggested that there were very few sources of information from the Nuclear Energy Board but I would refer him to one which is very interesting, illuminating, factual and comprehensive on the subject.  It is a paper entitled Nuclear Power Implications and Issues by Mr. C. Cunningham, Chief Executive, Nuclear Energy Board.  This was a paper delivered at <Col N="187" /> the national energy conference in September 1977.  That paper outlines very clearly the views of the Nuclear Energy Board on the various possibilities and options.  It is an extremely readable paper for such a complicated technical subject.  Of course it does point out that there are now some 150 power reactors in operation and approximately 300 ordered or in course of construction throughout the world. Not only are there 150 functioning but there are a great many more being built in different parts of the world.</P>
    <P>One of the most interesting aspects of that paper is that it gives comparative costs for United Kingdom energy sources.  This is very close to our situation and consequently these figures are particularly interesting.  For coal it states that the cost would work out at 0.97 pence per kilowatt hour.  For oil the figure is 1.09 pence per kilowatt hour and, for nuclear, 0.67 pence per kilowatt hour.  On the figures given by the Nuclear Energy Board and gleaned from experience in the United Kingdom nuclear energy is 40 per cent cheaper than oil ex the generating stations.  Of course, there are other factors which arise thereafter.  Taking the energy source as delivered from the generating station and comparing coal, oil and nuclear, nuclear is 40 per cent cheaper than oil.  Consequently, we must be interested in nuclear energy as a future source of energy.</P>
    <P>This paper also mentions:</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting here that the overall cost of nuclear power is much less sensitive to escalation in fuel cost since the fuel cost component for a nuclear station is only about one-third of the total cost of generation while it is about two-thirds of the total cost for a coal or oil fired station.</P>
    <P>Consequently, one is in a much stronger position, from a long term point of view, if one invests in a nuclear energy station.  This means a source of fuel which is cheaper for industry, which will help to make industry more competitive in the future and maintain competitiveness with other industries in Europe.  It will enable us to maintain and sustain <Col N="188" /> exports, lead to more jobs, particularly for school-leavers.  It will also lead to a lower or maintenance of consumer prices.  If we do not invest in low-cost energy sources we will be less competitive, and we must have higher consumer prices, or import all of our products from abroad.</P>
    <P>This form of energy will also be cheaper for the housewife.  It would lead to cheaper electricity.  As we know already the cost of electricity has gone so high that ESB bills are causing a major problem in many homes in this country.  One would not need to know very much in that direction to realise that many people's power is being cut off at present because of this inability to pay electricity costs and they are having to make arrangements to pay arrears by instalments and various other means.  Unless we opt for cheaper energy we can expect that kind of situation not alone to continue but to worsen.  Therefore future school-leavers and consumers will not thank us if we procrastinate on decisions such as this, the very technical and complicated one of nuclear energy.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Kelly when he said last evening that we must all be concerned about conservation.  We must not delay on other measures of energy conservation and utilisation, or on making use of alternative renewable energy sources.  For instance, in the case of conservation, we need improved insulation for new houses and indeed existing ones.  We need new standards, more education and incentives in an endeavour to do something positive about the desired conservation of energy.  We also need to examine such matters as district heating mentioned by Deputy Kelly.  We need a commitment to implement a pilot scheme in a large new housing development in one of the growth areas.  There are many such schemes on the continent.</P>
    <P>We need also to pursue research vigorously.  The biomass experiments being carried out here with EEC backing are one interesting example of a benefit we can reap from a new energy source.  We need to keep in touch with the work being done on wind, sun and <Col N="189" /> wave energy.  As the Minister has said, these new kinds of energies&mdash;especially these renewable energy sources&mdash;are likely within the next 20 years or so to contribute a small proportion only of our total energy needs.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corish has said, the environment is a major factor and one with which we must all be concerned, whether it be close to Dublin, Wexford or on the west coast.  Deputy Desmond expressed fears about safety and health and spoke about public fears in this respect.  Deputy Kelly was not quite so concerned in that regard.  He seemed reasonably happy with the measures proposed by the technical experts and was concerned mainly with the cost factor.  That was a point he reiterated this evening.</P>
    <P>In relation to the environment I was glad to note that Deputy Corish had complete knowledge of what has been going on.  There is another copy of the document&mdash;Nuclear Power Station at Carnsore Point&mdash;over here and the Deputy has saved me making some references to it.  I should like to congratulate Mr. Brian Coulter and the distinguished people who worked with him on the agricultural implications of this nuclear power station at Carnsore Point presented by An Foras Talúntais. As Deputy Corish said it is a very extensive, comprehensive and technical consideration of the factors involved. Deputy Corish gave us a number of the conclusions reached.  One he did not give was the final paragraph in the summary which states very clearly:</P>
    <P>Under these circumstances, and if the Nuclear Energy Board exercises its role in regulating the design, construction and operation of the power plant, the safety procedures and sabotage precautions, the monitoring and control of releases of radioactivity to the environment and the training and testing of station staff, then there should be no radiobiological consequences to the agricultural community from the proposed nuclear generating station.</P>
    <P>This is a very comprehensive and explicit statement of the conclusions of this study, which was very comprehensive in itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> I might also refer to Sir Brian Flower's report, the Sixth Report on Nuclear Power and the Environment, which refers to current levels of radiation in the UK and shows how low the nuclear power industry is in relation to a variety of other industries.  The Minister gave these figures in his speech last night and I will not dwell on them again, but they indicate that the smallest of levels is coming from the nuclear power industry as it is run at present.  I agree with Deputy Corish that the question of public relations is extremely important because although the information may be available in valuable books and reports people have to understand and be convinced about these matters.  It is important to convey the details as clearly as possible.</P>
    <P>Waste disposal must be a precondition of any arrangements that are made with the uranium suppliers.  In relation to waste disposal it is quite possible that Britatin may even reprocess waste in some of their specialised generating stations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>Where?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a minute.  The next item that arises is the question of safety.  The Minister dealt fairly extensively with this and made reference to the USA and the Continent.  If we look at Britain, we find that there are 11 standard nuclear generating stations in existence.  In addition to that, there are four other fuel processing stations and these include the reprocessing stations.  The total including atomic energy authority stations comes to 20.  There are 20 such stations functioning across the water from us, beside Liverpool, Manchester and London.  They are spread all over England.  I would refer Deputies to the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's&mdash;Sir Brian Flower is the chairman&mdash;Sixth Report on Nuclear Power and the Environment, September 1976.  This report shows how extensive these power stations are in Britain, and it is interesting how many of them are on the west side of Britain nearest to us, and there does not seem to be any great difficulty with these at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> The question of how many accidents are likely to occur has been raised. The Nuclear Energy Board paper to which I referred gave some interesting statistics in this respect.  It pointed out that 500 people are killed each year on the roads, that is almost ten per week.  That is the normal risk associated with driving.  We are prepared to drive cars with the risk of 500 being killed each year.  The Foras Talúntais report indicates that there is one fatal road accident every 15 hours, one rail accident every two months, one petroleum fire accident every six months, one fatal accident from lightning striking every nine months, one falling meteor accident every 100,000 years, and one nuclear accident at a location like Carnsore Point once in every 400,000 years. Consequently they conclude that there is negligible practical risk if the station is conducted properly.</P>
    <P>Another important area is the strategic importance of nuclear energy. In relation to the stocks of nuclear energy, it is a fact that when fuelled the uranium which is used for fuelling will last for one year, consequently we would have that amount of stock on hands for a year ahead.</P>
    <P>The diversification of energy sources is another aspect of strategic importance. We are currently 80 per cent dependent on oil while the ESB are 67 per cent dependent on oil.  All Members of the House would agree that it is important not to be overdependent on oil as a source of energy. Another strategic aspect is the technology which comes with nuclear energy. As we can see, Britain is very far advanced in the technology of nuclear energy.  We have a great deal to learn which will put us in a position to assess and be involved in future developments around the world, so that we will not be quite so far behind in that respect in relation to other countries.</P>
    <P>There is one element which came up in the debate which is very important, that is the question of urgency.  Deputy Kelly in his contribution to the debate urged the Minister to go easy for 12 to 18 months.  The Deputy also said that Norway was building a coal <Col N="192" /> station now, and that this is a new development which we ought to look at fairly closely to see what is in it for us.  Deputy Kelly did not say that Norway has discovered immense coal reserves and that regular coal mining is expected to commence in 1982 at a rich coal deposit called Svea.  The annual planned production of coal is at present one million tons at Svea, along with an unspecified cutback from the present 430,000 tons at Longyearbyen. At these production rates currently known coal deposits are estimated to last for 20 years, although the potential of the area could be as high as several hundred million tons of coal.  Of course the Norwegians have to rely on coal.  They have the supplies and resources and have discovered immense new coal reserves.  For this reason Norway does not envisage being into nuclear power before 1990, because of their policy review timetable and the lead time for such stations to come on stream.  Being into it in 1990 means starting in 1980.  In the 1980s Norway will continue with the building of fossil fuel fired stations and finalise the development of hydro-electric stations, which of course with their mountainous areas and very strong water power are a major source of energy.  Norway is richly endowed. Not alone have they very large hydropower resources but they have found oil in large quantities and now have found new probably very large coal deposits.  We should not become too involved with waiting for 12 to 18 months to see what Norway is doing in relation to coal.  Delay has been too great already.  An Act was passed in 1971 establishing a Nuclear Energy Board; there was a decision in 1973 by the Coalition to go ahead with the nuclear station and, as has been pointed out, it was a decision in principle. Here again, in relation to urgency, I would refer Deputies to the statement of Deputy Peter Barry on 29 March 1977, at column 574 of volume 298 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>...there is the possibility of no energy, if the people in democracies who are now objecting to the establishment of nuclear energy stations get their way and these stations are not established.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="193" /> Does the world grind to a halt while at the same time the Eastern bloc countries, who have not got the problems that democracies have, continue to build nuclear stations as they are doing now?  Who tackles that problem?  This is one of the most important questions tied to energy but in relation to democracy that faces the western world at the moment.  There is no democracy, there is no European Community, no IDA, no OECD from the time of the removal of energy.  We are not talking about the scarcity or the price of it but the removal of it.</P>
    <P>Governments will have to be unpopular maybe or perhaps to fall and be willing to take the risk of paying that price knowing that what they are trying to do in their own country is providing a form of energy to fill this gap when the finite fossil fuels run out, and before fusion energy comes in.</P>
    <P>Consequently, Deputy Barry was concerned that the matter be dealt with urgently.  The question arises then of starting an inquiry now as is proposed by Deputy Desmond and supported by Fine Gael.  I ask why we should start an inquiry now?  Let us look at the facts.  First, we have a comprehensive report from An Foras Talúntais.  This was referred to by Deputy Corish. Secondly there is Britain's comprehensive report&mdash;the Flower Report&mdash;and there is also their deep experience in this area.  Thirdly, we have the Nuclear Energy Board.  I have referred to the paper by their chief executive.  We know that this board is acting and will continue to act as a watch dog. Fourthly, we know that the ESB began training people for such a project in 1968 and, fifthly, we know that in this regard there would be a Cabinet decision that would include the decisions of the Ministers for the Environment, for Industry, Commerce and Energy, of the Minister responsible for consumer affairs, and of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The Coalition reached a decision in principle but did not proceed to act on that decision.  I have every confidence in this Cabinet and I welcome the Minister's announcement that the Government <Col N="194" /> will take a decision shortly on whether to reaffirm in principle the 1973 decision to go ahead with a nuclear generation station.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment in the name of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that the question before us is not that of the country going nuclear but of the process by which the various matters should be considered.  I find it surprising that an ostensibly democratic party would oppose this proposal, which is essentially aimed at trying to ensure that every last vestige of comment and interest is examined fully and that everybody concerned is given the opportunity of putting his views on record before a final decision is reached.  Any suggestion that the need for full discussion should not be met is unhealthy, would lead to grave reservations on the part of many people and would perhaps cause more disquiet than, say, the Minister intends causing.</P>
      <P>The first regrettable aspect of this question is that the decision which in the words of one of the Ministers of State is imminent, is being made outside the context of a clear comprehensive statement by the Government on our energy needs for the future, whether that statement be in the form of a Green Paper or a White Paper. There is reasonable evidence to indicate that the arguments are being accepted rather glibly by the Minister regarding the necessity for a nuclear station or for it to be located in the area proposed.</P>
      <P>The energy projections on which, apparently, the decision is based, imply a basic lack of wisdom.  Energy needs do not inevitably and inextricably continue to increase at the same rate, that is, at a rate of from 8 to 10 per cent. There will be a tapering off in that regard.  There is reason to believe that the arguments put forward in favour of this projected growth rate were based on one year's sale of electricity by the ESB.  That would be a most unsatisfactory base on which to determine the projections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that we have the Shephard Report on the present and <Col N="195" /> projected financial position of the Northern Ireland electricity service. That was supported by the ESB and showed to be without foundation the growth rate as argued by the authority in that case.  The ESB lent their weight to this case.</P>
    <P>As the previous speaker has pointed out, much more consideration and research is needed in the field of domestic and local means of energy creation. I shall not go into those now except to say that there are local resources which have not been either examined or exploited fully.  The whole question of fossil fuels, for instance, and of other energy sources has not been tapped or examined fully.  If such examination had been carried out.  I would be much happier about the decision we are talking about.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the basic question that causes concern is the nature of this decision and particularly the safety aspects appertaining to it.  The basic fuel involved is uranium, the safety, military and economic implications of which are very serious.  I am sure the House is aware that extensive uranium mining is in progress on this island. To date, though, there is no indication of the progress of this mining with the exception of a statement from the EEC Commissioner, Mr. Richard Burke, who indicated that uranium prospecting in Ireland has produced promising results.  As soon as he said this, Mr. P. J. O'Connor, head of the national uranium reconnaissance unit in the Geological Survey Office, confirmed that although no uranium deposits were found there had been uranium showings in various parts of the country. It is important that all aspects of this matter be taken into consideration. Substantial amounts of EEC money are being spent in the pursuit of this exploration.</P>
    <P>There are serious implications, too, in regard to our neutrality.  The Euratom Treaty to which we are cosignatories would put us in a relatively weak position regarding the control of uranium mined here.  As a supplier to NATO we might find that in the event of a fairly substantial repository <Col N="196" /> of uranium being found, the Euratom Treaty bound us to part with this. In other words we might find that uranium mined here would be used for warfare in other countries.  That is something that I am sure nobody here would like to see happening. Consequently, we must think of some safeguards in this area.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that if nuclear stations are safe they are hardly economic and that if they are economic they are probably not safe.  That element of disquiet in the public mind needs to be met.  There, is, too, the question of waste, and this is fundamental. I am not happy with the Government suggestion so far, which seems to imply that the people involved in exploration should be left with the responsibility of disposing of the waste. This is undoubtedly the area in which looms the major health question. Already there is substantial evidence of serious contamination in the Irish Sea from the Windscale plant.  There is no other reprocessing plant either in Great Britain or on the horizon in this country for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to assume that Windscale will be the site for reprocessing the radioactive waste from this country and there is substantial medical evidence from a variety of sources which, if time allowed one could quote indicating that there is some cause for concern that the saucer-shaped Irish Sea could, if subjected to further radioactive waste, be a serious health hazard.  That is a fundamental point. Already, Windscale discharges several kilograms of plutonium annually into the Irish Sea.  No one knows where it goes.  It is one of the most toxic substances known to man.  One-millionth of a gram, we are told, can cause cancer because of the alpha radiation it emits.  If the Irish Sea is a repository for our future waste, I would not be happy with the position.</P>
    <P>While we sit here, the European Commission have seen fit to formalise a major public debate on the issue, the first session of which took place before Christmas, and there will be further sessions to discuss, in the way in which this topic should be discussed, non-emotively, in a calm <Col N="197" /> fashion, all the issues.  What we should consider is basically the question of examining all the options here, ensuring that everybody in the public sector or indeed in the private sector, who wants to put his views on record has an opportunity of exercising his democratic right so to do.  That is not an unreasonable request.  It is one which should find a responsive chord in a democratic State.  An unhealthy rush to make a decision must be questioned. I do not know what the motivation is. I do not see any immediate demand or need for a decision within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>I may not have put the case as well as I would like to have done.  Time did not allow.  For any Member of the House who wishes to seek it&mdash;and I recognise that the devil can cite Scripture for his purposes&mdash;there is ample evidence indicating that nothing less than full consideration of all the factors involved is required.  The economic arguments, the question of disposal of waste, safety health factors and the moral aspects, need full public examination before this major commitment, with all its implications for the kind of society we will have in the future, is made.  I would seriously recommend to the Government that they should reconsider.</P>

      <P>In the first instance, it is important to state what this Motion is not about and what this party and, I suspect, also the Fine Gael Party, are not about and what we are not against, because this is being viewed and argued as a negative Motion.  It is not a negative Motion.  It is an attempt to be positive. That is why it is so important.  It is not against the ESB.  It is not against the Nuclear Energy Board.  It is not against nuclear power as such.  Nor, indeed, is it against Carnsore Point as the site for a possible nuclear station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must congratulate Deputy Corish on his speech in which he showed a balanced consideration of many of the issues involved, presented to the Dáil in a way which I believe did him <Col N="198" /> credit and did the Motion in front of us credit as well.</P>
    <P>It has been inevitable that the debate has spread from time to time away from the Motion itself into the merits and demerits of nuclear power. I do not propose to take that particular line, except momentarily here and there, for a couple of reasons&mdash;first of all because I believe the Motion itself in its own right is an important one and gives us plenty to talk about; secondly, because I do not believe that this House is at the present time competent to decide on the merits of nuclear power on the paltry amount of evidence that we have before us, and this is precisely why we put down this Motion, because the amount of evidence we have before us is paltry.  This is why we want an Oireachtas Committee. This is why we want production of all the relevant documents and information.</P>
    <P>The Government have made considerable play of the fact that progress towards nuclear power continued under the previous Administration.  This is true.  It is also true that the Nuclear Energy Board, as such, was set up in 1971, by a Fianna Fáil Administration. We must remember that 1971 is now some seven years ago.  While it is true that there has been a seven years' delay in planning a nuclear station, if you look at it that way, it is also true that there has been seven more years of knowledge about the way in which we ought to be making projections about energy needs and about alternative sources of energy. The frame of mind which was common not only in this country but in other countries, in 1971, when the Nuclear Energy Board was set up, was a sort of &ldquo;wise men&rdquo; philosophy &mdash;find the wise men and leave it to them.  I have no doubt that the Nuclear Energy Board is composed of extremely wise men and that they have done to the best of their, no doubt, considerable ability the task entrusted to them but in the seven years since the Nuclear Energy Board was established there has been international reaction, especially on the issue of nuclear power, to the idea that you can and should leave a decision of <Col N="199" /> such overwhelming magnitude to a relatively small body of men, however competent.</P>
    <P>I will give the example of Sweden, where almost exactly the same process seems to have happened but a few years earlier than it seems to be happening in this country.  In Sweden, in fact, ultimately, a general election was fought and lost, at least partly, on this particular issue.  In <i>Sweden Now</i>, which is an independent Swedish magazine, Mr. Per Ragnarson described with great clarity what happened there. I quote:</P>
    <P>The Swedish public didn't have the slightest idea of what was happening.  The controlling clan of less than 10 people were so convinced of the excellence of nuclear power and the superiority of their own wisdom that they never, in their wildest imagination, could foresee a future controversy with the public over nuclear energy.  But it came. And it was tough.</P>
    <P>Later on he points out that even the responsible Cabinet Ministers at that time in Sweden later had to admit that they did not sufficiently understand briefs which they presented to the Swedish Parliament.  This happened in Sweden and I think the results of the last general election in that country showed the growing public disquiet with the habit of handing everything over to the wise men, however wise, however serious or however well-intentioned they may be.  This is something which is the relict of a Victorian system of government.  We want a different kind of society in this country. We want a different kind of democracy, with more participation and more information about decisions.  That is why we put down this Motion.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the attitude taken by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to this whole subject.  His attitude, all too common, unfortunately, on the far side of the House, can be divided quite easily into two different components. The first one is his action in setting up a whole series of straw men whom he caricatures as the only opposition to this particular project <Col N="200" /> and whom he then proceeds to knock down.  His second argument is the big stick one: if the naughty boys in Wexford do not like it, all these lovely jobs will be taken away and given to Sligo, Mayo or wherever.  This is unworthy of the subject we are discussing; it is unworthy of the Minister and his role.</P>
    <P>Speaking at the Ard Fheis on 18th of this month the Minister said: &ldquo;We want an informed debate on this&rdquo;. He went on to say: &ldquo;We don't want members of the Flat Earth Society shooting off at a tangent&rdquo;.  This is barroom stuff.  It may be good enough for a Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis but it is not good enough for the people of this country.  It is instructive to remember that not all of the reactions, even from organisations and societies which might fit into this caricature of the Minister, have been opposed to nuclear action and nuclear policy.  The Solar Energy Society, for example, in a lengthy statement on a nuclear power station at Carnsore Point specifically avoided coming down against nuclear energy and asked instead for the kind of public inquiry for which we are asking here.</P>
    <P>Let us look very briefly at the history of the relationship between the Nuclear Energy Board and the Government. In the first report of the board it was noted that they had visited the Carnsore site.  The second report for the year ending December 1975 noted that the reduction in the demand for electricity had led the ESB to suggest that there might be some delay in the introduction of nuclear power to their network.  The report went on:</P>
    <P>However, because of the long lead time associated with planning and constructing a nuclear power station, the ESB was anxious that the board's assessment of its site report on Carnsore Point should be completed as originally planned.</P>
    <P>The third report for the year ending December 1976 informed us that the board had, with the help of experts from the Commission, completed their assessment of the ESB site report and presented this to the Minister.  It went on to say that before giving formal approval for any particular site the <Col N="201" /> board would require additional and more detailed submissions from the ESB.</P>
    <P>We have here three fundamental documents: the ESB site report, the board's assessment of that site report and the additional information which I assume has been made available by the ESB to the Nuclear Energy Board. At least one of these documents, the site report, was furnished to the AFT for their report and is actually quoted verbatim in that report.  It is not available to us.  The very minimum that we need before any decision is taken is these three documents, so that informed public opinion can be brought to bear.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn briefly to the AFT report because it has been dealt with very effectively by Deputy Corish and others.  I accept that An Foras Talúntais did an excellent job based on the information available to them, and probably it would have been difficult to do a better job.  Two things must be said about the report.  First of all, it is not the whole job that needs to be done.  We do not need only a report on the safety of nuclear installations. We need reports, up-to-date assessments and projections about future energy sources and needs.  An Foras Talúntais did not do this; they were not asked and they could not have done so.  I am not blaming them. I am saying that this is only half the story.  The second point is that they took their decision on the basis of the evidence available to them, and I am prepared to accept that they had a substantial degree of very important evidence available.</P>
    <P>All political decisions must necessarily be taken in the framework of some kind of ignorance.  No Cabinet in the world can be aware of all the relevant information before they take a decision, even a decision of this magniture, but it is important to find out whether the necessary ignorance is changed, through a process of disregard for public opinion and other matters, into culpable ignorance.  It is because we are afraid of culpable ignorance that we put down this motion.</P>
    <P>In 1973 a decision in principle may have been taken.  It is now five years <Col N="202" /> later and there has been more research into the kind of projections being done and the kind of energy needs in the future.  We want to see this evidence really brought to bear where it counts before the decision is taken.  All the modern evidence shows that we are heading into a period of considerable uncertainty, both about the projected rise in energy needs and the projected future utilisation of energy.  The Watts Committee in Great Britian, part of the Government's Advisory Council on Energy Conservation, suggested that up to 88 per cent of present energy could be saved by conservation methods.  That estimate may be too high, but practical experiments on the ground have proved that conservation methods could save at least 20 per cent in terms of home heating.  Great Britain is spending £100 million within the next couple of years to bring two million council houses up to reasonable conservation standards. They would not do this if they did not believe that spending the money in this way and providing jobs in this way was cheaper than spending the money on providing the jobs to provide the energy which would otherwise be lost.</P>
    <P>In an 18-month study the International Institute for Environment and Development estimate that by the year 2025&mdash;that is, fifty years from now&mdash; they will need in Britain only 60 per cent of the energy now used for transport, heating and servicing buildings. This institution is not an anti-nuclear lobby.  They say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to nuclear power for Britain, but they want modest nuclear power.  Their assumptions are generous.  They assume that the number of households with cars will go up from 56 per cent to 80 per cent, that homes and offices will be bigger, that people will be warmer, and that ownership of electrical appliances will be trebled.  More and more a basic question mark is being put against the fundamental assumption that rising energy demands are inevitable if there is to be economic growth.  This is the fundamental question which the Government have not attempted to answer, and on which to date we have not had any absolutely convincing fundamental evidence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> I will turn very briefly to the employment implications.  It is not enough to say, as the Minister has said, that the alternative is between the jobs that would be provided in the building and staffing of a nuclear station and no jobs at all.  If we are not to build this station, we will need hundreds and thousands of other jobs in conservation and in the production of other sources of energy.  We have not heard about this and we have not heard a convincing argument against it.  I suspect that many permanent jobs which are mooted for this station at Carnsore Point may be provided for members of the armed forces marching around outside it trying to maintain security, which is an issue at least as important as safety.</P>
    <P>We have been told that we need to reduce our dependence on oil.  Of course we do, partly at least because oil contributes to our balance of payments problems.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly we will have to import fuel, and we will have <Col N="204" /> to pay to export it for reprocessing. We need time, and we can get this time by launching a full-scale conservation policy.  We need this anyway, and the danger is that we will lose out both ways and that we will have neither a full-scale conservation policy&mdash;which we need whether we get nuclear power or not&mdash;nor a nuclear power station whose justification has not been adequately proved.  We need to experiment with conservation and with pricing policies and we need above all to be open-minded. The Green Paper, I suspect, will be a farce.  It will be a careful selection of evidence designed to buttress a decision already taken in principle. We need to be open-minded before the decision is taken and not afterwards.  I have an open mind but on the basis of the evidence before us to date the Minister has not.  That is why this amendment is a tragedy for democracy for this country.</P>

Between 1 April 1973 and 1 January 1978, my Department paid grants totalling £223,878 in respect of group schemes in County Cork.  The overall position regarding group water supply schemes in the county at 31 December 1977, was as follows: 264 schemes serving 2,825 houses had been completed; 89 schemes to serve 2,205 houses were in progress, for which 1,939 grants had been paid; seven schemes were designed, to serve 82 houses; and 168 schemes were at earlier stages of development (e.g. location and testing of source, preparation of design).</P>

      <P>Article 17 of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations, 1958 as amended by the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations, 1977, provides that a licensing authority shall, upon application, supply free of charge to any other licensing authority, or to any officer of the Garda Síochána or a member of the Garda Síochána authorised by such an officer, or to any collector of Customs and Excise, or (with my consent) to any Department of State, or to any local authority exercising functions pursuant to the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act, 1975 (No. 14 of 1975), full particulars of any vehicle registered with them or of any trade licence issued by them.  The regulations do not provide for supply of these particulars, including the engine and chassis number of a vehicle, to any other person or body.  The latter part of the question does not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <P>Rathfarnham Courthouse is no longer adequate to cater for the volume of business in the District Court Area of Rathfarnham which has increased rapidly in recent years.  The courtroom is too small, there is no waiting or consultation area and traffic noise inconveniences the court.  Moreover the incorporation of Rathfarnham into the administrative area of Dublin Corporation has led to the anomalous position where the courthouse for an area most of which is in the administrative area of the county council is situated within the administrative area of the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been pressing Dublin County Council since 1974 to provide better courthouse facilities for <Col N="107" /> the area but so far without success.  The county council was unable to find a premises in its own administrative area which would serve as temporary accommodation and it maintains that it has no statutory authority to spend money on the acquisition of a building in the administrative area of the corporation. The most recent development was that my Department proposed that premises near the present courthouse, and within the administrative area of the corporation, might be leased.  These premises could be adapted for use as temporary court accommodation by the Office of Public Works, with Dublin County Council paying an approximate portion of the cost of the adaptation work and of the rent.  The proposal has not been accepted by the county council because they consider the proposed accommodation inadequate for the needs of the area.  The whole matter will be discussed at a meeting later this month between county councillors and officers of my Department.  The officers of my Department will be urging on the county councillors that the county council should accept my Department's latest proposal as a temporary solution because the plans for the future major road network and particularly public transport routes for the Rathfarnham/ Tallaght area as a whole are not yet sufficiently advanced to enable a decision to be taken regarding the siting of a permanent new courthouse or courthouses.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that the court accommodation at Kilmainham, Dublin is no longer adequate to cope with the volume of business now coming before the District Court there; and the steps he proposes to take to rectify the position.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the court accommodation in Kilmainham Court-house is no longer adequate to cope with the volume of business now coming before the District Court there. The solution to this problem is to schedule a second sitting of the court for Kilmainham on at least some days every week.  However, there is not <Col N="108" /> sufficient court accommodation available in the courthouse at present to allow of simultaneous sittings.</P>
      <P>As the Dublin County Council is responsible under the terms of the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, for the provision of courthouse accommodation at Kilmainham, my Department wrote to the county council in December 1976 requesting that the accommodation at present used for library purposes in the courthouse be handed over for use as court accommodation.  In reply, the county council have stated that they are agreeable in principle to surrendering the library accommodation for use as court accommodation.  The county council, however, are having difficulty in obtaining suitable alternative accommodation for the library work now being carried out in Kilmainham Courthouse.</P>
      <P>A meeting has been arranged for later this month between Dublin county councillors and officers of my Department to discuss court accommodation problems in Rathfarnham. I have directed the officers of my Department to raise the subject of the extra accommodation needed at Kilmainham with the councillors with a view to impressing on them the extreme urgency of making additional accommodation available for court purposes in Kilmainham.</P>
      <P>As soon as additional accommodation becomes available in Kilmainham it is my intention to schedule a second sitting of the District Court for that venue on whatever number of days per week is required having regard to the volume of business to be dealt with at the venue.</P>
