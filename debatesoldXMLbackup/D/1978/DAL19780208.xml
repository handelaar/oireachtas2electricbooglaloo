      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): We had, I think, teased out this section.  It is the section which gives the tenant for life the right to borrow money on the security of the farm which he is entitled to enjoy for life only.  I can see the merit in providing finance to enable the tenant for life to engage in good husbandry by putting the land to the best possible use.  It is in the national interest the land should be productive.  But this section goes pretty far.  It is good if the tenant for life who borrows on the security of his limited interest in the land uses the money he borrows to improve the land and hands on the land so improved to his successor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon used to say, it is the duty of every man to hand on the land a little better than he gets it. That is a very laudable principle. However, if the tenant for life who borrows the money does not use it to improve the land but takes himself and the money off to Cheltenham or to some other race meeting where he <Col N="774" /> gambles it&mdash;this is an age of gambling nationally and individually&mdash;and the bet does not come off, then the money is gone and the remainder man will have to pay.  He has to take the land subject to the charge in favour of the ACC without any benefit whatever. That is the position and, so long as the House appreciates that that is the position, it is entering into a commitment with its eyes open.</P>
    <P>I trust that when the ACC are making loans of this nature they will exercise great care and discretion and vet, so to speak, the applicants on past performance as well as future promise.  I would go so far as to say that the money should be given for permanent improvements of the land and permanent improvements, as we now know, have got a new definition under the Bill as we are amending it.  Permanent improvements are something other than what the average man would regard as permanent improvements.  I say the money should be advanced only in respect of old-fashioned permanent improvements so that the land will be improved and handed on so improved. I would even go further and say that the ACC might consider making advances under this section&mdash;I am not speaking about other sections&mdash;in instalments and, if a man borrows £20,000 to drain land, erect fences, manure it and so on, he should get £5,000 when he has so much work done, another £5,000 when further work has been done and so on.  In that way the ACC would ensure that the tenant for life, who has a very limited interest in the land and whose interest can be extinguished in a breath, would be compelled to use the money borrowed in a way which would be beneficial to the land and to the remainder man.  The situation is different where the tenant owns the land absolutely. If he does not use the borrowed money wisely that is his own responsibility and it is his own money, so to speak, he is wasting.  In that case the ACC can sell the land and get their money back.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the tenant for life who has a very limited interest.  I am concerned that he should not be able to mortgage his very limited interest up to the hilt and not make <Col N="775" /> good use of the money borrowed to make permanent improvements to the land, handing on the land to the remainder man ultimately mortgaged to the hilt and only worth a fraction of what it should be worth.  I hope I can rely on the ACC to use this section very carefully and to take every step open to them to ensure that money advanced for permanent improvements is used for permanent improvements.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has explained in detail the points that were raised and covered last week.  I must repeat what I said then, that the definition of &ldquo;permanent improvements&rdquo; has been expanded and the ACC can give a loan for livestock to a tenant for life.</P>
      <P>I would agree with the points made by Deputy Fitzpatrick and in passing those views to the ACC I would say that all the points raised are a matter for the ACC's discretion in their relationship and contact with the applicant, the tenant for life.  I am quite sure that the very valid points he has made will be taken into account by the ACC before giving any loans to a tenant for life for any purpose, including permanent improvements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like Deputy Fitzpatrick to clarify a point for me. Could he explain the difference between the absolute owner and the tenant for life?  The ACC are more than capable of making sure that the borrower will use the money for the purpose for which it was borrowed.  In regard to instalments, in my area you can borrow £20,000 and use £5,000 this year and so on.  What difference is there to the ACC between the registered owner and a tenant for life?  If your last breath is drawn it does not matter whether you are a tenant for life or the absolute registered owner.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Suppose that John Smith is the owner of a farm and land and he leaves the land to his brother James Smith for life and after the death of James Smith to James Smith's son <Col N="776" /> Willie Smith.  In that case John Smith's interest in the land goes to his brother James for his life, and after his life his son Willie becomes the absolute owner. Under this section we are giving the ACC authority which they had before but with the new definition of permanent improvements it is more forage. We are giving the ACC the right to advance to James Smith, the man who only has it for his life, £20,000 and that £2,000 will be charged on the land, not on James Smith's interest in the land.  If James Smith spends that £20,000 in clearing ditches, making drains, putting up gates and on other useful improvements to the land, that is all right.  His son Willie will take the land subject to the mortgage if it is not repaid but with the benefit of the work which his father has done on the land. But if James Smith, the tenant for life, is a speculative sort of fellow and decides to invest the money in stocks and shares, not to use an absurd example, or, more absurd, if he got what he considered to be a good tip for a horse, put the money on the horse and the horse crashed or the stocks and shares depreciated to the extent where they were no good and did not improve the land, his son Willie would take the land subject to the mortgage of £20,000 but with no advantage whatever.  You may say that that is a family matter, and it is, but the intention of the father was to give the land to his brother for life and that the son would then take it.  Were it not for this section, James the brother could only charge his limited interest in the land which would be of little value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The example I have given is the case of a family, but it could be that Willie might not be related to the tenant for life.  Other difficult situations could arise.  If the tenant for life was a bad manager or foolish, or if there was a crash in cattle prices or some other disaster, he might put the money to bad use and hand over the land to Willie without any benefit.  You could have a worse case where the tenant for life really thought that he should have got the land and begrudged it bitterly to the man coming after him.  Instead of having good <Col N="777" /> intentions he could borrow this money with the alleged intention of improving the land when he might have no intention whatever of spending it on the land.  He might be using this device to defeat the intention of the original grantor who was giving him the land for life and then passing it to somebody else.</P>
    <P>I regard those cases as real possibilities. I do not regard any of the cases that I have put forward as fantasy.  At the same time I can see that it is a good thing to have machinery in the Bill under which the ACC can advance money to the tenant for life who might not live for a short time but for 25 years, to enable him to use the farm well.  When giving that authority and those powers to the ACC and those benefits to the tenant for life, there is an obligation on us to have regard to the interests of the remainder man.</P>
    <P>Lawyers and people of practical experience know that land is often given to a man for life just because the man who is giving the land does not trust him sufficiently to give it to him absolutely, because he thinks he will gamble it or that it will go out of the family.  In other words, he does not believe he is a sensible person, and he uses the device of giving him the land for life only and then to his son, but I often think the son could be a lot worse than him.  Anyway, he is keeping it in the family for one generation longer.  He knows he cannot trust A and is hopeful that he may be able to trust B.  The reason we have a tenant for life is that he is often an unreliable person.  Therefore, we should try to ensure that the ACC will not lightly use this section, that they will use it in a fatherly way to ensure that the tenant for life does not squander the borrowed money and hand on the land heavily burdened and mortgaged to his successor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference is that John knew that James was going to get it after his death and if he was the type that he begrudged James getting it he might squander it.  My argument is that things would be very difficult for the ACC unless they were the last. If they were the first company he <Col N="778" /> sought to borrow from with the intention of squandering the money it would be very difficult to guard against such squandering.  With the first £5,000 he would get from the company he might back a horse and not care about the outcome, but the situation would be different if he did not know who was getting the farm.  The one big safety valve in being the tenant for life is that such a person could not sell the farm but he could mortgage it as far as he wished.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): If this section was not in the Bill he could only mortgage his own interest and the amount of money he would get on that sort of a security would be very little.  By virtue of this section he can mortgage his own interest and his successor's interest and he gets the money into his claw.</P>

      <P>Up to now one could only mortgage one's place for one's lifetime, but under this section even though a person has only a life interest in a place he can mortgage it for those coming after him.  I can assure the House that officials of the ACC are careful, and they judge each applicant on how he is using his farm, but I accept that they may not be able to judge a farmer fully.</P>

      <P>The points raised by the Deputies are valid ones.  I should like to state that the ACC use their discretion in regard to such loans. This section provides that where the ACC give a loan the money be paid to trustees if they are there, and if they are not there there is provision for appointing them in subsections (2) (3). <Col N="779" /> Many of the fears and doubts raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick are covered.  It is, finally, a matter for the ACC and their discretion.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): That subsection states:</P>
      <P>(2) Money borrowed under this section shall be paid by the Corporation to the trustees for the purposes of the Settled Land Acts, 1882 to 1890, of the settlement under which the borrower is tenant for life or has the powers of a tenant for life or to persons appointed under this section to receive the money, and the money shall be capital money arising under the said settlement within the meaning of the said Acts, and the purpose for which the money is borrowed under this section shall be a purpose for which capital money may be applied under the said Acts, and the said Acts shall apply to the said money accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would be all very well if we did not amend the definition of &ldquo;permanent improvements&rdquo;, because the term &ldquo;permanent improvements&rdquo;, as amended, can mean the improvement of the business carried out on the land, the putting of more cattle on it and so on.  I am satisfied that it is our duty to ventilate points like this and to pass on to the ACC our views.  It is my view <Col N="780" /> that when money is advanced under this section every reasonable step should be taken to protect the remainder money.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This section enables the corporation to advance money to an administrator for the purposes as stated in it.  An administrator can be a widow with a young family, and until that young family reaches the age of 21 she cannot deal with the land absolutely and, therefore, must borrow as administrator.  She must give a bond to the High Court when taking out administration for her faithful administration of the estate, and the amount of the bond must be double the amount of the gross assets.  If she is guilty of default in the administration the people who are entitled to the property can claim against her, against the insurance company or the people who have given the bond.  Therefore, I wonder if £25,000 in 1978 is a sufficiently high ceiling.  One could have £25,000 in stock or machinery.  It is not all that great an amount of money.  I doubt if the ceiling is high enough in a genuine case, and I suggest that the Minister have a look at the figure between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This is the section that is copper-fastening or implementing the previous sections which give the corporation the right to take priority over the outstanding interest in the land. The corporation, notwithstanding that relatives or other people may have valid charges which are not registered, may take a charge which gives them priority over it. This particular section deals with machinery available to the corporation for selling land subject to priority charges.  I believe it is very far going.  One subsection of it gives the court the right to make orders even <Col N="782" /> though all people who have not an interest in the land are not before it.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to repeat the arguments I made on a previous section even though they could be made here. The effect of this section and the previous sections is to give the applicant for the loan and the corporation the right to ignore outstanding claims. Some effort should be made to ascertain the outstanding claims and pay them.  If we are ignoring them we should give the owners of those outstanding claims the benefit of an insurance fund which should be established under the Act.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that if this was contested in the court it would be contrary to the Constitution to mortgage somebody who has equities which are not discharged. There are hundreds of farmers in the west of Ireland who need development and who need the ACC loan who have not proper owner-ship. There are a lot of farms which are subject to equity.  I am sure the position is the same in Cavan and that Deputy Fitzpatrick knows this from his practice as a solicitor.  I believe if it was contested in court that I would not have the right to mortgage somebody who had a charge against my holding.  The Minister has said that the ACC will be very careful not to use this power.  If they have not the power to give loans I am afraid that quite a number of people will not get them, because in the west of Ireland a lot of people have not got absolute owner-ship of their holdings.  I would like to give the ACC as much power as possible to loan money to those people who want to improve their farms.</P>

I agree fully that land should not be unreasonably starved of capital through red tape and through complicated legal enactments, but I do not believe that I should be able to borrow £25,000 from the ACC on the security of a farm one-third of which is owned by Deputy Callanan just because he happens to be out of the country or does not happen to be knocking on the door, and if I do not pay the ACC that the land can be sold and Deputy Callanan can be robbed of his one-third share in the land.  I do not agree with that.  I do not believe that is constitutional, but that is what we are doing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The equity note covers a lot of possible claims, but there is machinery <Col N="784" /> in the Land Registry for cancelling the equity note and the owners then become absolute.  If, in cancelling the equity note, a mistake is made in the Land Registry and Deputy Callanan is deprived of land he is entitled to I believe he has a right there against the insurance fund.  This is shortcutting all that, and without cancelling the equity note at all I can borrow the money because I am the registered owner subject to equities, on the security of land, a third of which is owned by Deputy Callanan and he can be robbed of that. I do not agree with that.  I believe it is unconstitutional and I believe it will be challenged some day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move : &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill forms one of a trilogy of measures which are intended to give effect to the Government's proposals in the area of landlord and tenant law. The first of those Bills has already been through this House and is now awaiting Second Stage in the Seanad. It proposes a prohibition on the creation of future ground rents of dwelling-houses.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with the problem of existing ground rents.  When these two Bills have been enacted, as I hope they will be before the end of this session, it is my intention to introduce legislation dealing with the many other aspects of the law on landlord and tenant&mdash;apart from ground rents&mdash; which require amendment.  I may add that some of those matters require attention as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Bill which is now before this House, I think it might be useful if I were to deal first with some general issues before coming to the actual contents of the Bill.  Since the Bill was <Col N="787" /> circulated during the recess it has been given a considerable amount of publicity and a number of these issues has been raised.  The one I should like to dispose of first is the question of the Government's undertaking in relation to ground rents.</P>
    <P>In the Fianna Fáil manifesto which was issued before the general election in 1977 it is said in relation to ground rents that the Government would &ldquo;provide a scheme which will lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents&rdquo;.  That statement is perfectly clear.  It has always been clear to me.  The only way in which that clear undertaking might be said to have been altered in any way by me was when I actually enlarged it by promising to introduce the necessary legislation within six months of the Government's assuming office.  It will be evident to any one who takes the trouble to read our undertaking and to study the contents of this Bill that we as a Government are fulfilling our undertaking in accordance with the letter and the spirit.</P>
    <P>I am aware from the debates that took place on the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill, 1977&mdash; which I may call the No. 1 Bill&mdash;when it was before this House in November and December last, that there are those who would like to misconstrue the undertaking in the manifesto.  They would like that undertaking construed as if it were a promise to abolish ground rents directly, leaving landlords either with no compensation or to be compensated by the State.  But of course we never said that.  The record is there for all to see.  If we wanted to promise the abolition of ground rents directly that is precisely what we would have said and, indeed, that is what we did say and do in relation to rates and car tax, for instance.</P>
    <P>Moreover, nothing that I have said in this House or outside it can reasonably be taken as indicating that I, or the Government, favoured abolition in that sense.  On the contrary, I think it fair to say that I went to considerable pains when in opposition to make my <Col N="788" /> position quite clear.  I am on record as having referred to my discussions with the residents associations on this very subject.  I said that they had never suggested that the ground landlord's interest should be taken over without compensation.  Neither did I ever suggest that the State should be responsible for this compensation.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that concentration on the question of compensation tends, to my mind, to cloud the real issues.  I have always been clear that the real problem of ground rents is the problem of legal costs.  If we can solve the problem of legal costs then, I would suggest, we have solved the problem of ground rents.  If we enable tenants to get the fee simple at a fixed nominal charge for the legal work, then we have a scheme which will lead to the abolition of ground rents.  That is what we have in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The State's contribution towards the costs of acquisition as proposed in this Bill is the kernel of the whole scheme. That contribution amounts virtually to undertaking the whole task.  The fees to be charged will be nominal and are the minimum which could be charged so as to avoid purely frivolous applications under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I may be asked if I am saying that the scheme will, in fact, lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  While I have no crystal ball, my answer is that I think it will.  Tenants will not of course be forced by this legislation to acquire the fee simple and to abolish ground rent in that way. That would be both unworkable and wrong in principle to my mind.  What the Bill proposes is to provide strong encouragement for ground rent tenants to exercise their rights.  I feel it will succeed in this for the following reasons.</P>
    <P>I think most people paying ground rents are genuinely interested in becoming full owners&mdash;that is to say, owners of the fee simple&mdash;of their dwelling if they can do so without too much inconvenience and without incurring an unknown but substantial burden of legal costs.  If they are not, then the campaign against ground <Col N="789" /> rents cannot have been representative of the feelings of ordinary house-holders. The terms of this Bill will offer the strongest possible encouragement to them to become full owners for the very simple reason that it offers what I have already referred to elsewhere as the bargain of a lifetime.  I also think that the vast majority of tenants will move quickly and will not put the matter on the long finger because this bargain will be available only for the coming five years or so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should emphasise that this five-year limit is not designed to reduce the State's financial commitment to the scheme. On the contrary, the time limit may well increase that commitment because it will encourage all tenants to avail themselves of the scheme.  There are good practical reasons why tenants from time to time may wish to acquire the fee simple&mdash;that is, of course, apart from the general desire to be the full owner.  It may be a question of needing freedom from covenants.  It may be <Col N="790" /> a question of raising a loan when the lease has less than 50 years to run.  But to wait until these forces operate in the case of all ground leases would not, to my mind, be consistent with a scheme aimed consciously at the abolition of the ground rent system.  The limitation of the State's contribution to a period of five years is designed to introduce the concept of terminating the system&mdash;as far as dwellings are concerned.  I think it will work that way too.</P>
      <P>I should now like to comment briefly on the various provisions of the Bill and in so doing to indicate where the Bill differs from the proposals of my predecessor contained in the Bill which lapsed with the dissolution of the last Dáil.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the classes of tenant who will be entitled to acquire the fee simple in their properties.  Deputies may have seen from the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated in connection with the Bill that this Part of the Bill together with section 26 in Part IV is intended to be a fully comprehensive statement of the classes which are to have this right as well as of the law relating to the determination of a purchase price.  It consolidates the provisions in this area which are at present contained in the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967 and the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1971.  In addition, it provides for new classes of leases and tenancies which are to attract the right to acquire the fee simple in future and it clarifies the law as to the method of determining the maximum price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in this part of the Bill that we must face up to the problem of trying to determine what is a ground rent. Most Deputies will be aware by now that there is no statutory definition of a ground rent.  The essential thing about such a rent in the ordinary way is that it arises in a landlord and tenant relationship where the tenant owns the &ldquo;bricks and mortar&rdquo; interest in the property and, for that reason, the ground rent will tend to be <Col N="791" /> a small rent in relation to the value of the entire property.  At the other end of the scale there is, of course, the concept of occupational rent which is a rent payable when the landlord owns that &ldquo;bricks and mortar&rdquo; interest.  This may appear simple enough at both extremes of the scale. Unfortunately, difficulties do arise in determining whether a rent falls within one class or another in the middle, or grey area.</P>
    <P>The Landlord and Tenant Acts have since 1931 sought to distinguish between those two types of rents and to provide for the rights of the parties involved as appropriate to each type. The Acts did this initially by developing the concepts of a &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; and a &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo; as the types of leases which were taken to reserve a ground rent as distinct from an occupational rent.  The problem was, however, that as time went by these concepts were found to be inadequate to describe all the types of lease which were found to reserve ground rents.  As a result, in the 1958, 1967 and 1971 Acts new types of leases and tenancies had to be added to the concepts already established in 1931.  The result is, to say the least, a somewhat complex body of law.</P>
    <P>The provisions in Part II of the Bill provide, in turn, for the addition of new classes of leases and tenancies which have been identified as ground rent leases and tenancies.  However, the former practice of building on the 1931 Act concepts of &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; and &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo; is now being abandoned.  Instead the Bill sets out all the conditions with which any lease or tenancy must comply if it is to attract the right to acquire the fee simple.  This is of course a very welcome simplification of the law.  I hasten to add that, as far as the substance of Part II of the Bill is concerned, it represents no change as against the provisions which were included in the Bill introduced by my predecessor.  There is, however, one important change of presentation.</P>
    <P>In the previous Bill, which was, of course, a general landlord and tenant Bill as opposed to a ground rents Bill, <Col N="792" /> there was no single comprehensive statement of the classes of leases and tenancies which would attract the right to purchase the fee simple. Instead, there was a list of conditions to apply to leases which would attract the right to obtain a renewal of the lease on termination as well as a list of conditions applicable to yearly tenants who would have the right to acquire the fee simple.  By way of a cross-reference, the lessees who were to have the right to a reversionary lease were also given the right to acquire the fee simple.</P>
    <P>I think it is perhaps fortunate that this Bill, limited as it is to ground rents, could not adopt the same approach and that a new one had to be found.  To my mind, there is a considerable advantage in doing things the way we have them in the present Bill.  For most people the acquisition of the fee simple will be a matter entirely separate from other landlord and tenant rights, particularly in the context of a State-aided scheme.  Very many people who have no great knowledge of the law will find it necessary to check their leases against the provisions of this Bill.  For that reason, it seems to me to be useful that there should be one comprehensive statement of the conditions which must be complied with, and that this should be as simple and readable as it is possible to make it.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I do not propose to go into detail as to the classes which are to have these rights.  Such a discussion would be more appropriate for the Committee stage of the Bill and in that regard, the Explanatory Memorandum which sets out the categories to be newly entitled under the Bill may be of some assistance.  I should like to say, however, that the general intention behind this Part of the Bill is that all known classes of ground rent tenant should be given the right to acquire the fee simple.</P>
    <P>When I say, &ldquo;all known classes&rdquo;, I do not want to give the impression that there is anything arbitrary about proposals to extend the right of purchase to new categories of leases or yearly tenancies.  Such proposals have in the past been made only after the fullest <Col N="793" /> consideration and following thorough investigation.  In recent years this investigation has been done by the Landlord and Tenant Commission and the proposals in this Part are based on their recommendations.  This is only as it should be, since a decision to move a tenancy from one category to another is not only a technically complex matter but one which affects important property rights.</P>
    <P>I should now like to comment on Part III to which I have already referred as containing the kernel of this Bill, that is, the State's contribution to the purchase scheme.  It is, I think, generally agreed that the main reason why people did not avail themselves to a greater extent of their right to purchase the fee simple under the 1967 Act was the legal costs of doing so.  I think it fair to say that this is acknowledged in the approach which my predecessor had adopted in the Bill which lapsed.  The proposals in that Bill to introduce a system of transfer by way of a vesting certificate to be issued by a State authority was intended to deal with the problem of costs.</P>
    <P>There are, however, important differences between the approach adopted in this Bill and that of my predecessor. The most important difference&mdash;and one which is an essential feature of the scheme&mdash;is that we are in this Bill telling the tenant precisely how much it will cost him to get his fee simple. For a transfer by consent the fee will be £5 and no more.  When we were debating the previous Bill we had no idea whatsoever what the intention was with regard to the costs of acquisition. At no stage was the actual fee to be charged mentioned and this was, indeed, to have been left over for determination in the context of regulations to be made after the Bill had passed.  That was not, to my mind, a satisfactory approach.</P>
    <P>There is another important difference between the scheme now proposed and that of the previous Bill.  It is not merely a procedural point that the task of converting leasehold titles into fee simples is being given in the Bill to the Land Registry rather than to County Registrars as was proposed in the previous Bill.  A number of Deputies <Col N="794" /> had voiced serious doubts as to whether a procedure based on County Registrars would work.  My own view was that it could not have worked well.  I can see many problems that could have arisen if this job had been given to 26 different offices around the country.  Of course, this has added significance when we are introducing a scheme which will be widely availed of, as I expect it will.  On the other hand, what we are proposing in this Bill must be, from an objective point of view, more efficient and less expensive in real terms.  I have made all the necessary arrangements to ensure that the Land Registry will be properly equipped to carry out the tasks to be imposed upon it under this legislation and I am fully convinced that there is no other institution of the State which could do it as well.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies will undoubtedly be aware that there have for some time been arrears of work in the Registry and may well ask if the addition of new responsibilities will not exacerbate that position.  While I realise that the ordinary work of the Land Registry is not directly relevant to the Bill, I think I should explain briefly how we propose to deal with the overall situation so that the scheme will be workable&mdash; without adversely affecting the ordinary work of the Registry.  What I have arranged is that there would be a special addition of staff designed specifically to handle the &ldquo;ground rents&rdquo; work.  In addition, other substantial staff increases in the Registry have been authorised to enable the arrears of ordinary work to be disposed of in a reasonably short time.</P>
    <P>There remain two important aspects of this Bill upon which I should like to comment.  The first is the fact that it extends the right to purchase the fee simple to ground rent tenants of local authorities.  The second is the proposal it contains to abolish a landlord's right of re-entry for non-payment of ground rent.</P>
    <P>One of the main criticisms of the Bill which lapsed was that it distinguished unfairly between ground rent tenants in the private sector and those in the public sector.  There were <Col N="795" /> references to making second class citizens of people who had purchased or who were purchasing their own homes from local authorities by way of leases.  Under the present Bill local authority lessees will, for the first time, have the right to acquire the fee simple.  The procedure will be by way of vesting orders to be made under the Housing Act, rather than by way of the Land Registry procedure under the Bill.  The fee payable by the tenant will be £5.</P>
    <P>The remaining point I should like to deal with is the question of the abolition of the landlord's right of re-entry for non-payment of ground rent. Deputies will be aware that leases normally contain a condition that in the event of the rent being in arrears for a specified period, the lessor may re-enter on the lands.  In addition, section 52 of the Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment Act, Ireland, 1860 (Deasy's Act) gives the landlord a right to take an action for ejectment where the tenant allows the rent to run into one year's arrears, even if the time for re-entry provided in the lease has not expired.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms made of the present law is that it gives landlords a security for their rent which is out of all proportion to the size and nature of their interest in the property concerned. There may have been an argument in favour of the extensive power which this enables landlords to wield when they had a real responsibility for good estate management in the interests of all the tenants.  This is no longer so. The protection of the amenities is now a function of planning legislation. It follows that the landlord should no longer have a right to re-enter but should be in the same position as any other creditor.  He should have only a right to sue for the debt owed him. Section 27 of the Bill abolishes the right of re-entry for non-payment of ground rent in the case of a dwelling-house but leaves unaffected the landlord's right to sue for arrears of rent as a civil debt.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to refer once more to the part which the Landlord and Tenant Commission <Col N="796" /> have played in the preparation of this measure.  I have already mentioned the research and consideration which the Commission have devoted to the particular question of determining what classes of lease or tenancy should attract the right to acquire the fee simple.  This is, of course, only one aspect of their work.  The Commission's work will have an even more important bearing on the third Bill&mdash; which will deal with landlord and tenant matters apart from ground rent. I should therefore like to take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to the members of the Commission and their Chairman&mdash;Judge Conroy. They are all busy men whose time is devoted voluntarily to this important service.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Bill dealing with landlord and tenant law is of its nature complex.  In this case the complexities are compounded by the misleading manner in which this Bill is presented as being a scheme leading towards the abolition of ground rents.  The first question that occurs to me is : what has this Bill to do with the abolition of ground rents?  It has nearly as much to do with it as a Bill restricting the import of butterflies from Afghanistan; it has nothing to do with the abolition of ground rents as promised by the Minister and his party.  I once read a book called &ldquo;The Big Lie&rdquo; which dealt with the science of propaganda, and while I should not like to compare the Minister for Justice with Dr. Goebbels it appears that there is a major propaganda exercise being carried out by the Minister and his colleagues to mislead the public into believing that this Bill in fact honours their election commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Black is black and white is white, and the fact that the Minister pretends that the Bill honours the commitment, the fact that Government speakers will continue this pretence inside or outside the House, the fact that 84 pairs of Fianna Fáil feet will troop through the Lobbies in support of this Bill, will <Col N="797" /> not transform its provisions so as to lead to the abolition of ground rents. Very simply, abolition means to do away with.  The word was used very much in the context of the great abolition debate in connection with slavery, but in that case it was properly used because the problem involved was dealt with and slavery was abolished. Here, we have a situation where the Minister produces a Bill which, without going into detail, is a rehash of the Bill produced by the National Coalition before the dissolution of the Dáil.  But the most serious point about it is that he produces it on the basis that it is by way of implementation of a Fianna Fáil commitment, that in effect it is a scheme leading to the abolition of ground rents.  On that basis initially I have to say to the House that the presentation of this Bill has the odour of deceit and dishonesty about it.  It smells of subterfuge and cynicism.  It smells of misrepresentation and fraud.  It amounts to a confidence trick on the public, the press and, most of all, on the thousands of householders whose hopes, aspirations and expectations were raised by Fianna Fáil prior to the election, and these hopes, aspirations and expectations have now been dashed.</P>
    <P>What is the background to the situation? The 1967 Landlord and Tenant Bill gave the tenant the right to purchase his freehold.  Difficulties arose in some cases, particularly where the tenant's immediate landlord did not himself have a freehold title and there was a pyramid of interests leading back to the ultimate freehold owner. Next, the National Coalition produced a Bill last year which provided a simplified procedure.  The tenant had only to apply to the county registrar, lodge the purchase money and he would be issued with a vesting certificate which would be absolute proof of freehold title.  Subsequently&mdash;this is the most important part of the whole business, that it was subsequently&mdash; Fianna Fáil promised to introduce a scheme leading to abolition.  This promise was hawked from door to door by Fianna Fáil canvassers: &ldquo;We are going to abolish your ground rent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="798" /> The Minister is correct in referring to small print in the manifesto.  In some ways I should liken him to the shady salesman selling shoddy goods on the doorstep giving plenty of fast talk&mdash;&ldquo;sign here&rdquo; and so on&mdash;but when trouble arises he refers to the small print.  Even taking the small print and taking the commitment in the context of its full expression in the manifesto this Bill does not in any way measure up to the honouring of that commitment.  We already have the right to acquire.  We have the National Coalition Bill removing the difficulties by appointing the county registrar to handle applications and issue vesting certificates.  In what way is this Bill an advance on the previous procedure?  It changes the system whereby you go to the Registrar of the Land Registry instead of going to the county registrar. How can anybody accept that, this being the only basic change in the Bill, it can lead to the abolition of ground rent?  The National Coalition never pretended or attempted to mislead the public into believing that they were abolishing ground rents or introducing a scheme which would lead to their abolition; they merely said they were simplifying the procedure and, in fact, that is what the Minister is doing and no more.</P>
    <P>As regards the change from county registrar to Land Registry, in many ways it is not important in the context of the major attack which I must make on the Bill, but it is important in the context of the ultimate law of this country.  In many ways the system under the county registrar was a far better system, particularly for those people living outside Dublin city.  I can imagine it would be far easier for a tenant of Lord Bantry in West Cork to deal with the county registrar in Cork than have to deal with the Land Registry in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I must also point out from my own practical experience as a lawyer that the Land Registry at present is totally overworked and as a result of this and also, I think, probably as a result of inadequate accommodation, there are very long delays in the lodging of existing applications in the Land Registry. For example, we have applications <Col N="799" /> under the Registration of Titles Act, 1964 under section 49 where somebody applies by way of a possessory application to the Land Registry to be registered, or somebody is not registered at all applies for first registration. It is my experience that the normal time taken to complete such an application works out, on average, at about 18 months.  This then is the office which is going to solve the problem for ground rent tenants.</P>
    <P>The other major item in regard to the Land Registry to which I must refer concerns the fee payable.  It was referred to by the Minister recently in an interview published in <i>The Sunday Press.</i> a £5 fee, the bargain of the century.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of the fee presently payable in relation to applications to the county registrar under existing legislation; perhaps it would be as well to advise him that the fee, taking into account £1.50 on the application and 50p on the order, is £2.  That is the level of fee presently payable by a tenant resorting to the county registrar under existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I ask : how can changing the system from the county registrar to the Land Registry, even if it is a sensible step &mdash;and there is an area of doubt here&mdash; be construed as leading to the abolition of ground rents?  The Minister knows very well that it will not.  He accepts at this stage that his Bill, apart from fixing an increased fee in the Land Registry over that presently payable to the county registrar, is basically on the same lines as the National Coalition Bill.  It is worth recalling what the present Minister had to say about the National Coalition Bill.  On 23 February, 1977, at column 162 of the Official Report, he stated:</P>
    <P>One of the principal provisions of the Bill as it stands at present is an extension of the role of the county registrar in the operation of the Act.  We see in it the elimination of certain impediments in former legislation and a widening of the scope of the categories who would benefit.  It aims, as the <Col N="800" /> Minister says, at reducing legal costs.  I hope that it will achieve that aim.</P>
    <P>He accepted then that the National Coalition Bill simplified the procedure and would reduce legal costs.  The National Coalition Bill was not presented as having anything to do with abolition, this Bill is, but both Bills are remarkably similar.</P>
    <P>To delve further into the Minister's mind it is worth recalling what he had to say in relation to abolition when dealing with the National Coalition Bill.  On the same date, at column 163 of the Official Report, he stated:</P>
    <P>There is disappointment that the acceptance of the principle of the abolition of existing ground rents is not in the Bill.</P>
    <P>How then can the Minister suggest that a Bill he is now presenting, almost similar to the National Coalition Bill, has the principle of abolition?  He gives the lie to that argument out of his own mouth.  The Minister referred to the manner in which ground rents could be abolished, and I agree with him, they could be abolished only by a system of confiscation or compensation. One addition was suggested by a colleague of the Minister in an earlier debate that could be a scheme which would lead to the abolition of ground rents which would not fit, strictly speaking, under the heading of either confiscation or compensation.  I shall revert to that later.  In relation to confiscation the Constitution provides, in Article 43, for the protection of private property rights.  Therefore it is unconstitutional to terminate a landlord's interest without compensation and any ground rents Bill providing for such would be declared to be unconstitutional by the courts.  Of course the Constitution could be changed by Referendum but it is quite clear that there is no such intention.  Apart from that it is no harm to mention that if such a course of action were suggested the ground rent tenants, who would appear to benefit initially from such a move&mdash;because of the diminution in the rights of private property involved <Col N="801" /> in such a change&mdash;would find that the very thing they were seeking would be lost.  In effect their legitimate aspiration to ownership of their own houses would not be constitutionally guaranteed. This argument is apart altogether from the question of morality of confiscation. On this point, for once, I am in agreement with the Minister.  I do not believe that the question of confiscation can arise either constitutionally or morally.</P>
    <P>Having disposed of the question of confiscation we look at that of compensation. Under this heading I am trying to divine what exactly was promised or proposed by the present administration.  We had already a system whereby ground lessees could purchase by paying a certain sum to the landlord.  The Coalition, while not in any way pretending that the 1977 Bill would abolish existing residential ground rents, provided a cheap and effective way of purchase by house-holders. The Fianna Fáil commitment, made subsequently, was to introduce a scheme leading to the complete abolition of existing ground rents; in other words, according to the dictionary definition, do away with them.</P>
    <P>The only reasonable interpretation to be drawn from this commitment is that the Government, either by way of providing compensation or through some other scheme, would appreciably improve the situation as it obtained under the National Coalition Bill; in fact, as a result of this scheme, we would have the cessation of ground rents.  In no way can this Bill be interpreted as leading to that end.  Therefore it seems clear to me at this stage that Fianna Fáil never had the intention of providing compensation. It seems clear further that they never had any intention of producing any other scheme.  Therefore the only conclusion I can reach is that Fianna Fáil deliberately deceived the electorate on this point.</P>
    <P>If there is any doubt about the deception we can go back further to delve into the Fianna Fáil minds.  Here we have further proof of Fianna Fáil's duplicity in the matter by referring to speeches made on the Ground Rent Motion in the House on 9 December, <Col N="802" /> 1975.  On that date, at column 1123 of the Official Report, Deputy Collins, then spokesman for the Opposition, said:</P>
    <P>It is part of the Fianna Fáil package in relation to the ordinary householder that not only should he be relieved of the burden of rates but also of ground rents.</P>
    <P>Later in the same column he had this to say :</P>
    <P>We are absolutely in favour of the total abolition of ground rents, but we are acutely aware that this could cause constitutional problems and that by doing away with one injustice you might be creating another.</P>
    <P>At that stage the Minister was totally aware of the problems involved but still was committed to total abolition which, to any reasonable person, would indicate that he had a scheme in mind at the time, or was working on one, which would lead to such abolition.  In the same debate his colleague, Deputy Ray Burke, now Minister of State, developed the argument somewhat further when he said, at column 1358 of the Official Report :</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to ensure that something will be included in the new legislation to reduce drastically the legal fees involved in the purchase of ground rents.  Even if that were done you still do not grasp the nettle.</P>
    <P>We have heard that expression before somewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the abolition of existing ground rents.  That will remain until some Government decide to abolish them by some method and until then you will have legitimate agitation and bad feeling about the payment of this barren tax.</P>
    <P>At that stage the Minister's colleague had in mind that some scheme other than simplifying the procedure and reducing the cost would be necessary to lead to the abolition of ground rents.  At that time the Minister's colleague made a suggestion which was worthy of consideration.  I wonder if it has ever been given consideration <Col N="803" /> since then.  On 10 December 1975, at column 1359 of the Official Report, Deputy Ray Burke said:</P>
    <P>But some Government must produce a solution to the constitutional difficulty. This Government have a responsibility to use all the legal expertise available to them in the civil service and courts to devise a scheme that will get around this constitutional difficulty.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>It could be done in many ways, and one way we have suggested is by the setting up of a board similar to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>At that stage there were ideas floating around as to how it might be done. What is clear from the foregoing is that Fianna Fáil gave a commitment on ground rent abolition which they have no intention of honouring.  Even worse, they have the gall to pretend that in some way this Bill measures up to that commitment.  It is patently obvious that this is not so.  I urge the Minister to cut out the humbug and indicate either that the election commitment will be honoured and the Bill amended accordingly or face the public and say that he cannot or will not honour that commitment.</P>
    <P>As Opposition spokesman it is not for me to say how it can be done, but it could be achieved by doing it as most householders thought and expected it would be done, by way of compensation being paid by the State.  If the Minister was not willing to do that he has further precedent&mdash;something along the lines suggested by his colleague when speaking on the 1975 motion.</P>
    <P>The system of agricultural tenancies was abolished, and the abolition was achieved by the 1923 Land Act.  Very simply this was done by way of the compulsory taking over of the landlord interest by the State on payment of land bonds, the vesting of the free-hold interest in the tenant subject to an annuity, with the proviso that that annuity, which was far less than the rent, would terminate after a number <Col N="804" /> of years.  Therefore the Minister had a precedent for a system.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was serious about honouring his commitment, a similar system could be devised and possibly administered by the Land Commission, that is, payment for the landlords by way of ground rent bonds and vesting freehold in the tenants subject to an annuity which would terminate after a short number of years.  I looked in vain in this Bill for any scheme of this nature or anything which would resemble such a scheme and failed to find anything like that.</P>
    <P>Before coming to the Bill proper there is another aspect to which I would like to refer at this stage&mdash;the question of the cost of the purchase. Let us not forget that the basic cost to the tenants relates to the number of years' purchase he has to pay on his ground rent.  This has not been materially altered except to his detriment, which I will come to in a moment.  To understand the situation one has to look at the procedure under the 1967 Act.  The right to purchase was there. The cost of the purchase, that is the number of years purchase of the rent which I referred to as the multiplier, arose in certain fixed instances.  In most cases, and this applies to the majority of modern residential ground rents, the price should not exceed the amount which if invested at the date of purchase in the most recent Government long term loan would give a gross annual return equal to the amount of the ground rent.  In simple terms, you take the interest rate on the last long term national loan, divide it into 100 and you get the multiplier.</P>
    <P>This system has not been changed. The basis on which the amount is computed is also included in this Bill.  A rather unusual thing has happened, and is worthy of mention.  If a householder bought last year under this provision, the multiplier would be about 7½.  This was related to the 13 per cent finance stock, which was the last national loan. What is the position today?  Last Friday we had a new long term national loan introduced at 11½ per cent.  What is the effect of this?  The multiplier is increased to approximately <Col N="805" /> 8½ years purchase.  We now have the ironic situation, admittedly not totally related to this Bill but related to the interest rate on the most recent national loan, that if the National Coalition Bill had been passed last year, and if somebody had bought then, it would have been cheaper for him to do so than it will be under this Bill.  The increase in the purchase money is of the order of 13 per cent as between 1978 and 1977. That is some way to lead to abolition.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is relevant to look at a simple comparison between the tenant buying out in 1977 had the National Coalition Bill gone through and the tenant buying out in 1978 under this Bill.  Under the Coalition Bill the tenant lodging his money with the county registrar would have paid approximately 7½ years purchase on his ground rent plus, unless there had been an alteration in the fee scale in the circuit office, a sum of £2 in Circuit Court fees.  If he wanted to employ a solicitor he would have paid solicitor's fees, which would have been at a low rate because of the simple procedure involved.</P>
    <P>What is the position in 1978 under the Fianna Fáil Bill?  The tenant will be paying 8½ years purchase, £5 fee to the Land Registry and the same legal costs, because the same simple procedure is outlined in this Bill.  I accept that this is a simple procedure. Why should it not be?  It was modelled on the Coalition Bill.  We now find, it is easy to argue, that a person buying out under the Fianna Fáil Bill in 1978 would be paying more than he would have paid last year had the National Coalition Bill gone through.</P>
    <P>These points are arguable.  The Minister can justify, pointing to international factors which caused a fall in interest rates to explain the increased purchase money.  I accept that would be a good point, but he has been pretending he would abolish ground rents and it was up to him to deal with this factor.</P>
    <P>Summing up the Bill, Fianna Fáil promised to introduce a scheme leading to the abolition of existing ground <Col N="806" /> rents.  It is beyond dispute that this Bill does nothing to implement that promise.  Under the 1967 Act the tenant already had the right to purchase. The National Coalition's Bill simplified the procedure.  Subsequently Fianna Fáil made their famous promise.  It is interesting to look at the leaflet handed out by ACRA prior to the election.  According to that leaflet, ACRA considered that the National Coalition's Bill would have done very little to end the ground rents system. I accept that point.  It would not have abolished ground rents.  It would have helped to simplify the procedure, but it did not pretend to lead towards the abolition of ground rents.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was spokesman on justice for Fianna Fáil he said he wished to state that, on being returned to office, Fianna Fáil would provide a scheme which would lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  He said he was prepared to commit his party to introduce the necessary legislation within six months of becoming the Government.  ACRA urged people to read the leaflet and judge the facts for themselves before they cast their votes in the election and to make sure their vote was a vote to end the ground rents system.  God help the poor householder who thinks this Bill will end this system.</P>
    <P>I want to look at the Bill in a general way now.  There are a number of points I will be raising with the Minister on Committee Stage.  I am glad the Minister, who is attempting to mislead everybody, has had the sense of propriety not to include in the long title to the Bill any suggestion that it will lead to the abolition of ground rents.  I commend him for that. Section 4 provides that the Act shall not bind a Minister of the Government, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland or the Irish Land Commission.  It is interesting to refer back to what the Minister had to say in this regard on 23 February 1977. As reported at column 165 of the Official Report he said:</P>
    <P>Whereas on the one hand the State is being protected as a tenant, on the other hand the State is not <Col N="807" /> giving the same protection to its own tenants.  It protects itself as a tenant, but its tenants are not protected.  If I am wrong perhaps the Minister will correct me, but if I am right perhaps he will say why the State's tenants should be excluded from the protection of the Bill.</P>
    <P>If I am wrong perhaps the Minister will tell me why the State's tenants should be excluded from the protection of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill can be criticised on one other score, although the Minister points to this as a fact in favour of the Bill.  I would not argue with him too much about it.  The Bill has limited terms of reference in that it deals only with ground rents.  The Minister accepts that there are considerable problems in the landlord and tenant field particularly following the Byrne and Loftus decision in the Supreme Court.  There is the problem of business tenants whose leases have expired and who are seeking renewals.  The National Coalition dealt in one Bill with three items, the trilogy to which the Minister referred in his opening statement&mdash;future ground rents, existing residential ground rents and general landlord and tenant reform.  The Minister seems to make it as an excellent point in favour of Fianna Fáil that they are being dealt with in three Bills.  I will not fall out with him over that.</P>
    <P>Let us have the three Bills.  Where is the Bill dealing with general landlord and tenant reform?  The result of tackling the problem in this way is that the National Coalition measure covering the three points fell on the dissolution of the Dáil and has been gone for almost a year and major landlord and tenant reform has been put in abeyance.  I appreciate that there are pressures on the Minister, but the Bill dealing with future and existing ground rents is largely a rehash of the National Coalition's measure.  I would ask the Minister to produce another rehash as quickly as he can to cover general landlord and tenant reform not have these measures in one There is no reason why we should <Col N="808" /> general Bill, or by the reintroduction of the National Coalition's Bill, or in three separate Bills before the Dáil very quickly.  All the ground work has been done, and further delay will cause further problems in the landlord and tenant field.</P>
    <P>I will not go into detail on the various sections of the Bill.  People have been in touch with me about the definition of subsidiary and ancillary. There are people who have dwelling houses on land which might not be considered totally subsidiary or ancillary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that details on the sections should be left to Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is reasonable. I will be coming back to the Minister on that point.  There is one important aspect I want to refer to the Minister at this stage.  It might involve some recasting of the Bill in view of the change from the county registrar to the Land Registry.  It might seem a technical point, but I want to refer it to the Minister and his officials. Section 8 replaces section 3 of the 1967 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that apart from the sections of the 1967 Act which are repealed and which are referred to in section 7 of the new Bill, the jurisdiction and procedure under the 1967 Act for acquisition of the fee simple and arbitration by the county registrar have been left intact.  As a result of this there is one fundamental matter that needs clarification.  Part II of the Bill extends and restates in new terms the heads of qualification to acquire the fee simple.  There are references throughout Part II to &ldquo;the arbitrator&rdquo; but there is no statement as to whether the arbitrator is to be the county registrar or the registrar of titles. Section 21 (3) of Part III of the Bill indicates clearly that the registrar of titles is for all purposes the arbitrator under that part in substitution for the county registrar and section 21 clearly indicates he will be arbitrating in relation to claims by persons entitled to acquire the fee simple by virtue of <Col N="809" /> Part II.  It is clear from section 17 (1) that the termination of the purchase price of the fee simple by arbitration under the 1967 Act or under this Bill is to be handled by the registrar of titles rather than the county registrar. It is curious, therefore, that in the sections dealing with the purchase of the fee simple down to section 17 it is not very clear if this is to be the case, that the registrar of titles is to have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of determination of the right to acquire the fee simple under Part II, leaving the county registrar with his jurisdiction to determine the right to acquire fee simple under the 1967 Act.  That point is rather complex but it is worth referring to at this stage so that it may be considered.  There seems to be a possibility of duplication or crossing of jurisdiction under Part II unless this point is clarified.</P>
    <P>I have little fault with other aspects of the Bill apart from some details.  It is generally a rehash of the provisions of the National Coalition measure dealing with the purchase of existing ground rents.  I am glad to see the Minister has retained the issue of the vesting certificates.  The very words of the present section are similar to the provisions of section 73 of the National Coalition measure dealing with the issue of a vesting certificate by the Land Registry instead of the county registrar.  As has been suggested by the Chair, it would be right to defer detailed comment on the complex points in the Bill until Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In the main my criticism is not with the form of the Bill.  I approved of the measures in the National Coalition Bill, of which this is a rehash.  My criticisms must be with regard to the manner in which the Bill was presented. It is altogether wrong and misleading to suggest that this Bill has anything to do with the abolition of ground rents, and on that basis I make my main criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject matter of this Bill has been rarely out of the public mind in recent years.  It has given rise to considerable agitation.  It is an emotive subject and it arouses <Col N="810" /> strong feelings of resentment in those who are the victims of the system and in those who have a strong social conscience on the subject.  For many it represents an expression of the divide that exists between the haves and the have-nots in our society, between the landed, whether native or alien, and the men and women of no property.</P>
      <P>So far as the Labour Party are concerned, we have long been opposed in principle to a system under which an individual is forced to pay year after year a rent for the site on which his house is built without ever getting nearer to ownership of that site.  Our opposition to that system is on record. As far back as 1961, a Labour Deputy, the late Seán Dunne, sought leave to introduce a Bill that would do what was proposed in the Bill that passed this House before Christmas, namely, to make illegal the creation of new ground rents.  Needless to say he was refused leave to introduce that Bill.  He probably would have been realistic enough to realise that it would have taken 16 or 17 years for people in control of this House to catch up with his thinking on that occasion.  To say the least, he was 17 years before his time on that issue.</P>
      <P>During the past week I have read an editorial comment in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> that the Bill that was passed by the Dáil before Christmas and the current Bill before the House were the only efforts at social reform which this Government have made since they came to office, or which they are likely to make in the near future.  If that is so it is a poor reflection on the Government. The Bill that passed through this House before Christmas made provision only for enactment of part of the Bill that was before us at the time of dissolution of the last Dáil. On the Minister's own admission the current Bill is just another instalment of that, with a few changes.  Perhaps those changes are for the better and are made as a result of the discussions that took place.  Nevertheless this Bill is not one that we consider ideal. It is not what we hoped for, it is not what the tenants, their various organisations and the public generally, expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> We do not believe that the Government are great social reformers, but there was an unequivocal commitment given by Fianna Fáil to provide for the abolition of ground rents.  Deputy O'Keeffe made that point most ably, but it must be repeated by anyone who wishes to speak on this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the section dealing with local government in the Fianna Fáil manifesto there are 11 paragraphs.  Paragraph 9 is headed and underlined &ldquo;Ground Rents&rdquo; and it states that Fianna Fáil will provide a scheme that will lead to the abolition of existing ground rents.  Fianna Fáil spokesmen were adamant about this matter during the election campaign; they would abolish ground rents, without qualification or modification.  There were specific statements on every platform where this matter was raised&mdash;in effect on every platform in the country.  The words were not recorded and we cannot harness them now but I do not think we need to at this stage.  We can refer to the clear commitment given in the manifesto.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us the position is clear but it is not clear to anybody else.  It cannot be said that this Bill provides for the implementation of the Fianna Fáil promise.  It provides for a less expensive and simpler method by which tenants can purchase ground rents and it brings in other categories of tenants, but nobody can say it will lead to the abolition of existing ground rents.  It will not do that, because the onus will be on the lessee to take the initative.</P>
    <P>Although it will be optional for a lessee to avail of the scheme many who would like to do so may not have the money to purchase their ground rents, so it is impossible for anyone to predict the extent to which the scheme will be available.  During a radio interview on Sunday last a spokesman for the Department of Justice said that numerous inquiries had been made about the scheme and that residents associations wished to buy their ground rents in block.  Even in that sort of situation I am sure that some people could not afford to purchase. On the other hand, there are bound <Col N="812" /> to be some people who will not want to avail of the scheme, but at least they have a choice.  There is no choice for the person who cannot afford to avail of the scheme.  Consequently, ground rents as such will remain.</P>
    <P>In their sub-committee report, dated 14 December, 1977, ACRA demanded as their sixteenth point, that any scheme introduced by the Government in fulfilment of their promise to abolish existing ground rents should be compulsory so that ground rents would vanish forever.  There is some justification for that request.  I take the association's point that to enact legislation of the kind that we enacted here before Christmas in regard to this issue is to recognise that ground rents are wrong, that they impose a hardship and an injustice on those who pay them.  That point having been recognised, it should have been carried forward into this Bill by providing for the ending by compulsion of existing contracts for the payment of ground rents at least in so far as these apply to owner-occupied residences and properties.  It may not have been a simple matter to have implemented such a measure in the last Bill, but there has been commitment to such a provision and given the will this could be implemented.</P>
    <P>About this time last year the Minister, then in opposition, expressed his disappointment regarding the omission in the Bill introduced by the then Minister for the abolition of ground rents. At that time Deputy Collins quoted two of the then Ministers, neither of whom was Minister for Justice, on the subject of ground rents.  He quoted one of these Ministers as having said that ground rents were a medievel anachronism and constituted a private tax by the wealthy on the poor.  I agree with that.  Deputy Collins quoted the other Minister as having said that ground rents were an abomination.  I agree with that, too.  He went on to say that those two Ministers were expected by those interested to devise a scheme for the abolition of ground rents.</P>
    <P>The Minister will surely pardon us for issuing the same challenge to him now.  He holds the relevant portfolio. <Col N="813" /> When speaking on the subject last year he did not confine himself merely to referring to ground rents as being anachronistic and abominable but added that in office he would introduce a scheme that would lead to their abolition.  What we have here is essentially the same Bill as that of which the Minister was so critical at that time.  It was after the then Deputy Collins had become aware fully of what that other Bill contained that he gave his commitment not only in the manifesto but in a letter to ACRA that led people to believe that in power his party would do something far more radical in this regard.  Therefore he stands charged, as Deputy O'Keeffe has said, of having misled the people on this subject.</P>
    <P>There is a five-year limit on the application of this Bill so far as residential ground rents are concerned. There would be some credibility in what was promised if, instead of providing for this five-year limit the Minister were to say simply that five years from now ground rents will cease.</P>
    <P>From the tenants' viewpoint they have paid many times over for the land on which their houses are built.  There are exceptions, and I referred to those while speaking on the occasion of the previous Bill.  Some of the people collecting ground rents have inherited them, so that they have not had to put any energy or thought into this source of income.  Perhaps the obsession with property rights has not gripped this party to the same extent as has happened among others, but I would ask those who are most jealous of property rights and who are afraid to implement a scheme that would lead to the abolition of ground rents for fear of opening the door to all sorts of take-overs by the State if they can instance any other case of property rights comparable with this one.  Can it be just or equitable that the property rights of some individuals extend to the point where they encroach on the homes of others?  ACRA quoted, and with relevance, from the Constitution in support of their case, and made the point that ground rents may not be constitutional.  They quote paragraph 2. 1º of Article 43 which reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" />  The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2. 2º of the same article puts the State's duty even more emphatically.  It reads:</P>
    <P>The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>If there is any case for delimiting those rights, surely the ground rents area is such.  I do not presume, however to be able to interpret the Constitution, but those who have expertise in that area have expressed the view that to delimit rights in this way would be unconstitutional.  If that is so the option open to the Minister was to have sought an amendment of the constitutional provision.  I am sure he had ample support from his own benches to have proceeded in this way, and I do not think that the people on these benches would have been unsympathetic either in regard to any such move.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is a consolation to a non-legal person like me to find the experts saying that the Bill is complex and difficult and that some aspects of it can be dealt with only in a general way.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill deals with definitions, regulations, restrictions, expenses and repeals.  A residence is defined as a dwelling that does not include a separate or self-contained flat.  We had an argument on this question during the Second Stage debate on the other Bill and I recall the Minister telling us that he had an open mind in this regard.  I do not think the matter was ever finalised.  That Bill has not yet passed through Seanad Éireann.  Perhaps when he is replying the Minister will tell us whether he has had any new thinking on the definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;.  If at all possible the definition should be extended to include a self-contained flat.  There are restrictions on the application to the State of the provisions of the Bill.  I find no fault with that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> I look on the State as the custodian of the common good and I would not equate the State with the private landlord in this regard.  The State is subject to pressures to which the private landlord would not be subject. The present Minister had very strong views on this when he was in Opposition and I would ask him what it was that changed those views.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill sets out the classes of persons entitled to purchase, residential and otherwise.  The Memorandum makes the point that it sets out to implement the recommendations of the Second Report of the Landlord and Tenant Commission extending the right to purchase to new classes of tenants and to local authority tenants. In so far as we can accept the Bill as it is, I welcome this as an improvement on the previous Bill.  It was an omission in that Bill which, I feel, would have been corrected by an amendment on Committee Stage had we discussed it.  It is a welcome improvement, and I give credit where it is due.</P>
    <P>Section 8 sets out the general right to acquire the fee simple and the following sections state the conditions which attract that right.  As public representatives we have all received representations on this matter which we have passed on to the Minister.  As someone who has no expertise in this area, I should like to have defined exactly what &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; and &ldquo;ancillary&rdquo; mean.  Is there such a thing as maximum ground rent?  Is it subsidiary or ancillary to a house or is it subject to a loose interpretation?</P>
    <P>There is another point in the alternative conditions which the subsequent section lays down.  There is the question of a lease being for a term of 50 years.  This confuses me somewhat, though possibly it is a simple matter. It is stated that the rent reserved must be for an amount which is less than the rateable valuation.  I hope that someone will tell me why this is so.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is welcome in that it deals with expired leases.  It extends the right to purchase for one year after the coming into operation of the Act to persons whose lease has expired <Col N="816" /> and who would have the right to purchase anyway but for the fact that the lease has expired up to eight years before the commencement of the Act.  We all know of cases of this nature and it is the type of case which often comes to the notice of a public representative in the course of his or her duties. Most of us will welcome this provision. Often landlords will not entertain the idea of a renewal of tenancy and this places the tenant in a very difficult and precarious position.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with the purchase price and all the factors which will be taken into account in determining the purchase price.  Section 17 (2) (b) states:</P>
    <P>where the land was held by the person acquiring the fee simple under a lease which has expired or is held by him under a lease which will expire less than twenty-five years after the date of the service of the notice under section 4 of the Act of 1967 or of the application under Part III of this Act, the rent which, in the opinion of the arbittrator, would be reserved by a reversionary lease under the Act of 1958 of the land granted for a term commencing on the expiration of the first-mentioned lease.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that in some cases the purchase price will be greater than the tenant may have expected.  Deputy O'Keeffe made the point that it will be greater by virtue of the fact that interest rates are down.  This is another aspect which will make the purchase price for many tenants higher than they would have expected.  Section 17 (3) indicates how this would graduate depending on what remains of the 25 years mentioned.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the current interest yields on Government loans.  ACRA were critical of this and made the point that they did not agree with a system related to a national loan.  This is fundamental to the whole question of compensation and whether we think it is warranted to the extent of providing a substitute or alternative income in perpetuity for those who would lose the annual income provided by ground rents through the coming into operation of this Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> There is in section 17 (2) (g) a point which I found very amusing in reading through the speeches made when the Coalition Bill was before the House.  It relates to the cost and expenses of the lessor in investing money.  The present Minister waxed very wittily on this.  He pictured himself as the lessee and the then Minister as the lessor going off to invest his money and he being responsible for the cost of transport and other expenses.  It makes pleasant reading.  I should like to know whether the Minister was misinformed then or what has changed his mind on that score.  It does not seem fair that this expense should be taken into acount in determining the price.  The present Minister made a very good suggestion at that time when he said that there should be recognition of the number of years for which the tenant had been paying ground rent.  If this were taken into account it could lead to a situation where the purchase price might be nil.  From the tenants' point of view this appears to be a very relevant point.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the position of people who have paid a site fine and whether credit is given under the Bill for this.  There is also the matter of the failure of landlords to develop estates and provide amenities which they had covenanted to provide.  This should be reflected in the price, if price there has to be.</P>
    <P>There is the common problem of the ground landlords who cannot be traced.  This could be a difficult problem, and there must be some cases where they cannot be traced. Does the property revert to the State and, if so, has the tenant the right to purchase?  This is a point which needs mention.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the duration of the provisions.  It is applicable only to applications made within five years of the commencement of the Act.  I see that people are entitled to acquire the fee simple in a dwellinghouse by virtue of Part II and to do so they may apply to the Registrar of Titles.</P>
    <P>Section 20 deals with vesting by consent and section 21 deals with vesting by means of arbitration where there is <Col N="818" /> not consent.  The references to the county registrar in the 1967 Act are substituted by reference to &ldquo;Registrar of Titles&rdquo;.  This will provide for the registration of title under the Registration of Title Act, 1964.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister says the fees are very reasonable.  I am not in a position to argue whether they are more reasonable than those charged hitherto.  I would like to know from the Minister how the fee of £5 was arrived at for the issue of a vesting certificate where the applicant is in occupation of the dwellinghouse.  What steps did the Minister take to ascertain this was the correct fee?  How was the £12 arrived at in the case of an arbitration?</P>
    <P>Section 23 (2) provides:</P>
    <P>The Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may by order fix the fees to be taken in the Land Registry for the purposes of this Part, other than the fees mentioned in subsection (1), and may revoke or amend any such order.</P>
    <P>Is it possible all the necessary homework has not been done?  Could these fees be altered or will they stand for the duration of the Bill?  It seems to me that under this provision they could be upped at any time.  Fees and prices unfortunately do not go down. If they can be altered with the consent of the Minister for Finance it is difficult to know what we are legislating here in regard to fees.</P>
    <P>I am concerned like others that the facilities and staff available in the Land Registry may not be sufficient to cope with the work this Bill will impose. This is a legitimate worry and I hope the Minister will assure us he has taken steps to ensure staffing arrangements and facilities will be adequate. In my experience the existing staff are most courteous and helpful.  There is a backlog and unless staff and facilities are increased the office could not cope with the increased volume of work this Bill will impose.</P>
    <P>Section 27 removes the right of eviction in regard to those entitled to acquire the fee simple.  Any covenant giving the lessor the right to take possession where rent is in arrear shall <Col N="819" /> not be enforceable.  That is fair enough. It is time that right was removed.  It is a right given under section 52 of the Tenant Law (Amendment) Act of Ireland, 1860.  The provision is not being repealed before its time.  This is a welcome reform.  Unfortunately re-form comes slowly, very slowly indeed, in the area of ground rents. Where property rights are involved a great deal more reform is needed. This Bill is by no means the implementation of the promise made by Fianna Fáil in the last election and does not fulfil their commitment to abolish ground rents.  I trust this Bill is not the final step and I hope the law will be further amended so that justice will be given to the many people who have been victims of this vicious system down through the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this very important Bill and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it so speedily. I am disappointed the Opposition speakers have not been vocal in praise of the new features in the Bill, features designed to lead to the ending of ground rents.  I have no doubt that this Bill will in a short time lead to the removal of existing ground rents. I would like to hear in this House calls on the residents' and tenants' associations to implement this measure through their negotiating procedures. They have here a framework which will enable them to do for their members the kind of deals and make the kind of arrangements which will facilitate the speedy and early removal of existing ground rents.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill so speedily before the House.  He has now introduced in two separate measures new legislation which was urgently requested by the people and urgently required by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first measure passed by the House has prohibited the creation of future ground rents and this Bill will ensure that tenants can avail of its provisions to buy out existing ground rents and I am certain tenants will be quite happy to do that.  I have worked with these people for a number of years.  I know what their problems are and I know they will welcome this <Col N="820" /> Bill.  I say that with every confidence having worked with them at grass-roots level.  People want things to be done for them but they also realise the Minister must act within the framework of the Constitution.  In this measure the Minister very skilfully proposes provisions meeting constitutional requirements in the abolition of existing ground rents.  I congratulate the Minister on implementing the manifesto promise made so clearly and so unequivocally.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe made a number of criticisms in this respect.  So did the Labour Party.  In June 1977, prior to the election, ACRA said in response to requests: &ldquo;As a result of our efforts on your behalf the following situation has emerged.  Coalition: Fine Gael&mdash; Labour: the introduction of the Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1977, first promised in 1973.  That Bill, to which ACRA proposes 40 amendments, would have done very little to end the ground rents system.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> This the Minister has done because people asked him to do it.  His party formed a Government and the Minister has done what he promised within a period of six months.  I congratulate him on the speed of his action and the type of action which he has taken.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe has also voiced another criticism.  He has said that if the Coalition had gone ahead with their Bill it would have been cheaper for those who had been buying out their ground rents.  If we had all done the things we should have done at the time they would have been cheaper.  If you did things sooner than later in a period of inflation they would be cheaper, but this can hardly be used as a criticism of the Fianna Fáil Government, that the Coalition did not do what they could and should have done when they could and should have done it.</P>

      <P>On 6 June 1974, before the local elections, the Coalition issued the following statement as a press release from the Department of Justice:</P>
      <P>The following statement has been issued by the Government Information Services on behalf of the Department of Justice: At their meeting on 6 June 1974 the Government decided that legislation should be prepared on the basis of proposals that had been submitted by the Minister for Justice, Mr. Patrick Cooney, TD, on the subject of ground rents.  Accordingly, the Minister intends to introduce legislation as soon as possible which will contain a provision to prohibit the creation of future ground rents.</P>
      <P>The Government was also concerned with the difficulties regarding title and legal costs being experienced by persons wishing to buy out their ground rents under the 1967 Ground Rents Act and will seek to include proposals in the new legislation to ameliorate these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In coming to their decision the Government took cognisance of the <Col N="822" /> view expressed in the Ground Rents Commission Report of 1964 in favour of a prohibition on the creation of future ground rents.  An extension of the right to purchase ground rents is also under consideration.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe that if the Coalition had acted when they said they would act it would have been cheaper.  Everything would have been cheaper if it was done at that time.  Obviously, there was some lack of will in relation to this action.  Even when the Bill was ultimately brought before Dáil Éireann at the beginning of last year it was quickly removed because there was disagreement about its contents.  It did not come back before the House was dissolved in the middle of May.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe's criticism is hypocritical and I, as a reasonable person, would not accept it as a reasonable criticism of the Minister, especially a criticism of the Minister who said that within six months he would cover both aspects of the Bill in abolishing future ground rents and in providing a scheme for the abolition of ground rents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point made by Deputy O'Keeffe related to the price.  He is trying to raise the issue of price and trying to claim that the price will grow suddenly as a result of this Bill.  It is obvious that he is oversimplifying the question of price.  Deputy Mrs. Desmond also referred to the price being tied to the current market price of the most recent national loan or that type of security.</P>
      <P>The first point that must be made is that the device of tying the price to the most recent national loan type of security, as set out in section 17, clarifies the maximum purchase price.  It puts a ceiling on the purchase price. It does not say that the purchase price should be the equivalent of a particular national loan type of security or the current market value of that type of security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It has the same wording as the 1967 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="823" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It does say that the price should not exceed such an equivalent. In addition, one must consider the fact that ground rents cost money to collect and that tax must be paid on them.  They are not as valuable an asset as they used to be.  I have no doubt that this legislation will pass through the House because the people have put 84 Fianna Fáil Deputies here to see that it does.  The Deputies opposite know in their hearts that ground rents are dead in market value. The present value of ground rents is not near the maximum purchase price. I believe the Minister has provided a scheme which will lead to the abolition of existing ground rents.</P>
      <P>The question of price is one that can be thrown up readily and often to confuse people.  The market value is the price which one has to consider.  In considering the market value it becomes a matter of negotiation and discussion. This is why I would call on the residents' and tenants' associations to bring their combined strength to bear on the negotiations to ensure that those who are reluctant to depart from the maximum price will come to a reasonable market value for ground rents which in business terms is considerably below the maximum price to which the Deputies referred.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I welcome the measures in this Bill.  It contains some new features which are important to ordinary people.  For instance, the procedural methodology has been simplified. Applications will be determined by one single authority, that is the Registrar of Titles, and this will compare with the previous Bill which would have introduced a variety of county registrars, each acting individually in relation to ground rents. It is a better procedure and one that will lead to a simpler and speedier removal of ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the significant extension of the right of purchase.  It is in the Bill in a variety of ways, but I particularly welcome the extension of the Bill to include the purchasers of local authority houses.  It has often been said that purchasers of local authority houses have been treated as second class citizens, and I am glad <Col N="824" /> that the Minister gives them the absolute rights which apply to other citizens who are purchasing their residences.  In that sense, it is over a hundred years since Michael Davitt gave that type of authority to the tenant farmers.  I am sure our Minister will go down in history as the man who gave this right of purchase to the tenants of our local authority houses. It is a significant step and one at which the Opposition may now smile, but I am surprised that they are not weeping bitter tears because they had neither the courage nor the consensus to continue what many of their members must have suggested was the right thing for them to do: remove this problem of ground rents.</P>
    <P>Another feature which I welcome is the retrospective element of eight years. That is very important for those caught in the situation where their lease has expired over this period.  That is welcome from the point of view of the residents.  One of the most important aspects of the Bill, and one which will have considerable effect on the market value of a house, is the abolition of the right of the landlord to evict.  I suppose I should not be surprised if the Opposition have little understanding of practical business market values particularly when one considers the state they left our country in before they surrendered the reins of office. The landlord will no longer have the right to evict, he can only pursue for damages and that will not be a particularly rewarding, interesting or exciting venture for a landlord.  It will have the effect of making landlords negotiate fair and reasonable deals with residents.</P>
    <P>We all know of the many cases which have been going through the courts as a result of long delays caused by the National Coalition on this question. The thousands of people waiting for a court decision will thank the Minister for being decisive and clear-cut in removing this right of landlords. If there is a conflict in future there is no way the dreaded word, eviction, can be used.  I also welcome the fixed legal fees, £5 for ordinary cases and £12 where negotiations take place, a provision which did not exist in any <Col N="825" /> previous draft legislation.  I believe people look for a reasonable, negotiated price in purchasing their ground rent and, in addition, reasonable, fixed legal fees.  I am sure many house-holders will rejoice once they realise the implications in this Bill for them.</P>
    <P>Another important feature is that there will now be simplified procedures where there is no agreement as to the purchase price.  I note that the lessee is only required to serve notice on the immediate lessor.  The Bill provides for 95 per cent of our population who can quite readily under these measures buy out their existing ground rents but I would be obliged if the Minister would consider hardship cases that might arise.  I would be obliged if he would consider cases where people are unemployed, the cases of widows, pensioners or those suffering hardship.  He should make a special provision for such people.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for ordinary tenants and residents the framework and the simplified basis under which they can buy out their existing ground rents at what I am sure will be reasonable costs.  It is up to the residents and the tenants' associations and individuals to negotiate purchasing deals at a firm marked value.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill and I hope it will be given a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House because I agree with the Bill generally.  By and large it contains what the National Coalition had in their comprehensive Bill.  The Bill contains a number of changes, one of which gives local authority tenants the right to purchase their fee simple.  That would have been contained in the Bill introduced by the last Government before debate on it concluded in the House.  It was not my intention to speak on this Bill because I am anxious to see such legislation given a speedy passage but one must contribute when one realises that promises have been broken.  Fianna Fáil before the last election made it clear that rents would be abolished.  After the election they announced that they would introduce a Bill to do away with new ground rents and implied that another Bill would <Col N="826" /> follow abolishing existing ground rents. The Minister mentioned this and sought to make it clear by quoting provisions in their election propaganda. He told us that it was their intention to provide a scheme which would lead to the abolition of existing ground rents.  The Minister apparently stands over that because he mentioned it in his speech today.  There is nothing in the Bill that will abolish existing ground rents.  It is the same in essence as the National Coalition Bill.  We did not say that our Bill was leading to the abolition of ground rents.  We gave the facts and said that this would not be possible without changing the Constitution.</P>
      <P>This is a question of election promises being broken.  They said they would adhere to the propaganda circulated during the election campaign and honour it.  They are not honouring their election propaganda in this Bill.  They have broken a promise, no matter how the Minister might like to juggle with words, because they are not abolishing existing ground rents.  If they said that in approximately ten years' time existing ground rents would cease everybody would know that ground rents would be abolished then.  There is nothing in this Bill which implies that.  They are hoodwinking the public.  I believe this will be a forerunner to more broken promises in the next year.  We have another broken promise in relation to jobs.  What will be the next one?</P>
      <P>Why did the Government not reintroduce the comprehensive Bill which the previous Government had ready, and perhaps add a few changes to it?  I believe they really wanted to mislead the people.  In the Coalition Bill ground rents could be bought out through the county registrar, but in this Bill it is the Land Registry.  I understood there was some commitment to decentralisation on all sides of the House, but this is a typical example of going back to the old system, that it is all happening in Dublin.  Deputies from rural constituencies will want to know why they have to go to the Land Registry in Dublin and why they cannot have the matter dealt with in their own counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> The Minister said that additional staff will be provided to deal with the extra work.  Surely it would be better to have them employed in the various places throughout the country rather than employing them in Dublin?  The Land Registry are over-worked.  While promises of additional staff have been made I believe the office will be cluttered up with extra work and staff. It would be far better to decentralise, and work would be far more efficient. I can see Deputies in rural constituencies inundated with problems because of holdups in the central bureaucratic network which will be set up.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the idea and go back to the old system of the county registrars.  Under the National Coalition Bill it would have only cost £2 to process through the county registrar.  In the Land Registry it will cost £5.  I am not quarrelling with the extra £3 but the extra expense should be considered.  It is more personal to have the county registrars dealing with this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence to indicate that special hardship will be imposed on old people as a result of the Government's decision to terminate the subsidy on cheese and instead to concentrate the dairy product subsidies on butter and milk for which an additional £4½ million has been provided this year.</P>
      <P>Indeed while no definite data is available in relation to individual expenditure and consumption patterns for dairy products, the available evidence suggests the expenditure on cheese is greater among households in the higher income group whereas expenditure on butter and milk, which will cost the Exchequer £41 million in consumer subsidies in 1978, tends to be highest among the lower income categories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have heard in my reply&mdash;which was fairly comprehensive&mdash;that the areas which benefit the poorer people most in the subsidy which we increased by £4½ million are those of milk and butter. It is better from the point of view of the consumer that food subsidies in the dairy foods sector be concentrated on milk and butter.</P>

Might I ask the Minister if the removal of the subsidy is not in total contradiction of what was promised prior to the election <i>vis-à-vis</i> foodstuffs when it was said quite clearly that the subsidy would not be taken off foods?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will consider having all commonages in County Galway divided as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission have divided several commonages in County Galway in recent years and will continue to effect the division of suitable areas according as opportunity offers and resources permit.  The amount of land held in common in County Galway&mdash;especially in the western part of the county&mdash;is large and its division into individual plots <Col N="831" /> has to be viewed as a continuous and long-term undertaking.</P>
      <P>I need hardly remind the Deputy that not all commonages are suitable for division.  Low agricultural potential, difficulties as to lay-out, lack of interest on the part of the share-holders, not to mention high development costs, are often prohibitive factors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister says.  However, is he aware that, from the point of view of the eradication of, say, TB and brucellosis, it is necessary for the Land Commission to have a direct policy in relation to the division of commonages? Is he further aware that one or two individuals in a rather large commonage&mdash;and the Minister is well aware that there are a number of very large commonages in County Galway still undivided&mdash;can hold up the whole proceedings?  Might I inquire from the Minister if the Land Commission have a direct policy in this direction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the responsibility in regard to animal disease begins with the herdowner himself.  He will have heard me saying already that the Land Commission are continuing, wherever possible, to take over and subdivide commonages where that is practicable.  But it is very important that herdowners themselves should adopt a responsible attitude in the matter of animal disease, especially in the circumstances we now find ourselves in when, in the past four years, there has been a really catastrophic increase in the incidence of disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to determine Deputy Donnellan's effort to relate the operation of the Land Commission to the disease eradication programme. The terms of reference of the Land Commission are laid down very specifically in the various Land Acts. As far as I know these terms of reference do not relate, even indirectly, to the control of disease.  That duty falls, first of all, on the herdowners to operate the scheme under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is desirable that the presence of antibiotics in milk products be reduced to a minimum not only from the point of view of public health but also from the industrial point of view as the presence of these antibiotics interferes with the staphycultures in the manufacture of cheese and yoghurts?  As we are a major exporting country we have to comply with the stringent regulations laid down in the international field.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of what was contained in the Deputy's speech.  It is true that the less use that is made of antibiotics, especially in the hands of lay men, the better. It is also true that the control of epizootic diseases like mastitis sometimes requires the use of antibiotic preparations to be in the hands of herd owners.  I am as aware as the Deputy is of the difficulties encountered in the matter of inhibitors in the manufacture of cheese.  Deputy Griffin is probably also aware, since his question was more informative than otherwise, that the creamery societies are now penalising fairly heavily for the presence of inhibitors in milk samples. That penalty will be effective in that specific area.</P>
      <P>In my opinion it is necessary that users of antibiotics in agriculture should be informed as fully as possible as to the manner of use and the contents of the active ingredients.  I discussed that matter this morning with the people from the farming organisations and we will be having further conversations about this at official level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. R Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The detailed feasibility study of the zinc smelter project commenced in April 1977.  It was recently finalised by the New Jersey Zinc Company and the completed study was received by the IDA from the company on 1 February. Examination of the study by the IDA and subsequent consideration of the study and an IDA report thereon in my Department will then be necessary. The projected date for the commencement of production, not later than the end of 1981, remains unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that the study will contain certain data and information relating to marketing strategy and production costs, the publication of which would not be in the best interests of the smelter.  However, when final decisions have been taken I will review the question of publication <Col N="838" /> with the other principals in the project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us an indication as to what the objectives of his Department are in relation to the amount of output from the Tara Mines in particular to be smelted in the proposed smelter?  Would the Minister agree that the export of this raw material&mdash;enormous wealth from zinc and lead&mdash;is a particularly irresponsible way of exporting it rather than retaining it until we can smelt it ourselves and, when we get it, smelt the whole produce of the mine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That sounds like a different matter and, if the Deputy would like to put down a separate question on that aspect of it, I will arrange for it to be answered.  On the question of the export of the ore, obviously the Government's attitude is that we should have a smelter and that is why we asked for this feasibility study to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the correction. When the smelter is in full operation, what proportion do the Government expect to smelt?  I have used a figure of one-third.  Is that continuing, or will we smelt the whole produce of the mine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put down a question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a report being prepared at departmental level and indicated that it was not yet completed.  Presumably the entire enterprise depends on the quality and the conclusion of that report.  Will the putative production date for the smelter possibly be delayed if there is a delay in the production of the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The date of 1981 remains unchanged.  The delay is not in the Department.  The report became available to the IDA on 1 February.  It is being treated as a matter or urgency.  For the information of the Deputy I hope, subject to <Col N="839" /> the views of the IDA board, that the project will be considered by the authority at their meeting in April, following which the IDA's views will be forwarded to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister regard it as proper that members of the board of the IDA, some of whom have private interests, should be privy to a feasibility study and that a private company, New Jersey Zinc, should be privy to marketing strategies, and so on, and that report cannot be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the Dáil Library?  Does he agree that strategy of the Government contrasts very strangely with their decision on the publication of agreements relating to Bula?  Secrecy for one and publication for the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly the Deputy is aware those are not the facts of the situation.  New Jersey Zinc have indicated that much of the report, especially the sections dealing with marketing, financial and economic evaluation, and process selection should be treated as strictly confidential because the information on these aspects would be valuable to commercial competitors of the smelter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that spokesmen for New Jersey Zinc have indicated publicly and in other areas certain internal strategies of that report?  Why cannot his Department make available at this stage to the Oireachtas and to Opposition spokesmen the prospect of evaluating the different strategies in the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In my original reply I emphasised that, when the final decision has been taken, a review of the question of publication with the other principals in the project will be undertaken.  It is not a closed door as yet.  The whole question of publication will be reviewed in the light of the final decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister two questions and I will join them together.  Is it true, as reported, that the Minister's Department have received <Col N="840" /> a proposal from a Soviet source in regard to the building of this smelter?  If it is true, or if the Minister envisages that a proposal of this kind might be officially received, would his Department consider trying any possible arrangement with a foreign source, whether the Soviets or anybody else, onto the kind of trade advantage, the kind of trade strings, which the Finns succeeded lately in tying onto a large contract with the British Aircraft Corporation to re-equip their air force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Russian proposal is a separate question but I have the information here and I can give it to the Deputy.  There has been an exchange of letters between the Department and the USSR Embassy and a commercial consul here.  The Minister has directed that the Russian proposals be examined and the IDA have been so informed.  Obviously the Minister wishes to keep all possibilities in mind in considering the decision to be taken on the zinc smelter project and further possibilities of lead smelting also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister two quick questions?  Could he tell the House who initiated the correspondence he referred to?  Was it the Soviets who initiated it. or was it we who wrote to them?  That is one question. I have another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It arose out of a discussion between the Minister and the Russian Ambassador in December 1977.  The question arose as to a possible Russian interest in an Irish zinc smelter project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the House to take it that the proposal came from the Russian side?  Even in a conversation someone draws down a subject first.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider bringing Córas Tráchtála into the picture even at this stage to see if our very large unfavourable trade balance with the Soviets could be put right as a side benefit of this contract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="841" />
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not make a definite statement on that.  Obviously it is Government policy if we have an unfavourable trade balance with any country to improve that situation.  The Minister has expressed very strong views on this in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if a licence has been granted to the company Rio Tinto Finance and Exploration Limited, to prospect for zinc in County Cork; and if he considers that such an action is consistent with the Government's declared policy in relation to apartheid, in view of Rio Tinto's record in South Africa.</P>

      <P>Rio Tinto Finance and Exploration Limited hold general prospecting licences in their own right, or jointly with another company, over four areas in County Cork and over 26 areas elsewhere in the country. Notice of my intention to grant prospecting licences to the companies over five other areas in County Cork was published on the 13 August 1977 and these licences will be issued shortly.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that the withholding of prospecting facilities from the company would contribute in any appropriate or effective way to a change in the policy of apartheid, to which the Irish Government are completely opposed.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the totally disreputable and shameful record of this company in South Africa would merit the kind of action suggested here by me?

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment I was saying that basically the only real difference between this Bill and what was there when the National Coalition went out of office is the provision transferring particular functions from the county registrar to the Registrar of Titles in the Land Registry.  I believe that is a retrograde step, because this is a small area in which decentralisation could be practised with comparative ease and I would ask the Minister to have another look at this from that point of view.  It is very important that people should have ease of access when transferring the fee simple from the ground landlord to the occupier of the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil promised to abolish existing residential ground rents.  In their manifesto they said &ldquo;a scheme leading&rdquo;.  &ldquo;A scheme leading&rdquo; means what it says.  It means total abolition. If I do not feel free to buy out my ground rent then ground rents are not abolished <i>per se.</i>  The Minister was congratulated by Deputy Woods.  I wonder was he being congratulated because he conned the people into believing ground rents would be abolished.  That was the common belief, and I believe there should be no shifting away from the implementation of that promise at this stage.  It is because there is a shifting away from implementation this side of the House must raise very strong <Col N="866" /> objection.  It is totally dishonest.  It is misleading.</P>
    <P>ACRA have clearly spelled out in their document of 14 December last that they rejected the buying out of the landlord's interest.  It was obvious that there was no great enthusiasm on the Government's side today to spell out the fact that they were not going to abolish existing ground rents.  They had the neck in the Minister's speech to talk about &ldquo;leading to the abolition&rdquo;. When the Minister comes to reply will he spell out exactly what he means? If I do not wish to buy out my ground rent is it abolished?  Of course it is not.  Ground rents will continue and the Minister knows that.  He sits smugly on the Front Bench feeling he has done a good day's work in codding the people.  Other days will come and he and his colleagues will be called upon to render an account of their stewardship. They will have to answer for their false promises.  They are not long in office and the honeymoon period is over.  It is becoming obvious that the promises so gaily entered into will not now be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>There is no real difference between the Minister's Bill and that of the Coalition Government, but had the latter Bill been passed people would now be purchasing their ground rents at a lower rate over approximately 7½ years as against 8½ years because of interest rates and the national loan. Why the fanfare of trumpets for this Bill?  Surely the Minister is not claiming credit.  He cannot.  The Bill introduced by the Coalition Government was a comprehensive reform in tenant and landlord legislation.  Here we have bits and pieces of reform.  It was believed that ground rents would be abolished.  That is not now the position. There is no question of abolition.  I defy the Minister to deny that.  I cannot understand why anyone should be excited about this Bill.  There are just a few changes in existing legislation. The provision allowing local authority owners to purchase their ground rents is something that should have been in the original Bill and I have no doubt it would have been before the Bill left this House.</P>
    <P>The Government are playing with <Col N="867" /> words and misleading the people.  But they will not mislead the people.  Had they provided that in eight to ten years ground rents would have disappeared that would have been a positive step towards the abolition of ground rents.  That is not in this Bill. I regret having to be critical.  For practical purposes this is the Coalition's Bill.  The Government are guilty of deception in misleading the people into believing that existing residential ground rents would be abolished.  No matter how they whitewash it or phrase their words, that is the message and it was clearly stated in the small print of their election propaganda. They must state in this House that they have reneged on their election promises.  This will be the trend from now on, that the Government will renege on their promises one after the other.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the bargain of the century.  There is no doubt that they will use banner headlines in urging people to purchase their ground rents at Fianna Fáil bargain basement prices.  It is a ludicrous way in which to describe this kind of thinking.  It is an effort to whitewash their false promises but they will not be allowed to whitewash them.  That is primarily why it is important that this type of deception be put on the record of this House.  It is sad that political parties are prepared to do this to win popular support.  It would be better to be without a parliament than to have to resort to such tactics to win support.  We knew they could not fulfil their promises because the Constitution would not allow it.  They can change the Constitution if they are so concerned about the abolition of existing ground rents.  However, they have only paid lip service to it and now the great con trick is being unveiled.</P>
    <P>I should like this Bill to go through the House as quickly as possible because there are many good things in it.  The next time they try to con the people they may have second thoughts. I believe they will and that the next time the electorate will have second thoughts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It was Shakespeare who put into the mouths of one of his characters the expression &ldquo;Me thinks thou dost protest too much&rdquo;, and that about summarises the Minister's approach to this Bill.  He came into the House very much on the defensive.  His script, which has been supplied to us now, shows that he spent approximately half of his speech denying that he had promised to abolish ground rents.  The first four-and-a-half pages of this script deal with no other topic than his interpretation of the promise contained in his manifesto and he tries to show that he did not undertake to abolish ground rents.  The Minister knows that he did convey the impression to the electorate that he would abolish ground rents.  He knows perfectly well that he has reneged on that promise every bit as much as the Minister for Foreign Affairs has reneged on his promise to the Third World to provide them with £90 million to make life more bearable for them, whereas he provided them with only £9.6 million.  The only difference is that the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not extract votes from the people of the Third World but the Minister for Justice did extract votes from our people on the promise that he would abolish ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he promised to abolish ground rents the Minister was not promising something that was not possible.  He could have abolished ground rents in one or two ways.  He could have amended the Constitution and confiscated ground rents but he dare not do that and he dare not tell the electorate before an election that he was going to do that because the people who own the ground rents would rebel.  On the other hand he could have decided to abolish ground rents without amending the Constitution and let the State pay the bill.  Of course, he could not tell that to the people before the election because it would be a simple matter to work out the endless millions that that exercise would have cost and the people would not buy that one either.  So the Minister decided to be gloriously vague by saying that they would abolish ground rents but would introduce a scheme <Col N="869" /> leading to the abolition of ground rents and the people would think that that meant in ordinary language what it says: that they would abolish ground rents.</P>
    <P>This term &ldquo;abolition&rdquo; or &ldquo;abolish&rdquo; appears at least three times in the manifesto which has now been quoted freely and will continue to be quoted.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I crave the Chair's indulgence for not more than a minute and I hope to be able to convince him that I am not out of order.  The Minister says that he did not undertake to abolish ground rents and I say he did. I am referring to the language he used in the manifesto and I am comparing that with the language he used in regard to tax on motor cars and rates. Indeed, Sir, you were not in the Chair when the Minister referred to these two items in his opening speech in justification of his argument.  I am trying to throw them back at him and in using the same argument that he was permitted to use to prove the opposite.  I assure you, Sir, I will not go into an in-depth discussion on the merits or demerits of road tax or rates. There will be another day for that when the bill comes up for payment next year or the year after.</P>
      <P>In regard to ground rents the manifesto says:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will provide a scheme which will lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.</P>
      <P>In regard to road tax the manifesto stated:</P>
      <P>Abolishing annual road tax on all cars up to and including 16 h.p. from August 1977.</P>
      <P>The Minister abolished road tax from that date.  With regard to rates the manifesto stated:</P>
      <P>Abolishing rates on all dwellings from January 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" /> There was a time element in those cases but those undertakings were honoured.  The only difference between those undertakings and that in regard to ground rents is that the manifesto did not specify the date when ground rents would be abolished.  We were told that a scheme would be introduced which would lead to the abolition of ground rents at some future time.  I suggest that the only meaning that could be taken out of the manifesto in regard to ground rents is that they would be abolished without cost to the lessee, whoever else would be paying the cost.</P>
    <P>The Minister is introducing a Bill to facilitate the purchase of ground rents, to facilitate and simplify the procedures in regard to the purchase of ground rents.  That should have been written into the manifesto, but that would not be an attractive carrot because people would want to know how much it would cost them.  It is not the same as saying that ground rents are going to abolished.  That is why I charge the Minister, and the drafters of the manifesto, with being politically dishonest and misleading the electorate. They certainly misled ACRA because in a long document they stated that they did not want a system whereby ground rents would have to be brought out.  ACRA felt that compensation should be paid for the ground rents paid in the past, but they were codded by the Minister for Justice and his advisers.</P>
    <P>The Minister is on record as having said that he was disappointed with the Bill introduced by his predecessor because it did not provide for the abolition of ground rents.  What is the difference in principle between what the former Minister introduced and what this Minister has introduced? The principle is the same although there may be some procedural differences.  I do not think the Minister can blow any trumpets about what he proposes doing here.  The Bill is doing exactly as Senator Cooney proposed doing and the present Minister expressed his disappointment with that.</P>
    <P>The Minister devoted four pages to trying to prove that the manifesto <Col N="871" /> meant something other than what everybody took it to mean, and in dealing with the terms of the Bill he stated:</P>
    <P>There are, however, important differences between the approach adopted in this Bill and that of my predecessor.  The most important difference&mdash;and one which is an essential feature of the scheme&mdash;is that we are in this Bill telling the tenant precisely how much it will cost him to get his fee simple.  For a transfer by consent the fee will be £5 and no more.  When we were debating the previous Bill we had no idea whatsoever what the intention was with regard to the costs of acquisition.  At no stage was the actual fee to be charged mentioned and this was, indeed, to have been left over for determination in the context of regulations to be made after the Bill had passed.  That was not, to my mind, a satisfactory approach.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the Minister, having made that little boast stopped, as Deputy Eileen Desmond said, without mentioning subsections (2) and (3) of section 23.  Those subsections specify that other charges will be made by the Land Registry and will be dealt with in regulations to be drawn up by the Minister for Justice, under the fatherly eye of the Minister for Finance, and that they will prescribe other charges to be made in the Land Registry.  It is significant that these other charges shall be fixed so as to meet the full cost of dealing with the relevant application.  It will be operated on an economic basis without any subsidy from the State; it must pay its way.  If it is complicated and goes on for a while the people will be charged accordingly.  On occasions it takes up to a year for the Land Registry to deal with such matters. They are harsh provisions in a Bill which sets out to simplify and subsidise. Tenants are being asked to pay fees in the Land Registry on an economic basis and they will have to pay for everything there.  We had a <Col N="872" /> provision in the Agricultural Credit Bill, which we dealt with this morning, not that the fees in the Land Registry will be economic and will bear the cost of the transaction but that there will not be any stamp duty or any fees payable. There is a great contrast between the way the agricultural sector will be treated under the Agricultural Credit Bill and the way the people who are buying out their ground rents under this Bill will be treated in the Land Registry.  They will have to pay the full economic costs of the transaction in the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister was ill-advised to entrust the machinery for registration of the lessee in fee simple to the Registrar of Titles rather than the county registrars.  That is a move towards centralisation, expense and mystery as far as the purchaser down the country is concerned.  The other Bill provided that the legal working connection with the purchase of ground rents would be done by the county registrar and disputes in regard to them would be resolved by the county registrar.  There are 26 county registrars, one in each county.  In almost every case the county registrar is also the local registrar of titles.  He has particulars of all registered titles in his county in the courthouse.  A folio is opened in the courthouse in each county town regarding every bit of registered land in the country.  It was a simpler procedure to leave the working out of this legal procedure to the county registrar who was also the local registrar of titles.</P>
    <P>This man is in constant touch with the Land Registry in Chancery Place in Dublin.  They speak the same language and he could communicate with the registrar of titles in Dublin.  The local registrar of titles also speaks the same language as the purchaser down the country who comes from the same county and probably knows him.  The county registrar in each county is accessible to the purchaser down the country.  If the county registrar was doing the job less travelling would have to be done.  If a person was semiilliterate he could go into the local man, get his differences ironed out, bring his documents with him and explain the position to the county registrar. <Col N="873" /> That would not mean any extra journey for the man living in Dublin because he already has his county registrar in Dublin within one mile or two miles from him.</P>
    <P>The man in Cavan, Galway or any other place around the country under this procedure will have to travel to Dublin to see the registrar of titles. The system adopted by the Minister&mdash; I speak as a non-practising solicitor&mdash; is the best possible way of keeping the legal profession busy.  I cannot see how a country man will be able to travel up to the Land Registry in Dublin, go into a place staffed by hundreds of people, be sent from one section to another and eventually see the registrar of titles and try to explain his position to him.  He will not do that. He will see the local solicitor and get it done by him.  Perhaps that is the intention of the Minister.  If it is, there will be the existing fee, the unknown Land Registry fee and the solicitors' fee.  That is a very bad move.</P>
    <P>It is also provided in the Bill that if there is a dispute the arbitrator will be the registrar of titles.  There may be a flaw in the title and he could be right or wrong but he will have to sit as judge and try to decide between one and the other.  The arbitrator should be somebody other than the Registrar of Titles of the county registrar.  I cannot think of anybody more suitable than the Circuit Court judge who sits in each county approximately three times a year.  There are many precedents for him acting as arbitrator.  Many years ago he was the arbitrator under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  The Circuit Court judge also acted as arbitrator under the Military Pensions Acts.  He sat locally and informally in his chamber and ironed out those things.  I do not see how the registrar can be advisor-in-chief and judge.</P>
    <P>I, like Deputy Fergus O'Brien, stood up to speak to expose the political deception the Minister engaged in prior to the election.  I want to put it on the record in no uncertain language that the Minister is not doing what he promised.  The Bill is much the same as Senator Cooney's Bill.  There is the extra little bit about different categories and prohibition against eviction which <Col N="874" /> I believe is sound and acceptable.  I approve of the provision to prevent a man who owes £30 or £40 being ejected from his house.  That is an improvement.</P>
    <P>If there was another Bill introduced on this topic next year there would be improvements in it also.  There are improvements made in Bills between Second and Committee Stages.  Indeed there are improvements made in them between Committee and Report Stages. It may happen that they are improved on in the Seanad provided it does not happen before the long vacation when, whether or not the Seanad could approve of them, they are not left to do it, or cannot, because then the Dáil would have to be recalled.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Bill proposes to enact more or less what Senator Cooney proposed I welcome it.  But the Minister knew, coming into the House, that this Bill was a bit of deception.  The Fianna Fáil Party were very conscious of that because they proposed to take the Second Reading of this Bill on a very significant date which may or may not have been a coincidence.  This Bill was intended to be taken on this day last week.  That may have been a mere coincidence or a way of burying it in the budget so that it would have got through the House without anybody talking about it and, if they did, without a word having been reported on it.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this Bill about which I am disappointed is that it is a piecemeal job.  There are the Landlord and Tenant Acts of 1931 and subsequent Acts badly needing to be updated and amended.  During his term of office Senator Cooney put in train a Bill to consolidate the Landlord and Tenant Acts from 1931 to 1971.  He availed of that exercise to do what the Minister is now doing.  But the Minister has put to one side Senator Cooney's Bill with its 122 sections and Schedule.  Many of those sections are urgently required in regard to ordinary residential and business leases, and many other matters such as courts in which disputes can be heard in regard to sporting leases&mdash;very important and long overdue&mdash;apportionment of rents and so on.  The Minister was prevented by his party's manifesto from doing <Col N="875" /> the sensible thing, of putting down a Motion in this House and reactivating that Bill with its 122 sections.  Indeed he could have introduced amendments on Committee or Report Stage when the differences between Senator Cooney's Bill and his could have been attended to.  Of course the Minister dare not do that because that would let the cat out of the bag properly.  But here he was coming in with Senator Cooney's Bill, naked, and he had to find some way in which that performance could be covered up.  What did he do?  He gets two or three Bills.  He took one bite of the cherry with the first one dealing with future ground rents.  Now he comes along and takes another bit out of this Bill and deals with existing ground rents, leaving the 122 sections there to be dealt with some old time.  It is very much in the interest both of landlords and tenants that the Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1977 should be processed through this House as quickly as possible irrespective of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2), Bill, 1977.</P>
    <P>I want to make it as clear as crystal that there was no necessity for the introduction of this small Bill with which we are now dealing.  It was all in Senator Cooney's Bill.  The difference between the Minister's and Senator Cooney's Bills could have been dealt with by amendment on Committee Stage here, which would have had the added advantage&mdash;as far as the public and property owners are concerned&mdash; that all of the other outstanding matters arising out of the Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1971 and innumerable others introduced, such as those in 1958, 1960, 1963, 1967 could have been amended and updated.  Instead of having the piecemeal discussion in which we are now engaging we could have made a tidy job of the whole thing.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is better for solicitors and lawyers to have three Bills instead of one because it confuses the issue, making it more difficult for ordinary human beings to find out what are their rights.  Under Senator Cooney's procedure the law dealing with future and existing ground rents, residential leases and all sorts of landlord <Col N="876" /> and tenant matters from 1931 to date could have been incorporated in the one Bill.  Now, in bewilderment, one will have to root through the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 1) Bill, 1977, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Bill, 1977 to the Landlord and Tenant Consolidating Bill if the Minister ever succeeds &mdash;when the political pressure is off&mdash; in processing it through the House.  I say that is bad business; it is a bad way of dealing with statute law.</P>
    <P>All of this messing arises simply and solely because the Minister wants to justify his manifesto.  God knows that manifesto will cost the country a hell of a lot in more ways than one. It will be a millstone around the neck of every Member of the Cabinet and the country as well because it will not be a case of what is good for our citizens but rather what is it necessary to do to show that the manifesto has been carried out.  That is the exercise in which we are engaged here.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Bill is a repetition of Senator Cooney's I welcome it.  In so far it is marginally, procedurally an technically, in some respects, an improvement on Senator Cooney's Bill I welcome it also.  But I repeat that all these bits of Mickey Mousery could have been done within Senator Cooney's Bill, with all the other virtues that would flow from having one complete, consolidating measure rather than three.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree with the Bill in principle because we realise the hardship inflicted on many people who have to pay ground rents.  Many thousands of people were disappointed because they expected ground rents would be abolished.  I do not know if it was deliberate but the impression was given that this would happen.  If one read the manifesto one would be inclined to accept that.  When canvassing at the last election I felt at a disadvantage in the housing estates because ground rents was a day-to-day subject there.  Numerous people asked me if we would abolish ground rents. I could give no commitment but they were not in the least shy telling me that the Fianna Fáil Party had told them they would abolish existing ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> I have read this Bill.  As a layman I might have missed the point where this promise was fulfilled.  As I am not a lawyer, it is possible I may have slipped up but I am convinced that I did not.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I may be asked if I am saying that the scheme will, in fact, lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  While I have no crystal ball, my answer is that I think it will.</P>
    <P>Wherever that crystal ball has disappeared to, there was definitely one during the last general election.  Many people were led to believe that ground rents would be abolished in a very short time.</P>
    <P>The only change of any importance which I have seen between this Bill and the Coalition Bill is the change from the county registrar to the Land Registry.  Over the last number of years I have had experience dealing with the Land Registry and found it impossible to have anything dealt with urgently.  I can understand that because the volume of work must be very heavy and perhaps that section is understaffed.  The Minister said he has given instructions to have the staff situation improved to deal specifically with ground rents.  If extra staff are employed they must be employed solely for work on ground rents.</P>
    <P>We must be serious about decentralisation. In my city we have the registrar's office.  What could be wrong with having extra staff in that office which is situated in a constituency in east Limerick adjacent to my constituency? That constituency suffered a great loss recently through the closing of a certain industry.  We should have decentralisation.  Although there are only 26 offices involved, if we employed another two or three people for each office this would be a step in the right direction.  It is often said in the country that Dublin is top-heavy where service jobs are concerned.  I believe that is true.  This is an opportunity for us to bring as many jobs as possible to the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister will defend himself by saying that at no time was that promise made.  I say this in all sincerity: <Col N="878" /> this Minister during the canvassing at the last general election was convinced that it was possible to have existing ground rents abolished.  I do not mind admitting this; that when the Coalition were in power I was asked if it were possible to have existing ground rents abolished; I made an approach to the then Minister and he told me he would not commit himself to that policy.  One can understand my embarrassment when canvassing during the last election when I was told that Fianna Fáil were prepared to give that commitment.</P>
    <P>I am not under-estimating the Minister but whether it was deliberate or not, the impression was given down the country that existing ground rents would be abolished.  I ask the Minister to contact the <i>Limerick Leader</i> tomorrow and say that in view of the amount of criticism and proof available, there must have been some misunderstanding when he was canvassing during the last election because I feel it is only right to put on record that the impression was given in the manifesto that Fianna Fáil would abolish existing ground rents.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if at all possible to tell the people that in view of what he has heard they were led astray.  He has very little choice but to go back to our constituency and give a report to the <i>Limerick Leader</i> that there was a misunderstanding and although his intentions were good he now finds it is not possible to abolish ground rents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In politics I like plain, straight, honest talk and so do the people generally.  I rise mainly to condemn the sheer and utter hypocrisy expressed in this Bill on the basis of what Fianna Fáil said, or gave the impression, they were going to do in relation to ground rents.  There can be no doubt outside this House about the impression Fianna Fáil gave in their public statements, and especially statements by their candidates during the election campign, or what was said in private to such people as ACRA and tenant associations, that it was the intention of Fianna Fáil to abolish existing ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> I was particularly aware of this before the last general election.  I made several serious inquiries within my own party about the possibility of abolishing ground rents.  It was made quite clear to me that the Constitution was there and could not be flouted. I accepted that.  I also accepted the fact that it would be very expensive for any Government to take on the task of buying out existing residential ground rents.  It would take unknown millions.  I am not a legal person by any means.  I am not well read in the small print of the law.  It was explained to me reasonably well and I accepted this as being very difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency I was called on to make my position clear and I did so.  I said that socially evil though the ground rent structure is, I would recommend to tenants that they should pay their ground rent until such time as the law is changed.  I said I would support any change in the law if some legal means were found whereby the State could bear the charge of abolishing them.  That was my personal position before, during and since the election, when I was called to a meeting of a residential association in Waterford.</P>
    <P>Over the past year the Fianna Fáil Party gave a clear impression that, in office, they would take up the cause and abolish ground rents.  The thing is &mdash;and here the wrong was done&mdash; people involved in ACRA and in Sinn Féin took up this cause very strongly.  On the basis of what Fianna Fáil said they would do, ACRA and Sinn Féin have been advocating the withholding of ground rents.  In a circular from ACRA on 14 December they said that in the meantime all householders were requested to continue with the campaign in the withholding and non-purchase of ground rents.  I told people they should pay their ground rents because it is a legal charge.  I also said that I have to pay ground rent myself and I would be very happy to see ground rents abolished.  I will use this legislation, or I would have used Senator Cooney's legislation had it been passed, to buy out my own small ground rent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> Fianna Fáil encouraged this illegal approach to the matter, and this has done harm.  Any approach which gives peace of mind to people who want to break the law, in however small a way, lessens the stature of this House and of parliamentary democracy in general. That is the basic reason why I want to speak here today.  I spoke on the Bill introduced by Senator Cooney when he was Minister.  I became so annoyed that I decided to speak today. There is no doubt the Minister is splitting hairs.  On page 27 of the famous manifesto it is stated:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will provide a scheme which will lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister reiterated that statement.  He said: &ldquo;That statement is perfectly clear.  It has always been clear to me.&rdquo;  It is not clear, because this Bill does not lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents. There is nothing in it which states specifically that existing residential ground rents will be abolished.  It is a measure, as was the National Coalition's measure, designed to facilitate tenants purchasing existing ground rents.  This Bill changes the approach slightly.  It fixes a fee, which is to be approved, of £5 in relation to legal fees.  That is an improvement, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said earlier.  This Bill is very similar in its approach to the question of existing residential ground rents to the National Coalition's Bill.  The House has been misled on this whole question.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>It will be evident to any one who takes the trouble to read our undertaking and to study the contents of this Bill that we as a Government are fulfilling our undertaking, in accordance with the letter and the spirit.</P>
    <P>That is wrong and I reject it.  The letter and the spirit of the undertaking have not been fulfilled.  The spirit of this Bill is very similar to the spirit of the Bill introduced by the National Coalition. There are no sour grapes. Obviously I wish the National Coalition Government were in office, but we all agree with this legislation which goes some way along the road to making ground rents less of a social evil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> The Minister said:</P>
    <P>If we can solve the problem of legal costs then, I would suggest, we have solved the problem of ground rents.</P>
    <P>That again is a misleading statement. Of course, fixing a fee of £5 goes some way along the road, but it does not abolish existing residential ground rents.  No Minister could come into the House and say: &ldquo;We have solved the problem of ground rents.&rdquo;  The Minister has not solved the problem he set out to solve.  He has not abolished ground rents as such.  He has done exactly what the National Coalition Government did in office.  He has introduced a Bill to make the purchase easier.  He has not done what he told the people he would do, that is, abolish ground rents or introduce a scheme which would lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  That has not been done and this House should understand it clearly.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I may be asked if I am saying that the scheme will, in fact, lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  While I have no crystal ball...</P>
    <P>At least he admits that much&mdash;</P>
    <P>...my answer is that I think it will.</P>
    <P>That is only an opinion, and you are entitled to your opinion.  In fact, it is an admission that this proposed legislation is not specifically abolishing existing residential ground rents.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also said that while this Bill is an improvement on some aspects of the Bill discussed last year, nevertheless the Bill introduced by the National Coalition was more comprehensive and was much more a consolidating Bill.  In relation to sporting leases it is unfortunate that this Bill was not consolidating in its objective.  It is a piecemeal measure. It is much more preferable to consolidate the law rather than bring in one small Bill after another.  That would be much better than the piecemeal approach you have adopted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of the £5 fee is welcome and nobody will cavil at it.  It was the proper thing to do.  While it was not specified in the Bill introduced by the National Coalition it was to be dealt with by an order. The situation with regard to local authority tenants who may wish to buy out their ground rents has been improved. I do not think there is any major problem in relation to local authorities.  From my experience of local authorities I have found that the cost of sites, and particularly serviced sites, has become so high that tenants initially prefer to buy them from the local authorities by way of rent.  What is being done in this Bill merely extends their option.</P>
      <P>The question of rights of re-entry has been dealt with in the Bill.  The Minister pointed out that the relatively little interest of a ground landlord in his property does not justify eviction and, therefore, the move to abolish his right, or to say to him that, like every other creditor, he has a recourse in civil litigation, is putting the matter into perspective.  I do not think that we in Ireland have been too fond of absentee landlords.  There is the feeling that all landlords who collect ground rents are to some extent absentee landlords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this legislation will settle the question of ground rents.  I should like to see them abolished by some means or other, but the information available to the National Coalition Government was that there was a constitutional problem.  They would have incurred enormous expense if they undertook <Col N="883" /> to pay the costs of acquiring ground rents.  I have not any other information to establish a mechanism whereby this could be done.</P>
    <P>ACRA have been conducting a campaign for people to withhold ground rents, but that does not appeal to me.  If a legal charge exists, people should pay their ground rents until legislation is passed to change the situation.  There is a campaign to withhold ground rents in a part of Waterford. I am saying now that it is my opinion and recommendation to honest householders who have bought houses in Waterford that they should buy out their ground rents under this legislation as soon as it goes through the Houses of the Oireachtas or they should pay their ground rents when they are due. As a public representative I cannot, and will not, be seen to be two-faced in this matter.  I will not recommend to any tenant to withhold his ground rent.  For as long as this is a legal charge I am saying to people to pay their ground rents or else to buy them out within the law.  I cannot accede to the ACRA position which recommends withholding ground rents.</P>
    <P>So far as it settles the question of ground rents for the foreseeable future, this legislation sets out a model whereby ground rents can be bought out relatively cheaply.  It is very similar in spirit to the measure introduced by the then Minister for Justice, now Senator Cooney, on behalf of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  I do not think Fianna Fáil can say they are doing something we were not doing. That would be wrong; it would be a lie, and I am satisfied they will not try to say that.  This is merely a reintroduction of part of our Bill dealing with ground rents, slightly improved so far as the £5 fee is concerned.</P>
    <P>You misled the people on a very serious matter in so far as you led them to believe you would do something which you knew in your hearts was not constitutionally possible.  In doing so you misled people into taking a stand on a matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil misled the people and then they left them in the cold.  They gave the impression that they would abolish ground rents.  What they did was bad for Irish politics, for democracy and for those who serve in this Parliament.  I do not say that in any spirit of sour grapes.  It is bad for the spirit of the people to be misled as they have been misled by Fianna Fáil in relation to ground rents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in so far as it deals in a clear manner with the proposals of the Government and indeed of the previous administration also on the question of existing ground rents and the purchase of such rents.  Apart from one major change in the Bill, namely, the abolition of the landlord's right of re-entry for non-payment of ground rent &mdash;a substantial change that is welcomed universally&mdash;the policy being pursued is by and large the same as that of the previous administration, having regard to the understanding then and to the legislative initiatives taken in this area.  Perhaps it is well that future ground rents, in so far as the first Bill was concerned, and existing ground rents in this Bill, as well as other aspects of the law on landlord and tenant relationships, are being contained in separate legislation.  There has been a considerable degree of drafting, redrafting and preparation of this legislation both by Fianna Fáil up to 1973 and more recently and by the Coalition during a period of three or four years.  This Minister has had the very substantial benefit of having had many of the drafting and legislative problems cleared up on his resuming office.  He found that the legislation had been put into a more manageable and coherent form for the benefit generally of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall a previous Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, saying that when he was given the Bill first he more or less threw the whole thing back and said: &ldquo;Let us have a look <Col N="885" /> at the entire Bill again.&rdquo;  I do not think that in saying that there is any unfair reflection either on the then internal drafting section of the Department or on the parliamentary draftsman's office.  Again, the legislation came forward in the form in which it was introduced by the former Minister, Senator Cooney.  I recall pointing out to him some sections of the Bill that were more a source of confusion than of enlightenment.  He, too, took the Bill back and had a hard look at it during the best part of 18 months. The unfortunate Minister at the time had an enormous amount of work on his plate as he had during the entire term of office of the Coalition.  Nevertheless, I badgered him continually about the legislation until finally it was brought forward in a revised version.  Unfortunately we did not succeed in enacting that legislation but the Coalition need not give any apologia for that.  The legislation could have been enacted had we given it the priority it deserved.  Unfortunately, the Cabinet for reasons best known to themselves did not give it absolute priority as a result of which the Bill fell on the dissolution of the Dáil.  The present Minister has had the benefit of the voluminous file in the Department on the legislation going back to the best part of five years but I am not in any way taking from his ability or his concern in this matter.  He has been able to expedite the Bill in a period of six or seven months.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, though a little straight-forward, open political bluntness on the part of the Minister would have been preferable to the very defensive two or three pages of his introduction on Second Stage.  I refer to the attitude of &ldquo;what we really meant was so and so&rdquo; and &ldquo;we did not give an undertaking this way or that way.&rdquo; The reality was quite different in June last.</P>
    <P>Prior to the election Deputy Horgan and I attended a meeting at Sallynoggin Comprehensive School.  At that meeting which was organised by ACRA we were graced by my constituency colleague, Deputy David Andrews, and by Professor O'Donoghue who was then aspiring to elective office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> Also there was the other Fianna Fáil candidate, both aspiring and perspiring. In addition there was a galaxy of other candidates, about 13 in all, including that very excellent candidate, Mrs. Una Higgins O'Malley.  About half way through the procedures when the then Senator Horgan and I were endeavouring to explain constitutional problems relating to ground rents and when we were getting a very severe hearing, Deputy Andrews produced a piece of paper which he claimed had been given to him that evening by Deputy Collins.  Deputy Horgan is my witness to this.  Deputy Andrews read the paper to the assembled gathering.  He told them that Fianna Fáil could not envisage any major constitutional problem regarding the abolition of ground rents.  When the very tall Deputy gesticulates he is noticed.  He gave the assembly to understand that the matter was merely one of phasing out ground rents.</P>
    <P>The question of vendors and so on did not arise.  There was a Jaundiced reaction from some people there, while there was silence from those on the Coalition side because we knew that it was not possible to improve that kind of situation.  I noticed that Professor O'Donoghue remained silent.  He decided to stay out of the matter.  I teased him about it afterwards saying that Deputy Andrews had really gone to town.  Subsequently, the paper concerned was issued to the newspapers. Perhaps that is why there has been a trilogy of measures.  There was a trilogy of promises at that time.  It is said that all is fair in love and war and I suppose that in an election campaign if one can gain an advantage one way or the other in terms of votes, that is all right if that is precisely what one is after.  At that stage the candidates probably did not see anything wrong in that They could not have known whether their party would be returned to power.  In any event some of the people present believed the Fianna Fáil spokesman.</P>

      <P>By the time the ACRA representatives and the Fianna Fáil people were finished with us we felt like selling our ground rents to the cheapest bidder.  I accept the viewpoint expressed by Deputy Collins regarding the promise not having been contained in the manifesto because the manifesto clause in this regard is ambiguous.  It is open to any kind of expediency of interpretation and has been bandied around sufficiently.  The Minister says that the commitment regarding the provision of a scheme that would lead to the abolition of ground rents has always been clear to him.  I share his view but would remind him that there is much difference between the impression people get of what something means and the reality. Undoubtedly there was created the explicit impression&mdash;certainly this was so in the constituency I represent&mdash;in the minds of many householders that one way or another ground rents would be phased out over a period, though not abolished outright.  That was the most dominant impression.  There is a big difference between impressions and intent, and that is the point we would make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill; it is an excellent Bill as far as it goes.  I would have preferred an amendment of the Constitution in that regard.  We have sidestepped the constitutionality aspect. There is no doubt that the people have a great social tenacity and a positive detestation of anybody who would interefere with private property&mdash;anybody who would do so would be facing revolution&mdash;but the constitutional aspect could have been better dealt with by a simple constitutional Bill abolishing ground rents.  It would have required a referendum, but I would have been in favour of such a referendum. It would have been a cleaner job, instead of giving ground landlords a nominal payment.  It will not break anybody's overdraft to pay six or seven <Col N="888" /> times his ground rent plus £5, but as a general principle I would have preferred an amendment to the segment of the Constitution dealing with private property so that many other aspects which require amendment could have been brought in, such as the aspects of local authority purchases of land and of rents, such as the implementation of the Kenny Report, which cannot be done as long as that section of the Constitution remains with a degree of rigidity which is absolutely prohibitive.  Unfortunately, it looks as if for the lifetime of this Dáil the Constitution will be given sacrosanct protection.  It will be given a sanctity which is, perhaps, excessive.  With that reservation I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is proper that the parity in the Bill between public and private leases should be introduced, and I welcome the decision of the Minister to extend the right of purchase of fee simple to the ground rent tenants of local authorities. Overall, this will be good and will lead to the removal of a very bureaucratic attitude towards the owners of local authority houses and tenancies.  There was a strong feeling in many areas of bureacracy, both in the Department of Local Government and to some extent in terms of social attitudes within the Department of Justice, that one could not fully trust local authority tenants, that they have to pay a nominal shilling a year in ground rent so that the whip can be kept on them.  While I could understand that in the context of the deficiencies in the 1963 Planning Act, I certainly could not understand it in the context of the amended planning legislation put through this House by the former Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully.  Once that went through there was no reason why ground rent right of purchase should not have been extended to local authority tenants.  I welcome the change of policy inherent in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the publication of the Explanatory Memorandum; it is very useful in relation to this Bill. Some Minister, both of the previous and current administrations, have failed to provide elaborate and essential explanatory memoranda.  I consider this one to be very valuable and useful and <Col N="889" /> I commend the Department in that regard.</P>
    <P>One is not quite sure at this stage what it is that ACRA want.  We were under no illusion and knew that they wanted us out because they were quite convinced that Fianna Fáil would abolish ground rents.  They said they understood the compensation aspect, but there seems to be some confusion as to what precisely ACRA want in relation to amendments to this Bill. They have not been in touch with us. Presumably we are <i>persona non grata</i> since last June and will probably remain so.  This Bill did not meet their view at that time as to the legislation to be enacted in relation to ground rents.  We pointed out that the kind of legislation they wanted and the issues they raised could not be met without completely changing the Constitution.  I was adamantly in favour of changing the Constitution, but the previous Cabinet and the current one have not been in favour of doing so in relation to that segment dealing with private property rights.  With that in mind, the very tentative objections currently being voiced in a rather muted way are unlikely to be met in any Committee Stage discussion of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been a source of considerable jaundiced cynicism on the part of a number of politicians.  There was a widespread public impression from what one might call the unwritten manifesto of the Fianna Fáil Party. I met this impression on the doorsteps in Dún Laoghaire.  The Fianna Fáil candidates were singing a totally different song in relation to ground rents to that which was being sung in Abbeyfeale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few ground rent landlords around there, some of them from decades past.  The song was sung and listened to and made an impression in the ballot box. The chorus of the song was knocked out today with the Minister's speech, but the reality is there that this is the legislation which the Coalition Government, after a lot of messing and toing and froing, eventually <Col N="890" /> produced and were ready to enact.  Unfortunately that was not the evolution.</P>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to remove the five-year period.  It is purely cosmetic.  In four-and-a-half years' time the Minister will be abolishing television licences, not just ground rents, and I can see the statement issued by the Minister four years and two months hence saying 4,231 people have bought out their ground rents and there will be another glorious opportunity presented to the remainder to buy out theirs and we will have a three line Bill extending the period for yet another five years.</P>
      <P>This five-year limit is arbitrary.  It has no relevance to the Bill.  It is just a piece of political cosmetic surgery. There should be no time limit.  The period should be left open-ended.  If I, in my wisdom, decide not to buy out my ground rent of £18 a year and I drop dead why should not whoever succeeds me be put in the position of being able to buy out the ground rent eight, ten or more years ahead?  I would not bother about this five-year limit.  It will only muck things up. This is the only amendment I would strongly suggest to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I come from a constituency which has the highest number of ground rents in the Republic.  It is also the highest rated.  One should really see the Proby Estate ground rents.  Most of the landlords are absentee landlords and here they are getting a very polite little minor kick in the groin.  I shed no tears for them and I hope the people in Dún Laoghaire and south Dublin will buy out their ground rents thereby removing that particular inhibition on their property.  Many of these rents will become extinct in the near future.  Some have only ten, 15 or 20 years to run.  I hope the people will avail of this provision and I hope the Minister will extend the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no particular observations to offer on the merits of the transfer from the county registrar to the Registrar of Titles.  I have the highest regard for the staff of the Land Registry.  They have been very overworked and I gather the Minister and his colleagues have files going backwards and forwards keeping things humming in respect <Col N="891" /> of the Land Registry.  No doubt the staff there would be capable of doing the work but I trust the Minister will allocate extra personnel.  He said he will increase the staff.  The Department of the Public Service will have a say in the increase and I sincerely hope the Minister will get all the staff required.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to issue a short explanatory leaflet.  My colleague, Deputy Horgan, suggests coupons or saving stamps for buying out ground rents.  One cannot buy out a ground rent with Green Shield stamps.  I suggest the Minister issues a leaflet that we can give to tenants and property owners explaining in simple terms the half dozen steps to be taken in order to buy out ground rents. There are people, including some members of the legal profession, who manage to make life very complicated for even the most perceptive among us.  I have seen legal luminaries getting involved up to their tonsils in a matter of a transfer which the Minister and I, neither being a legal luminary, could handle by the exchange of two or three letters at no cost to the tenant.  Lest this should become a new growth industry&mdash; the capacity of the legal profession to develop such industries is almost incredible&mdash;I urge the Minister to make a leaflet available.  He might too publish draft letters.  This would be of immense value to tenants purchasing their ground rents.  It could be distributed free of charge, as no doubt it will be by every Fianna Fáil cumann, and the Minister will get undying credit and political kudos for his exercise. Since he has been doing this sort of thing ever since he was in UCD, he should have no difficulty whatsoever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume it is fanciful for me to surmise the Minister is leaving the House because of the withering attack I am about to bring down on his head.  I rise principally to add my voice to those who seek to nail the lie implicit in this Bill presented to this House subsequent to the understanding by the people that, if Fianna Fáil were returned to office, ground rents would be abolished.  I propose to show that both the spirit <Col N="892" /> and the letter of that Fianna Fáil promise are now in dishonour.  Both are important because the defence of the Government, and it is a defence, hinges on the letter&mdash;not, mark you, the letter of the many colourful and attractive advertisements, not even the letter of the many local manifestos, but the letter of the national manifesto copies of which are increasingly rare and increasingly difficult to come by which makes me cherish all the more the original bound copy I have at my bedside.</P>

      <P>It is very relevant.  The Bill is in the manifesto.  The Chair will find that that is what this argument is about.  It is understandable that Members of this side of the House would feel a little piqued, to say the least, at losing the election in the magnificent way in which they lost.  Part of that pique derives from the fact that when they were asked prior to the election about ground rents some of them put their hands on their hearts and more of them put their hands in their pockets and said that in all honesty they could not give an unequivocal pledge to rid people of this centuries old burden. However, Fianna Fáil did not have any scruples about that and they rapidly responded to unanimous acclamation all over the country by saying in the almost classical words of one of their now Ministers, about ground rents like about so many other things &ldquo;there is no problem&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to ground rents in concept, I consider them to be essentially unacceptable and against the elements of natural justice, if you like. They are, and I think Fianna Fáil would feel that they are, part of a legacy that we inherited many centuries ago and they are repugnant to what that party and this Dáil stands for.  It is accurate to say that ground rents <Col N="893" /> exist because they were wrested from people by force and because they were the accoutrements of oppression and subjugation.  In general, their origins are lost in the mists of history but those origins are questionable in many cases.  We are talking about the right to own ground rent.  In so far as we are talking about the land of this country that right is synonymous with our right to breathe fresh air, and it would be just as ludicrous to tax that or to pay rent on it as it is to tax land.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that I was disappointed when I saw the pitiful response of the Government, a Government who would like to think that they had an exclusive corner in the republican tradition in so far as they are now proposing to provide a scheme leading to the abolition of ground rents.  I should like to make it clear that the Minister should not have the gall to come before the House and tell us that his pledge is now being honoured.  It is not being honoured. Unless he abolishes ground rents, as the people were led to expect, it will remain in dishonour.  There is not a Member of this House or a member of the public who does not know that up and down the country among the grass-roots and what I choose to call the cobblestones it was hawked that Fianna Fail would rid the country of ground rents once and for all.  That is what was whispered in the doorways and broadcast from the platforms around the country.  That is what was propagated and expressly commanded to be propagated by Fianna Fáil canvassers in all constituencies.</P>
    <P>It was clear to me, however, for the first time in the Private Members' Motion on this topic prior to Christmas that all was not well.  There was too smug a smile on the face of the Minister for Justice.  His backbenchers were also in possession of an attitude and a knowledge which I clearly was not, and it led me to believe, to quote Shakespeare, that something was rotten in the State of Denmark.  At that stage I knew there was no intention to do as the people were led to believe would be done.  Do the Minister and the Government stand by the local manifestos <Col N="894" /> of their Party organisation which were published and used as canvassing material in the general election last June?  Would the Minister be willing to make a comment on that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has answered my question.  He does not feel bound to honour what was said locally and printed in a myriad of forms during the election campaign <Col N="895" /> by various candidates.  The manifesto is an increasingly rare document; indeed, the majority of the people never read the manifesto, particularly the part on ground rents.  What they read were the various submissions from local candidates and what they heard was the speeches and canvassing material propagated at their doors, and that is not being honoured in the Bill before us.  Everybody on the far side of the House knows that that is absolutely true.</P>
      <P>The spirit of the Bill should be that ground rents would be abolished either by decree in some way or by constitutional amendment, if such was judged to be necessary, or by the Government buying them out.  That would be honouring the spirit of what people have been led to believe.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw your attention to the letter of the manifesto. As you know now, and you are probably sick of listening to it, the manifesto states that Fianna Fáil will provide a scheme that will lead to the abolition of existing ground rents. Some other speakers have said that there is a degree of ambiguity about this matter, that is a question of semantics. I do not accept that.  The Minister of State who, like myself, has experience in the classroom will be the first to admit that that &ldquo;will&rdquo; is not conditional.  It is not a &ldquo;may&rdquo; or a &ldquo;would&rdquo; or a &ldquo;should&rdquo; or a &ldquo;might&rdquo;.  It is a positive commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is subject to what follows &ldquo;will lead to&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that it may not lead to anything because the Minister cannot guarantee that people will respond in sufficient numbers to carry out that promise.  What should have been said and what this Bill accounts for is that the manifesto promise may lead or might lead to the abolition of ground rents.  It will not lead to the abolition of ground rents unless everybody unequivocally and spontaneously buys out their ground rents, and of course they will not.  Therefore it clearly does not lead to the abolition of existing ground <Col N="896" /> rents, and no amount of ambiguity or half-truth can distort that fundamental fact.  That is the essence of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It may lead to a partial abolition.  It will certainly lead to an abolition of existing residential ground rents for whoever chooses to buy them out, as it would have led to the same thing five years ago or under the Coalition's Bill it would have led to the same thing, but it will not lead to the abolition of existing ground rents period.  Anyone who says that&mdash; with respect, I was going to say is either a knave or a fool&mdash;has not looked closely at the implications of what is here.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Justice is to tell us that this Bill will lead&mdash;not may lead or could lead&mdash;to the abolition of existing ground rents then we have a Government who are masters of the half-truth, who indulge in ambiguity and exercise, in a politically advantageous way, in semantics and doubtful tactics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Chair's point, but my exercise will be futile unless I can show beyond a reasonable doubt that this Bill does not lead to the abolition of existing ground rents.  It will lead to that only if there is a unanimous response from all people now paying ground rent, and that is not guaranteed.  As Deputy Desmond hinted a few moments ago, in many cases it will not be bought out at all.  Many of us feel that the next Government may grasp the nettle and abolish ground rents completely. In the meantime inflation will take care of the existing ground rent price.  I am not talking about the spirit or the letter of the manifesto at all; I am talking about the degree to which that manifesto is carried out in the Bill.  It is not there.  I do not know whether this exercise in semantics is a natural characteristic of the Irish people.  Perhaps in Abbeyfeale they would say: &ldquo;It is a soft day, thank God&rdquo;, when there is torrential rain.  However, it seems <Col N="897" /> to be a very unwholesome example, indeed to be a cynical exercise in obtaining power by any means.  It is clear to me now&mdash;perhaps it should have been clearer earlier&mdash; that the document which gave rise to this Bill was a carefully worked out piece of literature which allowed sufficient trapdoors for escape when the time came, and we have not seen the last of it yet.</P>
      <P>The Minister is essentially cowering behind this most extreme and unlikely interpretation of a few words in the manifesto.  I spent some time today looking at the dictionary definitions and I defy contradiction on what I have stated.  &ldquo;Will lead&rdquo; is not what the Bill has in it.  It will not lead because there is no way the Government can guarantee that people will respond. Therefore, they are not entitled to say unequivocally that this Bill &ldquo;will lead&rdquo; as they promised.  The Government could have tackled this problem in a number of ways.  Some of us felt the Government would have bought out the ground rents.  This would have meant an enormous sum of money, but that pales into insignificance when one thinks of the sums we were talking of last week.  It makes it seem to me all the more likely that it could have been considered as a reasonable option for carrying out in an honourable way what was a major and popular political election plank of the Government. The Government could have decreed that ground rents were at an end because they were unconstitutional under Article 40.3.2º which states:</P>
      <P>The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a constitutional way of vindicating the property rights of every citizen.  The Government could then have let the courts decide on the constitutionality of the matter. There would not have been any critics on this side of the House if the Government said: &ldquo;Our intentions are noble and genuine; ground rents are at an end and let he who wishes to complain go before the courts.&rdquo;  That would have been acceptable, and if the courts <Col N="898" /> found against the Government the people would have felt that they were honourable.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the path of dishonour. It is a cheap and cynical way out of a major promise, and I will not be found wanting in terms of reminding the Government of their responsibility in this area.  How does the Bill fall short of what Fianna Fáil said they would do? It is not my intention to go over what our spokesman said this morning in regard to the differences between this and the proposed Coalition Bill.  That Bill was dealt with by the Coalition with a degree of conscientiousness and seriousness which perhaps did not match the political climate at the time and the kind of short cuts some people say were justified.  The Coalition felt that there were major problems involved and they had the honesty to say that.  This Bill only proposes to put a veneer on what the Coalition proposed to do.  It makes it slightly more attractive.  There are those who will say that it is going to be more expensive now than it was due to a number of factors, not the least of which is the multiplier which was upped in the budget last week.</P>
    <P>It could be stated that comparison between what the National Coalition were going to do and what the Government are about to do in relation to ground rents and other matters is not valid because the people rejected the National Coalition and voted for Fianna Fáil.  Therefore, it is not acceptable that Fianna Fáil speakers should now say that the National Coalition promised only certain things. That is not relevant.  In the middle of the spotlight is the Fianna Fáil promise unequivocally put to produce a scheme which will lead to the abolition of ground rents and that is what we are talking about.  Admittedly, the immediate response of ACRA seemed favourable, but when they had a chance to look at this scheme and consider it they had second thoughts.  I do not blame them.  They had been courteously received by the Opposition prior to the election and treated, I am sure, to the hospitality befitting the occasion and in character with the Minister for Justice.  I am afraid they <Col N="899" /> were also&mdash;perhaps not deliberately&mdash; conned into believing that in Fianna Fáil on the ground rents issue they had a winner.  We know what happened and we are seeing it now.</P>
    <P>There is an attempt to push through this Bill as meeting in the letter and the spirit the pledge given by Fianna Fáil.  ACRA, who do not speak for all those who pay ground rents but for a substantial body of organised opinion in the urban areas, now have second thoughts, and their opposition to the Bill is so strong that they continue to say to the people they represent that they should not pay ground rent.  In effect, that means to break the law.  That is the degree to which these thoughtful people reject the proposal before us. I can see no reason to modify that stance except to say that I would dissociate myself from any suggestion that people should act outside the law although I can understand the chagrin and the ire they must feel.</P>
    <P>The Minister said a number of other things which cannot be allowed to pass without comment.  He tried to answer the point <i>vis-à-vis</i> the manifesto, using it as the escape hatch, that the people who were opposed to this Bill in what it contains but not opposed to it being at least an indication of some progress although not the progress which was promised, would like that undertaking construed as if it were a promise to abolish ground rents directly.  He stated at column 787, Volume 303, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>But of course we never said that.</P>
    <P>The record is there for all to see.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is possibly a matter in this House of semantics, but I believe some action should be taken by those who were so vocally critical of the National Coalition to ensure that this promise is lived up to. Certainly it is the duty and the intention of those on this side of the House in the coming years to pursue the Government at every opportunity on living up to their promise to introduce a scheme which will lead to the abolition of existing ground rents.  It will not be this scheme which may, if we are lucky, if people have the few bob <Col N="900" /> if they feel like it and the lease is long enough so that it is worth their while as well as a lot of other ifs, lead to the abolition of ground rents.  We are talking about a scheme which was promised which would lead to the abolition of ground rents.  Part of what we are talking about here is the belief by some that there is somehow an escape for the Government by virtue of the words that are here.  I am not an expert in the English language, but even a child at the back of one of the classrooms where I was privileged to teach until last June could tell me that there is a very major difference between an unconditional &ldquo;will&rdquo; and what we have in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this Bill is one of the best buys for a long time.  It is a bargain but, like many other bargains that we will pass on the way home, we do not have to go in and buy.  The same applies here.  I believe that some people will buy out their ground rents but many others will not bother because they will feel that sooner or later a very genuine scheme which will abolish ground rents along the lines they spoke about will be introduced by the Government.  The Minister said that he has no crystal ball.  He must be the only member of the Government who has not one.  My reading of Government documents is that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development has a crystal ball and the Taoiseach also has one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Minister for Economic Planning and Development nor the Taoiseach has anything to do with this Bill.  We will stay on the Bill.  We could deal with the crystal ball that the Minister for Justice has or has not, but we do not want other Ministers on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is, as the Minister admits, one which may help to produce a solution.  He said that if he was asked if the scheme would lead to the abolition of ground rents he would answer: &ldquo;I do not have a crystal ball but I do not think it will.&rdquo; Is that what he promised before the election?  Is that the way the Government are going to deliver on this <Col N="901" /> pledge?  There was no &ldquo;think&rdquo; about it in the manifesto.  They said they would deliver on it, and when they came knocking on the doors and spoke to the old and the young they said: &ldquo;Trust in Fianna Fáil and we will abolish ground rents&rdquo;.  They did not say: &ldquo;We think we have a scheme which may abolish them&rdquo;.  They said quite categorically: &ldquo;We will&rdquo;.  The Minister is forced to admit in his speech today that he thinks it will. He then tacks on a five-year period, after which the price, which is the only attractive aspect of this particular offer, may be changed completely.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the fees to be charged were nominal.  Nominal is a relative term.  It may be nominal where the Minister for Justice comes from, but it is not nominal in my constituency. The Minister could very quickly point out to me that people on very small incomes may not pay ground rents, but many of them do. There are people with incomes of less than £20 per week who have to pay ground rent who will not find the price nominal.  The Minister goes on to rub salt into the wound and say that this fee could possibly be changed in order to avoid purely frivolous applications under the scheme.  I would like an explanation about that, because I cannot understand how a Minister could seriously put forward the view that someone would frivolously indulge in embarking on buying out his ground rent when it means parting with hardearned money.  In an inner city of Dublin constituency money is scarce. When we go to visit our constituents we are shocked by the amount of poverty that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the Bill proposes to provide strong encouragement for ground rent tenants to exercise their rights.  Of course it does and so did the previous Bill.  Some might argue that this Bill will provide stronger encouragement.  We should not be talking about providing encouragement. We should be talking about the mechanics of ending a system which has its roots in centuries of questionable acquisition of these ground rents. My view is that ground rents should be abolished.  I believe that is the view <Col N="902" /> the Government and many of the Government TDs share.  They will not say it now because they have lapsed into what I understand is the perpetual silence of the Government backbenchers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy like to say how he would abolish them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had the answer to that I would be sitting in the Minister's place.  The Coalition Government conscientiously looked into their souls to try to give the answer to the Minister of State's question.  There are at least three answers.  The first is to say that they are abolished and let the courts worry about it.  I would not recommend that because it is clearly unfair.  The second is to say that they are abolished and we will talk about compensation in cases of proven hardship and let the courts decide the constitutionality of the issue.  Each of those at least has the merit of being honourable.  The third way is for the Government to say: &ldquo;We will buy them out&rdquo;.  In view of the large amount of money which was spent last week with great largesse that should not present a great problem to the Government.  Those are the three ways, which I, as a relatively new Member of the House can think about.  There must be others, but it is not my job to say what they are.  It is the Government's job, which they should be getting on with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject the view that this fee is nominal.  It is not just £5.  It is more than that, and is also subject to review if people do not grab the bargain while it is going.  It is not so long since a widow was able to show me her total financial possessions at that moment amounting to something around 5p or 6p which is all she had to keep body and soul together.  That lady also had to pay £3 per year ground rent.  That is not nominal.  It is nominal in relation to the lush plains of Abbeyfeale in the Golden Vale.  It may even be nominal in relation to one's substantial income but it is not nominal if one is born and reared in a deprived area of the city and has been forced by an iniquitous system foisted on one from birth to pay ground rent to people one never even met, who provide no service <Col N="903" /> for you and who have the dubious power of owning the piece of ground which the Government give you to stand on.  That is how ridiculous the whole concept of ground rent is.</P>
    <P>Many unfortunate people who have to pay ground rent pay up because they do not understand anything better and have no will to fight for a better system.  They will have to keep fighting, because this Bill does not give any help to them.  The Minister said that this bargain would be available only for the coming five years.  How can one put a limit on what is right and wrong?  Why it is right, as this Bill proposes, to put forward those measures for the next five years and not right after that?  What has five years to do with it?  I admit it happily coincides with the cyclical pattern of Irish public life and that we can expect an election in five years.  I do not know if that has anything to do with the possibility of a review.  That is another aspect which was not talked about.  Perhaps that will be dropped in Committee.  It should, because clearly it would be unfair to some people.  For instance, people might inherit a house or property from a mother or father and find the ground rent had not been bought out.  They would be deprived and inequities arise. Surely the whole purpose of this Bill is to establish what is right in natural justice and in law.  One cannot place time limits on that and any such suggestion ill becomes the Government.</P>
    <P>In his speech this morning the Minister referred also to the manner in which the work was to be carried out.  I do not accept the assurances he gave that all would be right in that regard.  I can foresee major difficulties.  I do not want to create some where none may exist but I am worried about the degree to which existing facilities and staffing may or may not be augmented to cope with the problem.  Undoubtedly there will be a substantial number of people who will be sufficiently interested in this offer to take it up although it does not at all meet what was promised or even the standards of ACRA, which organisation, to say the least, could not be said to be hostile <Col N="904" /> to the Government.  I have been tempted to think one or two less charitable thoughts in recent times.  If ACRA say this Bill is so unacceptable that people should continue to break the law by refusing to pay ground rents, there must be something wrong with it.  Therefore, it is not pure politics about which we are speaking and I would like the Minister of State to bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the people who agitated so strongly for change&mdash; many of them from all political walks of life&mdash;that, regardless of this Bill, they should continue to fight for justice. Justice just does not happen.  It has to be willed and worked for. People should persist in pressurising their public representatives on all sides to ensure that this Parliament has the courage to grasp this admittedly difficult nettle: it is too close to questions concerning the rights of private property for many in this Chamber.  As far as I am concerned it is a fundamentally important question.</P>
    <P>I have had letters in recent weeks about the content of the Bill, about the proposals that appeared to be in the Minister's mind around the time of the discussion we had on the Private Member's Motion.  I can assure the Minister of State that people are not happy, the public are not happy.  Happiness, like everything else, is relative; but there is strong concern and a feeling that they have been let down.  I do not think the Minister of State at the Department of Education would like that. I know him to be an honourable man, a person who would not be willing to believe that people should not honour their commitments.  I should like some indication from him&mdash;if he feels he can give it&mdash;that this Bill may be reviewed, that perhaps the attempt being made here to escape that commitment will be examined again, because he knows as well as I do that this is not what was promised.  More important than he or I knowing this, there is a growing volume of people who know that it is not what was promised.  I have had letters explaining with chapter and verse better than I could where parts of the Bill fall down.  I should be happy to pass them on to the relevant <Col N="905" /> Minister and see his response.  I should not take any particular glee in that exercise because it is a very serious issue.</P>
    <P>When the election was contested and lost by the outgoing Government I felt that there is a time and tide in the affairs of men which comes and goes, ebbs and flows, and that perhaps it was even wholesome for democracy that we should have change.  But if the price of that change is to be government by deceit, by dishonour, taking the path of power by means, methods and words which are questionable, then that price is too high.  Although I am getting older I should like to think I speak in a particular way for young people who want to have faith in this sometimes gloomy Chamber, who want to believe that men and women in politics say what they mean and will act according to their word.  In this Bill there is very little evidence of that. Quoting Shakespeare again, I have been tempted sometimes to brand the Minister for Justice as a villain smiling at the cheek, a goodly apple rotten at the heart.  I do not want to do that because it is too early yet.  Certainly he has a perpetual smile which conceals, shall we say, a mind which is complex. Perhaps that is necessary for ministerial posting.  I would say to him, through the Minister of State, to look at this Bill again, to try to restore confidence not merely in the Government &mdash;because this Government are birds of passage: in five, ten, 15 or 20 years they will be gone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Killilea's speech is over I will be happy to address myself to the Bill&mdash;a model of oratory, indeed.  In his introductory speech the Minister for Justice referred to this Bill as one of a trilogy.  It is not by any means unusual that a new Government, coming into office after a general election, should introduce a Bill or Bills which were in their major part fashioned by the preceding administration even if they were of a different political persuasion.  It is not even unusual, I suspect, that for the first year of their existence, such a Government should produce virtually a <Col N="908" /> majority of Bills whose genesis was in the administration of their predecessors in office.</P>
      <P>It is, I suspect, faintly unusual that one Bill which was drafted by the preceding administration should, with several strokes of the sword, become triplets and emerge as three Bills.  This Bill we are discussing here today is only part of one major Bill introduced but not completed by the previous administration. The other two parts of the trilogy to which the Minister referred are also parts of that same major Bill.</P>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill as far as it goes.  In common with many other speakers, I too would welcome the day, if it ever should come to pass, when ground rents would be completely a thing of the past.  I doubt that that will happen in the immediate or even in the foreseeable future.  This Bill, culled as it is almost in its entirety from that presented by the preceding administration, is a step along the road to that.  We have heard a great many allegations in this House and outside it, but especially in the past few hours, as to whether or not this Bill meets the campaign pledge offered to the electorate by the then Opposition.  The pledge itself was read out by the Minister and commented on, parsed and analysed by himself and a number of other speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to go over all that ground in detail, but I want to say one or two things about it, perhaps one or two things which have not been said before.  I have been working with words for about 20 years.  I am something of a connoisseur in the use of words.  Occasionally I make mistakes and the former Tánaiste, Mr. MacEntee, is not slow to point out when I make them.  I am probably right in saying that, of all the delicately and carefully phrased sections in the manifesto presented to the people before the last election, this section on ground rents is among the most spectacular in its aims and results.  Probably more than any other section of the manifesto it achieved the result most political documents no matter what party issue them strive to achieve, <Col N="909" /> that is, to give the appearance of a commitment without actually giving the solid ground of such a commitment.</P>
    <P>When I saw that phrase: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil will provide a scheme which will lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents,&rdquo; I was fairly clear as to what it meant.  I knew it was highly unlikely, to put it mildly, that the Fianna Fáil Party in Government would expropriate existing residential ground rents.  I regarded it as my political duty to go about saying at the top of my voice, and to the maximum possible extent to all who would listen to me, that this was not what the Fianna Fáil Party were proposing to do.  To some extent the fact that this message did not get across to many members of the electorate may be counted a political failure on the part of the then Government.</P>
    <P>But&mdash;and this is a very big but&mdash;we had also to contend not just with the manifesto itself but with a sub-stratum of argument which was often advanced to undercut our claim that Fianna Fáil were not, in fact, promising to abolish ground rents.  Part of this sub-stratum of argument was of the kind already referred to by Deputy Desmond.  At a meeting organised by the Association of Combined Residents Associations on the borders of our two constituencies the present Minister for State, Deputy David Andrews, not only stood up and averred that this was what Fianna Fáil were proposing to do but said that Fianna Fáil had legal advice to the effect that there was no constitutional difficulty about the abolition of ground rents.</P>
    <P>Either they have discovered since coming to office that the advice they then got was bad advice and could not be acted on, or they have not.  If they have discovered that the advice was bad advice, they should at least have the decency to tell us.  My real quarrel is not so much with that aspect of it as with the single word &ldquo;abolish&rdquo;. Obviously it was the connotation of this word which was responsible more than anything else for a general public impression about what would happen to ground rents, an impression which this Bill does not fulfil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> The dictionary definition of &ldquo;abolish&rdquo; which I consulted in great haste about half an hour ago is to annul or make void.  So, the translation of this pledge is that it is a pledge to introduce a scheme to annul or make void existing residential ground rents.  With all respect, it does not do that.  It does something else, and that something else can be explained in very plain English as well.  It is a scheme which will lead not to the abolition of existing residential ground rents but to their exchange for a sum in cash.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental difference between abolishing something and exchanging it for cash.  You can exchange almost anything for cash, but that is not to abolish it.  That is where I believe the fundamental, dangerous and unfortunate ambiguity was contained. We are dealing here with a scheme which will allow people to exchange ground rents for cash.  It has got nothing to do with the abolition of ground rents.  This is the message that should go from this House, and particularly from this side of the House, to people who are watching the progress of this debate and who are wondering what happened.  In order to explain to people what happened we must first explain to them what they thought would happen as well as explaining why it is not happening and why something else that is quite different is happening.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with what I believe to be the fundamental problem in regard to the relationship between the manifesto and the Bill, I should like to deal with some aspects of the Bill itself.  The matter of the five-year limit has been mentioned by many speakers and I will do no more than repeat my agreement with them that the limit should be removed.  There are a number of other problems that deserve attention. I am worried that the Bill does not attack satisfactorily the problem created by the pyramid of ground rent interests by the simple difficulty of ascertaining not necessarily the primary ground rent landlord but also subsequent and head ground rent landlords. This may give rise to problems in the future and I would be glad of <Col N="911" /> the Minister's assurance that this section of the Bill is watertight in all respects.</P>
    <P>There are individual problems that the Bill may not touch.  For instance, I am thinking of an example brought to me by a lady living in this city who pays ground rent.  As part of her general ground lease she has an obligation not merely to pay her own ground rent but to collect ground rents from half-a-dozen or more ground rent payers resident in the neighbourhood. What will happen to people in that unfortunate situation?  Do they find themselves in the position that they have bought out their own ground rents but, because of the other terms of the lease, are being forced to collect ground rents from other unfortunates? That would be a perversion of the spirit behind even this Bill and it is something that the Minister should consider.  The Bill should attempt to ensure that any conditions of a lease that are connected to or bound up with the ground rent should be extinguished by the exchange of that ground rent for cash.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is a difference of opinion between the Minister and myself as to what is the major issue.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I have always been clear that the real problem of ground rents in the problem of legal costs.</P>
    <P>I do not deny for a minute that the problem of legal costs is a very substantial problem in relation to ground rents.  I hope that the mechanism adopted by the Minister in this Bill will be as efficient as it is inexpensive, but he must have been deaf for the last four to ten years if he seriously believes that the real problem in this area is the problem of legal costs.  For the entire duration of the ground rents campaign the real problem, as depicted by the organisations and individuals who wanted them abolished, was whether the rents would be abolished without compensation. It was a fundamental plank of the campaign launched by the Association of Combined Residents Associations that there should be no compensation <Col N="912" /> to ground rent landlords, that most if not all had been compensated 100 times over in terms of the money they had taken out of their properties.  While it is true that legal costs are a substantial part of the problem, it is by no means true that they are the only part of the problem. The other much deeper issue is the question of compensation and that raises the issues of private ownership which were referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>We are not just talking about private ownership.  When we talk about ground rents we talk about private ownership of land and this has been one of the most serious and longstanding problems in relation to this matter.  In this country, as in so many other countries, land is probably the greatest single source of wealth.  John Stuart Mills said it all 130 years ago when he argued with some wit that &ldquo;owners of land make money as it were while they sleep&rdquo;.  That is a classic definition of the ground rent landlord.</P>
    <P>If I attack the private ownership of land in the sense the ground landlord understood it and benefited from it, it is not by any means to attack the concept of private property generally.  In fact, the constitution of my own party explicitly recognises a right to private property.  I believe there is a legitimate right to private property and indeed to the private ownership of the house in which one lives and a reasonable amount of land to enjoy it.  However, the problem we have failed to face, which this Bill fails to face, and the problem that would take a constitutional amendment to resolve, is that the ownership of land is a separate issue completely.  In my belief it is quite inappropriate to consider land in general within the context of the debate about private property because land is fundamentally a common resource, a community resource, and should be treated as such in our Constitution and in our legislation.  I am sorry that this Government have not taken this basic lesson to heart, although from the financial legislation which they propose to introduce it is easy to understand the reason.  I would remind the House, and beyond the <Col N="913" /> House the people who are following this debate, that this problem which is being dealt with in this Bill is only the tip of the iceberg.  The rest of that iceberg is related to the ownership of land in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on this Bill.  I wish also to welcome some aspects of the Bill.  There has been much discussion in this House on this Bill since the Minister introduced it.  Some of the comments have been by way of interruption and others by way of inference and they should not go unchallenged.</P>
      <P>I am reminded to say this because of an interjection by the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Tunney, when Deputy Keating was on his feet, when he asked him how he proposed to abolish ground rents.  The National Coalition never claimed to be in a position to abolish existing ground rents, but they said that they would prohibit the creation of new ground rents.  Indeed, the Minister's predecessor went to great lengths to explain to people who sought information on this point about a year ago that what they wanted done could not be done easily.  Anything is possible, but the then Minister was of the opinion that the cost involved in abolishing existing ground rents was such as to be prohibitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Towards the end of May the Fianna Fáil manifesto was published.  After-wards many of my supporters, having read the document, approached me and asked why the Minister was maintaining that existing ground rents could not be abolished while Fianna Fáil held the opposite view.  This was the accepted interpretation of the manifesto in this regard.  The Minister today said, referring to the extract from the manifesto that has been quoted here repeatedly that it was clear that the legislation would provide a scheme leading to the abolition of residential ground rents.  Clarity is relative.  What may be clear to one person may not be clear at all to somebody else.  The Minister might be tempted to reply by saying that something might not be too clear to the dim-witted among us. This may be a fair comment, but let me remind him that to say that would <Col N="914" /> be saying that there are many thousands of dim-witted people and many dim-witted members in organisations concerned directly with this problem. There is a note on the cover of the ACRA document which claims that as an immediate step the first-stage Bill to prohibit the creation of future ground rents results from the Minister's action in respect of a specific ACRA request made at their July 20 meeting.  The note continues that while retaining the original commitment, comprehensive legislation abolishing existing ground rents would be introduced within six months of Fianna Fáil being returned to office.  The association understood that they interpreted the manifesto correctly and that ground rents were to be abolished. Eight months later we find that this is not so.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcomed in so far as it can go in present circumstances to alleviate hardship and to rectify the problem, but, having said that, it must be said also that the way in which the statement was framed was misleading and, worse still, was meant to be misleading. As has been pointed out by people more qualified than me to make such assertions there are ways in which ground rents can be abolished.  The problem is one of constitutional difficulties but there are also money problems. Perhaps the cost involved would be prohibitive.  I do not know whether the Minister has costed the exercise in the light of the manifesto.  He, also, in good faith may have intended to abolish ground rents but having costed the exercise decided they could not be abolished.  Now he has put the onus on the people concerned to purchase their ground rents, if they wish.</P>
    <P>The other aspect towards which much comment has been directed during the day is the cost in so far as the tenant is concerned.  The Minister has referred to the matter as a bargain buy. That is so provided it works as the Minister thinks it should work.  However, it may not be as simple as it looks.  Many tenants who would wish to purchase their ground rents could be told to go to the Land Registry where, on payment of £5, they would be given a certificate stating that they are now <Col N="915" /> the registered owners of the properties on which their houses stand.  The people must realise soon that the situation is not as simple as that.  What will happen is that many thousands of tenants wishing to buy out their ground rents will seek a solicitor to handle the documentation, thereby incurring some expenses.  The ceiling of £5 for this part of the exercise is a definite advantage, but it will not be possible to sidestep the legal costs because people, perhaps because of their failure to realise how simple the exercise is or because of fear of the unknown, will seek the help of a solicitor. They have been conditioned to act in this way in regard to titles and so on.  In any case such action is required in almost all cases concerning dealings in property.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the nature of what we are dealing with here and of what the tenant is expected to do is the Minister envisaging a situation where, for example, a queue of people will form outside the Land Registry office holding £5 in their hands to demand certificates that will state clearly that they are now the registered owners of their properties?  The matter is not as simple as that, as anybody who endeavours to act in this way will find out.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has pointed out rightly the cost involved has been the kernel of the problem down through the years.  This problem has been alleviated to a major degree by what is being done here, but I would not oversimplify the situation.  I would hope that in the course of the debate on Committee Stage the people will be told in detail what they are to do in order to avail of this &ldquo;bargain buy&rdquo; which the Minister is putting before them.  I would suggest that the Minister should take great pains in explaining the matter because of the ignorance in this regard.  I include myself among the ignorant.  I have not any legal training and if I were paying ground rent the first person I would run to would be a solicitor.  A solicitor is entitled to his hire in the same way as anybody else.</P>
    <P>The Minister has inferred that <Col N="916" /> people set out deliberately to misinterpret what was promised.  This is not so.  The public at large and the media accepted at face value what was said and the Minister and the other members of the Government did not try to quell the aura of enthusiasm concerning the abolition of ground rents until it actually came to the crunch and people had to be brought to their senses.  By their silence I suggest that there was some degree of misconception planted in the minds of the people by some degree of deceit. To be charitable, it may not have been done deliberately; but that is how it turned out.  Whether the Minister likes it or not, he is now seen to be backtracking on what was expected of him and on what was said at the time of the election.</P>
    <P>The other matter which concerns me is the question of compensation.  I should like to know whether this matter has been examined in detail. Would it be possible to simplify the matter through the purchase of ground rents by the Government?  I appreciate that there may be constitutional problems and it might be unfair to landlords.  I would not regard the ground rents charged by landlords as rack rents, nor would I regard landlords as exploiters.  They have a perfect right to income from property which they own.  One cannot grab that right and tell them that this is something they should never have had.  The only other option is that the Government should purchase the ground rents on behalf of the people.  In the light of the wording of the promise, I should like to know if the Government have ascertained the cost of such an exercise and, if so, I should like to know the result.  I am fully prepared to accept the word of the Minister if he says that upon scrutinising the cost of such a scheme it was found to be absolutely prohibitive because of the state of the economy&mdash;despite last week's splurge.  I would accept that if I knew that an effort had been made to find out the sum of money involved.</P>
    <P>Regarding the cost of ground rents, I am not quite clear what is meant.  I presume this will be clarified during the debate on Committee Stage.  There <Col N="917" /> are certain types of lessees to whom the Bill applies and other types to whom it does not apply.  There is a third group in relation to whom discretion will have to be used in deciding whether they come within the scope of the Act.  I am sure that the Minister will give a comprehensive answer on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of staff in the Land Registry and every Member of the House is aware that this is the reason for the long delays.  I notice that the Minister has given a specific undertaking on the matter of staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Already 57 people have been brought in to deal with the arrears of ordinary work in the Land Registry and there will be additional staff to deal with ground rents.  A new section will be set up to deal with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is good news and I am delighted to here it.  The Minister's predecessor was thinking on the same lines in that there was to be a clearing house for ground rents business, which was to be the office of the county registrar.  The county registrar's office would be the proper place to deal with this business for the simple reason that these offices are in close proximity to people and more accessible than the Land Registry.  The extra staff will expedite business but it will also involve solicitors.  A householder who is now paying ground rent is not likely to handle this matter on his own.  Extra costs will be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I am in full agreement with the abolition of ground rents but the manner in which this matter was approached originally leaves a great deal to be desired.  The Minister's party would have got on just as well had they come out straight and said they knew, as everybody else knew, that existing ground rents could not be abolished for the moment.  They could have left it as vague as that in the hope that some bonanza would come our way later and the State would be in a position to buy out these ground rents.  The double-think and the semantics are not worthy of comment. People paying high ground rents are <Col N="918" /> not interested in the meanings of words.  They are interested only in whether or not they have to pay exorbitant sums to buy out their ground rents.  This they will have to do now.  The formula has been simplified somewhat but it is a long way from what the people expected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad this Bill has been brought before the House at an early stage.  My main concern is in regard to the morality of ground rents, how to go about their abolition and whether or not the Government promised to abolish ground rents.  The Minister and one other Fianna Fáil speaker today claimed they did not promise to abolish ground rents.  In the manifesto they certainly used a very clever wording: &ldquo;provide a scheme which will lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents&rdquo;. That was paraded throughout the length and breadth of the country by every Fianna Fáil candidate.  Fianna Fáil were going to abolish ground rents.</P>
      <P>The previous Government, apparently correctly, argued that it was constitutionally impossible to abolish ground rents.  The Fianna Fáil stand was that they did not accept this and they would find a way to abolish ground rents.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That will not be the case.  The fact is the impression was clearly given, and it was taken up by every ordinary decent member of the Fianna Fáil Party, that Fianna Fáil, if returned to power, would abolish <Col N="919" /> ground rents.  What they propose to do is almost identical with what the National Coalition proposed to do. There is very little difference.  Whether or not there is a constitutional problem, I would go further than any other Member of this House.  I would seek a constitutional amendment to enable us to abolish ground rents.  I believe they are absolutely immoral. Ground landlords are extracting thousands of pounds from young married couples in every housing estate in the country.  It is nothing but extortion and the Constitution was never designed to protect extortionists and to prevent justice being given to the people.  If there is some loophole, then there should be an amendment of the Constitution to close that loophole.  I do not believe there would be any opposition to it.</P>
      <P>Some may argue that abolition would amount to confiscation.  Confiscation in Irish historical terms is a very emotive word.  Even if we cannot go to the expense of holding a referendum to amend the Constitution in order to abolish ground rents, I do not see why another idea of mine could not be put into operation.  I suggest that in the next budget income from ground rents should be taxable at 99 per cent.  That would be a positive disincentive.  The Government could pay 99 per cent by way of grant to those who have to pay ground rents. That would not be confiscation and it would be no less penal than is the brunt of taxation on those who have to meet PAYE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told that initially ground rents were designed to allow people to rent land for building where they could not afford the purchase price of the land.  That reason has long since disappeared. I live in a housing estate in the south of the city.  There are 320 houses and the ground rent on each is £52 a year.  That is a massive income to a ground landlord, an absolutely unjustifiable income.  I am not in the least bit thankful to the Minister for providing me with an opportunity to buy out my ground rent because I believe he is not protecting my rights and the rights of thousands of other <Col N="920" /> vulnerable people who have to pay ground rents.  Young married couples will take a loan at almost any cost as was evidenced by those who took SDA loans at 12½ per cent.  They are now stuck with this rent for the rest of their lives.  That highlights their vulnerability in their anxiety to provide themselves with a roof over their heads. High rates of interest still obtain and nothing is done about them.  The ground rents charged for houses built in the last ten years are exorbitant.  The effect of this Bill will be to give those exploiters a huge lump sum.  We know money is diminishing in value but if everyone buys out his ground rent an enormous capital sum will become available to ground landlords, to the exploiters, and they can reinvest this and exploit others possibly in the process. That is what this Bill is doing.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is not a criticism of the Minister or of the Government because, as the Minister said, the Bill is substantially the Bill of the National Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>There are three ways in which ground rents could be abolished.  If you talked about it long enough you would find other ways.  One way would be to seek constitutional amendments to prevent or to remove the reputed ground ownership of land to someone other than the owner of the house that is on that land.  The second way is that it could be taxed at a rate to make it attractive for the landlord to present it to the tenant.  That is what I would do, and I would make no bones about doing it.  The third way in which it could be done, and this would be more honest and would meet the commitments which Fianna Fáil are understood to have given, would be for the State to purchase the ground rents and to leave the property remaining in the ownership of the person concerned.  I am not advocating the nationalisation of ground rents, but if the Government were to nationalise ground rents or if they were to pay for it themselves, they would be living up to their commitments.</P>
    <P>Many people that I canvassed during the election told me that Fine Gael would not abolish ground rents and that they were voting for Fianna <Col N="921" /> Fáil for that reason.  I was confused by some of the statements of some of the officers of ACRA.  Their vice-chairman, I think, made what could only be described as a party political speech which was to embarrass him later when he realised that he too had been conned.  The speech indicated that Fianna Fáil would abolish ground rents.  However, I did not hear too much about it from him when he realised that that is not what the Minister intended, whatever their canvassers said.  Like the Garvey question, the Taoiseach did not say it but his canvassers said it.  He did not read that it would provide a scheme which would lead to the abolition of existing ground rents.  He read that ground rents were going to be abolished if Fianna Fáil were returned to power.</P>
    <P>Judging by some of the political columns, the members of the Press Gallery are tired of Opposition Members waving documents showing Fianna Fáil commitments during the election.  It happened six or seven times and there was adverse comment in the Press.  We are not supposed to show that Fianna Fáil are not keeping their promises.  When I asked the Minister for the Environment if he was going to introduce improvements or changes for purchasers of corporation dwellings prior to July 1973, in relation to whom grave injustices exist and where, in my constituency, the local Fianna Fáil manifesto committed them to reducing the difference of the dearer pre-1973 prices to the lower prices of July 1973, the Minister said that he never saw the document, notwithstanding that on it there were photographs of a shadow Fianna Fáil Minister and two other Fianna Fáil candidates one of whom was Mrs. Eileen Lemass.  That is an instance of a deliberate disparity in Fianna Fáil's policy, cagily produced at national level.  It was deliberately distorted to give the most favourable impression, the impression most likely to gain votes.  Many ordinary members of the Fianna Fáil Party must feel deceived, and they have every right to feel that way.</P>
    <P>It is clear from events since the <Col N="922" /> general election, particularly in regard to the budget and in regard to the abolition of household rates, which benefits the owner of the mansion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that the concern by the Government to meet the whims and criticisms of the wealthy few, such as the abolition of wealth tax and the abolition of rates, does not benefit the poor local authority tenant, but someone living in a big house in Malahide&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am leading to the point that the poor have suffered from many of this Government's measures. In yesterday's debate Deputy Smith supported the cry that the poor did not receive anything in the budget.  I am glad to see him in the House.  He is one of the few Fianna Fáil Deputies to appear in the House during this debate.  In fact, and this is where the concern of Fianna Fáil for the welfare of the ordinary people comes in, apart from the Minister and one backbencher we have not had a contribution from a Fianna Fáil Member.  We did have an interruption from Deputy Killilea who is fast becoming the Government's heckler-in-chief.  That is an indication of Fianna Fáil's concern for ordinary people, because this Bill will affect ordinary people; it will further extend the exploitation of them and further enshrines the protection presumed to be given by the Constitution to exploiters and speculators.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Constitution was intended to do that, and I do not know whether a test case to the Supreme Court would be found to be unconstitutional.  If necessary a Constitutional amendment should be introduced and this would not be opposed here if the Government sought to clarify the Article which purports to make the abolition of ground rents unconstitutional.  The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" />  They would like that undertaking construed as if it were a promise to abolish ground rents directly, leaving landlords either with no compensation or to be compensated by the State.</P>
    <P>That is the impression that was abroad until the Bill was introduced.  It is still the impression many people have.  It was the deliberate policy of the Fianna Fáil organisation to give that impression, and the Minister has the gall in his speech to say: &ldquo;but of course we never said that&rdquo;.  How many times have we heard that since the election, even when it was in print as I stated earlier in relation to a number of other items?</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>Moreover, nothing that I have said in this House or outside it can reasonably be taken as indicating that I, or the Government, favoured abolition in that sense.</P>
    <P>I would love the Government to conduct a public opinion poll on that subject.  They should ask how many people understood the manifesto to say that they were going to abolish ground rents.  I would be surprised if the figure was less than 80 per cent.  If a poll of Fianna Fáil backbenchers was carried out it would give the same result.  Of course, Government backbenchers have no say in the running of the country, because if they had the Government would pay more attention to the man in the street and less attention to the wealthy.</P>
    <P>Later, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I should like to add that concentration on the question of compensation tends, to my mind, to cloud the real issue.</P>
    <P>As I see it compensation or the payment of money by people for what they really own is the real issue.  They must own the land on which their houses have been built.  I cannot see how it could be construed otherwise, except in legal fiction. Many people feel sore about having to pay more money for their houses.  This matter affects local authority houses also.  Many local authority tenants are now purchasing <Col N="924" /> their houses.  In this regard one of the few ground landlords who could not be termed as exploiters are local authorities because they charge a ground rent of 5p per annum, when asked and, of course, it is never asked for.  This does not create any problem. I represent a constituency which consists mostly of local authority houses and the people there are quite happy about the situation.</P>
    <P>Most people cannot understand why they should have to pay money to fictional companies set up as ground landlords.  Under the Bill local authorities will be compelled to sell their ground to the tenant purchasers of local authority houses.  The ground rent for local authority houses was deliberately fixed at a notional figure, so that local authorities who must continue to provide houses for those who cannot afford to build their own will now be penalised when this Bill becomes law in that the compensation they will get will be very little.  At the same time the private landlord will get a lot. I am very much opposed to this, and I am against local authority tenants or tenant purchasers being treated differently to any other purchasers.  In my view it would be unconstitutional to have terms for local authority tenants different to those for other houseowners.  That is provided for in the 1966 Act.  Under that Act a purchaser of a local authority house can be asked for a percentage of the notional profit on his house if he resells it within five years.  Some people purchased their houses for £2,000 even though the houses were worth in the region of £7,000.  They were given this concession because they had been paying rent for 30 years.  The price they were asked to pay for the house related to the original cost of building it.  This offended some wealthy people. I heard wealthy people, including wealthy public representatives, calling such people speculators because they were selling their houses and making some profit.</P>
    <P>I was Lord Mayor of Dublin when this was discussed and I was in charge of many meetings of Dublin City Council when this was raised.  I was not very fair on that subject because I <Col N="925" /> deliberately delayed and adjourned meetings to avoid that imposition on local authority tenants and to avoid having any discrimination against local authority tenant purchasers or to have any second class ownership of houses in the country.</P>
    <P>The local authorities will now be required to sell off land at low cost. I can see possible problems in the years to come, not in 20 years' time or 30 years' time, but probably in 60, 70 or 80 years' time when the present local authority redevelopment areas will be slums.  The local authorities will then have to repurchase all that land for public development at a huge cost to the State. The Minister should look at that point. This is where nationalisation of the land would possibly be a better answer than the one provided in this Bill, because at least the land would be in the ownership of the State for future public development in the generations ahead.  One has to talk in the long term in relation to houses.</P>
    <P>I would not like there to be any differential treatment of local authority tenant purchasers against anybody else, but I believe there is a problem there of land now in the ownership of the State through the local authorities being given away because of the deliberate policy of only having nominal ground rents and that land having to be repurchased at exorbitant prices in 60 to 100 years' time, thereby increasing the future cost of local authority dwellings.  That would be a bad legacy to leave to our successors.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a step in the right direction. Legal costs were a problem for those who decided to buy their ground rents.  Many people were put off by them.  I believe, therefore, that this Bill is a small step in the right direction. I believe ground rents are immoral and that the Government should do what the Fianna Fáil canvassers told the people they would do, do away with ground rents and not ask people to pay anything for what is truly their own.</P>

      <P>This is a further Bill dealing with ground rents.  Before the election the National Coalition brought a Bill before the House dealing with the abolition of ground rents.  Our Bill <Col N="926" /> succeeded in going further than the two Bills Fianna Fáil have brought before the House, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill which was before the House recently, which prevented the creation of new ground rents, and this Bill.  Our Bill was better than those two <i>ad hoc</i> Bills regarding ground rents.</P>
      <P>Steps should be taken to try to bring in a comprehensive Bill in the next two or three years to encompass all the Acts dealing with rents, ground rents, leases, proprietary leases and building leases.  A similar effort was made with regard to company law. Our company law was codified and brought in under one comprehensive Act.  The comprehensive company law Act did a lot to have all the company legislation under one Act which could be dealt with by students of law, practitioners and people involved in the different types of rent.</P>
      <P>We have two small Bills dealing with ground rents.  Many people who are not involved in this Bill will read in <i>The Irish Times, Irish Independent, The Irish Press</i> or <i>The Cork Examiner</i> tomorrow what the Minister said in the House today.  They will find that he said:</P>
      <P>The Landlord and Tenant Acts have since 1931 sought to distinguish between those two types of rents and to provide for the rights of the parties involved as appropriate to each type.  The Acts did this initially by developing the concepts of a &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; and a &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo; as the types of leases which were taken to reserve a ground rent as distinct from an occupational rent.  The problem, was however, that as time went by these concepts were found to be inadequate to describe all the types of lease which were found to reserve ground rents.  As a result, in the 1958, 1967 and 1971 Acts new types of leases and tenancies had to be added to the concepts already established in 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had Acts in 1958, 1967, 1971 and we now have two in 1977.  There are also other Acts dealing with rents. There are the Acts dealing with local authority housing, the old vested cottages <Col N="927" /> and many others.  There are so many different Acts dealing with many different types of rent that I believe it is necessary to have all brought in under one umbrella.  If I do nothing more this evening than put that idea into the minds of the people empowered to bring in such legislation, then I will have done a lot for the people involved in ground rents.</P>
    <P>Going back over the history of leases in so many different situations, leases and tenancies in regard to local authorities with regard to, say, fee simple, life interests, life estates, it is very difficult to read through all of the legislation: it is becoming well nigh impossible.  If all of this could be incorporated in the one Bill it would be of tremendous assistance to everybody.  I do not minimise the enormity of the task involved.  It would necessitate a vast amount of work in the Department of Justice to introduce such legislation, but its benefits would be enormous to all concerned.  I put it to the Government that this will prove necessary.  Otherwise we will be left in a situation in which this will recur.</P>
    <P>My reading of the terms of this Bill is that they will last for a period of five years only.  In other words, tenants who apply to buy out their ground rents will have to do so within a period of five years.  The point to which I am referring is the vesting of the fee simple in dwellinghouses.  Section 18 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Bill 1977, dealing with the vesting of the fee simple in dwelling-houses says:</P>
    <P>This Part shall have effect only in relation to applications made under it during the period of five years beginning on the commencement of this Act.</P>
    <P>My reading of that is that, when this period of five years expires, we will have to have further legislation to cover the position of people who did not make the effort in the meantime to buy out their fee simple.  If they have not bought out their fee simple within that period we may have to revert to the situation as it obtains at present, and that will continue.  For that reason it is important that an effort be made <Col N="928" /> to codify all of this legislation, bringing it under the one umbrella.</P>
    <P>Everyone in the House is agreed that whatever the usefulness of ground rents in the past that has now been outlived.  Deputies on all sides of the House welcome their abolition.  They may have served a purpose in earlier years when there were no planning authorities, no restrictions in regard to planning or development.  Were it not for the regulations often imposed by landlords at the time a lot of housing estates were being built, they would have gone to rack and ruin.  Let us take the example of a street such as Leeson Park or any other street in Dublin where there were very good houses, well built and properly looked after.  In the past, were it not for such restrictions, people living in those houses could have converted them for use in the exercise of any type of business, or converted them into any other type of premises if they bought out the fee simple.  That might not sound too bad until one day, in the middle of some very nice housing estate, somebody came in and started a blacksmith's shop or perhaps somebody else might come in and start banging away at motor cars late at night.  Such exercises were prevented by the covenants in the leases.  They were imposed by the landlords but were of benefit to almost all of the tenants living in dwellinghouses, people who had perhaps a 99 years or a 999 years' lease; they had a long term interest in it.  Were it not for such covenants their next-door neighbours might have devalued their property.  That is the historical context.  But ground rents have now outlived their usefulness in that there is now attached to each local authority a planning authority.</P>
    <P>Now if one converts one's house from one type of usage to another one may have the planning authority breathing down one's neck preventing one from so doing.  All one has to do is get in touch with one's planning department and say that such-and-such a person is changing the use of my dwellinghouse; I do not think it proper that they be allowed to do so, when the planning authority will prevent them continuing.  It is of importance because it maintains the standard of <Col N="929" /> the dwellinghouse, of the area, ensuring that a person is not entitled to do something with their house reducing the value of their next-door neighbour's property.  The planning authorities have succeeded in that goal.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister is back in the House.  I have been dealing with the effect of the acquisition of the fee simple on covenants.  I was illustrating how these covenants were of benefit to people in different localities, maintaining a reasonably high standard in the proper development of an estate, and its proper maintenance and upkeep.</P>
    <P>Section 28 deals with the effect of the acquisition of the fee simple on covenants.  It is relatively clear and straightforward.  A number of points spring to mind.  How does the Minister envisage the operation of the section which provides:</P>
    <P>(1)  Where the fee simple in land is acquired, whether under this Act or otherwise, all covenants subject to which the grantee held the land, other than a covenant specified in subsection (2), shall thereupon cease to have effect and no new covenant shall be created in the conveyance of the fee simple.</P>
    <P>(2)  In the case of a covenant&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  which protects or enhances the amenities of any land occupied by the immediate lessor of the grantee, or</P>
    <P>(b)  which relates to the performance of a duty imposed by statute on any such person, or</P>
    <P>(c)  which relates to a right of way over the acquired land or a right of drainage or other right necessary to secure or assist the development of other land,</P>
    <P>the covenant shall, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, continue in full force and effect and shall be enforceable as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is introducing <Col N="930" /> a section which completely abolishes covenants in leases with a few exceptions.  One exception is in regard to rights of way and another is in regard to protecting the amenities of the land.  This is the nucleus of the Bill.  In my view the leases will be done away with.  I want to find out from the Minister where the covenants will be.  They will not appear in the certificate of title obtained from the Registrar of Titles.  Where will these covenants be available for inspection? Suppose I buy a house in Clondalkin and I am living in it.  I have a lease for 999 years and I buy out the ground rent.  Later on I sell the house.  There happens to be a right of way across the back of my garden.  Where will this right of way be available on the purchase deeds for an intending purchaser? This is important.  It goes to the root of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this is a very important matter but it would be more appropriately dealt with on Committee Stage where it could be teased out by way of question and answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your point.  It appears to me that the Minister is proposing to do away with covenants in existing leases in section 28.  I want to know where these new rights will be available for inspection.  This aspect of the Bill will create a considerable amount of difficulty with regard to the practical operation of the Bill. Some of the restrictive covenants and the covenants involved in the leases will be abolished.  Some specified covenants will not be done away with. There has to be some way of ascertaining where the rights retained will be made available to intending purchasers. A person can purchase a dwellinghouse and buy out the fee simple.  An intending purchaser could suddenly discover there were rights attached to the house about which he had no way of knowing.  It is important that some effort should be made to clarify the situation so that these covenants will be available for inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> I will not embarrass the Minister by trying to make it difficult for him. He may already have the answer, or he may not.  I would ask him to look closely at this matter before Committee Stage when he may wish to put down amendments to clarify where these specified covenants will be retained. This is of the utmost importance. If it is not clarified, the effects of the Bill will be minimised.</P>
    <P>There are a number of most important items in the Bill.  The former Minister, Senator Cooney, introduced a Bill in which cases were dealt with by the country registrar.  This was far superior to having them dealt with by the Registrar of Titles.  I am not trying to score a political point.  Nor am I trying to quibble or make legal arguments. I am not trying to gain any kudos for anyone.  I deal with county registrars on a reasonably regular basis.  The vast majority of them have quite a number of staff available to them.  Their volume of work is not over-burdening them at present.  Their office staff can be enlarged, if necessary, by the addition of one or two persons.  Giving this job to the Registrar of Titles will cause difficulties and delays.</P>
    <P>In the Land Registry offices here in Dublin we have as courteous a group of people as I have ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  They are helpful and they will go out of their way to help any solicitor or counsel who goes in to do business with them, or any individual who goes in to them with a query.  Rarely have I met people who co-operate so well and help people in any way possible.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the delays in the Land Registry are unbelievable.  Where sub-division, registering of new maps and titles or investigation of titles are concerned there is an extensive backlog of work.</P>
    <P>Imposing extra work in connection with the purchase of ground rents will add to the considerable backlog in the Land Registry.  An effort is being made to have all titles eventually registered in the Land Registry but I cannot see it happening in my lifetime having regard to the way matters are progressing <Col N="932" /> at the moment.  Now there will be the position that matters relating to the purchase of ground rents by tenants will have to be dealt with in the Land Registry.  The Registrar of Titles has sufficient work without imposing this extra burden on him.</P>
    <P>Section 24 states:</P>
    <P>(1)  The Registrar of Titles shall deal with applications received under this Part in the order in which they are received so far as is consistent with the efficient discharge of all his functions as Registrar of Titles.</P>
    <P>This extra burden on the registrar of titles will affect the efficient discharge of his duties.  The Land Registry offices throughout the country are performing very useful work.  When a person wishes to obtain a county council loan he applies for the loan and his solicitor sends his title, his Land Registry maps and all the other necessary data to the Land Registry.  This job normally takes from six to nine months to complete. There are so many of these applications that the work of the Land Registry has expanded enormously and the addition of an extra burden will add further to their difficulties.  In many of the buildings there is no room to accommodate additional staff.  The Minister should look into this matter.</P>
    <P>There are country registrars' offices in all counties.  When an application from a person in Wexford is submitted it is sent to the country registrar in that country and there is no difficulty in having the person involved call to the country registrar's office to explain the position.  With the help of the county registrar the application can be made without the assistance of a solicitor. We are trying to cut down on the cost for tenants involved in the purchase of ground rents.  With the assistance of officials in the county registrar's office people could save themselves legal costs in preparing their applications.</P>
    <P>It costs £5 for the issuing of a vesting certificate and the charge in respect of arbitration is £12.  In our proposals we suggested a fee of £2 for a Circuit Court office fee.  We are talking about people who are trying to pay off mortgages and who have hire purchase <Col N="933" /> commitments in addition to their day-to-day living costs.  The measure proposed by the Coalition provided for a lower fee of £2.  In the present legislation the fees will vary from £5 to £12.</P>
    <P>It would have been much better if the following steps had been taken. First, the application should be made in the office of the country registrar who is attached to each country.  It would be done on a local basis, the applicant would not incur heavy travelling expenses, the county registrar would probably be aware of the circumstances and the application could be lodged by a local solicitor.  What the Government are proposing now is that the matter should be sent to the Land Registry where there will be no knowledge of local circumstances.  It will mean more expense for the applicant. Secondly, additional staff will be required in the Land Registry office in Dublin to cope with the work.</P>
    <P>If the applicant could go to the county registrar's office, with the aid of the county registrar and his staff he could complete his application himself without incurring heavy legal costs. This is an aspect that the Minister should consider seriously because I am convinced it will cause a lot of expense to those affected.</P>
    <P>Section 24 (2) states:</P>
    <P>When the Registrar is satisfied for reasons submitted in writing by the applicant or any other person concerned that an application is exceptional in that compliance with the duty imposed by subsection (1) in respect of it would result in serious inconvenience or substantial loss to any such person, he may deal with the application otherwise than in the order in which it was received.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>All this is detail on sections and should be raised properly at Committee Stage. When that stage is reached the Deputy will have every opportunity of raising these questions but he is not in order in doing so now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that if there is to be a situation in which I, for instance, made a normal application for the purchase of my fee simple but found that I was <Col N="934" /> left behind in the queue, I would be entitled to know why I was left behind. There would need to be a very substantial reason for me being treated in this way.  Therefore, I am anxious to know why this provision is included. It is important that we have some idea of what the Minister would consider to be serious reasons.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a comprehensive one and provides for a number of situations.  I am sure there will be no difficulty in putting it through.  The provision regrading the prohibition of the creation of further ground rents is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I understand that the purchase price of the leases will vary in accordance with prevailing interest yields on Government securities.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate in specific terms as to what the cost is likely to be in these circumstances.  It is important that we have this information.  On the face of it the situation would not appear to be satisfactory having regard to the fluctuations that can occur in the prices of Government stock. This cost can vary from 3 per cent to 15 per cent which was the yield on land bonds at one stage.  This represents a substantial differential.  I can envisage a situation in which there will be substantial fluctuations in regard to the prices that will be agreed.</P>
      <P>A difficulty that may arise relates to a situation in which much of the work involved may extend beyond the five-year period.  I should like the Minister to tell us to what extent a person will be expected to go in order to prove his claim to title.  I am talking of the person who is living in the house concerned.  There may be circumstances in which there is a tenant in the house on a weekly or a monthly basis while the owner is living elsewhere. Presumably it will be incumbent on an applicant to produce title documents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not go into too much detail on it.  In relation to the legislation in general I submit that the Bill brought in by the Minister's predecessor went at least as far as if not a stage further than this one.  It would have been a far more helpful Bill but it was not accepted.  The two Bills in the process of being enacted in regard to this matter are merely a padding, with some slight amendments, of what the former Minister proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said of the promise in the manifesto in regard to ground rents, and I shall not delay the House by dwelling on that now except to refer to the statement that Fianna Fáil, if returned to office, would provide a scheme that would lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  It depends upon one's interpretation of it.  The most the Minister has done is to resurrect what his predecessor left behind.  Many people believed that State help would be given to buy out <Col N="936" /> ground rents.  A large number of people were under this impression.  In fact, the State could have provided the money to purchase ground rents at very little cost to the Exchequer and the money would have been well spent. The situation is that people may buy out their ground rents if they wish and pay the cost themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister set out the position in regard to Land Registry costs.  Why has the Minister specified the five-year period?  If the legislation is satisfactory, why is the five-year period necessary? I cannot understand why we must have this five-year restriction and I believe that no specific period should be mentioned.  If it is good legislation it should be able to stand the test of time.  I imagine that the reason for this restriction is that during this time there will be such confusion in the Land Registry that it will be absolutely impossible to accept any further cases.  If there are enormous numbers of applications the Land Registry will not be able to cope. At present the staff are working to their utmost capacity and if there are, say, 15,000 applications each year over a five-year period then the Land Registry will slow down and stop.  In three or four years' time the registrar will tell the Minister that they cannot clear the backlog of work.  The Registrar of Titles will have to accept the titles furnished by the landlords in trying to get their compensation.  The tenant pays his money and gets his certificate of qualification and the landlord then proves his title to his money. At that stage the Land Registry will be unable to cope.</P>
    <P>It would seem that the members of ACRA are very anxious to buy out their ground rents.  They have a very large membership throughout the whole country and they will urge their members to make application before the end of the five-year period. Probably they will advise their members to lodge their applications immediately and the situation will be such that the scheme will be unworkable. This will cause great difficulty. I would ask the Minister to have this matter dealt with by the county registrars.  This would be more <Col N="937" /> efficient and would spread out the work over the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what the Minister says, the vast majority of people were under the impression that funds would be provided for the purchase of ground rents.  Many people are disappointed that the money is not being provided.  It would have been well spent in helping people to buy out their fee simple.  It is important that this Bill should go through.  There is much goodwill attached to it, as there was to the Bill brought in by the Minister's predecessor, I have summarised the situation and it is important that we bring about some necessary improvements. I wish the Bill a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express surprise at the fact that there have been so few backbench speakers from the extensive ranks of Government supporters coming in to praise this measure, vaunted so much during the election campaign by canvassers and speakers for the party now in power and used by them as a means of winning votes.  Why are the Government so anxious that there should not be a full debate on this issue?  Why are they muzzling their backbenchers and preventing them from speaking? Since 11.30 a.m. there has been only one backbench Fianna Fáil speaker.  In the budget debate Fianna Fáil speakers have been insisting, in contrast to previous practice when there were two parties in Opposition, that Fianna Fáil should get one speaker for every speaker from the Opposition&mdash;in other words, there should be two Fianna Fáil speakers for every Fine Gael speaker or Labour speaker.  They are so concerned that they should be allowed to speak that it is surprising to me and many others that in this debate, which they pretended to consider important, they have contributed only one speaker. It suggests that they are anxious to have this debate concluded at the earliest opportunity, swept away as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are concerned to do so because they realise, as we realise&mdash;and the people will realise all too well when they come to operate the provisions of <Col N="938" /> the Bill&mdash;that it is not what they were given to believe would be enacted by Fianna Fáil if they were returned to power.  Indeed, this Bill is very different, from what Fianna Fáil pretended they would do and it is very little different, if different in any significant respect, from the Bill the Coalition Government had brought to Committee Stage here.  No wonder they do not want this debate to be prolonged.  No wonder they do not want the Bill to be scrutinised here because, if it is, it will be seen to be what it is, namely, the Coalition's Bill on ground rents dressed up under a new name and delayed for more than six months&mdash;in fact, delayed for almost a year.  That is all this Bill is.  No wonder Fianna Fáil do not want it discussed.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask another question and I am sure the Minister will be able to answer it, as he is very anxious to get in to reply, and I am sure he will be able to devote a considerable time to answering not only this question but all the other questions raised in the course of the debate.  Why was this Bill not introduced in the last session? Why wait until 1978 to introduce the Bill?  After all, the Bill is, as I said, little different from the Bill introduced by Senator Pat Cooney when he was Minister for Justice? The drafting changes are of little significance.  In fact, all the work had been done by the parliamentary draftsman prior to this Government taking office.  There are some small changes but, that being the position, why was the Bill not introduced last session? Why did they not put it at the top of their legislative programme? Why did they give priority to the Agricultural Credit Bill, a purely consolidating measure containing practically no new provisions? Why did they insist on the Bill going before this one taking up parliamentary time in what, I agree, was a very useful debate and one that I am glad took place, but was certainly not something that was promised in the election campaign and certainly not something urgent because, with a few exceptions, all the provisions were already on the Statute Book and were merely being re-enacted in this consolidating measure which we discussed at great length.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> For some reason, best known to themselves, a reason, I am sure, the Minister for Justice will be only too anxious to give to the House when he comes to reply, the Government decided to give the Agricultural Credit Bill priority over this measure.  It was introduced and discussed on Second Stage and subsequently on Committee Stage.  Before they gave this much-vaunted measure its Second Reading they had the Agricultural Credit Bill processed on Committee Stage.  Admittedly, the Agricultural Credit Bill was a new Bill in the sense that, although it was a consolidating measure, it had not been introduced in the last Dáil. But a measure very similar to this one had been introduced in the last Dáil. It had been published.  The changes involved were small, as I said, and there was no reason therefore why it should not have been introduced immediately on the commencement of the new Dáil after the summer of 1977. Why was it not introduced then?  If the Minister believes the benefits conferred on householders by this Bill are important surely the Bill should have been taken during 1977.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister wait to enact this Bill until 1978, Clearly it was because he wanted the longest possible time to elapse between the general election, when all these elaborate promises were made, and the time when this puny product would emerge into the light of day in this House.  He hoped obviously that the people who were made such liberal promises during the election would have forgotten the promises by the time the Bill was introduced if he delayed long enough in bringing in the Bill.  I do not think he will succeed in his endeavours in this regard and it is our intention to make sure that the lack of any real difference between this measure and the measure introduced by the previous Government is made abundantly clear to the electorate by the debate here and by every means we can adopt to bring the facts of the situation to the public.</P>
    <P>There is another consequence of the delay, the quite unnecessary delay, in bringing this measure in.  The terms <Col N="940" /> available to tenants wishing to buy out their ground rents are less favourable because of the decline in the rate of interest on loans in the interim than they would have been under the measure brought to Committee Stage by Senator Cooney when he was Minister for Justice.  The interest rate on the National Loan has come down from 13 per cent to 11.5 per cent.  The multiplier has been increased and this will mean that the cost of purchasing ground rents will be increased.</P>
    <P>Why was this small change made in regard to the agency responsible for implementing the Bill from county registrars to the Land Registry?  County registrars are accessible to the public all over the country.  The Land Registry is located in Dublin and people living in the country may know the county registrar, some even personally, while they may have little or no reason to be familiar with the Land Registry situated here in Dublin.  County registrars are always very helpful when they are approached.  No longer will it be possible for people to go to the country registrar in Manorhamilton, Roscommon, Castlebar or elsewhere. They must go to Dublin to the Land Registry.  Many of them will not know where the Land Registry is.  Even if they are told where it is they may have difficulty in finding it because they are not familiar with the city.  Obviously they will have to engage a solicitor.</P>
    <P>I agree people should pay something towards the cost of extinguishing ground rents.  When they were purchasing houses they were not concerned with ground rents; all they were concerned with was getting houses.  It is only when they have the house that they scrutinise the terms under which they are there and that the ground rent seems to be a burden.  In theory and in contract they did buy the house with the ground rent and they did, in theory at least, freely enter into a contract. Obviously there would be a considerable burden on the Exchequer if it had to provide all the money that was involved to remove the burden from the tenants.  To that extent I agree with the Government.  In regard to the requirement that there should be a contribution by the tenant to the cost <Col N="941" /> or buying out the ground rent, there is justification for the measure in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that this was not the impression, rightly or wrongly, that the people got during the election campaign.  The impression they got was that ground rents were going to be abolished.  Obviously ground rents could not be abolished other than by Government action.  To say that ground rents were to be abolished by the simultaneous, by the voluntary action of every holder of a tenancy under a ground rents is illogical. There is no way that one can guarantee that every holder of a ground rent will opt for the provisions of this Bill.  If one person does not opt, even though all the others opt, then a ground rent continues and ground rents have not been abolished and the promise has not been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>To pretend that ground rents could be abolished by simply allowing people the facility to opt to extinguish them is not abolishing them and is not a fulfilment of the promise to abolish them.  The impression was clearly given that Fianna Fáil were going to abolish ground rents.  They were not going to allow people to get rid of them themselves.  They were going to abolish them <i>simpliciter.</i>  That is not happening under this Bill.  Under this Bill people can only opt to get rid of their own ground rent.</P>
    <P>I understand that a number of local authorities are ground landlords and I know of one.  Perhaps Deputy Mitchell will be able to correct me if I am wrong in the assertion that Dublin Corporation own ground rents in Tallaght. They bought land by a compulsory purchase order for house building and in doing so they bought out the right to the ground rent.  To all intents and purposes they have now taken over the burden of financing local authorities, certainly in urban areas because they have taken over domestic rates. So they are in a position to call the tune as far as local authorities are concerned and they are in a position to provide the money.</P>
    <P>As they have promised to introduce a scheme leading to the abolition of ground rents, I should like to know <Col N="942" /> if they are going to insist that local authorities hand over the rights to the ground rents free to any tenants who are paying them ground rents in places such as Tallaght.  Surely where the State itself or one of its agencies is the ground landlord they should lead the way, even if it was not possible for the Government to fulfil their promise.  If it is not possible for them to do it where the ground landlord is a private person surely it is possible for them to implement their promise in full where the ground landlord is a local authority, an agent or body acting on behalf of the public, a body over whose financial operations the Government have considerable influence by virtue of the fact that they are now providing the money for the operations of the local authority. Surely the Government have the opportunity of enabling the local authorities to extinguish any ground rents which they hold by giving them the necessary money.  I understand that this Bill does not even apply to local authorities. Therefore, the Government have the option to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>When this debate resumes I hope we will see many Fianna Fáil backbenchers discussing this measure and I hope we will hear some critical voices in relation to it.  We have been told that the &ldquo;think-tank&rdquo; continues.  I would ask the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice to ask the &ldquo;think-tank&rdquo; to have a look at this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Ceann Comhairle as ucht gur thug sé cead dom an cheist anthábhachtach seo a ordú ar athló na Dála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" /> I regret having to bring the Minister in on the adjournment but as spokesman for my party on telecommunications I am gravely concerned about the serious escalation over the past 24 hours of the situation in regard to the telecommunications services of the Minister's Department.  Today the situation is utterly chaotic.  I understand from the latest reports that lines to Limerick, Galway, Cork and the UK are totally out of action.  I do not have to recount for the Members of the House the extreme frustration of trying to make telephone calls from this House during the past 24 hours.</P>
    <P>There is a grave public concern about the protracted nature of these disputes which instead of being resolved are worsening.  The problems, to use the modern terminology, are escalating.  Concern has been expressed by many people, by business and community leaders, about the dispute.  The public have every right to be concerned about this totally unsatisfactory situation in the telecommunications section of the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I am sure I do not have to point out to the Minister the vital role the telecommunications service plays in modern life.  That service is of vital importance to the business, commercial and industrial life of a small country such as this on the periphery of Europe. We are dependent on exports and, consequently, it is essential that we have an efficient telecommunications service.  The situation is even more serious when one considers that in addition to the telephone and telex services we witnessed in recent years a rapid growth in the computerisation of many businesses.  Many concerns now have computer terminals linked to a central computer and are using Post Office lines and cables to have data processed by a central computer. In spite of all this over the past nine months 15 separate disputes took place and they crippled the telephone and telex services.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that 12,500 people in Blackrock have been without postal services for the last three weeks.  It is not my intention to avail of my full <Col N="944" /> 20 minutes because I wish to give an opportunity to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Liam Cosgrave, and my colleague from the Labour Party, Deputy John Ryan, to express their opinions on this matter.  I sought permission to raise this issue tonight because it appears that no progress has been made in these disputes and the Minister appears unable or unwilling to resolve the difficulties which best this most important section of his Department. It is not my intention to go into the details of the various points at issue in these disputes, but irrespective of what the pros and cons of the issues are there is an obligation on the Minister to ensure that the country's telecommunications service is maintained.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to everybody that there is something seriously and radically wrong with the whole industrial relations set-up within the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  This has been recognised by many people and it was even referred to in the Fianna Fáil Manifesto.  An undertaking was given in that manifesto that special steps would be taken to set up the appropriate machinery to ensure good industrial relations in the Department.  From the information available to me and the discussions I have had with various people&mdash;in fact, one does not need to be an expert to realise this&mdash;it is clear that there is something radically wrong with the set-up in that Department.  The public are demanding that the Minister for Labour and the industrial relations mechanism and machinery of the Labour Court, face up to this serious situation.</P>
    <P>I should like to illustrate how serious the situation is.  Two weeks ago when I was visiting the headquarters of Gaeltarra Éireann in Galway I had occasion to make a telephone call to Donegal but I was unsuccessful in my efforts.  I am sure the Minister is aware that there are a number of important industries in Donegal which are associate companies of Gaeltarra Éireann and that many of those firms are engaged in the export business.  I am sure the Minister is also aware that the export business of many concerns in the north-west was totally disrupted because of the telecommunications <Col N="945" /> situation.  The time has come for the Minister to face up to this serious situation.  In fairness, it must be recognised that the Department, and in particular the telecommunications section, has become through advances in modern technology a much more complex department than it was.  It may be that the industrial relations machinery, the procedures and the modus operandi which were formulated in the past are no longer suitable.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to come to grips with this serious situation.  On Monday last, following a request by many people I sent a telegram to the Taoiseach asking him to intervene or appoint a mediator.  In fairness to the Taoiseach I should like to acknowledge the fact that he replied to me today.  He informed me that he and his colleagues were giving close and continuous attention to this problem.  I suggest that there should be a complete and thorough review of the industrial relations machinery in the Department. In the short term I suggest that a mediator be appointed to ensure that the disputes in the telecommunications section and in Blackrock are resolved and that all the various categories of workers are got back to work as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>This is something in the short term. In the long term I respectfully suggest that some form of tribunal, commission or committee&mdash;I do not care what it is called&mdash;should be set up and given a mandate to examine and assess and formulate an industrial relations strategy appropriate to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in this modern age.  I would like now to give way to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Liam Cosgrave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary to emphasise to the Minister and his colleague, the Minister of State, the serious problems which have arisen for business, trade and commerce.  The situation in my constituency is that business people are unable to place orders and make contact with customers. <Col N="946" /> This has involved financial loss because of the decision involved in the present dispute which exists there.  I suggest to the Minister that it is time to reappraise the whole system and the work schedule.  There is need for a certain amount of flexibility in revising the arrangements. While I appreciate the importance of using established procedures they should not override the public interest and the obligation to maintain an adequate service.</P>
      <P>It is time, because of the frequency of the disputes in this area, to review the situation in an objective way.  I believe this is an opportune occasion to do so.  The problem created, not only in the Blackrock Post Office but in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire as well as in a wider area, is very grave for business as well as domestic users of the postal service.  I know the Minister is aware of certain other aspects of the problem which I do not think it is necessary to refer to. I believe it is time to have a fresh look at the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support Deputies O'Donnell and Cosgrave on this very important issue because, as spokesman for my party on industrial relations, I feel the situation is so bad now that a crisis exists in the services of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I can see a complete close down and a cessation of the services if the Government do not take strict action in the matter.  As Deputy O'Donnell already pointed out, for some years now we have spent millions installing sophisticated and modern facilities to ensure that at commercial level and at every day life level we are as near comparable as possible to many of the countries we are joined with in the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labour relations in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs during the past six months are like a festering sore.  I know from my discussions with many members of the staff of the Department that the mood there is one of unease and uncertainty.  Despite all our efforts and investment in modern facilities, if we have not good labour relations within the Department this <Col N="947" /> is all for nothing and can do little but disimprove the service.  During the past six weeks there has been a great deterioration in the services and I publicly appealed to the Taoiseach to intervene in the matter.  Unfortunately there was no response.</P>
    <P>Three weeks ago, with particular reference to the Blackrock Post Office, I contacted the Minister for Labour and he replied that it was not within his area of responsibility.  He referred my representation to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  It has now reached the stage that the ball is in the court of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, his Minister of State and the Minister for Labour to resolve without delay the serious situation or face a complete closedown.  There has been coming and going, settling and unsettling within the last six months.  I recall four different areas in the country where there was a labour disturbance in the Post Office engineering section, the workers went back to work and within a month the situation was back to square one.  I am satisfied that the workers are responsible men.  They appreciate the jobs they have and they know what efforts have been made to improve the facilities and the services. But there is something wrong.  The people are asking what is wrong and where it is wrong.  Are we dealing with our workers through regulations based on a situation which existed in 1878?</P>
    <P>Do we need another look at our regulations?  Is this an example of an area where there could be worker participation? Something must be done, because things cannot go on the way they are at the moment.  As Deputy O'Donnell pointed out, the situation has become so bad that our industrial and commercial life will be disrupted within a week if something serious is not done by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  It is a matter of Government responsibility. I appreciate that there are ways and means through which such labour disputes can be handled but it has reached a point where it must be the concern of the Government to see that <Col N="948" /> this unhappy situation is brought to a happy conclusion for the sake of the country, our commercial life and the workers employed in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As Fine Gael spokesman on labour matters I am very anxious for the Minister to consider the union's proposal for a month's truce in order to stop all the haggling that has been going on in the Department for the past six months.  As Deputy O'Donnell said, there have been 15 different disputes and the strain on relations in those six months through those 15 different disputes must be enormous.  The more disputes there are the less amenable workers will be to a solution.  Would the Minister consider that the written regulations laid down for employess in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs may be too rigid, too out of date and too detailed and that perhaps they need revision?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I begin by expressing regret to the public for the inconvenience and hardship being caused to them by the present disruption of the telephone and telex services. I need not remind the House that this industrial action is a problem I inherited.  It began in May 1977 in my predecessor's time when some members of the union, against the instructions of their executive, refused to hand up departmental records in breach of their conditions of employment and of agreements on peaceful procedures with their union.  Later the unofficial strike was made official. Since then industrial action has continued in an unbroken series of strikes and other acts of indiscipline which have involved groups of staff for different periods in many centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes those actions have been official and sometimes unofficial.  When one issue was settled another started. It was claimed by the union at the beginning of those actions and has since been claimed occasionally that they were for the purpose of compelling the Department to conclude a productivity agreement.  The truth is that my Department have been more <Col N="949" /> than willing to enter into a productivity agreement.  In negotiations in 1976 informal agreement in principle was reached on many features of such an agreement and my Department had proposed an introduction date.  An offer to share the benefits of increased productivity with the union's members had been made and payment on account offered.  After the union conference in May last year the executive made no further use of the negotiating machinery.  Various efforts been made over the period to bring this industrial action to an end.  In August last the Steering Committee of the Employer-Labour Conference made recommendaions for a resumption of normal work which both the union and the Department accepted. However, the industrial action continued. I would underline that these proposals were made by the Steering Committee of the Employer-Labour Conference and not by the Department.</P>
    <P>In November arrangements for return to normal work were again formulated during discussions which I had with the representatives of the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions lasting over two days. Briefly, these recommendations and arrangements provided that the Department would lift suspensions, that the union would cease industrial action, that the union would undertake that the staff would carry out instructions and that any claims, problems or proposals would be processed speedily through the standard negotiating machinery.  I accepted these recommendations in both instances and I honoured them.  The union executive accepted them but did not honour them.  The industrial action continued, on an official basis in some instances and on an unofficial basis in others.</P>
    <P>Unofficial industrial action was still continuing recently in three centres&mdash; in the central telephone exchange and in Distillery Road in Dublin and at Letterkenny.  The three alleged issues on which the present industrial action is being taken are related to the productivity deal, to the suspensions in Russell Street and to Letterkenny. <Col N="950" /> I want to underline the fact that these are not the real reasons.  How could they be?  The Department are more than willing to enter into a productivity agreement and have gone so far as to state that there is ample scope for considerable benefits to the staff in such a deal.</P>
    <P>As regards Russell Street all that is involved is the garaging of official vans a few hundred yards from the present depot.  No change of headquarters is involved.  I want to underline that.  By using this garage the Department could take on extra staff to relieve unemployment.  There has never been any agreement on consultation in connection with garaging Therefore, there is no basis for dispute here either.</P>
    <P>In Letterkenny the alleged grievance was that the Department had not yet settled the staffing for the new auto-manual exchange there not due to be opened until 1979.  The action began on the refusal of a technician to replace an electric light bulb required for the fitting out of the new exchange. I do not think comment is necessary in this instance.</P>
    <P>On 3 January the executive of the union wrote to assure me that these actions were unofficial.  In their letter they mentioned that in Russell Street the executive requested the staff to resume duty in line with discussions held between them and the union and to use Russell Street as a garaging area.  Regrettably, they say, the staff concerned have not gone along with the executive's request.  I could say the same thing applies to the other matters dealt with in the letter.  We were informed that these were unofficial strikes.  Yet I learned later from their own union journal that the union executives were financing these unofficial actions.  I do not think it is necessary for me to comment in a matter such as this.</P>
    <P>The real problem&mdash;and I believe the public must be aware of it from the various statements in the papers, and they should be aware of it&mdash;is that there is a deep split in the union executive.  Some members of the executive have been campaigning openly <Col N="951" /> against decisions of the executive. Others have been threatening to bring the Department to their knees and create chaos at a time when the executive were trying to bring about a return to normal work.  The reasonable proposals that were formulated by the Employer-Labour Conference and the Executive Council of ICTU, and which were accepted by the union, were frustrated by individual members.  This has been obvious for a long time from reports in the media.  Even the union's own journal has drawn attention to it. I quote from the editorial in the latest issue of the union journal.  <i>The Relay</i>, of November-December 1977:</P>
    <P>Within our own union, during 1977, we have witnessed the results of terrible bitterness at national executive level.  For months past the friction has been obvious for all to see and unfortunately it has done nothing to enhance the reputation of the IPOEU or to improve its functioning.</P>
    <P>This division is the kernel of the matter and not staff rules or regulations, or changes in work practices or productivity deals.  The public and the ordinary members of the union are the sufferers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to what he called the truce offer.  Effectively what was being asked for in the union's letter was that agreements which had been negotiated through the Steering Committee of the Employer-Labour Conference and with the Executive Council of ICTU, that all the agreed negotiating procedures, should be set aside, and instead that the demands of groups engaged in unofficial industrial action, and which the executive itself had stated were in defiance of their instructions, should be acceded to.  I do not believe that this proposal was put forward as a serious suggestion.  Its acceptance would have been a recipe for anarchy. I do not know what these groups hope to gain by the course they have adopted. By their actions they have delayed for almost a year negotiations on the productivity agreement from <Col N="952" /> which the staff stand to benefit substantially. They are creating serious and unnecessary difficulties and hardship for the public generally, particularly those engaged in trade and industry, and seriously impeding progress with plans for further developing the telecommunications service. At a time of high unemployment their actions have prevented the Department and industry from giving additional employment and, at times, have placed in jeopardy the jobs of other people in less secure employment than themselves.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear beyond any possibility of misunderstanding that continuation of the present action can bring no benefits whatsoever to the staff.  I would hope that the union executive and the staff would realise that they have obligations as well as rights, and that in the present instance whatever sense of grievance some of the staff may have does not transcend these obligations.</P>
    <P>I felt constrained, because of the spate of what I could term misleading propaganda, to put the facts fully before the House.  I have acted, I think, with restraint and patience in this matter since I became Minister in the hope that the executive would be able to get the whole matter under control. I do not want confrontation.  It is my earnest wish to have good relations with the staff in all grades in the Department so that a much improved and more reliable service can be given to the public with advantage to the staff also.  I began some months ago a review of industrial relations.  Therefore I would appeal again to those concerned to call off this campaign and to return to the use of the agreed negotiating procedures.  When they do they have my assurance that I will play my part.  I want to say that the negotiating procedures in themselves are not sacrosanct. I think Deputy Michell raised something of this kind.  We can always change these procedures by agreement. I should like to emphasise that there are quite a number of unions in the Department and it would be with the agreement of all of these unions, and not simply to satisfy one union, that <Col N="953" /> these changes could be made.  I have begun a review.  It is difficult to get a worth-while result from this review until I am in a position to consult with all of the unions, including this one.</P>
    <P>Let me finally appeal very strongly to the union to accept the agreed negotiation <Col N="954" /> procedures and return to normal working.  As I have said already, if they do, I can assure them&mdash;and I want to emphasise that&mdash;I will play my part.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Authority in co-operation with the Forest and Wildlife Service of the Department of Fisheries are engaged on a comprehensive study of the timber processing industry with a view to identifying how the maximum return can be obtained from our timber resources.  On completion of the study, the prospects for the establishment of industrial projects based on local timber supplies will be examined in detail.  In this connection full consideration will be given to the needs of County Donegal.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the extent to which national aids for industries in the European Free Trade Association countries are incompatible with the free trade agreements between EEC and EFTA countries; and the steps that are being or will be taken to encourage an end to such distorting aids.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided in each agreement between the European Economic Community on the one hand, and individual EFTA countries on the other, that &ldquo;any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods&rdquo; is &ldquo;incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement&rdquo; in so far as such aid may affect trade between the Community and the individual EFTA country.  Each agreement provides formal machinery, in the form of a Joint Committee, to deal with complaints by either of the contracting parties.  If one of the contracting parties considers that certain practices are incompatible with the terms of the agreement, it may refer the matter to the joint committee, who examine the problem, make recommendations, and take decisions.</P>
      <P>Up to December 1977 no complaints had been lodged with any of the joint committees of the EEC/EFTA country agreements in regard to national aids to industries in the EFTA states.  However in December 1977 at the most recent meeting of the EEC/Sweden Joint Committee, the Community did have occasion to raise the question of alleged subsidies introduced by Sweden in an effort to combat difficulties arising in the reconstituted wood industry because of the recent recession. The joint committee are examining the complaint and the problem will be further discussed bilaterally by the authorities of the partner states.</P>
