      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) if he has seen a report (details supplied) attributing to the head of the Government Information Services a statement about the proportion of truth which the services might be permitted to tell at one time; (b) whether he approves the attitude on the part of the head of the Government Information Services which this statement reflects; and (c) if so, whether he will at least direct the head of the Government Information Services to indicate when he is releasing information according to this formula.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping the Taoiseach would give a little more enlightenment than that.  Would the Taoiseach not accept this was a peculiarly unfortunate form of words for the official concerned to use on the very day he was lecturing the British press on their bias and lack of objectivity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be getting upset about something that seems to me to be rather trivial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> The person concerned spoke at a debate following which he was approached by journalists and made the comment of which the Deputy complains. I do not think there is anything seriously wrong with the comment he made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that the form the words is open to an interpretation which is extremely unfortunate particularly on the very day he was attacking the British press, and with some justice in my view, for the way they treat Irish news, giving them the excuse to believe that whatever they are getting here officially may not be the whole truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to try to get from the Taoiseach is an admission that this was a very unfortunate form of words to use <i>vis-á-vis</i> a press corps like the British who will seize on this in order to justify themselves in not accepting the Government Information Services good faith in the future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of persons registered as unemployed in the building and construction industry at the latest date for which figures are available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest available date for which the industrial analysis of the live register is available is 18 November 1977.</P>
      <P>The total number of persons on the live register in the building, contracting and works of construction industry at that date was 23, 631.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give us the figure for November 1976?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1383" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have it and I can tell the Minister it was only 641 more 12 months previously&mdash;a difference of 641. So much for the zap employment programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) whether he accepts the current live register total as accurately reflecting the number of persons now out of work and seeking work; (b) whether he accepts the live register totals reported in the months of May and June 1977, as having accurately reflected the number of such persons at that time; (c) if not in either case, what number he would calculate for each period and in what way he would calculate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the live register I think I can say that there is general acceptance that the live register total does not fully reflect the actual level of unemployment in the economy.  For example, it does not include young persons looking for work for the first time or other unemployed persons who for various reasons are not applicants for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  In regard to the latter group, the proposal recently announced in the budget to relax the eligibility conditions for single women applicants for unemployment assistance, to be introduced next October, will of itself have the effect of increasing the register when it comes to reflect this extra element of unemployment not currently covered in the total.</P>
      <P>The live register does however provide a regular and reasonably satisfactory indicator of the trend in the level of unemployment and it also makes it possible to compile a range of detailed tabulations&mdash;according to industries, regions, duration of registration and so on&mdash;which have proved to be of considerable use for the purposes of social and economic analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An annual mid-April estimate of the number of persons &ldquo;out of work&rdquo; is prepared within the framework of the annual estimates of the total labour force.  This is obtained by using the live register trends&mdash;excluding persons on systematic short-time working&mdash;to <Col N="1384" /> update the most recent census of population totals for persons &ldquo;out of work&rdquo;.  The classification of a person as &ldquo;out of work&rdquo; in a census is based mainly on the respondent's own assessment of his or her economic circumstances and does not depend on the receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The most recent estimate for the number &ldquo;out of work&rdquo; on this basis is 108,000 for mid-April 1977.  This does not include persons seeking work for the first time for which the most recent official estimate available is that of 20,000 given by the 1975 Labour Force Survey for May 1975.  A corresponding estimate for 1977 will be available within a few months from the 1977 Labour Force Survey.</P>
    <P>The whole question of unemployment statistics is under consideration by an interdepartmental study group. In particular the group is examining the question of formulating a measure of unemployment in labour force surveys which will more adequately reflect the level of unemployment in the community, taking into account a number of criteria, such as the availability for work and the search for work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>When all that smoke has cleared away would the Minister tell us how many were unemployed in June last year and how many are unemployed and looking for work now? Would he make an estimate&mdash;his best estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should I estimate when the latest date for which we have figures at this stage is 3 March and the number registered is 5,610 fewer than the corresponding figure for last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the figure of just over 112,000 reported yesterday evening is 3,000 more than were unemployed at the time of the last general election? There are, in fact, 3,000 more on the live register now than in mid-June 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development the amount by which the growth of GNP in 1979 and 1980, that would be achieved if borrowing remained at the 1978 level, expressed as a percentage <Col N="1387" /> of GNP, and at 1978 rates of remuneration and repayment of borrowings, will be reduced in consequence of the projected cut in borrowing, expressed as a percentage of GNP; and the projected rise in remuneration and repayment of borrowings in those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Molloy) (for the Minister for Economic Planning and Development) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Molloy) (for the Minister for Economic Planning and Development)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that of itself the maintenance of the 1978 public sector borrowing level as a percentage of GNP in 1979 and 1980 would result in GNP growth rates higher than those set out in the White Paper, National Development 1977-1980.</P>
      <P>The gradual reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement as a percentage of GNP over the three-year period 1978-80 forms part of an overall strategy for reducing inflation and achieving rapid growth and employment during that period.  Since it is envisaged that private sector investment and employment growth will make a greater contribution to expansion in 1978 and later years, it would be inappropriate to maintain the same level of debt-financed expenditure by the public sector.</P>
      <P>Economic and monetary policy will be geared to offset any dampening effect on the growth process of the projected rise in remuneration of public debt and repayment of borrowings in 1979 and 1980.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Development Committee, which have general responsibility for the co-ordination of <Col N="1388" /> the activities of State agencies in regard to islands and which reports to me, have put forward proposals relating to non-Gaeltacht islands off the west coast.  I presume it is to these proposals that the Deputy refers.  Implementation of them would impinge on the functions of other Government Departments and State-sponsored bodies and the process of consultation has not yet been completed.  I would, therefore, regard it as premature to make a statement on the matter at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As many of the inhabitants of these non-Gaeltacht islands are ineligible to receive benefits for which their Gaeltacht counterparts are eligible, would the Minister agree that discrimination exists in this area?

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development if the proposed pay agreement wage figures, if accepted, will require any alteration in the White Paper projections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of the proposed wage agreement provide for an average increase of approximately 7 per cent in basic wage rates in 1978, whereas the White Paper projections envisaged an increase of 5 per cent in basic wage rates over the year.  The wage agreement terms will obviously make more difficult the attainment of the Government's objective of achieving a reduction to 7 per cent in the rate of inflation this year and also the objectives on employment.  The relative competitiveness of Irish industry which was envisaged in the White Paper <Col N="1389" /> targets will tend to be adversely affected, with consequent effects on exports, output and employment.  In addition, the allocation of scarce Exchequer resources to direct employment-creation projects will be hampered by the need to allocate further Exchequer funds of the order of £13 million for the public service pay bill in 1978.</P>
      <P>The terms of the proposed wage agreement represent the very maximum that can be supported if the Government's overall economic strategy is not to be thrown seriously out of line.  To the extent that these terms will have an adverse effect on the White Paper projections in 1978, greater progress will have to be made in 1979 and 1980 in attaining the Government's overall strategy of reducing inflation and unemployment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development if he has given consideration to the latest figures for net passenger movement with a rise in emigration in the latter months of 1977; and if any forecasts available to him indicate a rise in the rate of emigration in 1978 and 1979.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest figures for net passenger movement by sea and air suggest that net emigration may have increased in 1977 compared with 1976.  It is hoped that the results of the 1977 EEC Labour Force Survey may help to identify the extent to which the increase in the net outward passenger movement represents an actual increase in net emigration.</P>

      <P>I do not want to take the Minister by surprise, but I would ask him if he will accept from me that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development told the House last week that the census would give an indication of emigration in the periods we are talking about.  I want to know if the Minister has the information there, what feature about the census will reveal anything except the crude or gross difference between the 1979 figure and the figure which resulted from the 1971 census?  In other words, will there be anything in it which will give an indication of trends in the intervening eight years?</P>

What I am trying to discover is whether this census, which will take place in about one year's time, will contain anything which will give any indication about emigration other than a crude comparison of the total number of people who should be here in 1979 as compared with those who were here in 1971.  It is the trends in the meanwhile we are talking about.</P>

      <P>No.  There is no accurate way in which these figures can be <Col N="1392" /> made available to the House because of the reason I have stated.  There was not a proper census taken; it was postponed. The method of making a calculation is a crude one and because of the huge number of people moving in and out of the country and the very small percentage of that which would relate to the emigration figures about which the Deputy is speaking, it would not be proper to indicate to the House that these were accurate figures.  I would not care to give such figures. The Deputy can obtain them himself but I would not make the claim that they were an accurate way of assessing whether we had this rate of emigration or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions No. 8, 9, 10 and 11 together.  The provision of employment for all persons, male or female, who are seeking work is one of the Government's top priorities. The Deputy will be familiar with the special measures being taken by the Government in the area of job creation. It is clear that in the implementation of these measures the Government are in no way restricting employment opportunities for women.</P>
      <P>In so far as there may be discrimination against women in economic matters, it would be the Government's intention to take steps to eliminate such discrimination as quickly as possible.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the budget's generous tax concessions which benefit married couples especially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the EEC Labour Force Survey conducted in May/June 1975 some 74,900 married women were at work at that time. This represented 7.2 per cent of the total number at work.  A reliable projection for the number of married women in the work force for a period as far ahead as 1986 could not be prepared until more up-to-date information is available.  An <Col N="1394" /> official projection will be prepared when the results of the 1979 limited census and associated labour force survey are available.  No official figures are available for the average earnings of married women at work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that in reply to an earlier question by me, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development said that the participation rate of Irish women was less than half that of European women. Given that fact, does the Minister expect that the level of participation by Irish women will go up to 14.4 per cent, double 7.2 per cent, and has that been taken into account in employment projection needs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development whether he has a view on the rapid growth in the proportion of the population living within the Dublin county boundary, and whether, if his view of this development is unfavourable, he will formulate proposals for checking this growth and inducing more administrative and industrial decentralisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is yes, I certainly have a view which is that of very serious concern at the rapid growth in the proportion of our population living within the Dublin county boundary.  Our policy in Government is that this tendency should be checked by providing conditions favourable for development in other regions and places to act as counter attractions to Dublin and thereby minimise population migration.</P>
      <P>For this purpose, we require a comprehensive regional development policy, the last statement on which was that issued in 1972&mdash;by the then Fianna Fáil Government.  In view of the changed economic and social circumstances now obtaining, I shall, given my statutory responsibilities for regional planning, be presenting to the Government a review of the 1972 statement along with policy proposals for future action in this area.</P>
      <P>As regards the decentralisation measures mentioned in the second part of the Deputy's question, it would, I feel, pending the review, be premature at this stage to comment on these except to assure him that they will be fully considered and assessed in the review which I intend to be as comprehensive as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>If we take it that the Government's policy is in favour of decentralisation, in so far as any new <Col N="1400" /> appointments in the public service outside Dublin could be created, will the Minister state that the Government would be in favour of such a course?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too clear about the Deputy's question. Certainly the Government favour decentralisation. It has always been part of our policy and some of the moves that have taken place were initiated by a Fianna Fáil Government.  Any proposals for decentralisation will be favourably considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister accept as part of this policy the move to change the procedure, for instance, under the Bill dealing with ground rents to centralise the administration of that scheme in Dublin as opposed to the original scheme which was to have it administered throughout the counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the point the Deputy is making is relevant in regard to the overall policy of the Government in regard to decentralisation. With regard to the Bill he mentioned, the best method decided upon by the Government of implementing changes necessitated operating it centrally, through the Land Registry in Dublin. It was not possible to provide for decentralisation in that area arising out of changes introduced by that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that in the administration of the Bill it is proposed to employ an extra 60 persons? If it is the policy of the Government to decentralise, surely they should be more favourably disposed to employing those people in counties throughout the country rather than in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>On any occasion when the Government consider it suitable and worth while to decentralise they will do so. There are situations where that opinion would not hold and the case mentioned by the Deputy may be such a case.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The projections for borrowing in 1979 and 1980 based on the percentages of GNP in <i>National Development</i>, 1977-1980 are £751 million and £648 million respectively, in current money terms.  The estimated GNP figures in current money terms for 1979 and 1980 are £7,150 million and £8,100 million respectively.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of remunerating borrowings on the basis of the figures in <i>National Development</i>, 1977-80, and assuming that interest rates remained at their present level, is £25 million in 1979 in respect of the borrowing in that year and £22 million in 1980 in respect of the borrowing in that year; the estimated cost of repaying such borrowings depends on factors such as the terms decided upon when the borrowings are being arranged so that an estimate of such repayments is not available at this juncture.</P>

The commissioners were not so satisfied in regard to the applicant here concerned.  Having examined the relevant papers I agree with the commissioners' decision.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsibilities of Ministers of State, like those of Parliamentary Secretaries before 1 January last, are of two kinds: first, the provision of general support and assistance to Ministers of the Government through making public appearances, receiving and considering representations, considering policy alternatives and directing departmental business, attending to Parliamentary business and participating in international affairs: second, the discharge of statutory functions of Ministers of the Government delegated to them under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts.  In the first category of responsibilities, Ministers of State are <Col N="1403" /> being required by the appropriate Ministers of the Government to undertake a greater degree of responsibility than that considered appropriate to a Parliamentary Secretary.  In the second category, a review of the statutory responsibilities of each Minister of the Government is necessary before the delegations of statutory functions are made by order by the Government.  As a result of this review so far, the Government have already by order assigned <Col N="1404" /> extra statutory functions to the Minister of State at the Department of Defence and further statutory functions will be assigned to other Ministers of State as the review proceeds.  The information on the specific responsibilities of the Ministers of State is set out in a tabular statement which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate for inclusion in the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the question relates to the civil service the position is as follows.  Pension for both established and unestablished officers with full service is calculated on the basis of 1/80th, and lump sum on the basis of 3/80ths, of reckonable salary at retirement, for each year of pensionable service.  In the case of unestablished officers, salary for the purposes of calculating pension is reduced by twice the personal rate of social welfare contributory old age pension.  The maximum service reckonable is 40 years in all cases.</P>
      <P>In general, in the case of established officers, pension and lump sum may be paid on retirement at age 60, or at age 65 in the case of unestablished officers.  On voluntary retirement before the age at which pension and lump sum may be paid the award is deferred and brought into payment on an uprated basis at age 60 or 65 as appropriate.  If premature retirement is due to ill-health, pension and lump sum are paid as from the date of retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the retirement of established and unestablished officers with full service, the wives, if widowed, are eligible for pensions of one half the amount payable to their husbands, if the latter were members of the civil service contributory widows' and children's pension scheme.  A child's pension of one-third of the widow's rate up to a maximum of three children is also payable.  Where the widow is dead two-thirds of her rate is payable to the first child and one-third to the second child subject to a maximum of two children.  Pensions are revised <Col N="1411" /> by reference to pay rates operative on 1 July each year.</P>
    <P>As regards the second part of the question the number of officers serving on 1 January 1978 age 55 and upwards with 40 years' service or more is as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, public service pensions are revised each year on 1 July by reference to rates of pay then in operation. The question of further improving this arrangement was considered by the Government in the context of the recent budget but in the light of the resources available it was not possible to provide more favourable treatment for these pensioners.

      <P>As announced in a statement dated 14 September 1977 on the publication of the third report of the Public Service Advisory Council, the Government are fully committed to an effective programme of reform for the whole public service including the civil service.  The main elements of this programme are: (i) the development of institutional arrangements for planning in each Government Department as well as the provision of specialised staff support systems in the functions of finance, organisation and personnel; (ii) the separation of responsibility for policy and execution by dividing Departments into policy areas and executive units; (iii) the development of personnel through a policy of mobility; and (iv) the development of a continuous management review of the public service for cost effectiveness.</P>
      <P>The programme is elaborated in more detail in paragraphs 6.14 to 6.18 of the Government's White Paper on National Development 1977-1980.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, when the public service review group reported in 1969 they recommended the establishment of the Department of the Public Service which has been done.  Various Departments were chosen for experiments in reform. Five such Departments were chosen.  During the past few years work has been going on in those Departments. Greater progress has been made in some Departments.  Some Ministers in the former Administration disagreed with the report of the task force and therefore the matter was slowed down. In the past six months the reform programme has been proceeding in those five Departments.  It is intended to install task forces in the other nine Departments and reports from them will be published.</P>

The regular monitoring of job satisfaction takes place as part of the normal responsibilities of management in the public service.

I should like to ask the Minister if he agrees that there is evidence to indicate that not everybody in the public service is clear about what he is doing, why he is doing it or towards which goal he is working.

      <P>The Government have decided to reorganise all line Departments of State, that is, all Departments with the exception of the four central Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Public Service and Economic Planning and Development, <Col N="1419" /> on the general lines involving an Aireacht and Executive Units recommended in the Report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group.</P>
      <P>In the Departments of Health, Tourism and Transport, Industry, Commerce and Energy, Defence and the Environment, joint task forces from my Department and each of the Departments concerned were asked to recommend on the application of the concept on a trial basis.  As a result, the concept is being applied on a trial basis in the Departments of Health and Transport and Power.  The report of the task force in the former Department of Industry and Commerce was not accepted by the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce and a new task force is being constituted to update the report having regard to changes that have taken place since it was prepared. The task forces in the Departments of Defence and the Environment are expected to report during the current year.</P>
      <P>As regards the other Departments it is intended that plans for reorganisation will be completed and that the new system will also be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, intended to extend the system to all Departments where it is appropriate. The Government accept the general validity of the concept which has been endorsed by the Public Service Advisory Council.  This does not mean, however, that the review group's recommendations will be applied in every detail; any changes which are indicated as necessary in the practical application of the concept will be made.  In this connection a study which is under way to review the system's effectiveness in the Department of Health will, I hope, result in the development of criteria for judging the effectiveness of administrative reforms generally.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he considers the situation to be equitable and just that some members of the public service are obliged to work well over 40 years in order to obtain a pension which other employees in the public sector get after much shorter service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The minimum age at which a retirement pension may be paid in the public service is generally 60 years.  Accordingly, depending upon the age at which employment commenced, some public servants will have more than 40 years' service when they qualify for pension.  To allow pension to commence at an earlier age would increase the cost of superannuation.  For example, to pay a pension at age 50 costs approrimately twice as much as to pay the same pension at age 60 and I do not consider, therefore, that a reduction in pension age is warranted.</P>
      <P>I would draw attention to the fact that up to recently a public servant who resigned before the minimum retiring age forfeited all of his pensionable service. However, facilities are now available which enable a public servant, who has at least five years' service, and who wishes to leave his employment before reaching the retiring age, to have his accrued entitlement to pension and lump sum preserved, and brought into payment on an uprated basis at age 60.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the scandals and injustices of the past would the Minister accept that there is a substantial degree of injustice about a situation which asks one man to work perhaps twice as long as a colleague of his in the same public service for the same pension?  Surely that is something, despite the difficulties, that all governments should be working towards eliminating.</P>

      <P>I move : &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Road Transport Act, 1933, imposed, through the system of merchandise licences, onerous restrictions on the private sector of the road freight haulage industry which remained practically unchanged until substantial measures of liberalisation were introduced under the Road Transport Act, 1971.  The process of liberalisation initiated in 1971 entailed the removal of area and commodity restrictions and certain restrictions on vehicle weight from the main stock of general haulage licences but a final control on the number of vehicles operable by each licensee was retained.  More than 500 general hauliers are confined to one vehicle; about 150 are allowed two and 70 or so have numbers ranging up to 22. These authorisations reflect in most cases the circumstances of the original undertakings involved in 1933.  A number have, however, grown through the acquisition of other businesses, which has been the only means of growth open to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures in the 1971 Act were preceded over a few years by a rather <Col N="1452" /> less restrictive view of the then existing legislation than had been applied in earlier days.  The change of approach got its impetus from the finding, following a special survey in 1964, that the overwhelming bulk of road freight transport was performed by the owners of goods using their own transport, or, by what is usually called transport on own account.  Only 20 per cent in tonnage terms was carried by licensed hauliers; of this, CIE accounted for some eight percentage points and private licensed hauliers for the remaining 12.  That finding, taken with the fact that the railway share of freight transport was virtually frozen to a few traffics especially suited to rail, demonstrated that the restrictive legislation maintained for over 30 years with the objective of securing freight traffic for the railways, or, road services operated by the railways, had totally failed in its purpose.</P>
    <P>A situation where the road freight transport industry is virtually an &ldquo;own account&rdquo; industry and licensed hauliers carry only about 20 per cent of road freight tonnage compares very unfavourably with that in other countries for which some data is available.  For example, in Germany, France and Belgium the corresponding figure is about 40 per cent; in the UK and Italy it is roughly 50 per cent and in the Netherlands a little over 60 per cent. Luxembourg is the only other EEC State where we know the figure to be as low as 20 per cent.  Since the 1964 survey the situation in Ireland has changed to the detriment of licensed hauliers and it has been estimated in recent years that the tonnage of road freight carried by licensees may now be as low as 10 per cent&mdash;half the figure disclosed in the mid-sixties&mdash; which was then thought to be a startling indicator.</P>
    <P>Too much own account transport, such as the figures suggest to exist in Ireland, must be regarded with concern because it is likely to be inefficient and to bring on to the roads an excessive number of vehicles, making it unduly costly in direct terms and in the indirect costs of wear and tear on the roads, time lost due to congestion and <Col N="1453" /> general detriment to the environment. We have that situation here while restrictive legislation prevents the development of an efficient and adequate professional transport fleet.</P>
    <P>In essence, therefore, if we want to get our road freight transport into better shape the task that faces us is to get the professional industry on to a proper footing.  This is the aim of the present measure and its ultimate objective is the creation of a cheaper and more efficient road freight transport system.</P>
    <P>The ultimate objective of policy would be the creation of a haulage industry free from the frustrating quantitative controls which have given rise to so much inefficiency and regulated rather by the quality of performance required of its members.  Taking account of the regulatory system that has existed until now, an unduly rapid transition towards that final objective would, in my view, prove disruptive. What we need before the eventual pattern can materialise is a period during which we can ease away old restrictions while experimenting, in so far as we can, as to the form and style of the flexible type of regulation now thought to be required.</P>
    <P>To reflect these views, the Bill contains, as its principal measure, a proposal to ease substantially the remaining restriction on the numbers of vehicles operable on general haulage licences.  The Bill proposes to permit, therefore, a minimum authorised number of six vehicles per licence in the case of the present one-vehicle firm and an absolute maximum of 80 vehicles as operable by any one licensee, whether on one licence or a number of licences held by him.  The appropriate level will be settled in each case by multiplying the existing authorised number by six, subject to the over-riding maximum of 80.  Section 3 of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Under the new dispensation a man at present authorised to operate one truck may well be satisfied to continue his business exactly as before but under this measure he would be able to operate six vehicles if he so desired.  The go-ahead enterprising haulier who has, say, four trucks will <Col N="1454" /> be free to operate 24 and to take his own decisions and actions in relation to the development of his business within that limit.  The ceiling of 80 will be a safeguard against unrealistic investment or attempts to dominate the market while the minimum of six will ensure that no one is compelled by a legal restraint to operate a business which by being confined to one or two vehicles is, on his own calculation, incapable of giving him a fair reward for his enterprise, labour and investment. In general, I will be providing the industry with a new open framework within which I will be able to monitor its development and allow it to review its objectives.</P>
    <P>As that process gets under way I will also be able to observe the effects of other provisions of the Bill which initiate new and more flexible techniques in the regulation of the road freight haulage industry.  The most important of these arises with the creation, as is proposed in section 6, of new licensing areas to supersede the existing exempted areas, which are being abolished, and to grant licences, as of right, in those areas on the sole basis of the qualitative criteria in the EEC Access Directive which came into effect on 1 January 1978.  People who were operating in those areas prior to that date will be entitled to their qualifications, in full or in part, under the directive but new entrants will have to fulfil all the necessary requirements. The radii of the new areas, based on the discontinued exempted areas at Dublin and Cork will be 20 miles as against 15 miles at present while the new areas based on those being eliminated at Waterford, Limerick and Galway will have 15 mile radii as against 10 mile radii as of now.</P>
    <P>Review of the exempted areas is, of course, long overdue.  The initial justification for them, which was to allow free transfers of goods between ships and the railway ceased to exist many years ago.  If they are to be regarded as devices which ensure adequate road freight transport services in the major urban centres, they no longer reflect the expansion which has taken place over the years in those centres. The proposal in the Bill will make <Col N="1455" /> use of the exempted area concept under which there has been no restriction on entry to the haulage business as a basis for a type of pilot scheme in qualitative licensing.</P>
    <P>A second experiment is intended to strengthen our position in the international haulage market.  The liberal policy exercised in relation to the grant of merchandise licences for international refrigerated haulage and the outstanding performance of Irish hauliers in that field encourage me in the belief that past restrictions have kept out of haulage a vigorous force of operators who if given the necessary freedom could contribute enormously to the development of an Irish international haulage fleet.  In section 4 of the Bill I am taking powers to grant licences for international haulage to Irish hauliers without being subject to the restrictive licensing provisions in the 1944 Act which at present inhibit, and would, indeed, permanently inhibit the development of any flexible licensing system.  These licences would be the reciprocal of the import/export transport licences at present granted to foreign hauliers under the 1971 Act.  The power to grant them may be used experimentally while the full potential of its use is being assessed.</P>
    <P>I attach particular importance to this provision because we need to strengthen our position in international haulage and lessen our dependence on outsiders so as to reduce our vulnerability in the event of any serious difficulty arising in the international haulage market.  It will not, of course, be possible to grant these licences to applicants who do not comply with the EEC Access Directive.</P>
    <P>It is my basic aim to encourage the further development of the international sector of the Irish road haulage industry.  The bulk of international road haulage is carried out under bilateral permits granted by the countries concerned and it is normal practice for countries to conclude bilateral road transport agreements with one another with a view to facilitating the operation and development of this traffic.  The growth of international <Col N="1456" /> operation by Irish road hauliers in recent years has given rise to the need to conclude bilateral road transport agreements with the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>With a view to facilitating Irish hauliers to obtain the necessary permits, which are sometimes required at short notice, my Department are currently negotiating such agreements with a number of European countries. Agreements with France, Belgium and the Federal Republic of Germany are already in operation.  Under those agreements Irish hauliers can obtain, direct from my Department, the necessary permits to operate to, from or in transit through the countries concerned, instead of having to apply to the countries concerned for the appropriate permits.</P>
    <P>Talks with the Italian authorities, which commenced in Rome on the conclusion of a bilateral agreement are to be resumed shortly.  Draft agreements received from the UK and the Netherlands are being considered and discussions with the transport authorities of those countries are in hand.  I will also consider the question of opening negotiations on similar agreements with other European countries as the need for such agreements arises for the facilitation of our hauliers.</P>
    <P>As part of the liberalisation of international road transport, agreement is reached from time to time both in the EEC and the ECMT and also in the course of the negotiations of bilateral road transport agreements for the exemption from licensing control of certain international road freight or road passenger transport operations.  While the necessary exemption in relation to EEC liberalisation measures can be made by way of Ministerial Order under the European Communities Act, 1972, there are at present no statutory provisions which would enable me to make similar exemptions in the other cases I have mentioned.  The purpose of section 5 of the Bill is to remedy this deficiency.</P>
    <P>A very important provision in section 2 of the Bill proposes the exemption from licensing controls of vehicles under 2.5 metric tons unladen weight subject to a maximum weight of six <Col N="1457" /> metric tons fully laden.  This type of exemption is found in a number of Community enactments.  I attach particular importance to it as a means by which many local rural transport problems in both commerce and agriculture may be solved.  It has been very difficult to service rural areas on an efficient basis.  Sometimes they have been served by large trucks which travel half-empty through the countryside to deliver very small consignments along the way.  In some cases it has not even been possible to provide this kind of service.  As well, there can be rural transport problems, which need a solution, in relation to the carriage of small quantities of produce of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>After the passing of this measure a local man in an area now badly served will be free to offer transport services, in a small vehicle suitable to the local needs of the area, to his neighbours, local traders or local industry.  Long hauls will be uneconomical except perhaps for the occasional express or special journey, but it will be the normal thing to serve local needs and, where appropriate, to run a groupage or a feeder service to link up with the railway or long distance transport concerns using heavy road vehicles.  It is these heavy vehicles that represent major business in road freight transport and altogether, apart from the benefits which decontrol of small vehicles would offer in rural areas, I am satisfied that there is not now any justification for statutory control of haulage in the smaller units.</P>
    <P>A further exemption for the carriage of wheat, oats and barley during the harvest period, is provided for in section 2.  I am strongly opposed to commodity exemptions and would not have considered this one except that there had been for many years what amounted to an all-the-year-round exemption for the carriage of wheat which for technical reasons was discontinued following our entry into the EEC.  Administrative arrangements to provide an assured supply of transport were made in succeeding years but amended legislation was clearly preferable.  It was also clear that to <Col N="1458" /> make new statutory arrangements for the carriage of wheat without providing for barley and oats would be very difficult to justify.  It would also be very difficult to justify an exemption for all cereals for the whole year. If all cereals were to be provided for then the better idea seemed to be to confine the exemptions categorically to the harvest period.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that with their new freedom licensed hauliers in general will be able to offer a more comprehensive service to the farming community than they have done before and that the farming community will respond accordingly, resorting to the exemption only in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have considered representations from the licensed hauliers in relation to penalties for illegal haulage.  The provisions of the 1933 Act and the Transport Act, 1958, are complicated in that they involve doubling and redoubling of fines for repeated offences up to a maximum of £320 and unrealistic in that they include forfeiture of the vehicle used.  Considering the value of road haulage vehicles nowadays I think a penalty of this order would be impossible either to defend or impose, and I see no justification for retaining an enforcement provision which no one would contemplate invoking.  Section 2 of the Bill proposes the simpler, more realistic fine of £250 for a first offence and £500 for second or subsequent offences.  It is my belief that the need for severe fines will diminish as illegal haulage becomes less attractive through licensed hauliers being in a position to offer a better deal than they now can. Moreover, intending hauliers who have committed repeated offences will find themselves unable to comply with the EEC Access Directive and thus debarred from being granted licences even on transfer, while new licensees may find their licences invalidated if they commit excessive breaches of the law.  I expect a changing picture in the enforcement field over the next few years and will keep the needs under review.</P>
    <P>The holder of a merchandise licence is required by law to have a vehicle plate affixed to each vehicle authorised <Col N="1459" /> for operation and in use under his licence.  Under existing legislation the plate has to be made of metal and be of uniform pattern irrespective of whether the relevant licence is restricted as to area or commodity or in any other such manner.  There has been pressure particularly by the hauliers for a change which would require the use of a distinctive plate on a vehicle in use under a restricted licence.  The case has been made that this would help the Garda in enforcing road transport legislation and thereby help to curb misuse of vehicle plates in some such cases where, it is claimed, they are being used illegally in connection with haulage which does not come within the scope of the licence held. I accept generally the validity of the argument made.  The provision which I propose in section 7 would give me the necessary scope to prescribe different type plates for a particular type of carriage, for instance, or for use under a restricted licence.</P>
    <P>Vehicle plates are issued by the Garda authorities.  It seems desirable that they be given authority to present evidence in court by way of a certificate signed by a chief superintendent or a superintendent acting on his behalf as to the issue or non-issue of a vehicle plate in a particular case.  This would obviate the need for the attendance in court of a member of the Garda to give such evidence and would be in line with a similar provision in existing road transport legislation for the presentation of such evidence as to the issue or non-issue of a merchandise licence to a particular person or company. Section 7 contains provisions accordingly.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 9 of the Bill tackles a problem that has existed since 1956 when, in effect, it became illegal to use a hired vehicle to carry one's own goods.  This measure was passed before leasing became common-place and we now have had, for many years, the serious anomaly that a businessman can lease all the premises, plant and equipment required for his business except the transport equipment. The barrier to vehicle leasing is also, I believe, unique in the EEC. <Col N="1460" /> Repeal of the 1956 Act could lead to an upsurge in own account transport which would run counter to the objective of the present measure.  On the other hand, some easement may enable firms who have been committing capital to own account vehicles to diversify their approach and commence leasing as a stepping-stone to the increased use of professional transport.  Change could also ensure the release of capital from transport investment to investment in manufacturing equipment and job creation.</P>
    <P>I have concluded that a controlled change in the 1956 legislation is warranted. Accordingly, I have decided to provide for vehicle leasing within the framework of the merchandise licence system and to keep the position under review.  The 1956 Act will remain in force but I will have power to regulate leasing outside the provisions of the Act by the attachment of conditions to merchandise licences.  I might add that decontrol of vehicles up to 2.5 metric tons in weight as is proposed in section 2 effectively repeals the 1956 Act in regard to that category of vehicle.</P>
    <P>In preparing these legislative proposals I have taken into account considerations based on a factor for which we must also have serious regard.  It is that the structure and circumstances enforced on the road freight industry of Ireland have deprived able and hard-working members of the industry of any real opportunity to earn a just reward for skill, hard work, enterprise or investment.  We owe to our hauliers an opportunity to demonstrate what they can do for the Irish economy before considering measures of liberalisation running beyond those contemplated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is, however, more to this than a plea based on equity alone.  The present position is that the enterprising haulier who wants to expand his business, say, from 2 vehicles to 3, can do so only by acquiring another business at very high cost.  The measure now proposed will allow him to expand without having to undertake that financial burden so that a very substantial cost saving will have been achieved.  If there were no change, the <Col N="1461" /> defects of the existing system would remain and increase.  CIE and the other licensed hauliers would be fighting for a diminishing share of the market and own account transport, which represents the real competition for them, would continue to develop with all its adverse cost implications.  The present measure offers a positive approach to current road freight transport problems.  It seeks to achieve a better balance between own account and professional transport and to lay a foundation for a new regime less costly than it might otherwise be which would meet national road freight transport needs on an improved basis with corresponding benefits to the licensed hauliers, including CIE.  This main objective will have beneficial side effects of several kinds including the prospect of avoiding an excessive increase in vehicle numbers on the roads and achieving a marked and rapid improvement in some sectors, notably in relation to rural transport.</P>
    <P>The holders of the main stock of merchandise licences and the enterprising hauliers prepared to enter international transport will be direct beneficiaries under this Bill.  In my opinion this is as it should be because the former are the backbone of the haulage industry and the latter are a bright hope for the future of the industry. It is up to them to take full advantage of the opportunities which the Bill affords.  All transport users should greatly benefit also not only because of an improvement in the supply of professional transport but also from the greater efficiency and economy which the Bill should make possible in transport services.  The freedom which the Bill offers for the use of light vehicles is potentially one of its greatest benefits and coupled with the other benefits already mentioned should lead rapidly to a new and welcome era in the development of the Irish transport industry.  I am satisfied that the package is a good one.  It offers progress on many fronts and it takes full account of existing difficulties without undue compromise.</P>
    <P>I confidently commend this Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Road Transport Bill, 1978, replaces the Road Transport Bill, 1976, which was circulated by the then Minister, Deputy P. Barry, and which lapsed with the general election of 1977.  Both Bills are based very substantially on the same fundamental principle of rationalisation of road haulage.  Both Bills are similar basically in that they are specifically designed to liberate the road haulage industry from the shackles and restrictions of the 1933 Road Transport Act.</P>
      <P>It is probably one of the strangest phenomena in modern economic development that, in this year of 1978, despite the advances technologically, economically and socially in this country and the rapid acceleration of industrial development, exports and so forth, the legislation governing road haulage and road transport up to now has been based fundamentally on the provisions of the 1933 Act.  The case for liberalisation is overwhelming. The calls for liberalising legislation have been continuous and forceful while the arguments put forward have been convincing.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that this Bill is a major step forward in the evolution of a professional, modern road haulage industry and that the ultimate objective would be the creation of a haulage industry free from the frustrating quantitative controls that have given rise to so much inefficiency and which has been regulated more or less by the quality of the performance required of its members.  This was the fundamental thinking behind the 1976 Bill but the difference is that that Bill envisaged going much further along the road to liberalisation than is proposed here.  What the Minister is proposing is a phased programme of liberalisation.  He says that what we need before an eventual pattern can materialise is a period during which we can ease away old restrictions while experimenting so far as we can as to the form and style of the flexible type of legislation now thought to be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrialists and exporters as well as many commentators in the field of <Col N="1463" /> transport have been advocating liberalisation measures.  The 1933 Act to which the Minister refers was designed, as was subsequent legislation with the exception of the 1971 Act, to protect the road and rail freight section of CIE in the first place and, secondly, to protect the then existing licensed hauliers.  While these objectives might have been achieved <i>per se</i>, as the Minister has said, they had very serious implications regarding the whole development of a national transport system.  They had serious implications, too, for the economy because what happened was that increasing numbers of firms, unable to get professional haulage services either from CIE or from a private concern, proceeded to purchase their own vehicles with the result that we have the highest percentage of own-account transport in Europe with the exception of Luxembourg, as the Minister has said.  This development had the result of forcing industrial and other commercial firms to purchase their own transport and operate it.  In that way there was added a new dimension to the operation of many concerns.  That was a development that most of these firms did not wish for.  It led also to another situation, that was, the colossal increase in the number of vehicles on the roads since own-account vehicles were generally of the smaller type.  Because of the restrictions of the 1933 Act it was not possible to develop a proper road haulage system.</P>
    <P>I am not clear regarding the reasons for the Minister's thinking that a phased approach to liberalisation is better than what was envisaged in the 1976 Bill.  Perhaps when he is replying he will elaborate on this and will tell us how long he thinks it will take to achieve the ultimate objective of the creation of a road haulage industry free from frustrating controls and restrictions.</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposal to increase the fines in respect of illegal haulage. The amounts fixed ten years ago bear little relationship to today's values and are no longer a deterrent.  I am sure that all sides of the House wish to see evolving a modern, highly-efficient <Col N="1464" /> transport system at the lowest cost possible but we must ensure that there are necessary controls and that illegal haulage is stamped out.</P>
    <P>Another difference in this Bill compared with the 1976 Bill relates to the provision proposed now regarding the leasing of vehicles.  Some very strong arguments have been put to me by various people who are in favour of changes in the legislation in this respect. I trust that the Minister is not hoping for the entire Bill today.  It is legislation that has implications for various people.  Therefore, it would be desirable that there be an opportunity between now and Committee Stage for the various people concerned to study the Bill in detail and perhaps to make representations to the Minister regarding amendments that they consider desirable.  Apart from the differences I have outlined the fundamental thinking both of the Minister and of those of us on this side of the House is the same.  The main difference relates to the pace of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister gave us a fairly detailed analysis of the road haulage industry I was disappointed with one aspect of his speech.  This is the first opportunity that we have had in the lifetime of the new Dáil so far to discuss road transport.  I had hoped the Minister would avail himself of this opportunity to give the House and the country his thinking, his plans and perhaps his policies for the development of a national transport agency. I recall the occasion in 1971 on which the then Minister, Deputy Lenihan, introduced a Transport Bill.  At that time I made the point that that Bill was another instalment of what could be called a continuous series of uncoordinated, patchwork, <i>ad hoc</i> type legislative measures that had been characteristic of the history of transport here.  I can say the same of this Bill.  The mistake that was made in the past, a mistake that I trust the Minister is not making here, has been looking at road haulage, road transport or CIE <i>per se</i> without giving any thought whatsoever to the implication of those measures.  One obvious implication of this Bill, the liberalisation of road transport, is the capacity of our <Col N="1465" /> road systems to carry the additional road transport envisaged here.  When we talk about liberalising road transport we are talking about expanding it.  This has serious implications <i>vis-à-vis</i> our road network.</P>
    <P>When I raise the question of the capacity of our roads, the standard of our roads and so forth, which is very relevant to the liberalisation of road transport, the Minister can rightly say that the question of road maintenance and so forth is a matter for the Minister for the Environment.  If I talk about the social effects of EEC transport legislation I find that certain aspects of the EEC transport regulations are administered by the Minister for Labour, for example, the controversial matter of the tachograph. The Minister for Justice has responsibility for administering other aspects of road traffic; licensing and the importation of vehicles come under the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, and excise duties come under the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There is a very important point here which is related to what I said about transport legislation here being uncoordinated and of a patchwork type.  I am not saying this in any controversial fashion.  Transport is a fundamental sector of our national economy and it should get a much higher order of priority in national planning, development and thinking.  We are a small peripheral maritime region and we are now a member of the European Economic Community but our exporters, our industrialists and the people who are trading with Europe have to bear a higher element of transport costs than any of their competitors in the UK or the mainland of Europe.  This is because we are further away from the European mainland than any of our EEC partners and we have to transport our goods much longer distances.  We have as well a very long sea crossing.  The result of this is that transport charges are a very important element in the cost competitiveness of Irish exports. It is vital that we should turn our energies towards achieving what I consider is the fundamental and most basic objective of national transport <Col N="1466" /> policy now, that is to ensure particularly our exporters, industrialists and the people who are trading with Europe have available to them the most efficient, lowest cost transport system we can provide.</P>
    <P>I have read a lot recently on the question of transport.  One fact that has emerged in relation to transport charges is that it is reckoned by independent experts that our road transport charges are 25 per cent higher than they need be and that this imposes a very severe additional burden and has a major implication for the cost competitiveness of Irish exports. Road transport is a very important element of the Irish transport scene. We have a major problem in relation to the development of road transport. It is wrong to look at road transport as the be-all and end-all of national freight transport here.  We must look at the question of the liberalisation of road transport in relation to the condition of our roads.</P>
    <P>I discovered last week that An Foras Forbartha have done a great amount of research into the capacity, the adequacy and the conditions of our road network.  I did not bring the volumes from the library but one striking fact emerged from my perusal of An Foras Forbartha's report, that is that about 40 per cent of our primary roads and about the same percentage of our secondary roads are not adequate to carry the present volume of traffic.  An excellent study was carried out by the Confederation of Irish Industries.  They produced a report on road freight transport 1973 to 1974 in which they adverted to the question of the impact of road transport on the roadways.</P>
    <P>An Foras Forbartha's report put the roads into different categories (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f).  Category (d) was considered just marginally adequate.  The Foras Forbartha report found that many of the national primary routes are inadequate and cannot even give the level of service (d).  Those routes include all the Dublin-Belfast routes south of Ballymascanlon, the main route from Dublin to the west as far as Enfield, the main southern route between Naas and Kildare, the south-eastern route <Col N="1467" /> between Dublin and Rathnew and the Cork-Limerick route between Cork and Mallow.  The report says they cannot even give the level of service (d).  This service is regarded as the minimum level of service.  It is defined as an unstable flow of traffic, fluctuations in traffic volume and temporary restrictions which may cause substantial drops in operating speeds, drivers have little room to manoeuvre, and comfort and convenience are low.  This is the position in a substantial part of our national primary routes.</P>
    <P>I saw reports in the media about a seminar last week in Dún Laoghaire in which an official from the Department of the Environment adverted to this fact.  He pointed out the totally unsatisfactory position in relation to the condition of our roads and their inadequacy to carry the volume of traffic on them.  He referred to one amazing figure.  The number of vehicles of all kinds on our roads increased from 250,000, 20 years ago, to 750,000 at the moment and the projections for the next ten years indicate that the number of vehicles will increase by three or fourfold.</P>
    <P>This aspect of road transport raises the very serious national problem of the roads.  The time has come when the Government must look at the transport situation, its role in the national economy, the different modes of transport and so on.  We must, as a basic national objective formulate and implement a comprehensive cohesive integrated transport policy.  The introduction of legislative measures to further liberalise road haulage and the role of the railways in relation to freight transport will have to be looked at.  The possibilities for developing air freight transport will also have to be examined. As was pointed out recently in relation to our exports problems, there is no point in having very efficient shipping services if our internal transport network is inefficient.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments put forward against liberalising road transport was that it would have an adverse effect on CIE.  When we circulated our Bill in 1976 Fianna Fáil were so frightened that instead of allowing a Second Reading <Col N="1468" /> and then submitting amendments, they tabled what was known as a reasoned amendment, totally rejecting the entire 1976 Bill because the provisions in the Bill would cause heavy unemployment in the rail and road freight sections of CIE and among the employees of licensed hauliers at a time of high unemployment.  They said that the Bill contained no provisions to control the standards of road transport and heavy road vehicles and that the provisions of the Bill would cause further heavy congestion on an inadequate road system and put the continuation of the railways in jeopardy.  They said that the Bill would enable hauliers from outside the jurisdiction to operate an unlimited number of vehicles.  Those views were expressed by Fianna Fáil about 18 months ago.  The implications for CIE of liberalising road transport have been taken into account in all the transport legislation we have had since 1933.  The 1933 Act did not achieve its objective which was to enable the CIE rail and road freight sections to expand. There was a decline in the volume of freight carried by road and rail by CIE.  The 1933 Act was self-destructive. As a public representative I am worried about any adverse effects legislation of this kind might have on CIE.  We discussed this in 1971 when we were liberalising livestock and certain agricultural commodities.</P>
    <P>During the last week I took the trouble to look at the situation in the road freight and rail freight sections of CIE.  I was delighted to find that since 1974 there has been a tremendous change for the better in the policy of CIE in relation to road and rail freight. In 1974 CIE started to implement a major modernisation programme in their road and rail freight sections. CIE have been at the receiving end of more abuse and adverse criticism than any other State company.  In relation to any question about liberalising road haulage the first thing to come to mind is, &ldquo;will it affect CIE?&rdquo;  I came across an article recently which is very relevant to this Bill, by Mr. John F. Higgins, the general manager of CIE, in a journal called <i>Rail International.</i> The article written last September reads as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> The railways are being reshaped and adapted to meet the changing needs in society and will emerge better suited to face the challenge and opportunity of the future.</P>
    <P>In a detailed reference to road freight on page 442 of the journal Mr. Higgins went on:</P>
    <P>The freight services are being radically overhauled to complement the attenuated network and to take advantage of the more up-to-date developments in mechanical handling. Freight handling is being centralised in twenty-five major depots fully equipped for inter-modal transfer.</P>
    <P>There are 45 sub-depots as well.  The article goes on to point out the success of CIE in developing a common modern mode of haulage on the continent. In the central depots and sub-depots there is an integrated system of feed-in by the road freight section of CIE and indeed by private hauliers as well.  I am impressed by the manner in which CIE faced this challenge of modernising their road and rail freight sections.  Under the restricted legislation of 1933, CIE's business was going downhill but under the new modern challenge over the last three or four years, business is increasing.  In 1977 CIE carried 3.7 million tons of freight by rail and the projection for this year is 5.5 million tons.  I do not hold with the argument&mdash;and I am sure the Minister recognises this&mdash;that CIE need to be protected in the way they have been since 1933.  In 1974 they had to face the fact that, under EEC rules and regulations, their road freight and freight section generally, must pay its way by 1980.  There have been tremendous developments made on the haulage of iron ore and other minerals, fertilisers, cement and the haulage of chemicals to industry and so on.</P>
    <P>We need to take a look at the global transport situation, at the need to formulate and implement a national transport policy making the optimum use of the various modes of transport, road, rail and sea, internally and also that of access transport.  This is a highly technical exercise, one which involves the co-operation of many disciplines <Col N="1470" /> and the co-ordination of many viewpoints but it is something that will have to be tackled in the very near future.</P>
    <P>As a matter of urgency I would respectfully suggest that the Minister consider the preparation of a White Paper on transport.  This would enable public debate to take place and afford us an opportunity of discussing the national implications of a transport policy.  I do not know what progress has been made in the Minister's Department in regard to the setting up of a national transport council.  I do not want to be petty or controversial on this point but, prior to the election last year, there was a commitment for the setting up of such a council or co-ordinating body.  The Minister reiterated that commitment some time after Christmas when I asked him questions here in this regard.  I should like to know what progress has been made.  As a first step, I would favour the setting up of a national transport council representative of the different modes of transport whose first aim should be the publishing of a White Paper.  Furthermore, based on the findings of such a White Paper, there should be formulated and implemented a comprehensive national transport policy.</P>
    <P>I commend CIE on the progress they have made over the past few years on the modernisation of their freight section. It is probably true to say that the basic overall aim of a national transport policy should be the provision, for our exporters in particular, of the lowest cost and most efficient transport service in order to neutralise the effect of the additional long distances to be travelled to the markets of Europe and so on.</P>
    <P>Another basic aim of any transport policy should be the taking of as much heavy freight traffic off the roads as possible.  Due to the courtesy of CIE some years ago I had an opportunity of visiting the six original Common Market countries prior to our entry to the EEC, when I had an opportunity of looking at the rail and general transport systems of those countries. It was a very interesting tour lasting six or seven days.  The basic aim of <Col N="1471" /> the transport policy of each of those countries was to transfer as much heavy traffic as was possible from the roads to the railways.  I hope CIE will continue to intensify their sale of the railways for the maximum haulage of freight.</P>
    <P>I have made inquiries with regard to what has been happening in the development of air freight.  Of course, the more freight there is carried by air the less there will be to be carried on the roads and railways.  I was pleased to learn from Aer Lingus that there has been a substantial upswing in the volume of freight they carry between this country and Europe.  In 1972 European freight amounted to only 6 per cent of CIE's total freight business.  It now amounts to over 15 per cent.  We have been very interested here in the whole question of air freight because of the existence of the industrial estate at Shannon.  There has been substantial industrial development in western regions in recent times, but essentially goods and raw materials are imported through east coast ports and largely exported through them also.  This has created a huge additional volume of heavy freight transport on the roads.  In addition to examining the possibility of attracting more business to the railways the Minister might also examine the question of attracting more business through air freight.  The possibility of evolving a national ports policy will also have to be examined very seriously, particularly the development of one or two ports along the western sea-board. I would remind the Minister of the existence of the Shannon Estuary. Indeed, I hope he is not forgetting the Shannon Estuarial Bill.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the importance of transport <i>vis-à-vis</i> the national economy, our position as a small country removed from European markets and the additional transport charges our businessmen must bear.  There is another element that has been overlooked not merely by us but by the EEC also, that is, that transport is a vital element of regional development. I feel very strongly about this because, during my term of office as Minister for the Gaeltacht, I became very much <Col N="1472" /> aware of the vital dimension of transport in relation to industrial development, say, at Gweedore, Connemara, west Mayo, Dingle and so on.  During that period I was abroad meeting industrialists in an endeavour to encourage them to set up industry in Gaeltacht regions.  But whether I met such industrialists at home or abroad the question of the remoteness of say, Carna, Gweedore or Carrickfinn from Dublin always arose.  It was for that reason that I decided, in 1973, that the fastest way possible by which we could improve transport and communication was through the development of air services, by building airfields and developing parallel air services.  I understand that my successor will be in Donegal next week to open the new airfield at Carrickfinn.  Therefore, transport is vitally important to regional development also.</P>
    <P>I might make a final point in relation to the EEC.  The Minister and any successor of his would need to keep a close watch on the implications of EEC regulations, new rules and so on in the field of road transport.  There was the question of a tachograph in respect of which I understand we have now been given a breathing space of three years.  All of these measures can have very serious effects on the whole transport system here.  The EEC need to be reminded that we are a small, underdeveloped country, with a road network that will need to be improved and upgraded at a cost of hundreds of millions.</P>
    <P>These are my observations on this Stage.  I shall have something to say on a number of the provisions on Committee Stage.  Basically, I favour liberalisation and I am a little doubtful as to whether or not the Minister was wise in not going the whole way along the road to liberalisation at this stage but I have an open mind on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>My first remarks will be critical but not necessarily in respect of the content of the Bill or anything the Minister said in his opening speech.  When a Bill of this nature is introduced we should have an explanatory memorandum circulated <Col N="1473" /> with it for the convenience of Deputies.  The Minister may say it is a short Bill but we should have some information on the provisions of section 2 (3) of the 1933 Act, section 4 (7) of the 1934 Act and on the references also to the 1971 Act.  That has been done in the past.  It was done in the case of the Health Contributions Bill and, when it is done, Deputies know exactly what the references are. This is not a severe criticism.  I merely mention the matter by way of suggestion to the Minister and his officials.</P>
      <P>We had the advantage, if one could so describe it, of some information in a Press release from the GIS.  That was some help.  In that release the Minister said the purpose of the Bill was to strengthen the haulage industry and contain haulage costs through increased efficiency.  Is the Minister confident this will be the outcome of this Bill?  Will it really do that? Legislation is needed, has long been needed, to provide for proper road haulage transport and proper regulations in respect of the haulage industry in general.  If the Minister is not in a position to bring forward more positive suggestions then he should accept Deputy O'Donnell's suggestion of a White Paper on road transport and haulage.</P>
      <P>A great many people are under a misapprehension about road haulage. If you ask someone not intimately connected with road haulage he will tell you that CIE have a monopoly. We still have this cry about CIE and their monopoly.  The facts, of course, are entirely different.  From the information I have&mdash;I may be wrong to the extent of a few percentage points&mdash;55 per cent of the transport of goods is catered for by manufacturing companies.  The professional hauliers have 17½ per cent and CIE have only 15 per cent.  The balance is carried by those engaged in distribution or in the services.  It is time that misapprehension was corrected.  It is time the myth was exploded.  CIE do not have a virtual monopoly, or any monopoly of road transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst I would favour the nationalisation of various services I can understand <Col N="1474" /> the dilemma and difficulties of manufacturing companies who have one-way carriage.  This has proved very expensive for them.  In an article in a newspaper recently I read a statement to the effect that road haulage by manufacturing companies was in many cases up to 25 per cent of their total annual expenditure.  This is due to the fact that they have only one-way carriage. I do not know if that is strictly observed.  It also appears that CIE are not able to cope with manufacturers' needs.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.  It seems to me odd that CIE are not able to cater for manufacturers' needs.  Will the Minister tell us if the share of the haulage market held by CIE will be further diminished?  The professional hauliers have increased and are still increasing their share of the market.</P>
    <P>The need for new legislation is supported by the fact that the number of haulage licences is still 750.  It stood at that figure quite some years ago. That 750 is in respect of some 1,200 vehicles.  How much illegal transport is there?  How many operate with no licences at all or with a greater number of trucks than they are entitled to under a licence?  Possibly the authorities turn a blind eye, but illegal or private transport is engaged in to a fairly large extent.  If this Bill helps to prevent that it will do a good day's work.</P>
    <P>I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> that we now have 10,000 vehicles, or we had in 1977, and these commercial vehicles are increasing year by year.  Are they used by manufacturing companies, by legitimate hauliers or by people who have no licences to engage in the haulage business?  I would be particularly concerned about the effect of this on Córas Iompair Éireann.  We must be conscious of the extent to which we, as legislators, the Minister and his Government are involved.  We must be concerned about the effect of any legislation on CIE.  We have had to dole out quite an amount of taxpayers' money to CIE over the last few decades.  I believe the Exchequer subvention to CIE this year will be in the region of £35 million.  Does the introduction of this legislation mean <Col N="1475" /> that there must be further financial subventions made to CIE?  The new Bill will put a number of people in competition with CIE for the haulage of goods and livestock.</P>
    <P>I am informed that CIE have development plans for the improvement of the railway system.  How far has consideration of these plans progressed in recent times?  I would reiterate what Deputy O'Donnell and many other people say, particularly those in my party: why can we not make more use of the railways?  We all know that so far as the transportation of goods is concerned CIE always seem to get the uneconomic cargo.  My information is that CIE have development plans for the improvement of the rail services in respect of haulage and perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</P>
    <P>CIE are a very vital factor in this. People are under the mistaken impression that they have a monopoly of haulage of goods, particularly on the roads.  I would like to ask if CIE have been consulted about this?  Do they agree that these changes are desirable?  Do they protest that these proposals will have an adverse effect on their operations and on their finances?  As I said before, if CIE cannot meet their debts at the end of the year, does that mean we will have to vote more money for them?</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to greatly increase the number of road haulage licences.  &ldquo;Road&rdquo; must be emphasised as much as &ldquo;haulage&rdquo;.  What effect will this increase in road haulage licences have on our roads?  Are our roads suitable?  We all know the awful damage being done to our roads at present, not alone by the juggernauts but by the substantially increased numbers of trucks on our roads in the last ten or 15 years.  I know the Minister for the Environment is concerned about this and also about the increase in the number of our motoring population.</P>
    <P>One day last week there was a seminar on roads.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy J. O'Leary, expressed his concern about the state of our roads and asked if they could cater for the everincreasing <Col N="1476" /> traffic.  I am sure the Minister has noticed in his own home town, in Drogheda, Dundalk, Ardee and so on, that our roads are being broken not just by the frost and snow but by the juggernauts and big lorries which have been increasing in numbers over the last few years.  For that reason it would be desirable to adopt Deputy O'Donnell's suggestion and not alone have a White Paper on goods transport but on the transport system itself, including the roads.</P>
    <P>The roadworthiness of many of these trucks has to be questioned and the Minister in charge of road haulage should consult with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment.  Without having any expert knowledge of trucks or vehicles, we can all see from the bald tyres, screeching and defective brakes that there are a number of trucks, possibly illegal trucks, which need to be checked.  The maintaining of the speed limit by juggernauts and other trucks which bring cargo to our ports is possibly a matter for the Minister for the Environment, but it must also be the concern of the Minister for Tourism and Transport.</P>
    <P>I quoted a figure of 10,000&mdash;I presume they include juggernauts&mdash;in the country at present.  As a result of this legislation, how many more trucks or juggernauts, or a combination of both, will we have in one, two, three, four or five years?  We are not just legislating for 1978 or 1979.  I presume we are legislating for the next ten, 15 or 20 years.  We know many changes will occur.  We should have our eye to the future to see what the traffic position will be on our roads and ask ourselves seriously if our roads can carry the ever-increasing numbers of vehicles. The Minister will have to give us a better explanation for his proposals either in his reply or on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into detail on this Bill because that will be a matter for the Committee Stage.  When this Bill is passed there will be an obligation on people who engage in the haulage of goods to have a licence.  If there are pirate hauliers&mdash;and according to all the evidence there must be&mdash; will they be stopped because they are operating to the detriment of the good <Col N="1477" /> hauliers and CIE?  Perhaps a blind eye is being turned to this by some Department, but I do not think that is so.  It is recognised, as far as CIE and certain licensed road hauliers are concerned, that there are conditions as regards wages and hours of work laid down by the various trade unions of which these drivers and their helpers may be members.  The pirate appears to get away with murder and consequently is able to underquote the legitimate haulier and CIE.</P>
    <P>In section 2 there is a need to revise fines for engaging in illegal hauling. The Minister mentioned a maximum figure for a second fine of £320.  This Bill proposes that the fine for the first offence would be £250 and for the second £500.  That is far too small when one considers that the legislation providing those fines was passed many years ago.  The Minister should have another look at this.  It must be remembered that we want to punish by way of fines those who are engaged in illegal hauling so that legitimate hauliers may be able to compete in a fair way.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 2 (5), I would favour the exemptions which the Minister has mentioned and which are provided for here.  This is desirable because I am sure that people find it difficult to engage someone with a large lorry or truck to carry small loads.  Now it will be possible for someone to engage a haulier who has a vehicle or trailer which does not exceed 2.5 metric tons unladen weight.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is one of the most important sections.  According to section 3 (3) (a), an existing carrier's licence shall be multiplied by six.  Section 3 (3) (b) refers to other cases but I think that these other cases were not specified by the Minister.  If they were, I did not hear the reference.  The maximum number of licences is to be 80. That is a shattering sort of figure, though there may be qualifications.  It means that everyone who has a licence for one truck can have a licence for six.  The Minister nods his head so I assume I am right.  In other cases&mdash;not specified&mdash;he can have 80.  Is this at the discretion of the Minister or is it given automatically?  This is what I <Col N="1478" /> would like to know because it seems to me that we will have more trucks than people in a short while.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this point.</P>
    <P>The carriage of cattle, sheep and pigs is also exempted, as is the carriage of harvest from the beginning of August to the end of November.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided in section 4 for the recognition of a licence issued by another State with which we have international agreements.  I understand from the Minister's remarks that this is not confined to EEC countries and that we can have such arrangements with countries outside the EEC, possibly in eastern Europe. I do not know how we have operated up to this, whether legally or illegally, but it is good that the licensing should be on a formal and legal basis.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to be a little parochial and I would refer the Minister to section 6.  Section 6 (3) states:</P>
    <P>Each of the following areas shall be known as a new area&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the area included within a circle having a radius of twenty miles and its centre at the principal post office in the city of Dublin;</P>
    <P>(b)  the area included within a circle having a radius of twenty miles and its centre at the principal post office in the city of Cork;</P>
    <P>This means that the radius will be increased from 15 miles to 20 miles.  In the case of Limerick there was a radius of 10 miles and this is now being increased to 15 miles and there is a similar increase in respect of Waterford and Galway.  Did the Minister ever think about a port called Rosslare Harbour?  It is said of Rosslare Harbour that, with the new development, it will be the second port in the country.  I do not see why there is this discrimination between Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway. I trust that the Minister will include Rosslare Harbour.  Last week he announced that a big development scheme at Rosslare Harbour had been approved by the Government and I hope that this scheme will be initiated <Col N="1479" /> in a very short time.  Even if all the areas do not have the same radius, Rosslare Port should be included and I will be putting down an amendment to that effect.  There is no need to laud Rosslare Harbour as a port because according to the experts it will be in a very short time, if it is not already, the second port in the country.</P>
    <P>These are the general comments I want to make on the Bill.  We will have a more detailed discussion on Committee Stage.  In respect of the matters I have mentioned, I trust the Minister will consider them well.  I trust he will include Rosslare Harbour among those ports where licences can extend within a radius of 15 miles or 20 miles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a Bill on which one can say very much but I want to make a few brief comments. The last two speakers referred to the question of transport but this is a matter for the Department of the Environment.  If we were to discuss transport in general it would be ruled out of order, but to me it is very relevant and I agree with the other speakers that this matter needs to be examined.</P>
      <P>This Bill is absolutely essential and is overdue.  We need a certain amount of liberalisation and this is what the Bill is all about.  Deputy Corish referred to the number of licences which can be obtained.  If a man has one licence he can now get six licences.  There should be control of licences because I can envisage the country dotted with huge lorries.  I am very much in favour of doing away with licences for small trucks which operate within a radius of about 20 miles.  It is terrible when large trucks have to use by-roads when they are only half full.  The decision to grant exemptions for farm produce is very important but I wonder how the Minister will define &ldquo;harvest&rdquo;.  What instructions will be given to the gardaí concerning the harvest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had not intended to speak on this Bill but I want to say that I agree with it.  I remember when the restrictions were introduced years ago.  They were <Col N="1480" /> introduced for a particular purpose but they did not do what they were intended to do because the services provided at that time and since were not what the private individual wanted.  The result was that anyone in business bought a lorry or a truck of his own and these took away business from public transport.  Anyone who could afford a truck bought one.  I am very worried about the use of our roads by very heavy trucks and I would not like to see too many of them. County Galway was supposed to have the second best roads in the country but it appears that after a few very dry summers the roads have deteriorated.  There should be certain restrictions imposed with regard to licences.  Our roads are not capable of carrying heavy trucks.  When we are discussing the Department of the Environment I shall discuss the merits or otherwise of trucks and rail transport.</P>
    <P>This Bill is necessary and it can be teased out on Committee Stage.  I agree with the approach adopted by two speakers on the Opposition benches.  They dealt with the Bill in an objective way.  I am sure we will be able to improve the Bill on Committee Stage.  On Second Stage discussions of any Bill there are usually speeches of a political nature but on Committee Stage each section is discussed and dealt with on its merits.  Many Bills have been improved as a result of discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  I understand it will get the support of all sides of the House.  It is long overdue. We should have had a Bill like this some years ago but better late than never.  I wish again to emphasise the desirability of restricting the number of licences granted for heavy vehicles.  Those vehicles are a hazard. Our roads are not able to carry them. I congratulate the Minister on what he has done with regard to smaller trucks.  This will be of considerable benefit to the agricultural community.</P>

Tig liom a rá leo go ndéanfaidh mé scrúdú ar an méid atá ráite acu agus tá súil agam nuair a bheidh am againn le dul isteach ins an Bhille go mion go mbeidh an Bille, mar adéarfá, i gceart do na ghnaithe gur cuireadh os cómhair na Dála é.</P>
      <P>Briefly, I wish to thank the Deputies who have spoken.  It is obvious that they have studied the Bill and the suggestions they made will be considered very carefully.  Deputy O'Donnell mentioned the 1976 Bill.  My fear with regard to that Bill was that it might tend towards monopoly situations but I do not think the present measure is susceptible to the criticisms raised in this House with regard to the 1976 Bill.  It differs from that measure in the essential respect that it contains safeguards against monopolisation of the market either by home or foreign hauliers in a manner that would be prejudicial to the interests of the licensed hauliers, including CIE and their employees, as well as the railways.  It introduces in a positive way the principle of qualitative control in relation to licensing that was not provided for in the 1976 measure.  It will have increasing backup from the EEC directive on vehicle testing which must be phased in by 1 January 1983.  The roads programme in so far as it may be affected by the present proposals will be given due consideration by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>I felt it was better to try to phase in this programme in order to give us an opportunity to study the effects of what we are doing and also to study the effect of what further liberalisation would be likely to mean to the haulage industry in general.  The basic aim in relation to the Bill is to try as much as possible to encourage people who are involved presently in what we call own-account transport to use both CIE and other licensed professional hauliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish raised a point in relation to CIE when he suggested that perhaps this Bill would have the opposite effect on CIE, that is, that the relatively <Col N="1482" /> small percentage of the market they have at present would become even smaller.  I think the Deputy will agree that the main contenders for business that the professional hauliers and CIE have at the moment are the own-account people.  They have a very high percentage of the total while the licensed hauliers and CIE have a relatively small percentage of the total. This is more or less in conflict with the situation that exists in other EEC countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that CIE as well as the professional hauliers will benefit from this Bill in the sense that, hopefully, own-account people will be encouraged to change from having their own vehicles to utilising CIE and the professional hauliers. I know this will not happen in every case but it will happen in many instances.</P>
      <P>I made a study of this own-account business and I should like to see it changed in two respects.  In itself it is uneconomic.  As Deputy Corish mentioned, they are able to carry in one direction only and because they cannot take a load back or out, depending on which direction they are carrying their own goods, it is uneconomic in that sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish also mentioned the possibility that there might be more vehicles on the roads because of this. In actual practice, from experience in other countries, the opposite is likely to happen.  The reason is that an own-account lorry travelling laden in one direction and travelling back without a load means that two vehicles have to do the work of one.  If they were using professional hauliers or CIE, <Col N="1483" /> loads could be brought in both directions. Possibly there will be a reduction because of that.</P>
    <P>I have some figures which show that the number of vehicles in the Republic increased from 44,000 in 1959 to 47,000 in 1966 and to 54,000 in 1976, whereas in Northern Ireland the number was 33,000 in 1959, 43,000 in 1966&mdash;and in that year transport was completely liberalised&mdash;and in 1976 it was down to 40,000, 3,000 less.  Admittedly this could have something to do with the size of the vehicles as well. My main concern in relation to the own-account situation is that the capital that many small industrialists must invest in transport could be much more beneficially invested in their own business, and possibly could produce more jobs, rather than by being invested in their own vehicles.  For that reason alone, if people who are using their own vehicles for the transport of their own goods would change over to the professional hauliers their financial situation would be much better and they would have a better opportunity to develop their own industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell suggested that I should have spent more time dealing with general transport matters, but he will admit that, in dealing with the Bill which has a specific purpose, it is rather difficult to deal with transport generally.  We gave a commitment in our election manifesto to introduce a transport consultative commission and we are actively pursuing that.</P>

      <P>I cannot say exactly when it will be ready.  The Deputy will know from his own experience that these things have to be examined by various Departments who have an interest in them.  Therefore, it is not possible for me to say anything further at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased that Deputy Corish and Deputy O'Donnell had complimentary remarks to make about CIE. CIE get a lot of stick.  Because they are a public transport system, people tend to think they should be capable <Col N="1484" /> of dealing with every possible emergency. In the circumstances in which they find themselves, CIE are doing a reasonably good job.  As was mentioned by both Deputies, recently they have been attempting to streamline their activities and this is proving very worth while.  There are areas, of course, where they can be criticised, but that is possible in relation to any transport company or to anything on this earth. As I said, far from losing out on this Bill I think they should gain from it.</P>
    <P>The question of the railways was also raised.  It does not relate specifically to the Bill.  It is EEC policy to preserve the railways and to utilise them in so far as it is possible to do so.  That is also the policy here.  The railways lend themselves to particular types of transport and CIE are endeavouring to give the best possible service.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the new approach in the Bill with regard to leasing.  As I said in my opening speech, my main concern in this area is to give an opportunity to various industrialists who have their own transport to ease themselves out of that type of transport through a leasing system and eventually to utilise professional hauliers and CIE also are professional hauliers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish's figures on CIE are, I think, based on an analysis of transport expenses.  I am told CIE and the other hauliers are now estimated to have only about 10 per cent or 11 per cent of road tonnage.</P>

      <P>CIE have less than 5 per cent.  In those circumstances CIE will do better under the new system than under the present system.  Deputy Callanan asked how we define harvest time.  It is from August to November inclusive.  That should cover the harvest period reasonably well.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish raised the question of illegal haulage. Apart altogether from fines, illegal <Col N="1485" /> haulage should be phased out by degrees because of the fact that licensed hauliers will be able to give a more efficient service and to put more vehicles on the road than previously.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish referred to the multiple of six and the maximum of 80.  The fact in relation to the 80, is that it deals with a situation where a multiple of six because of the number of vehicles on a specific licence, would actually give the licensee much more than 80.  I confined the number to 80. The vast majority of the licences have only one vehicle on them.  A certain number have two.  There are a few which have quite a number, in one instance 22, which would mean very considerably more than 80.  In the 1976 Bill there were no limitations whatsoever.  In this Bill I decided to limit the total to 80.  From experience there will be very few hauliers who will have 80 vehicles on the road.</P>

      <P>As I said before, the position in relation to the 1976 Bill was that there was no limitation at all so that one could have 1,000 if one wanted.  Considering the cost of the vehicles I doubt if many would be interested in having 80 vehicles.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also mentioned Rosslare Harbour.  The areas I have referred to were known as exempted areas.  They are now being abolished and I am adding on a number of miles.  I do not think it would be to the advantage of Rosslare to be an exempted area.  Rosslare Harbour would, however, have the benefit of the import-export licence, a new type of licence.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is some confusion about statistics?  For instance, we were trying to arrive at the percentage road haulage CIE carried.  Is the Minister aware that the last official transport statistics available to us are contained in a survey carried out in 1964 by the CSO?  I suggest it is desirable that we carry out another survey to update the 1964 figures, the only ones available to us, other than a study carried out by the Confederation of Irish Industry.</P>

      <P>The Bill is a short one.  Deputy Corish complained about the fact that there was no Explanatory Memorandum but I followed a precedent set when the 1976 Bill was circulated.  I did not make available an Explanatory Memorandum but issued a Press release. I accept that it would have been helpful if an Explanatory Memorandum was circulated.  Although this is a short Bill its provisions are wide ranging.  It is a Bill of opportunity for the haulage industry.  If hauliers and users take advantage of the opportunities offered we should bring into prospect a genuinely thriving road freight transport industry which will make a positive contribution to the welfare of the economy.  I look forward to a new and better era in road freight haulage of which this Bill is the initial measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Estimate which is of colossal proportions.  No ministry has such wide-ranging powers and duties as the Department of the Environment.  Items in the Estimate affect all of us, not just national politicians but members of local authorities also.  Firstly, I should like to deal with the question of roads.  Roads can make or break industries and towns.  The ease of access and travel can have a major bearing on the initial location of an industry.  I want to plead with the Minister to see that road links to the south-east, in particular to the city of Waterford, are considerably improved. The condition of those roads has an adverse affect on the growth of this area.  More money should be spent improving those links.  There are many major road links from such cities as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Sligo and, in Northern Ireland, from Derry and Belfast and there are many highways from those cities on which motorists and lorry drivers can travel <Col N="1488" /> with great ease.  However, the road links to the south-east are diabolical.</P>
      <P>In regard to this I should like to refer to a statement made by the planning officer of Waterford Corporation some weeks ago.  He said that there was a general awareness in Waterford that the road links between the city and Dublin are notoriously bad and that major roadwork improvements are necessary prerequisites to the development of Waterford.  He said that recent surveys carried out on behalf of the South-Eastern Regional Development Organisation indicated that the Dublin Road was in a dangerous condition, exhausting to travel on and unsatisfactory even for freight transport.  The planning officer said that the regional manager of the IDA also criticised the inadequate road link as being damaging to Waterford's job creation chances.  That is an indictment of the conditions of the road from Waterford to Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, in a Press release issued on 21 December, announced that a loan of £13.1 million had been granted by the European Investment Bank to the Government to help meet the cost of more than 200 improvement projects on at least 40 roads in the annual works programme for 1977 and 1978.  The report says that the works to be carried out at a cost of about £26 million are concerned in particular with improving the national road network to establish better communication in industrial centres with areas where industrial development is being promoted and with centres of tourism.</P>
      <P>The south-eastern region, Waterford in particular, comes within the ambit of that statement and we are asking for a sizeable portion of that grant which we were told was being awarded by the EEC last December.  We are being hampered in our efforts to attract industry to Waterford city by lack of a proper highway system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter likely to affect growth and industrial expansion in that area is the lack of a new bridge across the River Suir.  At present the bridge which connects Waterford with south Kilkenny and Dublin is quite old and dilapidated needing constant <Col N="1489" /> attention if it is not to be closed down. Built in 1911 it badly needs replacement. In 1968 Waterford Corporation sought a bridge order and ever since they have been preparing plans for a new bridge.  Last August a final report was submitted to the Department of the Environment by Waterford Corporation and it is still awaiting sanction in the Minister's office.  I plead with the Minister to give the sanction as soon as possible because that link is absolutely vital.  If anything happened the existing bridge Waterford, for all practical purposes, would be cut off.  The present bridge is anything but good.  We are being left in the lurch in this matter because other centres are not experiencing the same difficulty with road transport problems. Limerick, according to recent Press reports, will shortly have its third bridge across the Shannon whereas we have not one decent bridge to serve the Waterford area.  These matters are vital if areas are to have industrial growth because nobody wants to travel to an area with bumpy, twisting roads which is what we have at present.</P>
    <P>I think the time has come for a new look at our road system, safety matters and traffic management.  There is great need for the concept of by-passes.  We are getting to them very slowly but we should press forward and develop a series of by-passes around many towns which at present are bottlenecks.  Naas, in particular, is such a town; there are many others.  These create great hardships on industrialists and motorists generally who are being delayed, losing considerable time and money.  It is a negative approach to allow the problem to drift.  By-passes should be created around towns which have not adequate roads through them.</P>
    <P>The concept of a fly-over has not been developed yet.  We should tackle this problem very soon.  For instance, the Naas dual carriageway is a death-trap at present not merely due to the speed of vehicles on it but due to the crossing of vehicles, especially heavy lorries.  That haphazard type of crossing is bound to lead to serious accidents and there have been some.  There are accidents frequently at the Clondalkin turn-off.  The sooner we get fly-overs <Col N="1490" /> the better.  Obviously, there will be an enormous saving of life because there are fatal accidents every year due to vehicles crossing the dual carriageway.</P>
    <P>The Traffic Warden Bill was introduced in 1975 and in the Estimate it is stated that a number of towns have implemented various aspects of the Act.  Seven or eight towns are mentioned but the Act is not being utilised as was intended.  It should be a major help in regulating traffic in congested towns.  Many local authorities are shirking their responsibility in not implementing the Act.  It is politically unpopular to suggest the appointment of traffic wardens who will summons local motorists but when a town has a major problem we should not be shy about doing it.  The sooner the Act is fully implemented the better.  We have only touched the surface at present.</P>
    <P>A matter that comes within the ambit of the Minister and affects many major urban areas is that of boundary extension.  I should like to see the Minister introduce legislation for a far easier way of extending boundaries because in many cases urban areas are being strangled because of lack of land and their need to expand.  Two years ago we saw where Drogheda Corporation applied for an order to extend their area into County Meath.  The whole exercise took something like seven years which seems extraordinarily long for what should be a relatively simple task.  Many major urban centres need extra land urgently but because of friction with neighbouring local authorities the extension is not being granted.  If it is to take in the region of seven years to get an order from the Minister for such an extension, endless problems will be caused.  I believe Limerick has a major problem at present.  The corporation want to extend into County Limerick and into County Clare but agreement cannot be reached.  I understand.  It seems ridiculous that development of a major urban area is held up because of disagreement or squabbling between neighbouring local authorities.</P>
    <P>Waterford Corporation have petitioned the Minister for an extension <Col N="1491" /> of their boundary which is extremely badly needed.  It should not take seven years to decide such a matter.  At present Waterford city has overflowed into the neighbouring county of Kilkenny and into Waterford county itself.  It is an unsatisfactory situation if this city is developing areas which are not under its control.  Though members of local authorities in neighbouring counties may not be in full agreement with the extension, progress should not be stopped in this way and people should not be allowed to hinder the extending of boundaries provided they have had a reasonable hearing at the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make a point of speeding up the process of these inquiries.  If he does not there will be wholesale delays in development with an adverse consequential effect on housing and industry.  I appeal to the Minister to bring in legislation which would have this effect.  The Minister for Local Government in the last Dáil promised that there would be a general local government Bill in the spring or early summer of 1977 which would simplify the task of getting boundary extensions, and I ask the Minister to expedite the introduction of such a Bill.  I can understand the fears of local and national politicians who may think that if an area is taken out of their jurisdiction they will suffer in terms of votes and influence.  In many cases such fears are unfounded because of constituency readjustments and they should not be allowed to interfere with boundary extensions which would be for the common good.</P>
    <P>On the matter of housing, we all agree, no matter on which side of the House we sit, that the introduction of the new house grant was a good idea. The abolition of existing grants for people above a certain income level was not a very bright idea on the part of the previous Government and the introduction of this new grant is generally welcomed.  Young people starting off in life should be given every incentive to own their own houses and this grant does just that, although there are anomalies which <Col N="1492" /> should be ironed out.  For instance, if a contract had been signed prior to 26 May, the grant will not be given though the building may not have begun until after that date.  I understand this applies only to groups of houses, but the matter should be opened up.</P>
    <P>The increase in the new house grant from its previous maximum of £2,350 to £3,500 is also welcomed.  The old figure was ridiculously low because hardly any workingman nowadays is earning less than £2,350.  Unfortunately, I do not find the improvement sufficient. The majority of people wishing to build their houses have incomes above that level.  We see it publicised daily that the average income for an industrial worker is £70 a week, almost exactly coinciding with the income limit for new house loans.  I do not think that was the original idea when the loans scheme was introduced.  It was meant to cater for most people except the rich and the very rich.  Now, considerable numbers of working class people have incomes of more than the limit.</P>
    <P>The matter of income in regard to local authority houses raises an interesting question.  I should like the Minister to tell us if there is a national income limit laid down for approved applicants. In my county I have seen local authority officials demanding income certification from employers and if the income is in excess of £3,500, the same limit as for new house loans, applicants are being knocked off the housing lists. Is that national policy or is it being done by individual local authorities? It limits the numbers who can qualify for local authority houses.</P>
    <P>The price of sites is inhibiting private housing greatly.  The £1,000 grant is a help and an encouragement but the grant and the increased loan are more than offset by the cost of the site.  A developed site costs about £4,000 and a working man who does not qualify for a local authority house because he is barely outside the limit is not in a position to pay that kind of money for a site.  It is time that a national policy was devised whereby local authorities would be given capital from the Central Fund to buy large parcels of land suitable for development which <Col N="1493" /> could be sold to prospective house builders or to individuals wishing to build their own houses.  We have the reputation of being the nation in Europe with the greatest number of privately-owned houses, but that position is rapidly declining because of the price of sites.  The sooner the matter is tackled the better.</P>
    <P>Returning to the matter of local authority housing, I am not satisfied that the best is being done for people badly in need of rehousing.  In particular people with small families and single people find it exceedingly difficult to get accommodation from the local authorities.  The natural tendency is to rehouse larger families, but this should not be done to the exclusion of old or single people who have inadequate housing or who are not housed. The present tendency to give them caravans or what are known as demountable dwellings has not proved a success; in fact it is a major failure.  A lot of people have taken up residence in these dwellings for a couple of days or weeks and then left them.  They are not the answer to the problem.  The Department of the Environment should encourage county councils to build schemes in villages and towns for single old people and old couples.</P>
    <P>A scheme known as section 30 of the Housing Act was being operated by the county councils on behalf of the Department of the Environment. According to recent literature which we received from the Department this scheme is being done away with.  I would like clarification from the Minister on that point.  Section 30 involved private houses which had fallen into bad disrepair and the occupants of which were not in a financial position to repair them themselves. Under section 30 the county council could carry out the repair work on behalf of the Department. Many people lived in bad conditions and were not able to fend for themselves. As the dwellings they occupied were not local authority houses nobody would do anything for them. Section 30, therefore, served a need. If it is gone has the Minister any <Col N="1494" /> plans to substitute something comparable for it?</P>
    <P>In the Estimate reference is made to planning and in particular to An Bord Pleanála which was set up to deal with planning appeals.  I welcomed the setting up of this board. Matters like planning permission should not be subject to political pressures and an independent board such as this is the ideal solution.  It is not always easy to go along with the decisions of local authorities.  Sometimes members of local authorities are quite annoyed by decisions handed down by their local planning officers, but generally speaking they are fairly reasonable people to deal with.  Sometimes the annoyance of a local representative is due to the fact that he is being pressurised by a member of the public to seek something which should not be granted.  Planning should not be liberalised too much.  Good planning is essential.  The Planning Act is there to safeguard the public and I go along with anything that rationalises it and that does not allow abuse.</P>
    <P>On 10 March the Minister, addressing a seminar held by the Irish Planning Institute, said that local authorities should show greater interest in overall development of areas under their control rather than concentrating on planning issues.  I agree with that sentiment.  The tendency up to now has been to develop places little by little, depending not necessarily on local needs but on local pressures, and this is not in the interest of good planning. A much broader view should be taken of development.  I hope that the sentiment expressed by the Minister will get through to planning authorities around the country.  I object to the building up of an area which should be left as a green space for playing grounds or parks.  Invariably I find that local authorities have a tendency to build solidly out from the centre of town and to resist any attempt to allow for playing fields or parks for the young or the elderly.  The local authority themselves are not subject to having to apply for planning permission and therefore they get away with this inept and unfair development. <Col N="1495" /> That should be stopped and the Department should set up some system whereby green spaces will have to be compulsorily retained.  The Planning Act provides for a ratio of green space to be retained in proportion to the amount of land which is built up, but in my experience this ratio is not conformed with, and this is serious.</P>
    <P>The next item I want to deal with is pollution.  Up to now the Department of the Environment have dealt with matters coming under the three main headings of roads, housing, and water and sewerage.  Pollution has become a major item in recent years and must now rank with those other three in importance.  The Water Pollution Act is due to come into operation on 1 April next, and I believe it is not going to be implemented as it should.  I have always objected to local authorities being the licensing bodies for the discharge of waste and sewage into waterways. This idea cannot be a success and we will end up with the local authorities being the people who are supposed to prosecute themselves.  It is a most ridiculous situation.  It has been proved in recent years time and time again that the greatest pollutors of our waterways are local authorities. A number of them&mdash;not enough&mdash; have been summoned.  They have got away with it for far too long, and now they are being asked to be the people who will license bodies or groups who discharge into public waterways.  This cannot succeed.  I do not know what system of overseeing the Minister has in mind, but unless he is very vigilant this Bill will be useless.  Local authorities have been given the authority to appoint anti-pollution officers, but what county manager is going to allow his anti-pollution officer to bring a case in court against himself?  As chief executive of the local authority that is exactly what he would be doing. Who likes bad publicity?  The natural tendency would be to avoid it.</P>
    <P>Therefore I see grave defects in this Bill.  Until such time as the Minister <Col N="1496" /> controls and oversees the administration I am afraid that this Bill will not be worth the paper it is written on. We have seen large-scale pollution in recent years of some of our most scenic waterways.  It is said that Loughs Ennel and Owel in Mullingar are badly polluted through discharge of sewage by local authorities.  It has been widely publicised that the Lakes of Killarney have been badly polluted.  In last week's papers we read that all the portion of the River Suir which passes through County Tipperary is being closed to angling again in 1978 because fish life in it is very scarce owing to pollution which was caused primarily by various local authorities whose areas are situated along the banks of that river.</P>
    <P>We have reached an alarming situation with regard to pollution.  The efforts being made to remedy this situation are too weak and, in many cases, too late.  In summer when the oxygen content of the water is low, when the water level has dropped, we notice large-scale fish kills caused by the discharge of sewage into the waterways. The fines that are imposed for breaches of the pollution laws are ridiculous.  They are so small that they are no deterrent either to industrialists or to local authorities.  The proposed fines are not adequate either.</P>
    <P>This is an aspect of our legislation that will have to be tightened up if we are to be successful in the fight against pollution.  The answer to many of the problems is the provision of sewage treatment works but there has been a great reticence in regard to the carrying out of such work.  I appreciate that the provision of a sewage treatment plant near a major town involves heavy capital outlay but we must be prepared to spend the necessary moneys in order to deal with the problem.  Such plants have been provided in every civilised country, particularly on the continent and in Britain in the past 50 years whereas we are only beginning to carry out this essential work.  Unless we step up our efforts in regard to the provision of sewage treatment plants we will be faced with a worsening pollution problem for many years to come. I am aware that there are six or seven such schemes in operation but there is <Col N="1497" /> need, perhaps, for 600 or 700 schemes of that nature.  There is not sufficient provision in the Estimate for this kind of work.  Pollution ranks now with the big four&mdash;roads, housing, water and sewerage.  We must realise that for years past we have been causing pollution that is way beyond the safely limit.</P>
    <P>There are other factors in relation to pollution that are not readily apparent, for instance, the question of air pollution.  Although the Department are monitoring the amount of pollution in the atmosphere, especially around the cities, we cannot be too vigilant in this regard.  It seems likely that there will be smelters in the country in the future.  In that eventuality we shall have to be extremely careful in the control of air pollution.  Norway is a country far removed from the big industrial centres but I was surprised to read recently that the waterways there, especially in the south, are bereft of fish life because of the incidence of sulphuric acid.  It seems extraordinary that the sources of this pollution are the industrial centres of Belgium, Germany and Holland and that the pollution reaches Norway in the form of sulphur dioxide which dissolves in the atmosphere and is transmitted to the lakes and rivers.  We must be careful that a similar situation does not arise here.</P>
    <P>Two other major problems in the sphere of pollution are litter and the ordinary town dump.  The disposal of litter has been a problem for many years.  The Department have organised many campaigns nationally with a view to overcoming this problem and the example has been followed locally by such bodies as chambers of commerce but all to no avail.  We simply seem to be a dirty nation.  It seems to be more natural to us to throw away litter than to put it in a bin or to burn it at home.  The problem in so far as litter is concerned is great and is becoming worse because of the increase in the packaging of goods.  I see no solution to this problem other than the setting of heavy fines for people who behave irresponsibly in regard to the disposal of litter.  The voluntary method has been tried but without success.  We need legislation that will <Col N="1498" /> provide for automatic fines for offenders.</P>
    <P>The other problem is that of the town dump.  There is hardly a town or village where there is not the ugly sight of a dump on its outskirts.  One can usually smell these dumps before seeing them.  Very often in dry weather they are set alight.  The question of who is responsible for setting them on fire is a matter of debate.  Sometimes the impression is given that the fires are started deliberately in order to burn as much of the material as possible but I am told that the fires can be caused also by the reflection of the sun on glass but that seems unlikely. There is nothing more obnoxious in the vicinity of a town than a dump that is not managed properly.  It costs a lot of money to manage a dump properly.  Perhaps to do so would necessitate having a bulldozer on the site and burying the refuse at the end of each day.  However, such an operation would hardly be possible within the confines of the rates estimate.</P>
    <P>Apart from ourselves being repelled by the state of some of these dumps, tourists are revolted by them.  The only answer to this problem, and this is a system that is used in the more developed countries, is the provision of incinerators&mdash;a system which would involve local authorities in a very costly exercise but it is money that the Department would have to make available by way of capital funds.  We must do this not only for our own sake but in order to make the country attractive to visitors.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister begin by introducing pilot schemes in one or two towns.  Not only do we see dumps smouldering for months by the roadside but very often we find them on the banks of rivers so that there is a toxic emission from them into the waters.</P>
    <P>One of the other major items is the question of water and sewerage. It is a slow process providing water for everyone in rural areas and it is slower still to provide sewerage facilities because it is a more costly item. I am glad to see that increased grants <Col N="1499" /> are being provided for water and sewerage.  The Minister told us that there are still 75,000 houses in the country without water.  That represents a very large number of people without such a very basic necessity.  I am sure that twice that amount are without a proper sewerage system.  I have not much sympathy with people grouped together who will not go to the bother of providing water for themselves.  I find that those who do not do it depend on local authorities to provide them with everything at no cost.  Any person living in a group of houses should be able to avail of a group water scheme.</P>
    <P>I feel sorry for the people who are living in isolated houses.  Unfortunately at the end of the last century and in the early part of this century when county councils were building cottages they made very little provision for water and sewerage facilities. We often find now that very poor people, especially the elderly and people with large families, live in those cottages and are not in a financial position to provide water for themselves even with the aid of grants. People living on pensions or social welfare benefits are unable to put up several hundred pounds.  It is sad, as a member of a local authority, not to be able to offer any hope to those people.  I believe some effort will have to be made to provide money to carry out the work on behalf of those people. There must be thousands of such cases throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We are all glad to see that the election promise to abolish rates on domestic dwellings has been implemented by the Government.  The only complaint I have heard is from the officials of local authorities who say that the 11 per cent increase which was allowable in this year's Estimates is not sufficient to meet their needs.  In my county, Waterford, the rates were cut to the bone and when the 11 per cent was granted they still had a shortfall of £200,000.  There will have to be a major cutback in some services.  We had a catastrophe in the county when we had a very severe snowfall and the cost of clearing the roads came to <Col N="1500" /> £80,000.  There was very little provision made for such work.  The result is that many necessary road schemes will have to be abandoned this year.  Can the Department compensate a county council who run into difficulties like that?  In America, when there is a hurricane or serious flooding, a state of emergency can be declared and the Government provide additional funds to alleviate the hardship caused. Waterford County Council have been set back £80,000 because of a freak snowstorm which blocked roads for days.  The county council had to clear those roads at enormous expense.</P>
    <P>I should not leave the housing of itinerants to the end because we all have great regard for people like Victor Bewley and others who have done great work in rehousing people who are referred to commonly as itinerants or travelling people.  As a result of their efforts, together with those of the Department of the Environment, a lot of those people have been rehoused.  Most Reverend Dr. Birch of Kilkenny should also be mentioned in that context.  He was one of the first public figures actively to involve himself in this cause.</P>
    <P>It is startling to read in the Minister's speech that there are still 862 itinerant families without houses.  It appears from a survey carried out that two-thirds of them are anxious to settle in houses.  I know that a certain number of itinerants prefer to stay on the road.  I hope the Minister can impress on local authorities who are trying to shelve this problem that they should fulfil their duty.  There seems to be an enormous number of itinerant people who are anxious to settle in houses when one considers that itinerants usually have large families.  The itinerant problem is like the pollution problem which is with us and which we have evaded for far too long.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the staff of local authorities are being trained in the use of computers.  He said that nine county councils are involved in this training programme at the moment.  I feel that the staff of local authorities are not given a fair chance to train in modern methods, such as computers and other office <Col N="1501" /> methods.  I believe they get a very poor look in in comparison with people in similar positions in business organisations.  The Minister of State in the House at the moment is very conversant with the situation.  I hope he will impress on the Minister to have a look at this matter.  The staff should be given a better chance to attend seminars and courses and become up to date with modern business methods.  People in business organisations are allowed off duty frequently to attend seminars and courses to keep up to date with modern business methods.  The business methods employed by local authorities are a bit antiquated.  It is hard enough for local authorities, with restricted finance, to get modern office machinery but when they buy them the staff are not given the opportunity to learn how to use them.</P>
    <P>The White Paper brought in by Deputy Molloy, as Minister for Local Government in the last Fianna Fáil Government, dealt with the reorganisation of local government.  The big factor in that White Paper was the abolition of certain local authorities. That idea seems to have been abandoned and I agree with that.  The retention of local authorities is an essential part of local democracy.  The public are entitled to elect people to voice their grievances.  Some town commissioners have voluntarily gone out of existence and others do not seem to serve a great purpose.  However, rather than abolishing local authorities, certain towns served at the moment by town commissioners should have their status upgraded to that of urban council.  There are a number of towns in which 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 and 8,000 people live which have only got town commissioners.  That is not good enough.  The powers of town commissioners are extremely limited.  They have no power to deal with letting houses, which is a major matter in a community, and they cannot get repairs to houses and so on carried out. Towns of this size should be given a status so that they can have political muscle or local representation with a bit of muscle.  Instead of downgrading these local authorities they should be upgraded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1502" /> The importance of the rationalisation of membership of local authorities was brought out recently during Question Time.  It is ridiculous that a member of Dublin Corporation should represent something like 11,000 people when a person in a rural community may only represent hundreds.  There is a great discrepancy there.  I know there should always be a bias in favour of the rural member because his constituents are in much more spread-out areas, but the bias that exists at the moment is too ridiculous for words.  In fairness, the ratio of members to the number of voters should be rationalised.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Bill and I hope that some of the matters I referred to will be attended to.  In my part of the country we need a better road system.  The present situation, as I have already said, is not good enough.  We also need to have a new bridge erected before the old one falls down and Waterford becomes isolated.  Waterford has almost become the forgotten city of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his new appointment.  As the Minister said in his brief, the most striking aspect of this Estimate is its size.  The size of the Estimate gives us some idea of the tremendous effect that the Department of the Environment will have on our lives.  This new Department will do a very good job in bringing about a better society.  If a person wished to build a perfect society he would start with a proper environment as the base on which to build.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big factor in the Estimate is the removal of rates from domestic dwellings. It gives great satisfaction to those of us who agitated for this over the years.  The rates system was inequitable and had to be replaced.  Thousands of householders are very happy that the rates have been removed.  I would appeal to landlords here and in urban areas to pass on the rates relief to people living in their flats.  There is some suspicion that this is not being done in many cases.  The reason for the removal of the rates was to give relief to people who most needed it.  I am <Col N="1503" /> sure many flatdwellers need relief. Anything we can do to ensure that landlords pass on the relief should be done.  The enforcement of this may not be a matter for this Minister but an appeal in this House might have some effect.  Rates were removed not alone on dwellings but on community halls and schools.  I always regarded it as most inequitable that secondary schools had to pay rates and other schools had not.  This situation may have come about at a time when secondary schools were very affluent and when people paid heavy fees.  In recent years secondary education has been opened up and people from all types of homes avail of it.  I am glad that the Minister and the Government in their wisdom decided to remove the rates from secondary schools.</P>
    <P>This Estimate will affect the building and construction industry.  That industry gives the impetus to prosperity.  If the building and construction industry is kept in a healthy condition not alone will it provide houses for the people but the whole economy will benefit.  I compliment the Minister on the changes made in the housing loans, the SDA loans, the low mortgage loans and also in the repair grants and loans.  The building industry is getting back into its stride and it will go from strength to strength.  I suppose we shall never see the end of the housing problem but we should be able to reduce it.  It has been said that every living city has a housing problem and that only the dying cities have no problem.  In this context I make a plea on behalf of the city of Dublin.  In past years action was taken by wellmeaning people.  Dublin was considered a fairly affluent city and it was considered that we should not be over-anxious to further develop this. If one travels around this city now, particularly the north side, one cannot help but notice whole areas of desolation. It would take a huge injection of finance to bring these areas back to the degree of normality one might expect in any society.  Not alone do such areas affect the living conditions of people in them but they also cramp the very outlook of young people <Col N="1504" /> there, particularly those who cannot get employment; while they may be housed in a good municipal flat, their surroundings are terribly overcrowded.</P>
    <P>We must look at the whole question of urban housing and change many of the erroneous views held on the subject, and here I include myself. Until very recently we thought that if we built plenty of blocks of flats in an area, laying on all the modern amenities, such as hot and cold water in bathrooms, with fairly large accommodation, we were doing quite well.  But every country is having a rethink now on the construction of flats. Indeed, in some, they are demolishing them.  That is not to say that people who live in flats are any less worthy than those who live in houses but they must battle against the very atmosphere bred by high-density housing. People have tended wrongly to criticise some of the high-rise buildings in this city.  What was wrong was that we did not have the follow-through of social and community services there should have been, with proper roads, shops and other facilities being laid on in such areas before people came to live in them.  Another fault was that we placed large families at the very top of some of these high-rise buildings. I would suggest that we de-tenant some of these flats of families, giving them perhaps to childless couples or even single people, and placing families in houses with front and back gardens.  The Department will have to examine this aspect in an endeavour to correct some of the ills of our society.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our housing problem in various parts of the city is brought home to us particularly at election time when one is canvassing in such areas, that is, that every year many thousands of young people come to live there.  I am speaking now of private flats and of young people living in houses which were never properly converted.  Most of these young people leave behind them living conditions far better than those they must now accept in this city.  Sometimes they must pay exorbitant rents for such flats. I know that is not the job of this Department but many of them have to <Col N="1505" /> live in conditions their parents would not wish for them.  There is an onus on us in the city to help such young people just as we try to help families. I would suggest that the Minister might look at the rating system, at what is now left of it, and encourage industrialists to provide housing, giving them some relief in rates for so doing.  One can cite the example of a famous brewing family in this city who many years ago provided flats and other amenities which helped to change the face of the city at that time.  The flats they provided may be considered somewhat substandard measured by today's yardstick but that was not their fault because they conformed to the standards of their time.  We should encourage firms like that to provide more housing, even flats, in which childless couples, single people or indeed senior citizens might be placed.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on us and the Government generally to effect a revolution in the housing situation because it must be remembered that, in a few years' time, the greater Dublin area will have a population of one million. It is still a small city compared with some across the water or on the Continent but, nonetheless, a large city for the size of our country.  We must constantly emphasise that Dublin be given this consideration because land for housing in the city, whether purchased by a local authority or anybody else, is extremely costly.  We might even scrutinise the financing of this.  I am no expert on agriculture or on land bonds but perhaps land bonds could be used for the purchase of agricultural land. Why should land bonds not be used in the city?  One sees Dublin Corporation paying out vast sums of money for land.  The very fact that the corporation purchases land in an area increases the value of the land of the developer next to it.  The corporation will lay on drainage and so on in the land they are developing, rendering the land beside it more valuable.  Therefore the owners of such land know that if they start building they can avail of the drainage and other services already carried out by the corporation or county council as the case may be.</P>
    <P>We must investigate the whole question <Col N="1506" /> of financing housing not alone in Dublin city but in the larger urban area.  At present we deplore certain parts of Dublin and we here, in turn, are criticised for having allowed this to happen.  We must remember that the centre of many large cities across the water and indeed in the United States has been similarly blighted and they are now engaged in the same task of rejuvenating these areas.  The area I represent is perhaps termed as one of the affluent sectors of the city where we have not experienced the problems of other parts.  Certainly we have the flatland problem which is not improving. Time is running out on us and we must tackle these problems whether in centre city areas or others.  We must remember that we may well be sitting on a social bomb in some of the deprived areas of this city.  We must remember the people who live in these areas, the great people they are and the struggle they have to live in them under appalling conditions.  Many of these people are being beaten down by the conditions of unemployment and other economic factors.</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of the north side of the city where the docks have moved east down the river and where there is less demand for labour.  Years ago in such areas thousands of dockers were needed.  Now, with modern techniques, not so many are required, leaving these men to wither in these areas.  While there are many Government Departments involved in this question it will devolve on the Department of the Environment to set a pattern for the reconstruction of vast areas of this city.  We have no choice but to come up with a new deal for the deprived areas of this city and to give them a great financial injection.  We owe it to the people living there who have struggled on against great odds. We owe it to our young people to show them that we cherish all our children equally, that not alone do we cherish the children of the well-to-do but that we cherish also those children living in deprived areas in the inner city or wherever else they may be.</P>
    <P>There are four areas to my knowledge in which the existing housing must come down as quickly as possible.  In <Col N="1507" /> three of those areas the corporation have already started work but work must be speeded up, and when the areas are cleared we must take every step to ensure that the people are properly rehoused.  I am all in favour of rebuilding the inner city.  The Minister and our party are committed to this.  Work must start quickly.  This is something that cannot be put on the long finger.  A start has been made but a greater impetus is needed to increase momentum.  Not alone must the last of the really bad houses be removed but it is possible we may have to demolish houses which are not so old but which no longer serve the needs of our society.  We may have to follow the example of the British and the Americans in demolishing houses built in the last 30 years or so.</P>
    <P>A proper study and assessment must be made of the urban problem and the steps that must be taken to solve it.  I know both sides of this House subscribe to such a policy.  All of us are conscious of the social ills in urban areas.  To some extent we must blame ourselves for having contributed to the decay.  We must study what the evolution has been in other cities.  In Britain they have learned the hard way in the aftermath of the Industrial Revolution.  We can learn from what happened in Britain.  We have learned something but more study would pay a bigger dividend. Architects, engineers and social workers should meet and discuss the problems that exist and put forward suggestions for redevelopment.  In that way we could give a new deal to those living in those areas.  It is in these areas that unemployment is so high, as high as 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>A suburban sprawl is not the solution. Economists condemn this kind of development.  Good arable land should not be used for houses.  Economists say that the farther out building goes the higher becomes the cost of living because the city is deprived of those areas which hitherto produced dairy products and vegetables to feed the city.  The rebirth of the city cannot be planned in isolation by the Minister for the Environment.  All interested <Col N="1508" /> parties should come together and spell out what needs to be done to cure the ills from which the city is suffering.  Problems do not exist in Dublin only.  Problems also exist in other cities and towns.  The population is growing and we must plan to prevent bigger suburban sprawls.  This will require imaginative thinking.</P>
    <P>Roads have been improved tremendously but the increased traffic is to some extent negativing the improvements. Heavy demands are being made on the roads.  Some people say we should have autobahns.  Others disagree. Probably the solution lies somewhere in between.  I would suggest the development of flyovers and underpasses at busy junctions.  They would cut out a great deal of congestion. It should not be beyond the wisdom of our engineers to design flyovers and underpasses.  I myself would prefer underpasses.  The toll on the roads is truly horrific.  If an epedemic broke out doctors, nurses, the Government and everybody else would join in trying to find a cure.  We seem to have become used to death on our roads and to people being maimed on our roads.  Some say accidents are not caused, they happen.  That is a cliché. We will have to find the solution to cut down the death toll.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to achieve the promised reduction in the number of jobless, especially among young people, or to produce any plan in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the only matter before the House tonight were the latter part of the Government amendment I would be seeking the leave of the House to move that amendment for them because I have confidence in the ability of the Government to produce a plan for reducing the number of jobless.  I am sure they have that ability and I am sure they will produce a plan, but that plan I expect to see&mdash;and the House can, perhaps, make what is nowadays <Col N="1509" /> called a benchmark in regard to my guess&mdash;around the month of May 1981.  That is more or less when I expect to see their plan, shortly before the next general election, and I have no doubt whatsoever as to their ability and their firm intention to produce such a plan around that date.</P>
    <P>If that was all there was at issue between the parties this evening, I would be over there shoulder to shoulder with the Minister for Labour. I am certain that that plan will emerge and that it will be introduced to the public with as much professional advertising expertise as we saw deployed last May and June but we will be waiting another four years for it. That is why I take leave to reject the sense of their amendment and proceed with proposing this motion.</P>
    <P>No one in this House&mdash;so far as the House can be said to be in session with this very small attendance on what was supposed to be a crucial issue for the nation and its future&mdash;will be amazed or in a mood of contradiction if I remind the House that the main plank of the Government's election platform was the reduction of unemployment. At the time we entered the Common Market in 1973, and when the terms of our entry were presented to the people&mdash;essentially not materially but procedurally in referendum form in 1972&mdash;we had the highest unemployment rate of the nine countries involved by a mile.  In other words, if I can attempt to shoot down these myths as they arise, the idea that relatively high unemployment is something which has only recently emerged is false.  We had very high unemployment by comparison with most of the EEC countries before we joined.  Within a year of our entry we were hit by the oil crisis and by an international recession which followed on that crisis and these figures rose and now are not far short of 10 per cent.  These figures are naturally of concern to everybody.</P>
    <P>The Minister's party were nationally and tactically right in concentrating on these figures in planning their election strategy.  Where they were wrong and deceitful and where the people will <Col N="1510" /> have no reason to thank them, and where I hope for political reasons&mdash; though I intend nothing personal in saying so&mdash;the vengeance of the people will catch up on them, was in promising that somewhere in their bosoms there resided the formula for curing this disease which had shown very strong symptoms before the country joined the EEC.</P>
    <P>That was the main plank to which the Government pinned their hopes. The people elected them.  I have never whinged about it.  I did not whinge about it when I was put out of office, although I had only enjoyed my office for a matter of six weeks.  I put that behind me, I can tell the House in honesty, within a quarter of an hour, if not less.  If you are in politics you must be as willing to be out as to be in, otherwise it is not the right game for you.  When I observe that these were the objectives to which the Minister's party committed themselves I feel entitled, without being asked to submit to jibes about sour grapes, to, as they say in the public sector, monitor the progress of the Government towards achieving these objectives&mdash; God knows what we were all doing in the days before somebody dug up the word &ldquo;monitor&rdquo;.  When I was a child &ldquo;monitor&rdquo; was an old fashioned battleship&mdash;and we are entitled to relate the progress, or lack of it, to the specific weapons which the Government advertised in 1977 as being the means by which they proposed to deal with unemployment.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House: I was here at Question Time today and so was the Ceann Comhairle, but that is water under the bridge, and so were many other Deputies.  The Taoiseach sat here for the entire hour, a most unusual performance for him.  He is the most important man in the country and his time is valuable.  When I was Parliamentary Secretary to his predecessor I spent a lot of my time trying to save my boss's time.  The Taoiseach thought fit to sit here for a full hour today, even after his own questions had concluded, to monitor the progress of his Government and their underlings&mdash;the junior Ministers &mdash;in dealing with a few harmless <Col N="1511" /> questions put down by my colleagues and myself.  One of these questions to which I found it impossible to get an answer was how many people are out of work at the moment.  I asked that question both in relation to the current live register figures and the figures of last May and June which were not accepted by Fianna Fáil.  The figures last May were 109,000 falling in June to 108,000-odd.  Those figures were bunkum.  They did not exist.  What 108,000 or 109,000 was a question that people were being asked.  They were told it was 160,000.  Now the story is different because we were beaten and they won.  Now the question is, what 160,000?</P>
    <P>As spokesman for Industry, Commerce and Energy I am finding it impossible to get anyone on the far side to say in plain English or Irish, if they are able for it, that there were 160,000 unemployed here at a time when the live register said 108,000 and to draw the childish inference from that that if there is that differential of 52,000 we are now entitled to add the same differential to the current live register figures and produce a total of 164,000.  I put this question as well as I could, through the barrage which was being put up against me from various parts of the House, to the Minister who was answering the questions and the Taoiseach condescended to interject that I was not comparing like with like.  Even the Taoiseach did not think it beneath him to intervene on this point and to remind the House that this was only the spring and that June, the time I was first speaking about, had been high summer.  He did not scorn to stay here, when he might have been doing something more important or resting himself, which is also important for a Taoiseach, in order to judge the issue I was trying to raise in a clear form. That was not beneath him.</P>

I want to know from him or the Minister how many people are out of work this minute and how many were out of work last June.  I want both answers related to the 160,000 that Messers.

      <P>I withdraw that reference. I am sorry I mentioned their name.  I cannot get that reply out of the Government.  Believe me I do not worry about them.  I do not lose any sleep on account of their crookedness, on account of their unwillingness to give a straight answer, or on account of their constitutional inability to give a straight answer to a straight question because I know there are people watching what goes on here between the Government and Opposition and who are able to draw their own conclusions. Although I may, and do, get excited and perhaps over-react in certain situations where a more experienced Deputy would let the thing flow over him, I am not really worried about that degree of crookedness.  I know others can judge for themselves and that their memories are not so short.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot get a straight answer in regard to unemployment or employment figures but I can construct one for myself.  Where we find there are 4,000 more people on the live register now&mdash;In other words 4,000 more people drawing unemployment benefit or assistance than there were when the election took place which put us out of office&mdash;I am entitled to conclude that the gross figure of 160,000 has risen by 4,000 and that the figure is now 164,000.  I cannot get anyone on the Government side to admit that.  I do not find it too worrying because others are able to draw their own conclusions <Col N="1513" /> and have been visibly drawing them.</P>
    <P>At least the government party were not at such a stage of desperation that they assumed the people would not want any kind of indication at all about how they proposed to deal with the unemployment problem.  They included in their manifesto all the structures&mdash;to use another public service word which has become popular &mdash;which they would adopt and invent in order to overcome this problem. One of these was an intensified Buy and Sell Irish campaign.  I know I have been abrasive up to this and I intend to be at least as abrasive for the rest of the time, but I will call a two-minute truce in order to say with sincerity that this party absoutely accept and support, as they always did, the principle of the Buy and Sell Irish campaign.  The guaranteed Irish symbol, which is the heart and soul of the present campaign, emerged under the aegis of the former Minister for Industry and Commerce when the present Minister was in opposition.  I make no special point about that because we are all on the same side in that regard and I wish this campaign the best of luck.</P>
    <P>I observe every other day scripts from both senior and junior Ministers in which there are references to this campaign and to switching 3 per cent of purchasing power from imports to home produced material, creating in this way 10,000 jobs.  I am afraid we are on the verge of seeing a legend created according to which, without anything happening in regard to the switching of purchasing power, 10,000 jobs have been created by this campaign.</P>

      <P>If this had been advanced anywhere except in an election manifesto I would not be speaking about it now, but it was part of an election manifesto which was held up to the people as being the source of 10,000 jobs.  I feel entitled to draw attention to this figure and to say that we will be watching for it.  We will be watching to see how much of the extra spending power released by the remission of car tax and so on has been devoted to Irish goods.  We will be watching not in order to damn the Buy Irish campaign but in order to damn the dishonesty of the party which persuaded the people that by means like this they would produce jobs out of a hat.</P>
      <P>The Employment Action Team was another weapon which they intended to use.  I found today to my pleasure that I was able, even in a disorderly interjection, to use that Employment Action Team as a measure of ridicule. Although this Government have been in office for almost nine months&mdash;I am tempted to say almost for a full period of gestation&mdash;that Employment Action Team have yet to produce one single extra job, not a projected job or a job for which provision is made but a person actually at work and drawing wages.  As far as I am aware not one such job has been created.  I made that point a couple of weeks ago and within a few days the Minister was in with some programme, to which I wish the best of luck, although I would sooner have a productive programme rather than a bogus job programme.</P>
      <P>I want to draw attention to the linguistic dress of this team, the impression of &ldquo;zap&rdquo;, that the Fianna Fáil Party are in there and will get things moving while the other crowd were able to do nothing but sit on their bottoms.  That was the impression they set out to create, down to the teeshirts and the hats and the music on the buses.  I deliberately use the word &ldquo;zap&rdquo; which I see in my children's comics, the sound made by a space gun.</P>

      <P>I now go on to the second weapon, and I do not mean any disrespect to the late Taoiseach involved. You served under him, Sir, and knew his qualities.  I never had the privilege of his acquaintance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1516" /> They have described this weapon as a Seán Lemass-type industrial development consortium.  That was the second leg of the machine which was to get employment going.  I have a question down on this matter which, because of the way questions now run, will not be reached for some weeks.  I want to assert, and the Minister may contradict me if he wishes, that the Seán Lemass-type industrial development consortium has sunk without trace.  It may be that the Minister responsible has actually got a piece of paper which says that a meeting was held and, no doubt, a lunch dispensed and drinks handed out and that there is a nominal or national committee bearing the name of the industrial development consortium.  It is a fraud from start to finish.  It is not a consortium in any understanding of the English language so far heard of, any more than the ground rents abolition is an abolition.  A consortium is a business concern, a combination of business interests which risk money, give employment, produce, sell, do business.  This consortium is not that.  If the measure contained in the ground rents Bill is an abolition of ground rents, then certainly this is a consortium; it is a Woolworths; it does a lot of business. If the ground rents Bill is a sham and a fraud, so too is this consortium. What has been seen of this industrial development consortium of the Seán Lemass type?  Absolutely nothing.  The people were sold it over the memory of a respected man, over the memory of a respected Taoiseach.  Everybody in this party respected him even if they disagreed with him.  The memory of that Taoiseach was dragged from its rest in order to get votes for that party, in order to attach his name to a tuppenny ha'penny institution that, if it has come into being, is only a ghost and a spook.  Where are the jobs this industrial development consortium was supposed to produce?  Where is the co-ordination it was supposed to organise?  Nowhere.  It is a zero in the record of this Government and I am not going to forget about it as long as I have strength left.  The Minister will hear a great deal more about that consortium and the action team.</P>
    <P>I do not begrudge the Deputy for mid-Cork, <Col N="1517" /> Deputy Fitzgerald, now Minister for Labour, his job.  I am glad to see jobs changing around and men getting a chance.  Personally I wish him the best but I begrudge the deceit and the trendy boot ráiméis and seafóid that put his party in Government.  It is not because they put me out; I could not tell the Minister or the Chair how little that means to me.  However, I begrudge the wastage of trust and confidence in the ordinary people which that victory represents, a wastage that is being confirmed and made more plain every day that passes.</P>
    <P>Money was put into recruitment of extra people into the public service, and put in in large amounts.  If the Minister expects that I am going to dispute that with him he is going to be disappointed.  I do not dispute that with him.  There is no problem about creating public service jobs. Any Government that can beg, borrow or steal a few million pounds can create public service jobs, but this is the first time in the history of this nation that a Government sought credit for creating public service jobs. Previously it was something for which one had to apologise.  The Chair held office in this State long before many of us were heard of and knows it was something to apologise for if jobs were being spread around too fast or if too many people were taken on to the public payroll.  Suddenly all that is changed.  Zap, and we are all on the public payroll, we get so many millions of pounds from the Japs and the Germans and we can take thousands of people into the public service. I believe the Government are doing it. I do not dispute it for one instant. What I dispute is whether they are right to do it and whether it is the right way to solve our endemic unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>In this connection I want to quote the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy R. Burke who left this Chamber five minutes ago.  He spoke on 10 March in Waterford and said:</P>
    <P>As you are all aware, the Government is committed to creating new jobs at a greatly increased pace.  This is our first priority.  However, <Col N="1518" /> creating jobs is not enough to stimulate and to maintain economic growth.  These jobs must be productive.</P>
    <P>How often have I and other people on this side of the House said that? That is what was said by Deputy Burke, Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.</P>
    <P>How productive are public service jobs, paid for by the thousand, ordered off the hook from the hanger, jobs that are paid for by the sweat of the Dutch, the Germans and the Japs?  Where will they get us and how will we pay for them?  These are the questions which should be answered. I accept that the Minister is creating public service jobs but I want to know who will pay for them and what wealth they will produce.  Will the Minister's children and mine and their children benefit as a result of the sweat of people in those jobs?</P>
    <P>Another point that was heavily laboured during the budget debate and thereafter was investment in building. In volume 303, column 362 of the Official Report of 1 February there is the budget statement of the Minister for Finance in regard to job creation and building.  That speech envisaged that by the end of 1977 no fewer than 3,170 jobs would have been created directly and indirectly in the building and construction industry.  We know that Christmas is not a great time for the building industry, that unemployment tends to increase in bad weather. Therefore, I will not be thought to be exaggerating if I say that there is not a great difference between employment figures in mid-November and Christmas.</P>
    <P>I got figures from my friend, the Minister of State in the Department of the Taoiseach, in regard to the construction industry in November, the last date for which figures are available. They show that in November 1977 some 23,631 people were unemployed in the building industry.  In November 1976, back in the dark ages of the Coalition, that Black Knight of ignorance and selfishness of the National Coalition as it has been represented, <Col N="1519" /> how many were unemployed in the building industry?  The figure is 24,272.  What is the difference?  It is 641 jobs.  In 1976, as even the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is willing to admit, we were just coming out of recession.  The signs were visible from the beginning of the year that we were emerging from that recession.  Nobody will expect me to apologise too heavily for a figure like that, that even then had improved considerably from the peak in February and March 1976.  In November 1977 after four months of inestimable benefits conferred by the Minister and his colleagues, the improvement in the building industry, something they have in their hip pocket politically and every other way, was 641 jobs.  Where are the 3,000 jobs the Minister for Finance spoke about?  I cannot find them.  The Deputies opposite have the same right as I have to put down a Private Member's motion.  If they are unhappy with what I am saying and if they do not get an opportunity to put the record straight at Question Time or some other time, let them put down a motion to damn us and blacken us for producing bogus statistics and false figures.</P>
    <P>I cannot find the 3,000 jobs mentioned by the Minister.  I can find improvement but even if the worst possible Government were in office that would probably have taken place with our emergence from recession.  There was an improvement to the extent of about 640 jobs but I cannot find 3,170 jobs.  I accept it is the case that there are more at work now than there were last November but even the building programme is subject to the hazards of the budgetary policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>I want to quote a report in today's <i>Irish Times.</i>  It is a report from Dublin stockbrokers, Goodbody and Wilkinson. I do not know if there is a Mr. Goodbody or a Mr. Wilkinson.  If there is, I want to make clear that I never saw either of them at a Fine Gael meeting and I am not aware that either of them has any connection with my party or with the Opposition generally.  It may be, as is so often <Col N="1520" /> the case with firms like that, that the people who own the firm have got quite different names.  All I want to say to the House is that I know absolutely nothing about Goodbody and Wilkinson.  I am as innocent of their affiliations, whatever they are, if any, as a new born babe.  This is what they say about the effect of the budget on the construction industry which I know will be a central part of the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>Looking towards the end of this year and into 1979 the review feels that the government's &ldquo;rush for growth&rdquo; may eventually lead to balance of payments difficulties and &ldquo;we may have in 1979 to apply the classic deflationary remedies.&rdquo;  They see the possibility of taxes being increased in the next budget, accompanied by a possible trimming of next year's public capital programme.</P>
    <P>This possible cutback in the public capital programme will, they say, have particularly detrimental effects in the construction industry, which, in the words of one construction industry economist consulted by Goodbody's &ldquo;would kibosh the industry&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Before we start getting too grand about a drop in the weekly or monthly figures, let us bear in mind the impact on those figures of the entire three, four or five year budgetary strategy outlined by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development only a few days ago.</P>
    <P>I have only a few minutes left.  I had intended to point&mdash;and I will in a couple of sentences&mdash;to areas in which the Government have made a bad job of the employment problem, which would be a problem for any Government. I want to make it clear that I do not blame the Minister opposite, or any single one of his colleagues, or the whole lot of them put together, for unemployment although they were quick enough to blame us for it in the past.  It is not their fault.  We inherited a social economic structure here which Fianna Fáil did not create.  I know if it were a good one, or one which people regarded as admirable, <Col N="1521" /> they would claim credit for it, but they did not create it.  It was there before they or we arrived, and it may be there after us.  I do not say that by any particular act they aggravated the problem.  I know they have created public service jobs, although I assess that at zero from the point of view of long term national prosperity and wellbeing.</P>
    <P>What I do say is that they have let jobs slip in vital areas and that by other behaviour they have made things more difficult for themselves and for us ultimately.  In this connection I want to rely on a press release of the Confederation of Irish Industries issued on 9 March.  The Director General, again, funnily enough, is not a member of my party, so far as I know.  Maybe he is affiliated to Deputy O'Donnell's branch or to Deputy Mitchell's branch, but I have no knowledge that he has any connection with the Fine Gael Party or with the Opposition.  So far as I know he is absolutely independent.</P>

      <P>All I am trying to say is that I know this gentleman personally but I know nothing of his political views and have never discussed them with him.  He seems to me to be dedicated to one cause and one cause only, namely, the cause of the confederation which employs him, namely, that of Irish industry.  He lists five what he calls clouds on the industrial horizon. Of these five, three are in no way to be laid at the door of the Government and could not possibly be no matter what Government are in office.  One is the slow rate of growth in international trade.  One is the strengthening of sterling.  One is the very savage increase in competition from mobile international industries.  These matters are ones on which no Government here have any influence whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> There are two matters they mentioned in which that is not the case. One is labour cost increases and the other is trade distortions.  I say positively in the few minutes left to me that, although the Government have not produced the labour cost increases, they have done nothing to keep them within bounds except talk about them. We cannot open the papers without seeing pleas for wage restraint.  What kind of example do the unions get in the national wage agreement negotiations in regard to wage restraint?  All they see&mdash;and I admit this is an over-simplified view perhaps&mdash;is that the Government are abolishing the wealth tax.  All they hear is that the Leader of my party is damned by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development &ldquo;Prof.&rdquo; O'Donoghue for saying that to abolish the wealth tax will not be helpful in the context of achieving a reasonable national wage settlement.</P>
    <P>Why should he not say it?  Would he be doing his job if he did not?  If he believes it, ought he to keep it to himself?  I believe it, and it was the first thought which came into my mind when I heard the budget statement read out.  Are we to sit still and let Fianna Fáil do their worst?  Merely to call attention to this incredible piece of foolishness, the abolition of the wealth tax, is not the same as egging on the unions not to settle for a reasonable figure.  The Leader of my party criticised the abolition of the wealth tax, rightly in my view, and urged the acceptance by the unions of a reasonable figure.</P>
    <P>Essentially what he is doing, and what I expect he will be doing many times over the next four years, is trying to do the Government's job for them. He is saying to the unions: &ldquo;I know this is gross provocation but bear with it, live with it for the sake of the national interest.&rdquo;  For that he is criticised and lectured by &ldquo;Prof.&rdquo; O'Donoghue who gave a demonstration here last week of what he understands by academic impartiality and objectivity.  We know now what he thinks about it, and what he thinks about academic standards in regard to the release and dissemination of information. He lectured the Leader of my <Col N="1523" /> party on his utterances on the wealth tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying the increase in the labour costs we will have this year are directly contributed to by the Government's action in promising to abolish the wealth tax.  I have said enough about that.  Another one is the effect of trade distortions and the trade distortion they are talking about is the British temporary employment subsidy. I believe&mdash;and I hope a question of mine will be able to elicit it when the Dáil reassembles&mdash;that the Government have done nothing like enough to cancel out the effects of that subsidy which have been disastrous for Irish industry and have cost, on the CII's computation, between 3,000 and 4,000 Irish jobs.</P>
      <P>I know the way the Government will get off the hook.  They will get off it by allowing the people to go elsewhere for work.  I have in my hand the last issue of <i>The Irish Post</i> which is the journal of the Irish community in Britain.  That journal has seen fit to put on its front page the fact that emigration has now resumed and is really back.  It is safe to assume that this marks the re-emergence of old style emigration.  That article is based on figures issued from the Central Statistics Office.  They are available to everybody.  I must admit that a colleague of the Minister who is here in the House admitted that the figure issued by the CSO tended in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that <i>The Irish Post</i>, which circulates among the Irish community <Col N="1524" /> in Britain, sees fit to make this a lead story shows there is something in it. These people are in touch with their own community.  The know when there are more people at Mass on a Sunday. They know when the Irish community has new arrivals.  They know when families have brothers and sisters and cousins coming over.  This is a fact and I will not allow, nor will Deputy O'Donnell or Deputy Mitchell, the Government to solve our employment problem by this route.  It is estimated &mdash;we cannot know for certain&mdash;that approximately 40,000 more people went out of the country in 1977 and tens of thousands of them in the last half of it compared with previous years.</P>
    <P>While I do not blame the Government for the existence of unemployment, and I have said that often enough, I object very much to their leading the people to suppose they have a remedy, or that the pitiful weapons I described earlier, represent a remedy.  They are letting real jobs slip away, real productive jobs, by not combatting the British temporary employment subsidy and by not doing more in their general overall budgetary strategy to induce a reasonable wage agreement so as to reduce unit costs and above all&mdash;and this is the note I want to end on&mdash;by neglecting in their strategy the thing which has the most potential for employment here, namely, the land, and in more recent years the sea.  These things are being neglected.  In those things we have resources which no other EEC country has and by neglecting those resources we are letting jobs by the tens of thousands get away from us. It is because of that failure, and not because of any tupenny ha'penny failure to take more people into this Department or that Department&mdash;I am certain the Government, if they had the money, could employ more public servants&mdash;it is because of the failure to realise where we are really losing jobs and where jobs can be made in enormous numbers that I indict the Government and urge the House to accept this motion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>

    <P>&ldquo;has confidence in the ability of the Government to achieve the promised reduction in the number of jobless, especially among young people, and to produce a plan in this regard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I could probably have forgiven Deputy Kelly were he a new Deputy but a Member who was associated with the last Government could not feel but ashamed and embarrassed at such a speech, a contribution as lacking in constructiveness as it was in any worth-while relevance to the motion on the Order Paper.  How a member of the last Government could not feel ashamed and embarrassed to speak on such a topic as Deputy Kelly did considering the neglect of employment and job creation perpetrated by his Government is beyond me.  I would prefer to be more constructive in this regard and point out to the House what has been achieved in the eight months of Fianna Fáil Government.  I should like to refer to the manifesto commitment of last July, a commitment to provide 20,000 new jobs in our first year in office.  I shall prove later that not alone will the target be achieved but it will be exceeded.</P>
    <P>At no stage did we ever say that that would solve entirely our unemployment problem.  We did say that we would strive in that direction with job creation in the ensuring years.  We have been handed a situation where the unemployment figures were allowed run uncontrolled and youth employment was the furthest thought from the minds of the previous Government. This Government's radical approach to job creation took place immediately we took office.  The new initiatives embrace the public sector, building construction and youth employment.  I should like to refer to what was said in a speech in July last year about the public sector and about attaching no importance to job creation in that sector.  Many aspects of the public sector were allowed run down under the previous Government.  There was need for all the jobs we have created <Col N="1526" /> in the public sector and I shall list them later.  For example, in the National Manpower Service of my Department, a Department engaged in placing people in employment, the numbers were inadequate.</P>
    <P>Between 5 July and 31 December in the public sector almost 4,700 posts were created and of these more than 2,000 were in the civil service.  A further 139 were industrial civil servants; 900 were teachers; 890 in the health services; 500 gardaí; 36 in the Defence Forces and 182 in other areas of the public service.  All those posts were needed to give our people the services to which they are entitled.  At the end of December 2,010 of those jobs had been filled.  Following on that we had the budget proposals where again 18,000 new jobs were provided directly as a result of moneys allocated in that budget.  That figure was in addition to the 2,000 already created and the 3,100 provided for in the building construction industry. That is only part of the story but those jobs were needed to maintain our services at a strength our people deserve.</P>
    <P>The Employment Action Team was referred to in a very derogatory way by a Member from whom I expected greater appreciation of the problem but he was a member of a Government who ignored the problem of youth employment.  When in Opposition we told the Government that because of the seriousness of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, the problem would have to be tackled in a twofold way with the major emphasis on industrial growth and production. The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy will speak tomorrow night on this motion and concentrate on the importance of industrial growth and job creation.  We must all admit that this is the prime area and that this must be the area of concentration. Other areas cannot be neglected, even those of temporary job creation to give our young people some work experience and satisfaction from life or some involvement in work in the community. If we do not do so frustration will inevitably result and that will be damaging not alone economically but socially also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> The Employment Action Team was drawn from all sides of industry, from youth organisations and Government Departments.  The team submitted concrete and substantial proposals to provide jobs for young people.  I was amazed and disappointed to hear a Member who had experience in Government decrying the efforts of that team.  The first set of proposals of the team relate to the environmental works programme.  The money has already been allocated by the Department of Labour to the Department of the Environment and from that Department to all local authorities.  That programme is designed to provide 1,000 man-year-jobs, 750 in relation to young people and the remainder in relation to adults in a supervisory and other capacity.  Under that scheme amenities will be provided throughout the country.  The young people will be helping to beautify our countryside as well as providing facilities in their own areas.</P>
    <P>The work experience programme is another matter I should like to refer to.  Such a programme has been in operation in other member states of the EEC for some time but the previous Government, because of the lack of commitment to employment, ignored it.  That programme can help to give people experience which would make it easier for them to gain fulltime employment.  The Department of Education and my Department are engaged in preparing that programme and it is hoped that it will be put into operation at an early date.  In addition, staff are being recruited to put that scheme into operation.  The apprenticeship scheme operated by local authorities is another matter I should like to refer to.  I was appalled at the lack of commitment by the last Government to this matter.  They allowed apprenticeship recruitment to be run down in our public service.  The team recommended that local authorities be interviewed and investigated with a view to taking on a number of building and construction apprentices and money was allocated for the recruitment of 150 to 160 apprentices in local authorities throughout the country.  In addition, AnCO are <Col N="1528" /> making arrangements to recruit an additional 200 apprentices over and above their normal intake into the State bodies, two areas that were open for apprenticeship recruitment and in skills that are and will be needed.</P>
    <P>The Ballyfermot survey I am glad to say is making progress.  It is a pilot scheme and will be under way in early April.  It will provide only a small number of jobs and for a limited period but it will provide young people with very useful experience and, even more important, it will provide official information on the problems in the area with a view to solving them, especially in the employment field.  I cannot over-emphasise the advantage of having this information as well as the value of the training and experience for the people concerned. Another very important aspect is that we have a very useful group in the Ballyfermot Employment Action Group, benefiting by Government assistance up to approximately £10,000 which is very desirable and significant.  Deputy Mitchell should be pleased with this news particularly in view of the inaction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is something that could have been done long ago.  It can also be the forerunner of surveys in other areas, rural or urban, as the need arises.  I referred earlier to the community fitness programme. The scheme has been submitted to the Minister for Health for consideration under the larger scheme that he has in mind for community fitness generally. As the House is aware, in Opposition we pointed out on many occasions the necessity to broaden the employment incentive scheme which was confined to manufacturing and <Col N="1529" /> agricultural industry.  We sought without success to have it extended.  As Minister, I had the pleasure on behalf of this Government of extending that scheme in late September last year to cover the building sector, the services sector and the hotel and catering industry. I think that the figures for the extension of the scheme together with the return of confidence in the economy generally will indicate the change that has taken place regarding this scheme.  In the two months from January to end of February 1978, employees covered under applications for the scheme numbered just over 2,400. The interesting point is that in the 12 months of the scheme's existence up to the end of this February the total was only 6,400.  In the two months to the end of February we had applications in respect of 2,400 against the total from 1 March 1977 to the end of February 1978 of 6,400.  That is progress and indications are that it will continue.  The payments for those two months amounted to £504,342 against £1,300,492 for the entire 12 months, showing a very substantial increase. This is an indication of the success and correctness of the decision to extend the scheme and also of a return of confidence.  The amount of money saved on the scheme last year was disappointing for many reasons. It showed in a very positive way the previous Government's lack of commitment.</P>
      <P>I referred briefly to the National Manpower Service.  I was pleased to visit the offices of the Dublin centre at O'Connell Bridge House about six weeks ago and to hear the reports and observe the enthusiasm of the staff. They also believe that the extension of the scheme particularly for the Dublin area, will have many advantages.  The service is understaffed and recruitment of placement officers is at present going on, another indication of how important are some of these jobs in the public sector and of how important it is that this service should be at top strength so as to get as many as possible back to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funds being made available for training within AnCO this year amount to almost £12 million as compared <Col N="1530" /> with £9.5 million in 1977, an increase of over 25 per cent.  This increased grant will mean an increased grant from the European Social Fund also.  As a result, the number of training opportunities with AnCO will be substantially increased and it is expected that over 15,000 people will be trained in 1978 compared with 12,800 in 1977.  Earlier, I spoke of the importance of work experience as regards young people getting employment. There is no doubt that those who go through AnCO, whether young or adult trainees, find it far easier because of the skills they are taught and the training given, to obtain employment than those without such advantages.</P>
    <P>To refer to a further Government commitment in regard to employment, as no doubt the House is aware, under a three-year scheme introduced last year manufacturing companies could qualify for a special 25 per cent rate of corporation tax if they expanded activity to the extent of increasing employment by 3 per cent and sales volume by 5 per cent over the 1976 level.  To qualify for this special rate of corporation tax in 1978 and 1979 manufacturers will now only have to increase their employment level by 3 per cent in each year.  In other words, the emphasis is on increasing employment, more jobs and getting people back to work.</P>
    <P>I could not believe my ears when I heard Deputy Kelly talking about wage subsidies when he spoke about the damage done to Irish industry by the British temporary employment subsidy.  Did he have his head buried in the sand for four years when he, as a member of the then Government, ignored pleas from our side of the House and of many industries suffering because of the effect of that temporary employment subsidy?  Yet, this evening he said that this Government's commitment in that direction was inadequate.  The sectors of industry about which we were concerned are very pleased with the budget proposals intended to benefit industry for the purpose of protecting jobs in the clothing, footwear and some areas of the <Col N="1531" /> textile industries.  The people concerned are very pleased with that, but I find it hard to understand Deputy Kelly's inconsistency in saying it is inadequate, because his Government had ignored it entirely.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another encouraging point.  The February issue of <i>Economic Trends</i> for January, published by CII/ESRI, gives data from their recent survey.  I do not go into raptures about the independence of this survey like the Deputy opposite.  I will read one paragraph from it:</P>
    <P>The rates of growth, of production, home sales and exports have improved, and the most important feature this month is the substantial increase reported in the assessment of employment.  The percentage of respondents stating that employment was higher over those that said it was lower is the highest recorded since the <i>Monthly Survey</i> commenced in March, 1974.  At + 16, if this balance is maintained it indicates that employment in the manufacturing industry will increase by about 10,000 during this year.</P>
    <P>That is significant.  It is the result of actions by a Government that has restored confidence.  That is why I set out this evening to be positive and not to be over-critical of somebody who obviously was going to pains to explain that he was not peeved at having been beaten last year.  It was very hard to understand what he stood to gain by speaking with such little constructive comment on a motion that has been on the Order Paper for some months.</P>
    <P>The live register was referred to and I will give the figures for the latest date I have got.  They show that 112,017 persons were unemployed, a decrease of 144 on the previous week and of 5,110 on the figures for the corresponding week last year.  It has been moving in the right direction for many weeks.  We must realise, however, that the live register has a number of drawbacks as a measurement of the unemployment figures.  Its major defect is its failure to cover the young <Col N="1532" /> unemployed.  Deputy Kelly referred to various figures but not to the one I have just given.</P>
    <P>In a rather dramatic conclusion, the Deputy referred to emigration.  I have not got those figures available to me now but I will arrange to have them provided during the course of the debate, and Deputy Kelly's face will blush with embarrassment when they are produced to him.  I will arrange that one of the speakers to follow will have those figures.</P>
    <P>One of the Government's main concerns from the beginning has been to get people back to work and particularly to provide employment for the growing number of young people coming on the employment market. Confidence has already been restored in the economy.  I will skim over the building construction industry.  It was referred to by Deputy Kelly who said he thought it would be the main plank of my speech.  I will say that at the moment in some areas there is a serious shortage of skilled people, indicating that there has been a return to work of those engaged in those skills and that the prospects for that industry are bright.</P>
    <P>The Government have a duty to work on behalf of all sections of the community, to create opportunities for them and the climate in which industry can develop and produce and maintain jobs.  The commitments of our manifesto to reduce unemployment and inflation, to provide tax concessions, have been met.  The Government have fulfilled their part of their bargain to date, and co-operation from both sides in industry can keep us on the road to full economic recovery.  There is a new climate of confidence in the economy. Money is available for investment to create jobs.  All this is a great tribute to the spirit of the Irish people after four disastrous years of Coalition Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before developing my contribution I should like to put on record my amazement at the continued reference by the Minister to the statements of Deputy Kelly, with particular reference to the record of the previous Government in regard to employment, <Col N="1533" /> particularly of young people. It is the Minister who should be blushing.  In 1975 and 1976 he and others in his Party blamed the Coalition for the serious unemployment situation, but in the latter end of 1977 when it became apparent that it was a world problem, they switched to the defence and referred to unemployment as a world evil.  Tonight the Minister has returned to the 1975 saga&mdash;the Coalition were responsible for unemployment in, as he called them, those terrible years.  They were terrible years for this and every country in the civilised world because the worst inflation in living memory hit the industrial countries to the extent that put 6 million to 8 million people out of employment in the nine EEC countries, that put America back to the 1930s when President Roosevelt had people out digging holes and filling trenches, and it put us back to thinking once again of the terrible evil of the emigrant ship.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate at this stage, 300 days approximately after the new Government's rule commenced, that this motion should be debated.  Their failure to resolve the problem has raised grave doubts in the minds of many people.  Every time we try to solve a problem this tablet of stone on Mount Sinai, the manifesto, is brought here before us.  In June 1977 I listened to the many candidates, agents and canvassers of the Fianna Fáil Party, at church gate, at door and in street, indicate and outline the many ways they would have of resolving our problems. I heard the many promises that were made and saw the many gimmicks that were produced.  Many of the promises were easily covered by the budgetary proposals last January, but the prime vote-catcher on 16 June 1977 as far as the general public were concerned, particularly the young and the unemployed, was the promise to create employment and to reduce this tremendous figure of 160,000 unemployed. In their election manifesto, which I am lucky to have a copy of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They gave around thousands of copies indeed.  Their jobcreation programmes envisaged that in the first 12 months there would be 20,000 new jobs, and one could be talking in terms of at least 35,000 jobs.  There has been a to-ing and froing on what this means exactly and I am not going to go into that now.  In their programme they envisaged an allocation of £30 million for building and construction to create 5,000 jobs, £50 million in the public sector, Garda and civil service to create 10,000 jobs, and £20 million for 5,000 jobs to be created in the youth sector.  The success of the Fianna Fáil manifesto's strategy centres around their new whizz kid, Professor Martin O'Donoghue, Minister for Economic Planning and Development, now in many places I believe re-named Minister for Statistical Confusion.  He has descended from his academic heights to lead the country into an economic charge of the Light Brigade with as much strategic knowledge and concern for the result as had Lord Lucan at Balaclava and Custer at the Battle of Little Big Horn.  I thought at one stage we were looking at a programme about cowboys and Indians which was on Telefís Éireann some years ago.  I hope the Ceann Comhairle will pardon the expression, but I am using the terminology used by the learned Minister for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that our youth unemployment situation is frightening.  Unless something realistic and immediate is done the prospects for our young people are very dim. This is the most serious problem that has ever faced our country and it is intensified because, as I gather from a census, half our population are 25 years of age and under.  A far greater genuine effort from the Government is demanded to ensure permanent security and contentment for our youth in their own country.  It is with no disrespect that I say that the measures of landscaping and improving our environment may be all very good in their own way but there is nothing permanent about landscaping our country.  What the young people <Col N="1535" /> want is permanent security.  The youth of today will not tolerate the only solution offered to their counterparts 30 years ago, the emigrant ship.  They contribute to the well-being of the country and it is our duty to ensure that every opportunity is given to them to do so.  If on the other hand national concern for their future is not forthcoming and apparent I fear the consequences. This Government's craze to return to power on the backs of our youth may yet prove to be a dangerous and irresponsible act.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the input in the budget for the jobcreation programme.  In one aspect the promises of the present Government in the election campaign have proved very false.  I am thinking of the promise of £20 million for job creation among our youth.  The Minister for Finance on budget day clearly indicated that a meagre £5 million would be provided for this.  This in itself is an indication of the interest in our youth; indeed many aspects of the youth programme are an insult to them.  Ministerial statements are being made every day allocating moneys for job creation.  As the motion points out, there have been no clear indications of any policy or plan to ensure that within the next ten years the problems facing our youth and unemployment will be countered and defeated.  At this very moment how can the 20,000 young people who are earnestly preparing to sit for their leaving certificate in a couple of months look with confidence to the Government providing work for them?  Judging by the inept performance so far in job creation, we will reach by the end of this year a figure of approximately 200,000 unemployed. This is not pie-in-the-sky, it is the stark realism of nine months performance by the Government.  How can anyone in my region have confidence in the Government after their disastrous handling of the Ferenka crisis at Annacotty in County Limerick?  Much has been said about Ferenka and about the workers' contribution to the closure of it, but several of the Ministers concerned had information which, had the workers <Col N="1536" /> known it, would have inspired in the workers more confidence in the Government's handling of the situation. Many Ferenka workers have since become disenchanted with the promises made in June 1977.  There are hundreds of them, and in my area&mdash;I hate to put this on record&mdash;to have been a Ferenka employee is regarded in the mid-west region as something bad. This is unfortunate for the members of the staff of that concern who had worked there since its commencement and had contributed to making the industry what it was.  The industry had suffered considerably as a result of the recession but it was a multi-national concern which did not have as its prime responsibility the welfare of the workers.  Its closing was a disaster for the workers and for their dependants.</P>
    <P>Are we facing a similar situation in another industry which, though not employing the same number of people is a medium-sized multi-national firm in which a semi-State body have become involved in the past couple of years?  Are we to turn our backs on the Van Hool problem when the 350 workers there are in the position of not knowing what their future is to be or whether CIE, Van Hool or another organisation is responsible for them? To extend my criticism a little further, I shall dwell for a moment on the situation in one of the biggest semi-State bodies, CIE.</P>
    <P>While I am concerned about finding employment for our youth I am concerned also about job retention.  But if the Government shared this concern they would not have cut back this year the £34 million subsidy for CIE of recent years to £30 million for approximately 16,000 workers.  There was no allowance in that subsidy for this year's wage agreement which in itself could be regarded as a further cutback of £4 million.  There is indifference in so far as this major organisation is concerned.  The total cutback is approximately £8 million, or 25 per cent.  What are CIE to do in these circumstances and what must their workers be thinking?  Does this cutback mean that the employment factor in CIE will be reduced by 25 per cent also to offset the loss in subsidy, or <Col N="1537" /> does it mean that the Government have put the gun to the head of the chairman of CIE and his executive to once again up the fares of those who avail of CIE's services, services which have been reducing down through the years and which will be reduced further if the Government are to persist in their attitude?  Instead of cutting back the Government should be ensuring that CIE get a subsidy in keeping with the needs of a social service and thereby to allow the company maintain a service for the people in rural Ireland as well as in the cities.  If the Minister is genuinely concerned about the employment situation I appeal to him to use his influence with his Cabinet colleagues not only to reinstate the full CIE subsidy but to ensure that there is included in that subsidy a sufficient amount to allow for the national wage agreement which is about to be agreed with the trade unions.  Without taking this action the Government may be faced with an unemployment situation in CIE far more serious than what is envisaged now.</P>
    <P>Today a Minister of State admitted that the live register figure is 154,000. We are talking, then, in terms of the creation of about 6,000 jobs.  During the past six months the Government, and in particular the Minister for Health, have been claiming credit for the major job increase in the health services although it is well known and is on the record of the House that in the budget of 1977 the then Minister for Health was allocated about £12 million for the purpose of creating 2,500 jobs.  As a member of a health board I know that that job creation effort was successful and that the figure projected was reached by the end of the year.  Therefore, it is foolhardy and also a reflection on the intelligence of our people for a Minister to take credit for something for which he was not responsible.</P>
    <P>Much publicity was given to the setting up of the Employment Action Team.  So far we have had reports and surveys, but no action.  As Deputy Kelly said here some weeks ago, the only job created by this team was the job of secretary to themselves.  Certainly, they have made no impact on <Col N="1538" /> the employment situation in my area. It is time the Government stopped trying to cod the people and got down to the job they were elected to do and ensure, now that the recession is over and the world economy is on the upturn&mdash;I trust Fianna Fáil will not endeavour to claim credit for that, too&mdash;that there will be employment for our people.  We must endeavour to put back to work those who have been unemployed for years.  We cannot afford to have disappointed and angry young people.  Unless we provide them with employment opportunities we can look forward to nothing but trouble in the eighties.</P>
    <P>In the remaining few moments tomorrow evening I shall address some further remarks to the Minister on the activities and on the importance of the role of AnCO in training our young people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not an easy subject on which to speak.  There are circumstances that must be appreciated fully by an Opposition spokesman. First, I should like to extend sympathy to the family of the man who was killed in this city at the weekend, an incident which presses me to put my views before the House.  It was an action that shocked all of us into asking whether there are measures that we should be taking in an effort to prevent other such incidents recurring. There are no simple solutions but I think I am expressing the view of many people when I say that sawn-off shotguns are being used too frequently in bank raids and other robberies and we cannot continually ignore the threat they offer to society and how easily they can come into the hands of misguided people.  I know that farmers and members of gun clubs require guns to shoot vermin and game.  I know the arguments the Minister may put forward that keeping guns collected in one place, such as a garda station, might be a greater danger. and that, as we have an unarmed police force, it would be rather difficult for them to <Col N="1539" /> protect a large number of shotguns.  I am not asking for this.</P>
      <P>I believe that the views of farmers and those of gun club members should be respected.  A tribute should be paid to the members of gun clubs for the way they co-operate with the authorities and the high standards they practise as sportsmen and in encouraging the reproduction of game stock.  At the outset of the troubles in 1969 members of the FCA had guns which they kept in their homes and for security reasons they were then brought to a central point and they were kept under military control.  The authorities seem to have become slightly relaxed now when they are not  having shotguns under military control or supervision.  I do not want to use this occasion to hammer the Government for lack of interest or to criticise the Minister for Justice for not taking a greater interest in this matter because there is no such thing as absolute security.</P>
      <P>I believe, however, that by bringing this matter before the House tonight I am bringing before the Minister the need for up-to-date thinking on this particular problem.  It is frightening to think that any man can walk into a house where he knows a gun is kept and force the owner of the gun, his wife or his family to hand it over. That can happen in any house in the Republic where a gun is kept.  While I appreciate all the difficulties that the Department and the Garda authorities have, I do not think it is good enough to say that it is not easy to collect the guns and keep them in central storage places under military control.  We should look at the way the FCA guns are held in central points under military control and we should look at the military establishments situated throughout the Republic.  How many miles would a particular gun club member have to travel to collect his gun on the morning of a shoot?  Would this be a great inconvenience to that member?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The apparent reason for the murder of the Dublin man in his home recently was that he kept a gun in his home.  If members of gun clubs had to <Col N="1540" /> collect their guns from a central storage place greater scrutiny would be achieved and if they did not keep guns in their homes they would not expose their families to the dangers the murdered man's family were in.  I believe that the horror of what happened in Dublin can happen in any persons home, whether it is in County Donegal or County Cork, and must alert the authorities and they must do more than just say that they cannot bring in every gun in the country.</P>
    <P>A sawn-off shogun is more dangerous than a rifle.  It is not easy to conceal a rifle if a person is walking through the streets of this city or travelling in a motor car in going to rob a bank.  It is very easy to cut down a shotgun and a man can hide it by putting it in his inside pocket.  If a shotgun is cut down like that it loses its total identification and there is no way it can be established that the shots came from a particular gun.</P>
    <P>I believe that each year every licensed gun holder should bring his gun to the Garda barracks for inspection or maybe more often.  I have total sympathy with the authorities because there is no such thing as absolute security.  I have sympathy with farmers and members of gun clubs but tighter security demands effort on the part of us all.  I am sure that I will not be a very popular person with the people who believe that they have the right to hold licensed guns in their homes, but I believe, as a public representative, that I would not be fulfilling my duty if I did not, as spokesman for my party on security, use this opportunity to have a discussion with the Minister about the threat sawn-off shotguns are for society.</P>
    <P>I understand that the only rifle which can be held under license at the moment is a .22 but there is a bullet which is now used in those rifles, a .22 250 which I am told is a high velocity type and is as lethal as a .303 bore.  Those guns should be kept under tighter security.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party are thinking about the security aspect of the threat of sawn-off shotguns and other weapons held by licensed holders, and, as I have said, there is no easy answer <Col N="1541" /> and I know there is no absolute security.  However, something will have to be done and if it inconveniences people who are licensed holders we hope it will not be for too long.  Those people will know that they will not subject their families to the dangers of having guns in their homes and having people raid their homes to get these guns.  I assure the Minister that we will work in harmony with him and will co-operate in every way possible.</P>
    <P>There are three military installations in Donegal, at Finner, Lifford and Letterkenny.  Almost all of the gun clubs in Donegal, with the exception of those in the Inishowen Peninsula, would not have to travel more than ten or 15 miles to collect them.  Some arrangement could be made to store the guns in County Donegal at any of those military installations.  Exceptions could be made for farmers who have to have guns in their farmyards all of the time to shoot vermin.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the problem I have outlined, the threat which a sawn-off shotgun causes society at this time.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that I would be perfectly willing to consider the introduction of further controls on firearms if I thought that any further controls were necessary or would be beneficial.  The controls which exist on the possession, use and carriage of firearms are particularly stringent.  They are far more stringent than controls operated in almost any other country and are considerably more stringent than the controls operated on firearms in Northern Ireland.  I have a fair knowledge of the problem of controlling firearms because I introduced the Firearms Act, 1971 which made major changes <Col N="1542" /> in relation to our firearms law, and I made the order in July 1972 calling up all firearms other than shotguns, .22 rifles and those of a smaller calibre.  At that time one of the suggestions I made was that if a similar move was made in Northern Ireland, it would go at least part of the way towards easing the problems and bloodshed there.  Unfortunately, my suggestion to the then Secretary of State, Mr. Whitelaw, went unheeded and as far as I know every succeeding Secretary of State has not heeded it either.  The present Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is very security conscious and loses no opportunity to lecture those whom he considers less able at the job than he is.  I suggest that if he now did what I did in 1971 and 1972, even at this late stage, it would be of help.</P>
      <P>Since I made that Order in 1972 there are no non-sporting weapons lawfully held here.  There are licensed shotguns, airguns and rifles of .22 calibre and less.  The number of licensed shotguns at the moment is 106,000 approximately, the number of airguns and rifles of .22 calibre and less is approximately 25,000, and .22 rifles and airguns are of little value in a criminal context.  Unless shotguns are sawn off, they are of no value either.  The tragedy is that there appears to be quite a number of unlawfully held weapons and the great bulk of the trouble emanates from those and not from lawfully held weapons.  There are very occasional raids on the holders of licensed shotguns in order to get possession of the guns, but as far as we can judge these raids seem to be very infrequent.  The tragedy in Dublin some days ago mentioned by Deputy Harte is not an example of his kind of raid.  If this man held any licensed shotguns those who raided the house did not steal them or attempt to steal them as far as one knows.  I am not certain that the motive for that crime which Deputy Harte accredited to these people who perpetrated it is the actual motive.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that a sawn-off shotgun was used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not mean that it was ever a licensed weapon.  In addition to that, the number of armed robberies and incidents of that kind in which sawn-off shotguns are used is quite small.  The firearm or weapon normally used is a hand gun and these have been illegal in all circumstances since July, 1972.  The very possession of a hand gun carries a penalty of five years' imprisonment, which was introduced in the Firearms Act, 1971, and that is without proof of criminal intent.  Much longer terms can be imposed for any proved improper or unlawful intent.  So far as I can judge, because the Deputy did not say specificially, Deputy Harte seems to be suggesting that we should now call up shotguns, .22 rifles and airguns.  The Deputy talked about the inconvenience that this would cause to farmers and to sportsmen but he thought they would put up with it in the circumstances and then suggested that there could be exceptions for farmers who had to shoot vermin. Earlier on the Deputy said that the cause of some of these raids was that it was known that somebody had a licensed weapon.  If the Deputy made exceptions for certain farmers it would be known very quickly by the neighbours and everyone in the locality, including presumably criminally minded people, that particular farmers have these weapons.  I do not really know what Deputy Harte hopes to achieve by this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inconvenience caused by calling up 131,000 lawfully held weapons which are of little or no value to those of criminal mentality whether subversive or otherwise has to be balanced against whatever marginal good might be obtained by calling up the weapons.  I and my colleague, the Minister for Justice, would be perfectly prepared to call up those weapons if we thought the public interest would be served by doing so but we are satisfied that on balance it would not.  The vast majority of the cases of armed violence occurring here occur as a result of the possession of illegally held unlicensed weapons.  We feel therefore that on balance nothing <Col N="1544" /> would be gained and enormous inconvenience and difficulty would be created.  I am conscious even at a remove of almost six years of the great deal of inconvenience caused to many law abiding people by the calling up of weapons in 1972 but I felt that the public interest required it and I still hold that view.  There is no question of that order of 1972 being changed but the 131,000 weapons we are now talking about are in a totally different category and the inconvenience and trouble that would be caused by doing as Deputy Harte suggests would be out of all proportion to whatever slight marginal gain might be achieved by calling them up. We have to bear in mind that in spite of what we hear in the lectures we have been getting from London over the past few weeks there could be a fairly free movement of a huge number of weapons both lawfully held and illegally held in Northern Ireland down to here.  We would be putting our own people at enormous and unnecessary disadvantage without gaining anything.</P>
    <P>The last time anything was done in relation to firearms in this country was by me in 1971 and in 1972.  In the long intervening period apparently it was felt unnecessary or inappropriate to do anything else in spite of the fact that the situation at one stage during that period had reached such crisis proportions that the Government of the day felt it necessary to declare a state of emergency.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Deputy once more that, having considered his proposal from all angles, I am quite satisfied that the public interest would not be served by it and that the balance of inconvenience would be so great for whatever slight marginal gain might be achieved it would not be worth while, bearing in mind that there are at present in Northern Ireland a vast number of both licensed and unlicensed weapons of all calibres.</P>

      <P>It is proposed, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 348, 349, and 350 together.</P>
      <P>If adopted this draft article would involve my nominating a minimum of about 17 landing places at which species of fish subject to quota could be landed.  This would not, however, prevent fishermen from using other landing places which they traditionally used for the landing of such species. All landings would, of course, count against the national quotas.</P>

      <P>The average waiting <Col N="1435" /> time to date of applications at present on the waiting list in the Sligo Engineering District, which includes the Sligo-Leitrim area, is 14 months. A longer waiting time is likely at exchanges in rural areas because of the more extensive linework necessary to meet applications in such areas.</P>
      <P>The general reason for delay in meeting applications is that the Department's resources of manpower, plant and buildings are not yet adequate to overtake arrears and cope with current demand.  The development plan prepared in connection with the Telephone Capital Act, 1977, which provides for investment of a further £350 million in the telephone service, should go a long way towards eliminating delays experienced at present.</P>

      <P>Proceedings for the compulsory acquisition of some 114 acres of the property referred to were instituted by the Land Commission in July 1976.  While there was no objection to the acquisition of the lands price negotiations proved unsuccessful and in default of agreement the price was determined by the appeal tribunal.  The Land Commission considered that the price so fixed was such as to make the acquisition of the lands inexpedient and accordingly they withdrew from the proceedings in July 1977 under the provisions of section 24, Land Act, 1927.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the newspaper report mentioned and that the company referred to is active in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The Government are concerned about the undesirable features of pyramid selling and exhorts those who might feel tempted to become involved in such arrangements not to.  Such exhortations have too often gone un-heeded in the past and I have come to the conclusion that legislation is desirable.  Deputies will recall from previous occasions when this matter was raised in the House that there was hesitation to introduce legislation lest it should unintentionally penalise perfectly legitimate forms of trading. I have recently reconsidered the matter and I believe that suitable legislation can be devised which would effectively outlaw pyramid selling without damaging other forms of trade and I shall be putting proposals to the Government in this regard shortly.</P>
