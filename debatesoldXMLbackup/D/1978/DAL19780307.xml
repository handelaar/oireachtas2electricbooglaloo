    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) if there is any precedent for the taking of a limited census merely for the purposes of Dáil constituency revision; (b) if he will estimate the cost of taking such a census compared with the cost of taking a normal complete census; (c) why, in view of the limited nature of the proposed census, it should be necessary to defer its taking until a date approximately 18 months after the intention to take it was first announced by him; (d) how long it will take after the census date to publish the figures resulting from the census; and (e) if a normal complete census were taken, if it would not be possible within the same time to extract and publish the figures relevant to the purposes of constituency revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  There is no precedent for the taking of a limited census merely for the purposes of Dáil constituency revision.  A census similarly limited in scope was taken in 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  The 1979 census and the 1979 sample labour force survey will be carried out as an integrated operation at <Col N="846" /> an estimated combined cost, at current prices, of £2.2 million, of which the census will account for some £2 million. It is estimated that a comprehensive census would cost about £3.1 million at current prices.</P>
    <P>(c)  The necessary preparatory work for the census, much of which is independent of the actual content of the census questionnaire, could not be completed before April 1978.  Therefore, the earliest appropriate date on which the census could be held would be April 1979, bearing in mind the need to maintain consistency with previous censuses.</P>
    <P>(d)  It is anticipated that provisional figures will be published in August 1979, in respect of total population, classified by sex, county, county borough, rural district and urban district.  This will be followed in January 1980 by the publication of final population figures for the above-mentioned areas and also for towns with legally defined boundaries and for administrative areas such as district electoral divisions and wards.  A further volume will be published during 1980 containing analyses by sex, age and marital status.  The results of the associated labour force survey will also be published during 1980.</P>
    <P>(e)  If a comprehensive census were taken in 1979 the basic population figures for administrative areas could be produced by about February 1980. There is, however, an EEC requirement to take a full census in 1981, which year would accord with the normal census-taking pattern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister explain why there is a gap up to April of this year before the questions for the census are ready, if the information which this census will elicit is purely demographic and of a very limited kind?  Why should it take eight or nine months after the original announcement to prepare the set of questions for eliciting demographic information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It takes quite an amount of time to make the necessary preparations and the Deputy can take my word for it that it would take this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="847" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is hitting me with a child in my arms in asking me to take his word for anything. Could the Minister tell the House why there will be a necessary delay of a further 12 months from the date on which these questions become ready to the day on which the collectors go out and distribute the questionnaires?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>From experience it has been found that the April-May period is the ideal time for taking a census.  On the basis that it would take up to April-May of this year to get ready it would be inappropriate to endeavour to take the census at a different time of the year.  Experience for each five years since 1946 has shown that April-May is the ideal time to take the census.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting that, I wonder is the Minister serious in telling the House that it would not have been possible to contrive the completion of the census forms in time to permit this study to be done in April-May of this year?  There is something fishy in the census.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked this question and two others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one other question to ask.  Apart from the labour force survey, which would have been conducted in any event, and concentrating on the limited census with the demographic data which it will produce, will these data represent information which will be of any economic or planning value which would not have been available from other official sources or from easy calculations based on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.  Question No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very important. I have to put it to the Minister that the indignation over the cancellation of the 1976 census was based on the lack of economic information and that that indignation turns out now to be very largely a pretence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very necessary that we get the data it is planned to procure under the next census.  We are <Col N="848" /> very handicapped in planning at present without this data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell the House what data the census, as distinct from the labour force survey, will produce apart from demographic material which is easily available from calculations and from official documents already there?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a separate question for the Minister tomorrow but I wish to hear the Taoiseach's reply too.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Consumer Price Index.</Title>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will furnish an estimate of the proportion of the average household budget which is devoted to housing costs, both rental and purchase; the proportion of the consumer price index which is comprised of such housing costs; and if he will revise the index to take account of the rapid increase in house and land prices in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The last full-scale national household budget survey was conducted in 1973.  On the basis of the results of that survey it is estimated that, averaged over households of all types, total housing costs&mdash;including the full amount of mortgage repayments and life insurance premiums linked to house purchase&mdash;amounted to 7 per cent of total household expenditure.</P>
      <P>The weighting pattern of the current consumer price index is based on the same survey.  Housing costs, which exclude the capital element of mortgage repayments and life insurance premiums linked to house purchase&mdash; treated as investment&mdash;account for 6 per cent of the total household expenditure covered by the index.  Due account is taken in the compilation of the index of changes in the prices of all the elements covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if the cost of housing and lands is reflected accurately in the household <Col N="849" /> budget and, in view of the considerable increase in the speed of escalation from the point of view of prices for both housing and land, how will he control the cost of living if there is no serious price review or price control in respect of housing and land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree there is no serious control on the price of either land or houses? They are two things which are not subject to any serious review or control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question has nothing to do with control.  The question has to do with the realistic reflection of prices in the household budget survey and in the consumer price index.</P>

      <P>Question No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If any component in the household budget is allowed to increase at a greater rate than other components then, clearly, it will be reflected in the cost of living.  Would the Minister not agree with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asks if I will furnish an estimate of the proportion and if all factors are taken into consideration, and the reply deals with that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says there is no serious control of prices of land and houses unlike the other components.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he has under examination in his Department the present standard of literacy achieved after first level and second level education; and if he is satisfied that the literacy standards attained bear comparison with similar age groups in other EEC countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The standards of literacy achieved after various levels of education are under constant review in my Department.  Such review is a part of the normal process of assessment of the effects, objectives and needs of the educational system and is serviced by reports on testing procedures carried out by Departmental officers and others, by inspectors' reports, by the results of public examinations including examiners' reports and by various surveys and research reports which are submitted to my Department from time to time.</P>
      <P>With regard to the literacy standards attained bearing comparison with similar age groups in other EEC countries, I am not aware of any studies undertaken over the range of EEC countries which would allow for valid comparisons of the kind implied by the Deputy and I believe that the establishment of such studies is fraught with difficulties of a technical nature, not the least of which is the lack of any internationally accepted definition of literacy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation regarding second-level education in the greater Dublin area is kept under constant review by my Department and the Dublin Advisory Council.</P>
      <P>In relation to school developments at present I may say that a proposal from Dublin City VEC was approved for a new vocational school in the north city centre to replace the existing schools in Great Denmark Street and Parnell Square.  A major extension scheme has also been approved for the Sisters of Charity school in Kings Inns Street.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would inform the Deputy that my plans will not be thrown into confusion by any action on the part of any educational establishment closing down.  As I have told the Deputy, a new vocational school in the north city area will replace the existing schools in Great Denmark Street and Parnell Square and I will continue with that plan if a suitable site can be found. A suitable site is the problem at the moment.</P>

    <P>The Department of Education were advised in October 1975 of the proposed closing of the Sisters of Charity school, Gardiner Street, on a phased basis over the period to 30 June 1979. <Col N="861" /> In the circumstances of the time this decision did not cause any undue difficulty in relation to the provision of suitable alternative accommodation for pupils who might otherwise have gone to that school.  Accordingly, it would not have been necessary to have the matter considered specifically by the advisory council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy raised the matter.  I am aware of the financial implications.  Over many decades the State has been saved a great deal of money by the existence of these schools.

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the heart of this matter is the degree to which the Government are willing to fill the vacuum created by such closures?  Despite the fact that the Minister has given us an assurance to the effect that he will build schools wherever they are closed, will he accept <Col N="867" /> that the inherent instability because of closures, which may occur at the drop of a hat without due notice and without advance warning, is the basis of a most unsteady educational policy in the future?

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made a good point.  The implication for the Department and the Government is obvious.  No matter how many private schools opt out, it is my intention to have post-primary places available for pupils in the various areas.  The drop of a hat has not been so unfortunate because those who have indicated intentions to close already have allowed three years and five years for the dropping of a hat.  The people responsible should not give inadequate notice of the closing of a school: there is a serious obligation on such people to inform the planning section of the Department so that we can be ready for any eventuality.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the names and locations of all schools which he is aware are threatened with closure and/or are reported to be in financial difficulty; and the measures which he proposes to take to maintain and improve educational standards in their catchment areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to state the names and locations of any secondary schools the closure of which the authorities may have under consideration in advance of an announcement from the authorities of the school concerned in relation to the matter.  The closure of schools is not necessarily related to the financial circumstances of the schools.  It may be considered that the increase in the grant in lieu of tuition fees which was introduced with effect from 1 January last would serve to place secondary schools in a reasonably satisfactory financial situation.</P>
      <P>Where a religious order cease their involvement in a particular school, suitable alternative arrangements are made for the continued education of the pupils concerned, either through the continuation of the school under a new management or the enrolment of the pupils of the area in other schools.</P>
      <P>It may be anticipated that any such closures as may occur in the future will be on a suitably phased basis and I would also expect&mdash;and I emphasise this&mdash;that adequate prior notice should be given of their intentions by the conductors of the schools in all such cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies are interested in this problem which arises from the growing, increasingly rapid <Col N="871" /> failure of the religious orders to find members for the orders, priests rather than nuns, and is beginning to be a national trend and has reached crisis proportions.  In these circumstances would the Minister not attempt to carry out some kind of national survey to find out the size of the problem and the alternative staffing and financial arrangements he is likely to have to make in the circumstances of what is becoming a serious situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Browne that the main reason for the problem is the diminishing numbers available in the orders for teaching purposes.  Secondly, I want to assure the Deputy that as far as the Department are concerned we are committed to the provision of places in the various types of schools which I have already referred to in answer to a previous supplementary question.  I have left instructions to have a letter written to the main bodies involved pointing out to them the serious problems that further closure announcements would create for my Department and if they have any intention to close that we should be given notice in good time.</P>

      <P>Is it not true that there is some substance in Deputy's Keating's suggestion in regard to a drop of the hat of four or five years because it takes that period of time to plan.  In the circumstances would the Minister not consider it a matter of extreme urgency that they are told they cannot close in less than a specific time such as five years or whatever it might take to provide an alternative school or alternative staffing for that school?  The Minister is being faced practically with a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to implement the 10 per cent increase in the weekly rates of social welfare payments and other improvements in the social welfare code announced in the budget.  Provision is also made for consequential changes in the occupational injuries scheme and for the necessary increases in the contributions payable under the social insurance and occupational injuries schemes.</P>
      <P>In addition to the changes announced in the budget a number of further improvements are being made in particular schemes to remove inequities which have come to my notice since I took office as Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>In order to clarify the provisions of the Bill and to assist Deputies in their examination of it an explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the text of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Government are committed to maintaining living standards of social welfare recipients by regular adjustments of the level of payments at least in line with the cost of living.  The 10 per cent increase provided in this Bill, on the basis of the estimated increase in the cost of living in 1978, represents an increase in real terms of some 6 per cent.  The new levels of social welfare payments will consequently ensure a real improvement in the living standards of social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>The 10 per cent increase and the other improvements announced in the budget will involve a total cost of approximately £36.5 million in 1978 and £53 million in a full year.  The overall outlay on social welfare benefits and allowances will be approximately £594 million in 1978 or £610 million annually.</P>

    <P>Turning to the increases provided in individual payments the maximum weekly personal rate of non-contributory old age pension is being increased from £12.35 to £13.60 for persons aged <Col N="932" /> under 80 years and from £13.30 to £14.65 for persons aged 80 years or over.  The reduced rates of pension payable where the weekly means exceed £6 but do not exceed £15 are also being increased.  For a pensioner with qualified children, of course, the means limit is greater than £15.</P>
    <P>The maximum rate of payment in respect of an adult dependant under pensionable age is increased to £6.75. Therefore the overall payment for a pensioner with a dependent spouse will at the maximum rate be increased from £18.50 to £20.35 and, where the pensioner is 80 years of age or over from £19.45 to £21.40.</P>
    <P>The allowance payable in respect of a prescribed relative giving full-time care and attention to an incapacitated pensioner is being increased from £6.90 to £7.60 and the addition to pension for a pensioner living alone will be raised to £1.10.</P>
    <P>For pensioners who have qualified children the increases of pension payable are being raised by 35p to £3.65 a week for each of the first two children and by 25p to £2.75 a week for each other child.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill sets out in Table A the weekly means and rates of pension.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for increases in the rates of unemployment assistance.  The maximum personal weekly rate of assistance is being raised from £10.70 to £11.75 in an urban area and from £10.30 to £11.35 in a rural area.  The rates for adult dependants are being increased to £8.55 and £8.35 respectively and the rates in respect of dependent children to £3.65 for each of the first two and £2.75 for others.  Thus the rate of assistance for a married couple with two children is being increased from £25.05 to £27.60 in an urban area and from £24.50 to £27.00 in a rural area.</P>
    <P>In the case of smallholders whose means for unemployment assistance purposes are assessed notionally by reference to rateable land valuation the new rate of assistance will be as I have outlined where the valuation is £10 or less.  Those whose valuation is between £10 and £15 did not benefit <Col N="933" /> from any increase in 1977 and are currently in receipt of assistance at rates established in 1976.  These rates are now being increased by 10 per cent and the new rates are set out separately in section 4.  Unemployment assistance rates for those smallholders whose valuations are between £15 and £20 are, as announced in the budget, excluded from the 10 per cent increase, due to the continuing growth in farm incomes.  These smallholders did not receive any increase in 1976 or in 1977 and the rates payable to them are those established in October 1975. Landholders with valuations of more than £20 are no longer since 1977 eligible to have their means assessed on the notional basis but these, and any landholders below £20 valuation who feel it would be to their advantage, may have their means assessed on a factual basis in which case they would receive the current rate of payment appropriate to their means as so assessed.</P>
    <P>The increases in non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions are provided in sections 7 and 9 of the Bill.  The maximum weekly personal rate of widows' non-contributory pension is increased from £12.35 to £13.60 and the amount payable in respect of each qualified child is being raised from £4.10 to £4.50.  As in the case of non-contributory old age pension, reduced rates of pension are payable where the widow's weekly means exceed £6 but do not exceed £15 if she has no qualified child, higher means limits applying if she has qualified children.  The increases in widows' pensions automatically apply to the social assistance allowances for deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives.  Orphans' non-contributory pension is increased from £8.05 to £8.85 a week.</P>
    <P>The allowance for single women aged between 58 and 66 is being increased in section 10 of the Bill from £10.70 to £11.75.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for increases in the rates of supplementary welfare allowances.  The maximum personal weekly rate of the allowance is being increased from £10.30 to £11.35, the rate for an adult dependant from £7.60 to £8.35 and the rates for dependent <Col N="934" /> children to £3.65 for each of the first two and £2.75 for each other child.  These increases will maintain the parity between the rates of supplementary welfare allowance and the rural rates of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the increases in the rates of contributory benefits and pensions under the social insurance system which are set out in section 14 of the Bill.  The personal rates of disability and unemployment benefit and invalidity pension are being increased from £13.05 to £14.35 and the rate for an adult dependant from £8.50 to £9.35.  Maternity allowance is also being increased from £13.05 to £14.35.</P>
    <P>The personal rates of contributory old-age and retirement pensions for persons under age 80 are increased from £14.60 to £16.05 and for those over 80, from £15.50 to £17.05.  The rates for adult dependants are also increased so that a married couple both over pensionable age will get £28.15 as compared with £25.60 at present or £29.15 as compared with £26.50 if the pensioner is aged 80 or over.</P>
    <P>The personal rates of widows' contributory pensions are being increased from £13.25 to £14.60 in the case of those under age 80 and from £14.30 to £15.75 for those aged 80 or over. Deserted wife's benefit is also being increased from £13.25 to £14.60.</P>
    <P>Increases for children under the various social insurance schemes are being raised from £4.45 to £4.90 for each child in the case of widows and deserted wives and, in the case of other benefits and pensions, from £3.75 to £4.15 for each of the first two children and from £3.10 to £3.40 for each other child.  A widow or deserted wife with four qualified children will now get £34.20 as compared with £31.05 at present.</P>
    <P>On this occasion also provision is being made for increases in the grants payable under the social insurance system.  Maternity grant is increased from £4 to £8 and the maximum rate of death grant is increased from £35 to £50.</P>
    <P>In line with the improvements in the general social insurance system the <Col N="935" /> Bill provides also in sections 19 and 20 for increases in the rates of benefit payable under the occupational injuries scheme.  The increases are broadly in line with those provided for in the general social insurance schemes.</P>
    <P>The impact of the increases provided can be illustrated by giving an indication of the numbers of persons who will benefit.  There are about 330,000 recipients of long-term benefits and pensions under the social insurance and social assistance code and these, with their adult and child dependants, make up a total of over 440,000.  On the short-term benefit side there are some 245,000 beneficiaries with almost 300,000 adult and child beneficiaries.  In all, almost 990,000 persons will benefit from the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition to the increases in rates of benefits the Bill also provides for a number of other improvements in social welfare schemes.  It is my intention to keep all social welfare schemes under continuous review and to deal with anomalies and defects and to close any gaps in the services as they come to light.  A number of inequities have come to my notice since I took office as Minister for Social Welfare and, where appropriate, provision is made to deal with them in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government have undertaken to work towards the elimination of discrimination against women throughout the social welfare code and, as announced in the budget, a very substantial step forward in that programme is being taken by giving single women and widows full and unrestricted access to unemployment assistance on the same terms as men from October next by removing the requirement of having a dependant or having paid a certain minimum number of contributions.  This is provided for in section 5.  It is estimated that there will be over 50,000 applicants for unemployment assistance as a result of this change and, in order to make the operation as smooth as possible, section 6 of the Bill will enable such women, from the date of enactment of the Bill, to apply for a qualification <Col N="936" /> certificate.  This certificate sets out the holder's weekly means and, while it does not confer entitlement to assistance, it is a necessary requirement for such entitlement and if the women concerned obtain the certificates before October, it will facilitate the speedy clearance of applications for assistance at that stage.</P>
    <P>In the case of old age pensions the residence requirements are being eased under section 3 of the Bill.  The residence test in its present form requires that to qualify for a non-contributory old age pension a person must have lived in the State for an aggregate period of 15 years, at least five of them after attaining the age of 50.  Section 3 provides for the abolition of the requirement of five years' residence after age 50 so that an aggregate of 15 years at any time will now suffice.  A number of Irish people who have lived abroad, such as teachers, social workers, missionaries and the like, and who return home late in life have been prevented from qualifying for pension by the existing conditions and the provisions of section 3 will be of benefit mainly to such people.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides for the abolition of the condition requiring applicants for widows' non-contributory pension to have at least two years' residence in the State.  Application of the test has in some cases caused a delay in the award of pension resulting in the person concerned having to serve the required period before becoming entitled to pension.  The similiar residence condition in the case of deserted wife's allowance, social assistance allowance for unmarried mothers and prisoner's wife's allowance is being removed by appropriate changes in the relevant regulations.</P>
    <P>Another important problem for which provision is being made in section 16 of this Bill is the problem which arises where, on the death of a deserted wife, the father of the children does not resume responsibility for them.</P>
    <P>Cases have come to light where a woman in receipt of deserted wife's benefit or deserted wife's allowance dies and her children, for whom she had been receiving increases in her <Col N="937" /> benefit or allowance, are left with no income.  In such cases the deserted wife's benefit or allowance, including the increases for the children, ceases to be payable.  In some cases the father may return home following the death of the wife and resume his responsibilities in regard to his children.  In many cases, however, the whereabouts of the father of the children may be unknown, or he may be failing to support his family.  In these cases the children are effectively in the same position as orphans but, as the death of the father cannot be presumed, they do not qualify for orphan's non-contributory pension or orphan's contributory allowance.  To relieve hardship and to assist in keeping the children concerned out of institutions section 16 provides that these children will in future be treated as orphans and that orphans' pensions or allowances will be paid to a relative or some other suitable person so as to avoid the necessity of having to send the children to an institution.</P>
    <P>Last year provision was made that the increase in certain benefits payable to single men and widowers in respect of a woman looking after their children would be extended to single women, widows and deserted wives.  The benefits involved were unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit, injury benefit under the occupational injuries scheme and invalidity pension. Provision for a similar increase to single men and widowers is made under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which came into operation in July 1977 and section 13 of the Bill extends the provision to cover single women, widows and deserted wives who are in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Bill regularises an arrangement which has existed since 1973 whereby an old age pension may be paid on a provisional basis pending the formal decision of a pension committee where a social welfare officer is satisfied that the statutory conditions for receipt of the pension are fulfilled. In all cases the subsequent decision of the old age pension committee or appeals officer will supersede the provisional payment.  The making of a <Col N="938" /> provisional payment in this way overcomes the delay which can occur in obtaining decisions from pension committees and the consequent hardship to pensioners.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of existing legislation which I find iniquitous arises where a person has been in receipt of old age pension to which he was not entitled or at a higher rate than he was entitled to.  This could arise if, for example, the person did not disclose his means fully to an investigating officer.  Under existing legislation the amount overpaid may be recovered not only from the pensioner himself but it may be deducted from specified social welfare payments due to the spouse, widow or widower of the pensioner or, if any other person so consents, from payments due to that person.  Section 22 of the Bill abolishes the provision whereby recovery may be effected by deduction from benefits payable to other persons.  The effect of this will be to restrict the power of recovery to deduction from the pensioner himself or from his estate.</P>
    <P>I would now like to mention a number of improvements in social welfare services which are to be provided independently of this Bill.</P>
    <P>As announced in the budget, it is intended to arrange for the provision of bottled gas for certain pensioners though it does not require a specific provision in this Bill.  The free electricity scheme which was introduced in 1967 has been of considerable benefit to old age pensioners particularly in providing them with a reasonable standard of heating.  Unfortunately there are numbers of pensioners who cannot avail of the scheme, mainly persons in remote rural areas who are not yet connected to the ESB system.  We are therefore introducing a scheme of allowances for bottled gas which will be equivalent to the free electricity allowance.</P>
    <P>Also, as already announced, old age pensioners living alone will from April have the annual telephone rental charge fully paid for and this will be of considerable benefit to these people.</P>
    <P>Another serious problem relates to the provision of increases of social <Col N="939" /> welfare payments in respect of children where the parents are separated. At present, under the normal residence regulations no payments on the father's claim can be made to either parent where the children are residing with the mother.  I have recently amended these regulations to provide that, as from 1 April 1978, an increase of benefit, pension or assistance in respect of such children may be paid on the father's claim where the father is contributing substantially to the children. Once entitlement to payment is established it will be possible to exercise existing powers to make payment direct to the mother.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the overall cost of the improvements being provided for is £36.5 million in 1978.  Of this, social assistance accounts for over £16 million, all of which is borne by the Exchequer.  The total cost on the social insurance side is £20.44 million and this must be met out of the social insurance fund, which is financed by contributions from employers and employees with an annual subvention from the Exchequer.  On the basis of a 20 per cent Exchequer subvention the amount to be raised from contributions is £16.35 million.  To this must be added the sum of £10.4 million to cover mainly the full year cost of the October 1977 increases, making a total of £26.75 million to be raised from increased contributions.</P>
    <P>The cost of this year's improvements in the social services would require an increase of 82p in the ordinary rate of contribution, of which, on the usual two to one allocation, the employer would bear 55p and the employee 27p.</P>
    <P>To meet the additional £10.4 million, which I have referred to as representing mainly a &ldquo;carry-over&rdquo; from last year, the ordinary contribution has to be increased by a further 52p.  This will be shared 35p on the employer and 17p on the employee, bringing the increase of contribution to £1.34 broken down into 90p from the employer and 44p from the employee.</P>
    <P>The contribution for occupational injuries which is borne in full by the employer is being increased by 5p making <Col N="940" /> the employer's share of the increase 95p.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the provisions of the Health Contributions (Amendment) Bill, 1978, recently before the House, the health contribution, which is normally borne in full by the employee, will be increased by 11p bringing the employee's share of the increase to 55p. Accordingly, the total increase in the overall contribution will be £1.50 of which the employer will bear 95p and the employees 55p.</P>
    <P>Further special provision is being made for lower paid workers.  It will be remembered that in accordance with the Government's election manifesto, contribution rates were reduced from January 1978 by £1 a week for persons earning under £50 a week.  This measure has been of considerable benefit and in the Bill a further deduction of 50p is made from the contributions payable in respect of such employees.  The increase in respect of lower paid workers, accordingly, will not be £1.50 but rather £1.  Taking into account the existing £1 reduction, the contribution for lower paid workers will be £1.50 less than the full rate. This reduction is shared £1.16 to the employee and 34p to the employer.</P>
    <P>From 3 April next the total contribution, including social insurance, occupational injuries, health and redundancy will be £8.68 for men of which the employer will pay £5.26 and the employee £3.42.  The corresponding rate for a man earning less than £50 a week will be £7.18 of which the employer will pay £4.92 and the employee £2.26.</P>
    <P>The cost of the additional concession to lower paid workers is estimated at £4.25 million in 1978 which will be borne entirely by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I should also mention here that these rates include the special increase of 31p in the social insurance contribution introduced by my predecessor in 1975 which is being retained for a further 12 months to help meet the cost of the high level of unemployment claims still being experienced.</P>
    <P>The rates of voluntary contributions are being increased to £1.46 at the low <Col N="941" /> rate and £3.76 at the high rate&mdash;an increase of 26p and 66p respectively. The special voluntary contribution in respect of a certain category of insured persons affected by the abolition of the remuneration limit from April 1974, is being increased by 40p to £2.30.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that, despite the reductions we have made in the case of workers under £50 a week, the flat-rate contribution system is basically inequitable and I have already announced that a fully pay-related contributions system will be introduced from April 1979.  This will be a far more equitable arrangement and will substantially benefit lower-paid workers including a large number of women, and will be of particular assistance to labour-intensive industries.  I have recently received the report of the interdepartmental working group established to work out the administrative details and the legislative changes required and action will be taken immediately on these matters.</P>
    <P>I have now covered the areas of improvement provided for in this Bill. I think it will be agreed that even in a year when the Government's main effort had to be devoted to the solution of our economic problems, real advances are being made in the social welfare system and this process of development will go on.  Apart from the introduction of fully pay-related contributions, major developments are under consideration in the area of pensions and in relation to social insurance for the self-employed.  A detailed examination of the means tests operated by my Department has been carried out and I expect to be in a position in the near future to formulate proposals for the removal of anomalies in this area.</P>
    <P>My main concern now, however, is to ensure that the increases provided for in this Bill come into operation as planned from the beginning of April next and I, therefore, commend the Bill to Dáil Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there is a brand of detergent known as &ldquo;Three Hands&rdquo;.  When the package of legislation which the Minister for Health <Col N="942" /> and Social Welfare presented to the House last week and again this week is complete he will be in danger of being known as &ldquo;Three Hands Haughey&rdquo;.  Whatever he may have put into the pocket of social welfare recipients with one hand he took out of the other pocket with the health contribution last week and they will need to have a hip pocket so that he may remove the additional increases this week by way of social welfare contributions.</P>
      <P>Last week I said I was afraid the Minister was endeavouring to introduce his own budget.  I did not realise at the time that he was trying within a fortnight to introduce too many budgets. That is exactly what he has done. Last week the largest single annual increase was demanded for health contributions and this week the House is being asked to agree to a Bill that contains a provision for an increase that is double the level of last year's increase for the employee and is more than double last year's increase for the employer in respect of social welfare contributions.  This is being done at a time when employees are being urged to exercise moderation in their wage claims and employers are being urged to increase output and to reduce inflation.</P>
      <P>Is there anything less likely to encourage an employer to employ additional men than to tell a firm employing 100 people that their bill will be increased by £5,000?  There are a number of large employers throughout the country who employ 1,000 men. Is there anything less likely to encourage them to increase their work-force than to tell them that they will have to pay £50,000 extra per year in respect of social welfare contributions? That is what the employers are being told by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employee is being told that the Government want him to accept a wage increase of 8 per cent in order to reduce inflation, to bring about moderation and to restore sanity to the economy but, on the other hand, they tell him that they propose increasing his social welfare contribution by 18 per cent.  In addition they propose to increase his health contribution <Col N="943" /> by 28 per cent and he is supposed to sit back and like it.  This is being done at a time when he is asked to agree to an increase in his wages of only 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>Last November in the House the Minister introduced a regulation that had the effect of reducing the social welfare contribution by £1 per week for employees who were earning less than £50 per week.  The Minister heralded this measure as a real contribution to people on low incomes.  At columns 1321 and 1322 of the Official Report of 17 November 1977 I stated:</P>
    <P>I am surprised, too, to note that the change in the regulations is being introduced as and from January. Up to now any such change was always introduced either in March or in the autumn of the year concerned.  I wonder if the Minister is in a position to give an under-taking to the House that there would be no increase in Social Welfare contributions announced in the budget which also will be in January, an increase that might have the effect of negating the reduction we are talking of here.  The question we must ask is, how illusory is this scheme and how much more illusory will it be if there are upward changes in the January budget in respect of social welfare contributions?  Is the Minister in a position to guarantee to the people whom he alleges will benefit from this change that the benefit will continue to the same degree after the budget of 1978?</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly the Minister did not answer.  Incidentally, he could have given the guarantee because I asked if a guarantee would be given that no increase in social welfare contributions would be announced in the budget. I might have guessed that the increase would not be in the budget, that it would be done by sleight-of-hand, to quote the Minister's own words, &ldquo;in a petty, deceitful sort of way&rdquo; later on in the year.  What surprises me is the statement by the Minister at columns 1340 and 1341 of the Official Report of the same date. He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> It will become operative on the 2nd January and I hope that workers and their trade union representative will recognise it as a positive gesture, a contribution from the Government towards creating a climate in which the very crucial and important pay negotiations can take place.</P>
    <P>Three months later, when that discussion is still in our minds, we are being asked to agree to an increase of 28p per week in respect of workers earning less than £50 per week.</P>
    <P>Would it not have been more honest in November to have said to the lower paid workers earning less than £50 per week: &ldquo;We intend to reduce your social welfare stamp by 70p or 72p or whatever&rdquo;?  Surely it was deceitful to tell workers in November: &ldquo;We are honouring our election commitment; we are reducing the social welfare stamp for those earning less than £50 per week by £1, but three months later we will increase it by 28p&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a pay-related scheme in the last part of his speech.  If such a fair and equitable scheme could be introduced, and especially if it did not screw the middleman, or nail to the ground the unfortunate man in the middle income group who appears to have been the main sufferer, the straw in the wind which has been buffeted and tossed about on the sea of inflation over the past number of years, that scheme would meet with the wholehearted approval of my party.  It would be in keeping with our philosophy on the financing of health and social welfare.</P>
    <P>A social insurance scheme and, most important of all, a retirement scheme introduced in a fair and compassionate way for the self-employed, arising out of a report made to the Minister some time ago possibly with amendments, would also be in keeping with the philosophy which is very dear to the heart of my party and would meet with their unqualified support depending, of course, on the terms of those schemes when they are introduced.</P>
    <P>Both the reports to which the Minister referred were commissioned by the previous Government.  They are <Col N="945" /> of outstanding importance.  They could have the effect of revolutionising the approach to the financing of health and social welfare, eligibility and the range of benefits made available over a number of years.  I hope they will be introduced with the extreme care and with the maximum amount of forethought and consideration of their effect on all classes.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the very high cost of services I do not think a pay-related scheme can be introduced in which the contributor would be asked to pay the entire amount.  I do not think that would be acceptable to the man-in-the-street. It would be unfair and it would bear harshly on the middle-income groups, those who appear to pay for everything and seem to be getting little or nothing in return.  In the introduction of any such scheme, full consideration should be given to a cut-off point above which the contribution would not increase.  Fair and favourable consideration should be given to the ordinary worker.  I hope we will have an opportunity of discussing the proposed introduction of these schemes over the next 12 months.  I hope the House will approach this matter in a reasonable and non-contentious and dare I suggest possibly in a non-party political way.  The two suggestions in these reports are essential to the development of health and social security services over the next few decades.</P>
    <P>In a year in which everyone is being urged towards moderation, in a year in which employers are being asked to pay 90p more per week per employee and an additional 5p in respect of occupational injuries and the unfortunate employee is being asked to pay 55p more per week, the increases being levied on employers and employees are more than double the increases sought and granted by the Dáil last year, and vehemently opposed and criticised by the Minister's colleagues in Opposition, despite the fact that inflation, external factors and the level of wage agreements were all running at a much higher rate.  The level of increases last year was much nearer to the level of real increases in the cost of living than it will be this year <Col N="946" /> if the targets set by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for &ldquo;Economic Promises&rdquo; are attained.</P>
    <P>I am particularly upset that people earning less than £50 per week&mdash;and if I were in their position I might also have been attracted&mdash;were attracted by the offer made by the then Opposition of a reduction of £1 per week in their social welfare stamp. I presume they were attracted by that offer into voting for the Fianna Fáil Party and now they have had to witness the cynical action whereby they were granted a reduction of £1 from the beginning of January and they will have to pay back 28p of that from the beginning of April.</P>
    <P>Whether the Minister likes it or not &mdash;and I am sure he does not&mdash;there was an element in it of a three-card trick merchant: &ldquo;Now you see it, now you do not.  There is your £1.  We are taking more than a quarter of it back in a couple of months' time.  We honoured our election promise.  Do not say we did not.  We kept that promise even if only for a short time.&rdquo;  People on very low incomes and people on the verge of unemployment will not continue to have faith in democratic institutions when they witness such a cynical exercise.  As I said last week in my contribution on the budget, I do not think people who are on very low incomes or people who are unemployed for long periods should be manipulated in this cynical way.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the entire concept of this Bill in the same way as I am opposed to the concept of any percentage, across-the-board increase granted by any Government, irrespective of who are in power.  I do not think the right way to approach social welfare recipients, the way to keep recipients in line, the way to improve a lot of certain social welfare groups who are falling slowly behind, the poor who are getting poorer, is to adopt the lazy man's approach of saying: &ldquo;Let us give them X per cent across the board.&rdquo;  If blind pensioners living alone get a 10 per cent increase, what does it amount to?  Ten miserable pence.  They get £1 extra because they are blind and live alone.  You would not give ten miserable pence to a car <Col N="947" /> park attendant for minding your car while you went in to spend 50p to buy a packet of cigarettes.  You would be embarrassed, and you know what he would tell you.  Your car might not be there when you came back.  That is what was done by this concerned Government who were committed in their manifesto to keep social welfare beneficiaries at least in line with the increase in the cost of living.</P>

      <P>I will permit the Minister to interrupt as long as the Chair does not get upset if I interrupt him when he is replying.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the concept of a percentage increase across the board to social welfare beneficiaries at any time by any Government is the right way to approach this.  There is a large body of opinion that certain classes are obtaining too much through social welfare benefits.  Those people who must pay for a stamp every week object to what they term as the wasters and the fellows who hang around street corners getting such benefits.  I do not subscribe to or accept that idea. If we were put out of power partly because some people felt we had done too much for the social welfare classes, then it was a most honourable cause to be defeated on.  It is understandable to an extent that many people who are working and finding it difficult to make ends meet should be resentful of having to pay more in social welfare and health contributions in return for no real appreciable gains as far as they can see when they know of so many people who are obtaining unemployment benefit while at the same time are in gainful employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to accept the excuses put forward by various Ministers over recent years that it is not worth trying to catch the people who are abusing the system because it would cost more to catch them than would be saved in the benefits being paid out unfairly.  That is not the point.  The point is that the entire system is being brought into disrepute when a Minister for Social Welfare can make an <Col N="948" /> announcement in the House that he is asking employers and employees to make an extra contribution to the cost of the stamp.  It is no wonder that employees pay it grudgingly if they know of a number of neighbours who are earning more than they are by way of the combined income from unemployment benefit and the work they are doing which is not officially registered. For as long as that is allowed to continue people will become increasingly resentful of the social welfare code. Consequently, those really in need, the old, the widows and the deprived, those who are not organised and do not have an organised voice to speak on their behalf, those who are not pressure groups in a position to influence political parties enough to get them to make offers in the hope of winning their votes&mdash;all those people are made to suffer.</P>
    <P>There are thousands anxious to obtain gainful employment here and I believe a lot more gainful employment could be offered to them if those who are cheating the system, those who are earning £150 tax free and who break off on Thursdays to sign at their local labour exchanges, were stopped and put back to working properly.  A great number of additional jobs would then be available to those who are presently unemployed but are desperately seeking employment.  That would be a great contribution on the part of any Minister to an improvement of the social welfare system and a respect for it in the eyes of the general public.  It might not be the most realistic way for the Minister for &ldquo;Economic Promises&rdquo; and his colleagues to bring about a reduction in the number of unemployed but it is a good one.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in relation to a Bill like this is that virtually any amendment a Member wishes to introduce will be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Orders because every section of it involves the spending or the gathering of money.  To change the Bill in any way in order to improve it would involve a change in the financial structure which would lead to a charge or possible charge on State funds.  For that reason such amendments would be ruled out of <Col N="949" /> order.  I presume that the only amendments which would be acceptable would be those which would propose to reduce the level of benefits to certain classes.  I do not think any Member is likely to enter amendments of that type. It is a pity that Members are so hamstrung. They cannot make changes in the entire financial structure of the social welfare system by way of amendments which could be discussed here. For that reason I find that I am restricted in the contribution I can make.</P>
    <P>An across the board increase is a lazy man's approach to this matter. It is most unfair to old people, widows, deserted wives and so on.  An old person is not likely to benefit by the abolition of rates because for many years all local authorities operated a waiver of rates scheme and old age pensioners and widows in receipt of a small income qualified under that scheme.  It is unlikely that old people or widows run cars and, consequently, they did not benefit for the abolition of car tax.  It is almost certain that people at that end of the social welfare scale do not pay income tax so that the proposed increases in the rate of personal allowances will not help them.</P>
    <P>To suggest that they should be given a 10 per cent increase when people who are in gainful employment are to be given an 8 per cent increase is making them worse off relative to their colleagues in the work force.  On the calculations I have done based on an 8 per cent increase for workers it would have been necessary to have given social welfare recipients an increase of 15 per cent if they were to be kept in line with their equivalent in the work force.  As a result of the Minister's decision social welfare recipients will again fall behind.  While figures can be thrown out to justify the 10 per cent increase by the Minister I believe that the real effect of this will be that at the end of 12 months social welfare recipients will be poorer relative to the work force than they were at the outset.  From that point of view the Bill is a bad one.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters which militate against the disadvantaged. We are aware that the subsidy <Col N="950" /> on cheese has been abolished.  Subsidies such as that on cheese are introduced during times of inflation in support of the poorer sections of the community and whenever those subsidies on basic foodstuffs are reduced or abolished the poorer sections suffer most.  When foods subsidies are abolished, <i>in toto</i>, the man on £15 a week finds that it hits his pocket much harder than the man on £150 a week. I am afraid the abolition of the subsidy on cheese is the forerunner to the abolition of the remainder of the food subsidies right across the range of essential foodstuffs.  If that happens it will mean the social welfare classes will suffer most.  Consequently, I believe the concept of a 10 per cent across-the-board increase for our social welfare recipients is wrong and they will be put into a more disadvantageous position.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that provision was not made for an increase in the autumn, if it was seen to be necessary, to keep the rates of payment in line with the movement in the cost of living.  If the prognostications of the Government in relation to holding the cost of living come true it would not be necessary to implement the autumn increases.  If they do not come true or if it becomes apparent that the social welfare recipients are falling behind in relation to the rest of the community then, having made provisions for the autumn increases, it would at least have meant that there would be a second opportunity during 1978 of remedying the shortfall which I believe is contained in the existing Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>There are good aspects of this Bill and there are certain small changes from a financial point of view, with the exception of bringing single women into eligibility for payment of unemployment assistance, which may amount to a fairly large sum of money per annum.  I do not believe the other minor changes referred to by the Minister today or by the Minister for Finance in the budget will affect the cost of the operation of the social welfare system.  It is a good thing to have changed the residential qualification in respect of pensioners returning <Col N="951" /> from abroad before they can be eligible for pension here.  I am also in favour of the change which will relax the residential restrictions in relation to widows and deserted wives.  It is only realistic that the death grant be increased from £35 to £50.  It is certainly less than realistic to increase the maternity grant from an absurd £4 to an equally absurd £8.  If people can manage to have children as cheaply as that I believe the levels of unemployment might be higher than they are.</P>
    <P>All those things are very welcome. I especially welcome the idea of making payment available in respect of abandoned children where a mother who was a deserted wife dies and the father does not take charge of the children and a relative is prepared to look after them.  A ridiculous situation exists at present in the case of a mother and father who are separated.  If the children are not living with the father neither the father nor the mother receive an allowance in respect of those children.  I understand that the Minister intends to remove that ridiculous anomaly.</P>
    <P>Those things are very welcome but they do not go to the root of poverty. The cost of those changes is derisory in comparison with the entire cost of the services.  The one area where there will be increased expenses this year is in regard to the inclusion of single girls and women for eligibility for unemployment assistance.  That will only be from the autumn.  The Minister's excuse is that this will be a major task and it will take a number of months to implement it.  I do not accept that. Major changes were made during the last few years at shorter notice than this.  I am afraid the inclusion of those categories only in the autumn is merely a financial measure to soften the cost of the inclusion of those categories.</P>

I am sorry to say that no attempt has been made, in conjunction with those minor changes, to reduce further the qualifying age for the old age pension.  A concerted effort was made by the previous Government to bring down the age and it was brought down to the present level of 66 years. I am disappointed no effort has been made to reduce it further this year and to make a commitment to continue to reduce it, not only from the point of view of the benefit it would be to the people who would qualify but also as one of the methods which would help towards the contribution of further employment places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I believe, because of the great range of problems caused by the lack of employment we will have to tackle this matter from all angles.  It is not good enough for any Minister for Social Welfare to say that those are not really his problems, that they are matters for the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. The Minister for social Welfare will have to get involved in those matters.  When I suggest that the social welfare stamp should be abolished in respect of people under 21 years of age in order to stimulate employers to offer employment to young people, to give them job opportunities, and when I suggest that there should be a scaled social welfare stamp paid by people who do not work a full week to encourage employers to give part-time jobs to people when they have not got full 40-hour week jobs available, it is not good enough for the Minister for Social Welfare to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;They are not really social welfare matters, they are employment matters and they belong to my colleague.&rdquo;  He should be involved also.  He should suggest that apart from the help it would be to middle-aged people to see the qualifying age for old age pensions reduced it would also offer a real help <Col N="953" /> to the employment scene.  If people were encouraged to retire earlier, because of being eligible for a State pension, it would also make further jobs available.</P>
    <P>The Government in their election manifesto promised to keep all levels of social welfare payments to social welfare recipients at least in line with the cost of living.  As I understand it the Minister for Social Welfare is responsible for children's allowances.  As a social welfare measure children's allowances appear to be the most demonstrable area where the Government have broken their election promises. The Government promised to keep all social welfare payments in line with increases in the cost of living and yet nowhere in the budget speech and nowhere in the Social Welfare Bill are increases in the rate of payment for children's allowances announced.  If children's allowances are not going to be increased the Government have failed to honour their commitment to keep social welfare payments adjusted in line with cost of living increases.</P>
    <P>The Minister's colleagues confidently predicted a sharp fall in the level of unemployment.  I am surprised that that confidence is not echoed by the removal in the Social Welfare Bill of the temporary provision introduced some years ago whereby those in employment were asked to pay about 31p per week towards the cost of providing unemployment benefit for their colleagues who were not working.  This was introduced as a short-term measure for as long as the rates of unemployment were operating at an abnormally high rate.  The Minister's colleagues consistently are confidently predicted a sharp fall in unemployment during 1978 yet this Social Welfare Bill contains a provision extending for 1978 the payment by all employees of a special rate of contribution because of the exceptionally high rate of unemployment.  I do not understand how that can be continued if the promises given are to be honoured.</P>
    <P>There is also provision in the Bill for an increase in supplementary welfare allowances.  In page 4 of his speech the Minister said that</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> These increases will maintain the parity between the rates of supplementary welfare allowance and the rural rates of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy about the method in which the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme is being operated. This has been the subject of exchanges during Question Time and we might now take the opportunity to examine the scheme and how it is operating. Members of the House have said that the scheme is not operating equitably throughout the country, and that there appears to be confusion in the minds of recipients and operatives as to how the scheme ought to operate, as to who is eligible and as to the rates of eligibility and so on.  A flat ten per cent increase in supplementary welfare allowances as outlined in this Bill is not the way to approach this problem. Criticism has consistently been made, that a number of people entitled to payments under this scheme are not aware of their eligibility that some are paid a rate which is less than many people think it should be, and that they are not informed of their rights of appeal and that if they appeal the appeals authority are members of the same health board as the officer who refused to pay or paid the lower rate and that this is unfair.  The whole principle behind supplementary welfare allowances was that it should abolish the concept of the Victorian poor law and that people would be paid, as of right, a certain amount of money, if in the opinion of the welfare officer they needed that money to provide a decent basic standard of living for themselves and their dependants. Recently I received a letter from a person engaged in this field who asked that if that was the concept of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Act which is supposed to be in operation for some time, why do thousands of destitute people and their dependants have to request aid from charitable institutions so as to obtain shelter, clothing, food and occasionally finance?  He also asked why do destitute men and women have to beg in the streets for money for tickets to go into night shelters if the social <Col N="955" /> welfare supplementary allowances scheme is operating properly and why do the eight health boards not make provision for adequate financial funding of the scheme when compiling their annual budgets; why have officials from the Department never issued to the health boards sufficient detailed instructions as to how the scheme was to operate, and why has the Department not informed clerks in the labour exchanges that they should inform people who go there of their entitlements under the supplementary welfare scheme?  I know that in the last few weeks advertisements have been placed in the national press and sent to health centres around the country.  I hope that will improve the situation.  This Bill gives us an opportunity to look at how that scheme has been operating or, more correctly, how it appears not to have been operating in certain ways.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most telling question of all is that if the social welfare supplementary allowances scheme is to provide financial and other aid for people who have no income, who are not entitled to unemployment benefit or who are not entitled to unemployment assistance because they cannot really be described as being available for employment, why should hundreds of destitute and homeless men and women in Dublin and in other places have to exist on such a small rate per week?  The suggestion is that very often the officers administering this scheme appear to pay out less than the minimum that the scheme provides for.  I find that suggestion incomprehensible and I hope that the Minister will be in a position to say categorically that that suggestion is incorrect.  That suggestion has been made in documents submitted to the Minister.  After the people receiving less than the minimum provided for, have paid out the average charge of £7 per week for the Iveagh Hostel they are left with £3 or £4 a week on which to subsist.  They have that amount of money to feed and to clothe themselves and to keep themselves out of trouble during the hours in which they cannot get into the Iveagh Hostel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> The document goes on to suggest:</P>
    <P>Even the most elementary practice of hygiene is unattaintable and from 2 p.m. on Friday until noon on the following Monday these people are unable in the majority of cases to partake of even one full hot meal because the food centres, with one exception, are closed.  The exception is the Mendicity Institute but it can only cater for a small percentage of the poor.  A similar situation exists in most large cities and towns in Ireland.</P>
    <P>If there is any grain of truth in that suggestion from a social worker with several years' experience then the Supplementary Welfare Allowances Act designed to abolish the Victorian poor law concept is not working properly and the Minister should do something, and do it quickly, to repeal that Act and replace it with an Act that will work, an Act capable of implementation, properly financed and operated by expert trained personnel.</P>
    <P>There is need to examine into the categories requiring benefit, to look at those who are really poor and deprived. Some attempt should be made to define poverty and deprivation and an all-out effort should be made to discover how we can help.  It is not just a question of financial assistance. Education is involved and so is backup support.  Giving 10 per cent to the blind pensioner living alone is not the way to solve his problem.</P>
    <P>A group which is not getting a fair deal is that constituted of middle-aged single women.  Over 58 years these women may qualify for a hopelessly inadequate allowance.  They may have spent the best years of their lives looking after parents or helping to rear younger brothers or sisters.  They are untrained.  They have little or no prospect of marriage and possibly no income.  Until recently they got no help whatsoever.  They now receive a pittance.  I regularly get letters from these middle-aged women.  They feel they have been by-passed and ignored. They are not organised and they have no political muscle wherewith to bribe political parties into making attractive electoral offers to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> A change in the fabric of social welfare is required.  Better education is needed as are more workers in the field.  If a worth-while effort is not made now then whoever stands here will have the right&mdash;it is not a nice right to have&mdash;to come in and criticise and object to the lazy man's concept of giving an across-the-board increase in social welfare.</P>
    <P>To summarise, I am unhappy with the size of the increase from both the employer and the employee in regard to the social welfare stamp.  I am opposed to it.  I am opposed to the concept of an across-the-board increase because it is the lazy man's approach and it militates against the poorest of social welfare recipients.  I am against the 10 per cent increase in the light of current percentages.  I believe it should be 15 per cent if we really want it to hold the position of social welfare recipients relative to that of the rest of the community.  I am disappointed as the lack of an autumn increase because such an increase may well be necessary.  I am disappointed that we are not really doing anything as a christian-caring community to improve the lot of social welfare recipients. This Bill does nothing more than make an inadequate attempt to hold the position relative to the better-off sections of the community.  For that reason I am bitterly disappointed with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important in a debate like this to be guided in our observations, opinions and criticisms by some kind of philosophy, some idea as to what these benefits and allowances are about, and what they are meant to achieve and how.  I should like now to outline briefly my philosophy on this Bill from the point of view of the principles and the objectives guiding that philosophy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In developing a proper social welfare system we should be guided by four basic principles: planning for social development, the rights of social welfare recipients, State responsibility in financing and administering a social welfare system and equality for all recipients.  I was not given an opportunity on an earlier occasion to discuss these and so I should like to say something <Col N="958" /> about them today in order to underline the provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no use having principles without a final objective or a goal towards which to direct our efforts.  The goal I would set is that of securing for all recipients a basic standard of living in terms of income and services and the elimination once and for all of the dire poverty that exists.  It is against these this Bill must be measured.  How far does it go along the road to the elimination of poverty?  How far does it go in providing a decent standard of living for the underprivileged, the elderly, the infirm, the disabled, the deserted wife, the orphan?  How far does it advance social justice?  These are the questions that must be asked. Are we really a Christian society catering adequately for the disadvantaged? Here we are debating the amount we say we must provide.  Are we able to do enough for them?  Are we doing enough?  Will this 10 per cent increase go any distance along the road to helping these people?</P>
    <P>The Minister in the budget debate put the cost of these benefits for a full year at £55 million.  The Minister for Finance put the cost for a full year at £33 million.  I find it difficult to understand the discrepancy.  The Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>The social welfare measures which I have announced will cost the Exchequer £21 million in 1978 and £33.2 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the total costs of these social welfare measures will be £38 million in 1978 and £55 million in a full year.  Perhaps the Minister for Social Welfare would explain this discrepancy which has me somewhat baffled.  Assuming the £55 million announced by the Minister for Social Welfare, how far does it go towards improving the lot of social welfare recipients?  According to the Economic and Social Research Institute the projected inflation rate for 1978 is 8 per cent.  So, of the £55 million increase, £44 million is required to cover the expected rate of inflation in 1978, leaving us with a mere £10 million for the real increase which is just over 1 per cent.  If you spread that across the 900,000 recipients of social welfare <Col N="959" /> benefits and allowances it represents a real increase of £11 per head per annum.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get bogged down in statistical arguments on this 10 per cent increase but I want to focus the attention of the Dáil on the scale of social welfare increases embodied in this Bill.  The increase will give just over 1 per cent.  We should ask ourselves if this is sufficient, given the extent of the problem faced by our society.  My argument is that it is grossly inadequate in the face of the massive need of the underprivileged and constitutes a clear indictment of our priorities as a nation.  In that regard it is appropriate to quote a passage from the pastoral letter of the Irish bishops on the working of justice and social justice.  They said that if we are to assure basic human rights to everyone, quite deliberately we shall have to discriminate in favour of the poor.  A real transfer of money and opportunity must be made by the better-off sections of society to the poorer groups if the latter are to be raised to minimum standards of human dignity and if we are to lay claim to being a just and a Christian society.  In the light of that, can we honestly say that this Bill discriminates in favour of the poor and underprivileged in our society?  Does it involve a real transfer of money from the better-off sections to the poorer groups?  Can we claim to be a Christian society in what we are doing?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>The benefits in the recent budget were distributed in proportion to wealth, not to need.  The 5,000 liable for wealth tax get an extra £2,000 per head.  A family of four earning £10,000 a year get an extra £1,000.  An average family on an average wage prior to the 8 per cent wage agreement will get an extra £600 per year.  The widow, the deserted wife, and the unmarried mother on social welfare get an extra £70 per year.  A family of four on employment benefit get an extra £250 a year while a family of four on unemployment assistance will get an extra £2.60 a week.  The disparity is very obvious.  Before clapping ourselves on the back for these increases we should consider these facts and say <Col N="960" /> quite categorically that the 10 per cent increase is not enough.</P>
    <P>I do not want to knock these increases or what is being done here with the 10 per cent without offering some constructive suggestions.  I do not wish to be critical just for the sake of being critical; that would be grossly unfair and it would not serve any purpose here to do that.  Poverty has been with us through successive governments. When we were in office we did not do enough; there is no use in being dishonest about it.  A whole new approach and commitment is needed. I spoke earlier about planning for social development but with all the talk about economic planning there has been too little talk of social planning.  We must ensure that economic planning goes hand in hand with the establishment of goals and targets for social services and allocation of finances to help these people. Social welfare policy must mean more than annual increases just to keep in line with inflation.  It must embody a commitment to the elimination of poverty through the redistribution of wealth.  This is the only way we can have any proper social policy.</P>
    <P>I think we should have a five-year plan for a social welfare system and that this should be established forth-with laying down priorities and objectives. It should have two dimensions. There should be statutory linkage of all social welfare benefits to the cost of living.  We must take the whole issue of increases to meet inflation out of the realm of party politics.  We have this disgraceful charade each year of governments coming here clapping themselves on the back for increases in line with inflation.  This is absurd and should be abolished.  This is the absolute minimum that any self-respecting government should provide; it represents no real advance in social welfare services.  It is merely running to stand still.  No political capital should be allowed to be made about such increases.  These should be automatically computed on the basis of the CPI and should be administered by the civil service at six monthly intervals.  That is the first dimension and that should be done without any government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> The second dimension of the five-year plan would be an agreed proportion of the gross national product added to the social welfare increases over and above inflation to provide for a significant expansion of our social welfare services.  This is the only way we can achieve anything in social services.  The White Paper predicts an increase in gross national product of 7 per cent in 1978.  A significant slice of that should be allocated to our social welfare services over and above increases to cope with inflation.  This sort of policy would represent a commitment to transfer wealth to the poorer sections of the community and this is what social welfare planning should be about. This is what the Bishops are talking about, positive discrimination in favour of the poor.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Fianance in his budget statement said he was satisfied that social welfare recipients should participate in the prospective growth in the wealth of the community generally. If he would accept the principle of planning for the social dimension.  I think this would be achieved, first, by statutory linkage of social benefits to inflation and secondly, by earmarking a proportion of the growth in gross national product for the expansion of social welfare services.  I appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare to take this case to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, and quote Deputy Colley's words from the budget speech and insist that as the figures for economic growth in 1978 begin to come in, an October increase will be introduced to ensure that social welfare recipients will participate in the growth in wealth of the community generally.  This is what would be needed in the October budget.</P>
    <P>Before ending my general observations on the 10 per cent increase I wish to make one more suggestion to the Minister, that he consider a minimum income for every household, this to be linked to the CPI.  This should be a right for every household.  At the moment the patchwork of benefits, allowances and pensions leaves too many gaps in coverage that the present system is unable to plug.</P>
    <P>This bits and pieces approach to the <Col N="962" /> whole social services policy since the beginning of the State has made no impact on the problem of poverty and it is time something new was established. That is why I am suggesting that there be a guaranteed minimum income for every household.  This could be a very effective anti-poverty measure and could be considered in the context of the National Economic and Social Council report.</P>
    <P>It spoke about an integrated approach to personal income taxes and transfers.  It proposed a system whereby the tax and social welfare bureaucracy would be harmonised. This would simplify the whole range of transfers of income between the citizen and the State.  This good idea should be discussed and the Minister should not delay too long before bringing this report before the House for discussion.</P>
    <P>The report also calls for a guaranteed minimum income.  This involves a payment to everyone in the State as of right, the amount varying according to age, whether one is an employee or self-employed and a payment for each child in the family.  This guaranteed minimum income could have a real effect on the problem of poverty and would help to eliminate this abominable system of taxing social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>People at the bottom of the social welfare scale are obliged to pay tax. This is abominable and certainly inequitable because the State is giving with one hand and taking away with the other and hiring an army of civil servants to administer this crazy system.  The harmonisation of the income tax and social welfare systems could reduce enormously, in administrative terms, the cost of running two separate Departments which in many cases are running at cross-purposes.  I would ask the Minister to champion at Cabinet level some form of minimum guaranteed income linked to the cost of living.  This whole topic of guaranteed minimum income is germane to this Bill, especially the reference in section 17 which increases the rates of contribution for the employer and <Col N="963" /> the employee to the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>Another point mentioned is the question of extending the grant and tax scheme, widening the tax base to include all farmers and self-employed. This would be a major blow not only for tax equality but it would reduce the burden on the PAYE worker and the employer who together have absorbed most of the cost of the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>As we all know, the cost of the stamp has risen by nearly 150 per cent in the last four years and that is not an insignificant amount.  Whether we like to admit it or not, the social welfare contribution is a social welfare tax and accounts for almost one-third of the total taxes on personal income. In spite of the fact that the yield from income tax has been increasing over the years we are inclined to pay very little attention to it as a tax on personal income.  In my opinion this is because social welfare contributions are considered in the Social Welfare Bill rather than in the budget.  In all other countries the insurance contributions are considered a form of tax first, because they are compulsory and second, because they are non-refundable and do not give rise to benefits in relation to the contribution made.</P>
    <P>The increase of £1.34 is to be regretted. I am not saying the Minister is not following his predecessors by increasing this amount.  I noticed that in 1974 there was a 26.4 per cent increase, a 43.2 per cent increase in 1975, a 37.5 per cent increase in 1976, an 11 per cent increase in 1977 and now a 21 per cent increase.  Both Governments were guilty of increasing this contribution.  The Coalition Minister for Finance on 15 January 1975 at column 224 of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>The Exchequer share of income maintenance expenditure here is over 60 per cent, which is abnormally high by western European standards.  One of the main explanations for this is that employers and employees together contribute a far <Col N="964" /> lower proportion than is normal elsewhere of the cost of the social insurance element in this expenditure. The Government have there-fore decided in principle to transfer the Exchequer contribution towards the cost of social insurance to the other contributors to the social insurance fund over a period of six years or so.  This will have the effect of bringing the Exchequer's overall share of income maintenance expenditure more into line with practice in other EEC countries and of making the social insurance fund more self-financing.</P>
    <P>This Government are following exactly the practice of their predecessors. Deputy Boland should examine what the Coalition Minister for Finance said&mdash;that it was the intention of the Government to reduce progressively the Government contribution to the social insurance fund so that over six years it would be self-supporting and the Government would not have to pay anything towards it.  He also said that that was in line with EEC policy. At that time I was amazed to hear that and wondered if this EEC policy was imposed on the Government.</P>
    <P>I consider this a penal tax on workers already suffering the gross injustice of the PAYE system.  I am being objective.  I opposed these increases then and I oppose this increase now. This is a disincentive to employers. If we are to encourage more employment we should be giving employers incentives to employ more people.  I proposed to the Coalition, and I propose it again now, that we abolish the social insurance stamp for those between the ages of 16 and 21&mdash;let the State pay for it; it would be an incentive to employers to take on young people&mdash;but my proposal was ignored. I am asking the Minister to consider it now.  I do not want to shift the burden on to the employer and the employee and make the social insurance fund self-supporting.</P>
    <P>I noticed that the Exchequer contributions dropped from 30 per cent in 1973-74 to 19 per cent in 1977.  In my view we should not do things simply because that is the trend in the EEC countries.  They do not have <Col N="965" /> tax and social insurance systems like ours.  They do not have so many farmers and self-employed, in other words so much wealth, outside the system.  With the exception of Italy, we are the only EEC country with such a high percentage of self-employed. This means the insurance system falls on a small proportion of our society. In no other country is nearly one-third of the personal income in the State outside the social insurance scheme.  In this country the burden inevitably falls on those who pay PAYE.  The base for the social welfare contributions is too narrow and there is a basic injustice as a result.  The benefits for insured persons are financed by their own and employers' contributions, but the financing of benefits for the self-employed is spread over all sections of the community. Insured persons and their employers finance a major proportion of the cost of social assistance for the self-employed who finance only a minor proportion of the cost of benefits for the insured workers.  The widening of the social insurance base to include the self-employed would make for a much more equitable system because then the self-employed would be contributing directly to the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for a review of the Exchequer's level of contribution to the social insurance fund, and I suggest to the Minister that pending the introduction of a pay-related scheme he might consider asking his colleagues in the Cabinet, as a temporary measure, that the Exchequer increase significantly its proportion to the social insurance fund.  This would help to provide some incentive to employers to take on more workers, particularly in the labour-intensive industries.</P>
    <P>There are a few points I wish to make on section 17.  There is the case of the employer who does not stamp his employees' cards and either refuses or is unavailable to make a statement to the Department.  I have knowledge of a number of cases where benefits for employees are being held up pending statements by the employers.  I suggest that in such cases the State is shirking its responsibility.  The Social <Col N="966" /> Welfare Acts provide that the State assume responsibility for paying an employee in a situation like that, but unfortunately what we legislate for and what is done in practice are two different matters.  At the moment I am aware of a case of a company going into liquidation and the employees have been waiting about four months for their benefits.  They cannot ascertain whether their cards have been stamped.  This is a serious matter. It is provided in the Social Welfare Acts that the State sue the employer and pay the employee directly, but this has not been done.</P>
    <P>The present situation whereby an employee can ascertain whether his cards have been stamped is unsatisfactory and inadequate.  He can go to the employer and check once a month, but if an employee pesters an employer he is liable to be dismissed. I suggest that the Department should register all employees under their insurance numbers and ensure that their cards are up to date by a check at six monthly intervals.  Where an employee is not in benefit according to the computer, the State could take action against the employer.  Such a system is long overdue and I would ask the Minister to remedy a situation that has been causing a lot of hardship.</P>
    <P>Section 17 also deals with what I call the 31 per cent unemployment surcharge.  Is it intended that this will be a permanent feature of the social welfare code?  I did not like it in the first place because I do not think that the employed should be burdened to provide benefits for the unemployed. I ask the Minister to comment on this. It is not his fault because he inherited it, but he is perpetuating it and I should like him to indicate when it will be stopped.</P>
    <P>On the question of contributions for part-time work, would the Minister consider a proportionate reduction in the cost of stamps for work undertaken on a part-time basis?  This needs to be looked at seriously.  I wish to comment on the increased rate of the employment contribution.  I should prefer to see this in the budget, if possible, because I consider it to be a form of taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" /> I turn my attention now to section 4 dealing with unemployment assistance. More and more people are unemployed for longer periods and are moving from unemployment benefit to unemployment assistance, a much lower rate and subject to a strict means test on savings, value of board and lodgings and so on.  The insurance stamp provides cover for only 15 months of unemployment, and at present more than one-third of males on the unemployment register have been unemployed for more than a year, and half have been unemployed for more than six months.  The result is an increasing transfer of people from benefit to assistance.</P>
    <P>Figures released by Mr. Murray of the National Social Service Council show that in the period October 1976 to October 1977 the numbers receiving benefit dropped by more than 9,000 and the numbers on assistance went up by 4,000.  In previous years there were more people on benefit than assistance, but in 1977 the pattern changed.  Of those who received payments in 1976, 45 per cent were on assistance, but by October 1977 the figure had jumped to 52 per cent on assistance.  Therefore, when we include dependants we can say that 110,000 people here are living on assistance and this, at the princely sum of £25 per week for husband, wife and two children will give some indication of the extent of the poverty there is.  Because of the outrageous number who are living at or below poverty level it is urgent that the Minister would review the shifting pattern in relation to the unemployed.  Because of our massive unemployment people are staying on the register for two years or more.  In the circumstances I suggest that the Minister publish monthly returns of payments so that we can gauge the trend.</P>
    <P>The NSSC and Mr. Murray deserve thanks for alerting us to the developments in this respect, shattering the myth that the unemployed are living in the lap of luxury.  In fact far too many of them are living in poverty. It is a shame that the Press did not devote as much space to the figures <Col N="968" /> presented by Mr. Murray as to the unfounded allegations in regard to social welfare abuses and fraud.  I refer to the figure of £2.5 million mentioned by the Minister and repeated at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis as the figure to be saved by elimination of social welfare fraud. I suggest that the Minister should indicate how that figure was arrived at, because £2.5 million is a precise figure and it should be backed up by precise evidence.  The topic is too emotive to be bandied about lightly.  I should like to remind the Minister that between 1973 and 1975 criminal prosecutions for the failure of employers to stamp cards outnumbered offences relating to payment of unemployment benefit and assistance by roughly eight to one.</P>
    <P>One of the problems regarding section 4 and unemployment assistance is the means test.  It is overly restrictive. I ask the Minister earnestly to consider a man of say 18, 19 or 20 years living at home who, by virtue of family income, is deprived of unemployment assistance.  The Minister knows of such cases.  It is grossly unfair that a man of 18 or 19 cannot obtain any unemployment assistance where the means of the household are above the limit.  He is a man in his own right, and the Minister, as Minister for Health, recognises this right in that he will give that man a medical card and disregard the means of the household. He says that that man is entitled to a medical card in his own right.  But, as Minister for Social Welfare, he says: &ldquo;No, I will not recognise that he is a man in his own right.  He is not eligible for social welfare assistance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why this anomaly exists.  You may say that the man can move out.  He can, but where will he live?  He could qualify if he moved out and went into some hostel. There are many cases of this kind where people are suffering serious hardship.  It is not that they do not want jobs.  They cannot get them at the moment, although things will improve. These people are living like parasites on their families, and it is demoralising for a man not to have some means of his own.  We should review this.  There have been cases of people going to collect unemployment <Col N="969" /> assistance and receiving the princely sum of 10p and that is not an exaggeration. I have come across such cases. The Minister sees more of them than I do and he knows what I am talking about.  Students over the age of 16 are considered to be men in their own right and qualify for a medical card, but when it comes to unemployment assistance there is absurdity.</P>
    <P>One principle which should guide social welfare assistance is that of equality for all social welfare recipients under the law.  Section 5 of the Bill abolishes discrimination in social welfare assistance against single women and widows.  That deserves the highest praise, and I congratulate the Minister on it.  It was a bold innovatory move on his part and he has my gratitude for it.  I have spoken about this matter for years.  I would not agree with what his colleague in Government said on the question of income tax and women, but I must acknowledge the major moves being made by the Minister in this respect.  This is a very important advance in the cause of rights for women.</P>
    <P>The measures in this Bill abolishing some of the awkward residency requirements for old age pensioners and widows is good and must be welcomed as an effort to expand people's access to benefits.  I would like to refer to section 7 and widows' pensions.  There is a condition in relation to this that unless a claim is made within three months the widow will not qualify for back payment.  It is a small issue, but in the light of what happens in a bereavement this three months qualification is rather restrictive.  When a woman loses her husband she suffers a tragic loss.  There is inconvenience, bereavement and sadness.  Very often she does not realise what is happening and is late in applying.  She does not even think of it at the time.  I ask the Minister to eliminate that restrictive clause.  The State would not lose anything by this and it would help people. I think the Minister will look at this, but I am bringing it to his attention.</P>
    <P>I want to mention social welfare entitlements.  For too long these have been stigmatised as the hand-outs of a benevolent State.  I believe in people's <Col N="970" /> rights in this.  We must eliminate once and for all this question of political patronage or the fact that these benefits seem to be obtained only through access to a TD and so on.  If we are to be self-respecting members of the community as TDs we must eliminate that.  The purpose of the Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Act was to eliminate these charitable hand-outs.  The intent was to recognise for the first time that the recipients had a right to social welfare payments, and an appeals machinery was to be established to defend this right.  The old poor law mentality to which Deputy Boland referred and the home assistance scheme were to be declared dead.</P>
    <P>It sometimes happens with progressive legislation passed in this House that entitlements on paper are not necessarily those which work out in practice.  Section 12 of this Bill is concerned with supplementary welfare allowances.  When the Act was passed in 1975 it was estimated that over 30,000 people would qualify, but the statistics released by the Minister to me in reply to a parliamentary question last December revealed that only 14,000 people qualified and they received an average of only £6 a week. These are the people most in need of help.  This is not the performance we were expecting from this so-called fire brigade of a social welfare system.  This was to be a measure to provide some kind of barrier against poverty, but the small number of people qualifying and the small payments being made showed that the scheme simply is not working, and certainly not as envisaged when we passed the Bill three years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that adequate information is available to anyone who wishes to obtain it.  This is not the correct approach.  People should be told of their rights.  The Department should not adopt the attitude of &ldquo;information only on request&rdquo;.  There is need for a full-blooded publicity drive to get this scheme on its feet.  The Minister has said he has the training facilities and the needs of the community welfare officers under review. I hope he has them under rigorous review, because complaints <Col N="971" /> are mounting about the way in which the scheme is being run.  I ask the Minister if he will give some indication of the average length of time it takes to process a claim on the supplementary allowance scheme.  Just a week ago I had a case of a family who were impoverished and had literally nothing. They were three weeks waiting and there was still no money coming.  That is a long time to have to wait when you have no money.  The Minister has introduced this fire brigade measure on the question of pensions, and it is wonderful, but some way of speeding up the process of providing emergency funds for people in need must be examined very urgently.</P>
    <P>The whole fate of this effort lies in the hands of those first-point-of-contact officials who administer the scheme.  But there is a need for the urgent training of these persons.  The poor law mentality still applies, but it must be got rid of.  I had occasion to explain the scheme to a person in need who came to see me and who knew nothing about the scheme.  Regardless of whether the personnel are called community welfare officers, home assistance officers or anything else, they are acting with the same type of mentality as that which was applied to the operation of the home assistance scheme.  The application forms in respect of this scheme are quite complicated.  Indeed, I had some difficulty in filling one for somebody who had sought my help in that regard. Perhaps the Minister would make an effort to have the forms simplified.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that these officers are expected to inform applicants of their right to appeal, to inform them of how their means are assessed and to give reasons in the event of an application being refused, but he did not say that this is being done on a regular basis in each health board area throughout the country.  This is the kind of thing we must know about.</P>
    <P>There remains the question of appeals machinery.  Informal appeals, though time saving, can dilute seriously an applicant's right under the Act.  We must know how appeals are being conducted, whether they are on a consistent <Col N="972" /> basis in every health board area and whether it is the intention to introduce a more formal appeals system.  We must keep in mind always the question of discretionary powers in an area such as this.  Such powers can be and have been abused.  The provision in the Act for non-financial aid &mdash;aid such as essential furniture, clothing and food&mdash;is non-existent so far as many health board areas are concerned.  That is another matter that the Minister might look into.</P>
    <P>There are persistent allegations that community welfare officers are not making an attempt to ascertain the real needs of the individual as required by the Act.  I am aware that the Minister is moving on the scheme and that already he has made an attempt to rationalise it, but there are big problems remaining still.</P>
    <P>I should like to finish my contribution with a few remarks on our attitude to the problem of poverty, the elimination of which must be a fundamental objective of our social welfare service.  In this context I quote the Minister who, while speaking on a Supplementary Estimate for his Department said, as reported at column 649 of the Official Report of 1 December 1977:</P>
    <P>We would all like to think that such a situation could be brought about.  It is our ultimate objective to eliminate the last vestige of poverty from our society, but whether that can be achieved in a modern community is a question to which different people will give different answers... human frailty will always be with us.</P>
    <P>I should like to contrast that with the view put forward in a pastoral letter from the Irish bishops.  They said that in a society aspiring to be Christian it should be a consistent aim of social policy to work steadily towards the reduction and the ultimate elimination of poverty.  They said that the virtual elimination of poverty is not beyond our capacity even during the present recession and that the causes which generate poverty can be identified, foreseen, often checked and prevented.  They are quite positive in <Col N="973" /> their thinking.  It is not enough to say that the poor will always be with us.  Without wishing to be arrogant, I caution the Minister against becoming resigned to the existence of poverty. We must be determined to eliminate poverty and to say that it can and will be eliminated.  Half-hearted efforts will not work.  We must continue the battle against poverty.  Our efforts in this sphere are a test of our political will and of our claim to being a Christian society.  There should be no compromise.  I ask the Minister to bear this philosophy in mind.</P>
    <P>There is one last point that I wish to put to the Minister by way of suggestion. This relates to a considerable number of people who are in receipt of social welfare disability benefit but who, perhaps, should not be in receipt of this benefit.  When these people are declared fit by medical referees considerable trauma can result.  Much of their illness is psycho-genic in origin. I appreciate that the scheme is costing the State a lot of money but perhaps, in an effort to solve the problem to which I have referred and with a view to redistributing the money in a better way, the Minister would provide that where these people are declared fit after being out of work for a long time, they could transfer to the social welfare supplementary allowances system for a number of weeks in order to give them the opportunity to readjust.  Perhaps I am looking for something that is unorthodox or that is even illegal, but if the system could be changed in the way I suggest it would be of enormous benefit to the people concerned.  In addition, it would help the Department of Social Welfare and would make more money available for distribution to those in need.</P>
    <P>Another point I must not omit to refer to is that of married women being declared ineligible for unemployment benefit.  I interpret the reason for this to be that a woman has a child.  This provision represents gross discrimination against the people concerned, especially in modern life when there are available creches or a woman's mother or somebody else to mind children.  We must eliminate <Col N="974" /> this discrimination.  There is no provision for appeal in the Social Welfare Act of 1952 against the decision of an appeals officer.  The Minister has no power in this area but there is need to amend the Act as it is causing gross injustice.</P>
    <P>It is not my wish to appear to be critical for the sake of being critical. My criticism is offered by way of constructive suggestions.  A suggestion the Minister might consider in relation to this question of married women and unemployment benefit is that the applicants for benefit would have to produce proof of having sought employment&mdash;for example, letters from people from whom the women had sought work.  I do not know whether the Minister would have the power to make this suggestion but something should be done to rectify the situation as it is.</P>

      <P>I had not intended speaking on this Bill because it is important that it go through quickly. However, I shall not detain the House very long.  I have listened to the speeches so far because I am very interested in social welfare.  I congratulate the Minister on his brief.  He has forgotten nobody in this Bill.  The speeches from both Opposition parties were constructive, particularly the speech from Deputy O'Connell for whom I have the greatest respect.  He is a man with a great social conscience.</P>
      <P>We have had here today the sort of debate that is desirable&mdash;giving credit where credit is due and offering constructive criticism where such is considered necessary.  I, too, wish to give all the credit that is due in so far as the system goes but there are a few points on which I may be critical.  The Minister has a social conscience and because of that I am confident that he will give sympathetic consideration to the points we raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say first that I disagree totally with a system which provides for percentage increases for any group, but it is rather strange that the Opposition are complaining about percentage increases in social welfare because all wage agreements are negotiated on a percentage basis which gives greater amounts of money to those in the <Col N="975" /> higher income groups.  I am against percentage increases because the lower income groups receive least.  I am consistent in my view on this matter.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  If one criticises percentage increases in social welfare, one must also consider that percentage increases should not be given under national wage agreements.  If the increases were given on a different system some people would fare better.</P>
    <P>Various increases in old age pensions have been given by various Governments but the income limit for receipt of an old age pension has not been changed.  To qualify for a full old age non-contributory pension the limit for a single person is £6 and for a married couple it is £12.  This is wrong, and it would be impossible to live on such sums.  The increases which have been given are quite good but the Minister should take a look at the income limits.  There is no better man to do this than the present Minister. A single person who has more than £15 per week cannot get an old age pension.  Who could live on that? It is not realistic in 1978.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention another sore point.  I do not know if the Minister will come around to my point of view but if I continue talking somebody may give me a hearing.  I had been pressing the Minister's predecessor in regard to the allowance for the care of the aged.  This has now been increased, and I congratulate the Minister. However, it is completely unfair that if the person being cared for is a relative an allowance is not payable if there is anyone living in the house other than the person caring for that relative.  I have raised this point many times before and it is on the record of the House.  A young woman may be caring for an aged relative and keeping him out of an institution but she will not qualify for an allowance if her husband lives in the house.  It appears that there must be only one physically fit person in the house and that person must be minding the aged relative.  In order to qualify for the allowance there must not be another physically fit person in the house.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> A very attractive young girl came to me recently and complained bitterly that her husband had lost the allowance which he had been receiving for caring for his father.  I told her that her husband had a choice to make.  I said: &ldquo;He has either to do without the allowance or do without you, and I would choose you any day.&rdquo;  As soon as this man got married he lost the allowance because there was a second person in the house and the person for whom he was caring was a relative. I believe there would be fewer people in homes and institutions if a reasonable amount of money was paid, irrespective of whether they are relatives or not.  Anyone who takes in a person from the street will be paid provided that person is not a relative. I would ask the Minister to consider this very carefully.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about this Government doing away with the entitlement of farmers to social welfare. This is certainly not so.  Deputy O'Connell said he did not want to consider that the poor will be always with us.  Farmers with the type of valuation mentioned here will always be with us because unless they can get land they cannot make a living.  There are no increases for anybody with a valuation in excess of £15.  They are still on the notional system but there is no social welfare increase.  I do not know anybody who wants to be on social welfare.  Farmers would prefer to get good incentives to improve their land rather than social welfare benefits. People with valuations between £15 and £20 now find it very hard to get any social welfare.  Many people think that farmers who get social welfare go into the pub and spend it on drink.  That is not so.  If they have a few bob left they put it back into their farms in order to increase production. I am disappointed that the people who are losing social welfare are not getting incentives from another Department. We will talk about that on the Estimate. I do not like to hear it said that people who are drawing assistance are spending it in bars.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the fact that single women will now get unemployment assistance.  I should like <Col N="977" /> to draw the attention of the Minister, as Deputy O'Connell has done, to the case of a person living with a brother who is fairly well off.  The means of that person are taken into account in assessing eligibility for unemployment assistance but are not taken into account with regard to medical care. Some of these people get nothing but abuse from those with whom they are living and they are in the terrible position of not getting unemployment assistance because they are part of a family.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at this.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House because I understand it is absolutely important that this Bill should go through quickly.  I congratulate the Minister on having a social conscience and I bring to his notice the points on which he could go further&mdash;as I know he will&mdash;to eliminate unfair rules against people in regard to old age pensions and social welfare.  I would ask him to consider seriously raising the income for receipt of the old age pension and doing away with the rules regarding the relatives' allowance.  A decent allowance should be paid to keep aged people at home where they want to be and where they want to die and I assure the Minister that he would gain money.  I said this to the previous Minister and I will take a gamble on it.  I congratulate the Minister on what I consider to be a very good Bill.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasure to follow Deputy Callanan, who appears to be the social conscience of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I say that sincerely, not lightly, just in case Deputy Callanan might think I would say something derogatory.  This is another mini-budget.  In the budget the Government said the people would get a 10 per cent increase but they should spell out quite clearly where the money will come from.  If we want to spend additional moneys they must be raised in some way.  That is a matter for the Minister for Finance but apparently he does not like delivering the <i>coup de grâce.</i>  He does not like to tell the bad news.  Apparently he wants to leave that to the Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  It appears that the <Col N="978" /> Minister for Finance and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development are out to make life uncomfortable for the Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  I did not blame the Minister for not going on television the other night.  He was quite right. Why should he have to face criticism for the increases when he was not responsible for them?  Quite rightly he put in the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to answer the criticism.  The Minister for Health and Social Welfare said it was not his business to deliver bad news to the nation, it was his business to look after social welfare and health.  His attitude was that the people who formulate this policy should go on television and deliver the bad news themselves. Why should he do somebody else's dirty work?</P>
      <P>However, he has come to the Dáil to do precisely that.  On the one hand we are told about a reduction of £1 in the price of the social welfare stamp for a certain category while on the other hand people now find out they have to pay more.  It is necessary to highlight the gross dishonesty of Fianna Fáil and their dishonest approach in their manifesto.  This is showing itself day after day.  They tell the people they are their great benefactors, that they are removing £1 from the cost of the stamp.  That is in the large print but in the small print&mdash;or in print that cannot be read which is even worse because even the shoddy salesman has small print&mdash;it is a different story.</P>
      <P>Now that they have been elected and will remain in office for the next few years they do not mind asking for additional funds to meet the commitments made by them.  Many false promises were made.  It is sad to have to come to this House week after week and to say this.  All of the increases should have been incorporated in the budget but that did not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workers were told of the great benefits they would get.  That was necessary in order to sell the national wage agreement.  What is attractive about this measure, and about the increase of 44p in the price of the <Col N="979" /> stamp?  That is a direct taxation on the worker.  Fianna Fáil have set out in a very glossy document what they are giving to the workers but they are not told of the deceitful way the Government are coming to this House week after week with Bills whose purpose is to extract money to meet the promises of Fianna Fáil.  These promises were given in order to buy the votes of the people.</P>
    <P>I realise that we will have to pay for extra benefits.  My concern is with regard to the attitude of Fianna Fáil in this matter.  They came before the electorate last June and told them they would get benefits for nothing.  Any benefit that may have been given has been eroded by the additional increases since then.  Last week a Bill before this House made provision for an additional 11p on the worker and this week it is 44p making a total of 55p.  So much for a new era, so much for the great new horizons we were told about.  Last July I knew there were no economic miracles, there were no short-cuts and nobody had found a way of printing the kind of money to meet the promises of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The Government now tell us that this Bill must be put through quickly in order that the money will be paid in April.  They have brought in the Bill in the closing weeks of this session so that the House will not have time to talk about it.  If the Opposition attempt to debate the matter they will be accused of holding up a 10 per cent payment to social welfare recipients. That is an insult to the House.  We do not intend to delay payment of 10 per cent to anybody but we have a right to debate the matter.  It is wrong for anybody to say this Bill must go through in a cavalier and quick fashion.  We must debate it, examine it, and be critical of it.  This Bill means only one thing: people will pay more to work.</P>
    <P>Social welfare increases are a right and should be accepted as a right.  The Government should not set people against one another.  They are setting those who work and old age pensioners against each other and one group cannot say anything because the <Col N="980" /> others are getting a 10 per cent increase. This is ludicrous.  It is the type of nebulous thinking we get from the far side of the House.  I am very disturbed that such an increase should be contemplated, given that the Government removed car tax.  There was no demand for its removal.</P>

I looked at the debate on this type of Bill last year and the year before and if you talk about precedents &mdash;and we seem to be hidebound about precedents&mdash;the then Opposition spoke about job creation and what Deputy Lynch would do when he was in Government.

      <P>If we cannot speak in this House, it is better for us all to move out of it.  The issues I raised are relevant.  The comparisons I made are important.  These increases mean that the less well off in our society will have to pay for the better off.  I reject that very strongly.  It is sad that we should have this type of argument.  I want to highlight the hypocrisy of the people on the far side of the House who are pretending they have goodwill for the people.  Of course they have not.  They have been elected and, from now on, we can look forward to additional charges week after week under various subheads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the practical reality of the Bill, I want to mention a few items which concern me about widows' pensions being paid quickly.  I know there is a fire brigade action in some aspects of social welfare.  I will mention a case which happened a few weeks ago in my own constituency.  A married man with five children came out of a <Col N="983" /> pub one Saturday night, was knocked down and killed.  Four weeks later it came to my notice that his widow had not received one penny.  This is not an indictment of the Minister or anybody else.  I am merely saying a system which allows that to happen is wrong.  There should be some simple mechanism whereby a widow, particularly with a family, would have quick access to money.  We can talk about the supplementary allowances, and so on, but it takes too long to process these pensions.</P>
    <P>When the form is filled up and the necessary certificates have been authenticated on the spot, which can be done, some sort of voucher should be issued straight away for payment of the money.  People should be able to go in and say: &ldquo;There are all my documents and there is the death certificate.&rdquo; They should be examined and checked, and the cheque should be paid to the widow on the spot.  It is a traumatic experience for any woman to lose her husband.  She should receive the payment promptly.</P>
    <P>It is sad that this kind of bureaucratic attitude of no concern exists, that there is an insistence on fulfilling the terms of certain regulations.  Something should be done about this. Administrators are not there to talk down to people; they are there to serve people and make the system work.  If a person has to wait four of five weeks without money the system is not working. I want the system to work quickly particularly in the case of young widows with children who are in need of money.  When a breadwinner dies there is an instant cessation of income. The traumatic experience of the death of a breadwinner often leaves bewilderment in a house.  This regulation should be looked at in a humane manner.</P>
    <P>What annoys me about this is that a regulation is often introduced to stop one misdemeanour in a million.  I accept that we may have breakdowns but it is always possible to claw-back or to write-off.  The State is big enough to write-off.  We should not penalise everybody because a person has drawn money he was not entitled to.  While I <Col N="984" /> accept that rates on private houses have been abolished I feel obliged to point out that if one form of taxation is eliminated another method must be found to raise that money.  Elderly people with a small income did benefit from the waiver of rates scheme.  That was a bonus for them but now that all are benefiting by the abolition of rates that benefit has disappeared.  I accept that they will not be obliged to pay rates but the finance must be raised in another way.  For instance, the subsidy on cheese has been withdrawn with a consequent saving to the State.  The price of bread has been increased and so also have rents on local authority houses.  A lot of items have been increased in price to pay for the removal of rates.</P>
    <P>The fact that the burden of raising this tax is placed across-the-board militates against widows, old age pensioners and others on small incomes who benefited from the waiver of rates scheme.  Those people will suffer.  This is the type of philosophy being promulgated by the Government because there are not many votes to be gained. That is a sad situation.  Schemes like the waiver of rates scheme were introduced to make life easier for those less well-off in our community but there is nothing in the Bill to give them any additional assistance.  The Bill will merely mean that they will maintain their level of subsistence and I do not think anybody could be proud of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The waiver of rates scheme was his responsibility but I accept it is not his responsibility now because rates on private houses have been abolished.  The fact that rates have been abolished means that the less well-off will be hit hardest when the Government increases taxes in other directions.  Measures should have been taken to protect such people. This highlights the lack of foresight and imagination on the part of the Minister.  There is no imagination in the Bill and it does not open up any new avenues in relation to the payment of social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>It appears that a gullotine has fallen and the Minister has drawn a line across a 10 per cent increase in the hope that he will make everybody happy but that will not happen.  Obviously, some people will be happy but in my view the increase is not sufficient. I welcome the new scheme in relation to telephone rentals and I hope it is the start of an effort to install telephones in the houses of those who live alone.  It is a great ordeal to live alone particularly if one is in poor health.  If the Department are satisfied that a person living alone is in bad health they should make arrangements to pay the cost of the installation as well as providing the telephone free of rent.</P>
      <P>Some people can come to grips with living alone but others cannot.  If a person living alone has a telephone he or she can speak to a relation or a friend and discuss his or her problems. If that person is not well help can be obtained quickly.  A person living alone in a room without this type of communication is isolated.  I compliment the Minister in doing what he did because it is a very comprehensive step.  I hope he will be able to go further in this matter.  We should always keep the elderly in mind because they are the people who worked so hard at the beginning of this State. We should make life as easy as possible for them in their old age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supplementary rent benefits should be given to the elderly.  I mentioned this on another occasion and you ruled me out of order.  I do not think you can do so now because I think <Col N="986" /> it is in order on this Bill.  I hope the Minister will look at this matter. Elderly people who have houses of their own have a waiver of rates so they are basically living rent free now. The people living in local authority accommodation are living on highly subsidised rents.  The people living in private accommodation, which may be a bedsitter on Rathmines Road or somewhere else, have to pay the going rate.  It is sad to see people under pressure from landlords with regard to additional rent which they cannot afford to pay.  The local authorities are doing as much as they can to help those people but there is not sufficient accommodation to meet all the problems. It is important to devise some type of supplementary rent benefit for those people.  The increases given to old age pensioners are being absorbed by landlords.  The Minister should do something for those people.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about fraud in the Department of Social Welfare. The people who make those charges are possibly the people who get benefit from tax evasion.  While the Minister must be vigilent at all times he must not take the attitude that everybody drawing social welfare is a potential dodger, a person who might want to draw social welfare payment without being entitled to it.  If we adopt that type of attitude people might feel that we are only concerned about preventing people from getting payment and not looking to see where we can give people additional payments. People in receipt of social welfare money are on the poverty line.  I believe that most people will agree that the benefit those people are getting is very poor.</P>
    <P>Children's allowances come under the Department of Social Welfare although they do not come under this Bill.  No additional money was made available in the budget for children's allowances.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices at the Cabinet table to see that some increase in children's allowances is given in the near future. This money gives an income to the wife who remains at home.  Greater emphasis should be given to providing an income for the married woman who lives at home.</P>

      <P>The Minister should try to provide a special payment for the married woman who remains at home.  Those people are the backbone of our society, the people who make society tick over.  We have allowed married women to obtain children's allowances.  We should look into the tax mechanism with regard to the married woman who stays at home. This would have a very dramatic effect on our society and on the attitude towards wage increases.  I believe this comes within the Minister's ambit.  I have no doubt he will look at this matter during his term of office.</P>
      <P>There is poverty today, but whether it is self-inflicted or because of the systems we have evolved it should be examined.  We must recognise the problem. The last Government considered the problem and set up pilot committees to see what could be done.  I do not ask the Minister to eliminate poverty.  Poverty cannot be eliminated through social welfare, but it should be examined within the ambit of social welfare.</P>

      <P>I do.  I will not go into the whole question of poverty. We could spend the night talking about poverty and still get nowhere, but when the opportunity arises it is important to make a few comments on it.  It will not necessarily be done away with through social welfare, but the Minister in his pilot schemes will have to look at the attitude of society to poverty and should work to eliminate this evil.  A society that accepts poverty without question is an indolent society. Any social welfare programme should deal with the person who has no fixed abode.  In my area there are a number of hostels.</P>

      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is leaving a lot for me to say on the Estimate and I will say it on the Estimate.  I would ask the Minister to look at the question of homeless people to see what can be done to provide extra social welfare payments for them, be it through health boards or through private bodies.  I know this might come under the Estimate but we are talking about social welfare improvements and this is a needed improvement.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell referred to the question of married women who have to give up work for a short time to have a baby or for health reasons. When they decide to go back to work after having a baby and cannot find work they cannot seek social welfare benefit even though they can give an assurance that the baby will be looked after by some other person.  It is dishonest for the Department to operate in that manner.  These women are entitled to social welfare payments, but because they have a baby they will not be paid.  If a person is eligible for employment and can prove it she is entitled to benefit.  I heard of a case recently where this occurred and where the person subsequently got work.  Prior to that she was denied social welfare payment because she was told she did not want work, that she was not eligible for work.  This is a pathetic way for the Department to operate.  The Minister should have a look at this.  I will conclude&mdash;I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be delighted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will conclude on the free fuel.  I know the Minister is sympathetic about this.  The whole system needs to be looked at so that we can get heat for the elderly by whatever means they wish, whether it is turf or gas.  I saw something about this in the Minister's speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>As announced in the budget, it is intended to arrange for the provision of bottled gas for certain pensioners though it does not require a specific provision in this Bill.  The free electricity scheme which was introduced in 1967 has been of considerable benefit to old age pensioners particularly in providing them with a reasonable standard of heating.  Unfortunately there are a number of pensioners who cannot avail of the scheme&mdash;mainly persons in remote rural areas who are not yet connected to the ESB system.  We are, therefore, introducing a scheme of allowances for bottled gas which will be equivalent to the free electricity allowance.</P>
      <P>That is in the Minister's own statement so I am entitled to comment on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <P>I said I was going to talk about free fuel.  Right. And you said I could not go into that.  I know the Minister is sympathetic.  We all are.  It is a question of what we want done and I do not think we should be in the business of subsidising Bord na Móna just for the sake of Bord na Móna. What we should be doing is concerning ourselves with the elderly and asking ourselves if they are getting the benefit we want them to get, namely, some form of heating.  Heating must <Col N="991" /> be available to them and they must have easy access to that heating.  The turf scheme was a start but a whole new scheme must now be evolved.  I think the present system is disastrous. It does not meet the need.  There is no proper delivery system.  A proper scheme must be devised.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at the scheme before next winter and ensure adequate provision is made to meet the needs of those entitled to free fuel.</P>

      <P>In the budget debate we had them coming in with back-up scripts prepared by the Minister for Finance's think-tank.  On this Bill we had only one Fianna Fáil speaker with the Minister.  That speaks for itself. They are already beginning to feel the shock and the vibrations from that shock that went through the community when the Minister for Health and Social Welfare went on television, on radio and into the newspapers saying the stamp would be only £1 and in a matter of weeks he has raised it to £1.30.  We might as well look at it, I suppose, from the Minister's point of view.  He himself is in a quandary.  It is a well-known fact there is a clash of personalities in the Cabinet with the Minister for Finance and the Public Service on one side and the Minister for Health and Social Welfare on the other side.  The Minister for Finance would not loosen the purse strings and he told the Minister for Health and Social Welfare that he himself would have to get the lolly because the Minister for Finance would not give it to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Department of Social Welfare, as a public representative sees it, it is ridiculous that there should be such long delays in processing <Col N="992" /> claims for old age pensions. We are fortunate in having the privilege here of tabling parliamentary questions asking why these delays occur.  Recently I tabled a question about a man and his wife who had been waiting for over 12 months for old age non-contributory pensions.  The moment the question was tabled I had a reply saying the books had been forwarded four days before the question was to be answered.  Brilliant.  But that husband and wife would still be waiting had that question not been tabled.  When a small farmer with a valuation of £15 signs over that holding to a relative and a receipt comes from the Land Registry following the lodging of the deeds that should be good enough for the Department to issue a pension book.  It is hard enough on these people signing over their property without having another institute of the State delaying registration thereby depriving them of their pension.  The Minister should take a good hard look at this.  He should pick out 60 or 70 cases and see for himself the delay that takes place.</P>
    <P>In regard to long-stay patients in hospitals or homes run by voluntary organisations the Minister should insist that these patients should have at least £6 or £7 a week pocket money.  In some of these institutions these people get a paltry £3 or £4 a week.  A pint of stout and 20 cigarettes cost £1 a day and that means £7 per week of seven days.  These old people should not be compelled to walk the streets waiting for a neighbour to buy them a pint.</P>

If the Fianna Fáil manifesto is going so badly that they have to go after the social welfare recipients to save £2.5 million, God help Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that these social welfare officers should follow a course such as an ordinary social welfare officer would follow.  I have known social welfare officers who are pleasant to deal with.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was never out of order in my life and I can say the <Col N="995" /> same for yourself.  We are told that these smallholders are assessed for dole purposes by reference to their land valuation.  That is far from being the case.  The Ceann Comhairle probably knows that in Donegal the pension officers now want to know the quantity of milk going to the creamery and the number of cattle going to the mart, three or four calves perhaps.  All these things are being added up.  We are blandly told by the Minister that assistance is given out on the notional system.  With due respect to the Minister, I would say that a secret message has gone out to these people to knock off as many as possible from the farmers' dole by hook or by crook.  That feeling is shared generally by all the smallholders in County Kerry and the Minister need only ask Deputy O'Connor, his esteemed friend, to tell him what is going on there.  I am sure he would hear it fairly clearly if he had been listening to Deputy O'Connor complaining because we have many complaints coming in loud and clear at our political clinics all over the county.</P>
      <P>The most important point I can make is about the delay in processing old age pension claims.  It should be good enough for the Minister and the social welfare officer that the receipt for the transfer of the land from the Land Registry Office is lodged with the Department of Social Welfare; the book could be issued then if everything else is in order.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his fine delivery. As a native of my own town, I am sure I shall be approaching him about problems in the not-too-distant future.  The Minister stated that:</P>
      <P>I think it will be agreed that even in a year when the Government's main effort had to be devoted to the solution of our economic problems, real advances are being made in the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>That is followed by a remarkable sentence saying:</P>
      <P>And this process of development will go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> And on and on, we hope.  The social welfare bill for 1978 comes to approximately £610 million and the 10 per cent increases across the board come to approximately £53 million in a full year.  Looking at this as a rural representative, there is no provision for a second increase in the autumn.  The 10 per cent increase does not take into account any sudden increase in the cost of living which may occur between this and then.  There is no protection for social welfare recipients if such a thing happens and it is not entirely outside the bounds of possibility since we have had some 200 price increases since last June.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments down the years have increased old age pensions but the criticism I make is that the means test has not changed.  In western areas quite a large number of eligible people from the point of view of age for old age pensions are not receiving their pensions because their incomes from their property or what-ever finance they have are being assessed at too high a level.  There seems to be a return to the old days when every item of property is being taken into consideration in the estimation of means.  The Minister could have taken a step to increase the level of means for eligibility for old age pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, notes with grave concern the major increases from 35% to 50% from 1 March 1978 in the motor insurance premium rates of the PMPA sanctioned by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy; is convinced that a radical reorganisation of the whole system of motor insurance in the State is long overdue and accordingly calls on the Government to set up, without delay, a State system of motor insurance together with a more rational and equitable State system to deal with the processing and settlement of claims arising from such a scheme of insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> This motion was put down as a result of shock at the crushing increase of 35 per cent and in some cases 50 per cent in the insurance premium for the private motorist.  This increase will bring about some disastrous consequences, particularly to some of my constituents who have been commuting between their homes and their work which is very often in this city, some of them travelling about 90 miles a day.  These people never got income tax relief for using their motor cars which are essential to get them to their places of work.  For them this 35 to 50 per cent increase is the last straw, the straw that broke the camel's back. In my opinion it is more than a straw, it is nearly a stack of corn.</P>
    <P>The PMPA control six out of ten insurance policies on cars.  I understand their premium income is very large.  If an increase of this magnitude was necessary for them to stay solvent&mdash; and I doubt it&mdash;then they must be very near insolvency.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have always believed that insurance, particularly motor insurance, should be run by the State.  Motor insurance is of too great an importance to people to leave it in the hands of private enterprise, and very often unscrupulous private enterprise. Insurance affects every phase of life of the ordinary individual.  It affects his employment, his ability and mobility to reach employment; it affects commerce and our standard of living.  Now is the time for a proper examination of the whole insurance field to be undertaken by the Department. Private enterprise should not be allowed to do just what they like with insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>The PMPA started off as a people's co-operative.  I have been a member of that body for 11 years.  I have 35 years of no-claim driving behind me. Since I joined the PMPA my premiums have increased from £17 to over £50. That is the kind of no-claim bonus these people are talking about.  The letters PMPA stand for Private Motorists' Protection Association.  I wonder if they should change them to being the Private Motorists' Plunderers' <Col N="998" /> Association.  Their premiums were very cheap when they first got their licence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>This is necessary to bring out why I think these people should not be granted blanket coverage. I hold that the Minister is responsible for allowing this increase.  I must submit all these matters to make my point.  When this company started their premiums were very attractive.  The Fair Trade Commission set about investigating insurance.  The leaders of the PMPA gave evidence then and criticised other companies which were in operation for doing what they are doing now.  That is the history of the PMPA.</P>
      <P>They promised maximum coverage for minimum premiums.  When they got the insurance for six out of ten motorists they became more capitalistic than any of the other companies.  With no opposition they continued the order started way back to crucify car owners, workers and small business people. They have now applied for a 35 to 50 per cent increase.  The request for this increase was examined by the National Prices Commission.  Apparently the commission were of the opinion that there were too many factors involved over which they did not have sufficient knowledge and could not properly investigate. Therefore they made no recommendation.  The full responsibility for allowing this incredibly high increase rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Minister.  There is no doubt in anybody's mind about that.  This increase appears to have been sanctioned with some speed.  In my view this was a clear case where there should have been a public investigation into all the factors involved before the increase was granted.  Even still, the submissions which brought about this tremendous increase should be properly investigated and made public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will quote from a newspaper which, to say the least, cannot be regarded <Col N="999" /> as being anti the Minister or his party.  The paper is <i>The Irish Press</i>, dated 22 February 1978.  It is stated in the editorial:</P>
    <P>The timing of the increases given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. O'Malley, to the PMPA insurance company is significant and one wonders why they were not announced before the Fianna Fáil victory Ard Fheis.  Was Mr. O'Malley afraid of what this popular parliament would say about it?  If so he was right.</P>
    <P>This is not I talking: It is the editor of the Fianna Fáil-supporting <i>Irish Press.</i>  The article continues:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's concession to the motorists played a significant part in the election victory, and motorists are rightly angry that the saving given by the election manifesto should have to go to an insurance company.  Was this really the intention of the think-tank?</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister if it was.  The article continues:</P>
    <P>There is no reason why insurance companies should be allowed to increase their charges at a rate that outstrips inflation.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about cutting inflation to single figures but if increases such as this are to be given it will be very hard for the Minister to keep within these targets.  The article goes on:</P>
    <P>These insurance companies collect their premiums in advance and settle claims long after they are made.</P>
    <P>At this point I want to remind the House that very often claims are not paid until three or four years after being lodged, by which time, in the normal way, they are eroded to half their value by inflation.</P>
    <P>In his amendment, the Minister refers to the rise in claim costs and to the prospect of reviewing the legal framework and the jury system.  We know that in many cases the settlements in death cases are for smaller <Col N="1000" /> amounts than for accident cases&mdash;the dependants get less.  That is not fair, but perhaps it is the fault of the law and not of the jury system.  Jury awards have been known to be exorbitant, but the opposite has happened far too often.</P>
    <P>The size of these increases to the PMPA suggests that without them the company would have been on the verge of insolvency.  Yet we know that they have invested large amounts in department stores, blocks of flats, garages, public houses and various other types of property.  As far as the ordinary man in the street can see, they are expanding their wealth in a big way with money that has been collected from ordinary motorists during the past decade or longer.  I hope the Minister will agree to make public the company's submission when they were looking for these increases.  I hope he will tell us what would have been the result if he had not granted the increases.  Would they have stopped their motor insurance business in the same way as several other companies did not so long ago?  We all remember that when those companies got out of that type of business the PMPA were very anxious to go in and grab the spoils.  I believe that what they said at that time about those other companies could be said with equal justification about them.</P>
    <P>This company employ a number of people, but has the Minister been given any assurance that they are an efficient organisation?  Did the need for these increases arise from their inefficiency? If so, why are they inefficient?  Is the ordinary motorist being asked to pay for their inefficiency?  Has there been any investigation by the Department of their efficiency?  I do not know how good they are as employers but there have been a few disputes in that area. I have been there as a customer, or member&mdash;I do not know which&mdash;and I am getting the wrong end of the stick. From my observations I have the feeling that there is inefficiency there.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure that there is proper efficiency within a company operating six-tenths of the total motor insurance in the State.  Even if <Col N="1001" /> there is efficiency the Minister must consider seriously the involvement of the State in this serious business of motor insurance.  He has a duty to ensure at least that the profits being made from motor insurance, from payments by unfortunate young people and workers who must use a car in order to go long distances to their employment&mdash;if they are lucky enough to have employment&mdash;should be of benefit to those people.  Many people commuting, on account of the excessive cost of motoring, would be nearly as well off if they just stayed at home, particularly those who are married and have large families.  They would be better off to opt out of work and go on social welfare.  These are the kind of people who have always opted for working and who are being penalised by this huge increase.</P>
    <P>If the PMPA are a corporation instituted to protect motorists, as they say in their title, they have no right to seek these exorbitant increases, and 35 per cent to 50 per cent is an exorbitant increase.  This company have made substantial funds from premiums paid.  They made this money originally from motor insurance, but they may have reached the stage of getting into the property market where they make handier money in an easier way.  This has been done in a queer manner, because the PMPA set up to be a private motorists' protection association and they have started now to branch out into various fields from which they probably see their income coming in more handily than it has done from private motor owners.  This is wrong and completely unethical unless the money they do make in this way benefits the private motorists who have been members of their organisation, many of them indeed before the company had ever insurance to offer and when they were struggling to get the licence to operate insurance.  These people are entitled to the benefits of any investment made on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I freely admit that I am no financial expert.  I read in the newspapers and the various periodicals about all these extra profits that seem to be made and that the capital value of this company has expanded by <Col N="1002" /> leaps and bounds.  With the big offers being made by huge insurance corporations that have been in operation in this country for years and years, I wonder where the private motorist comes into all this.  I am wondering whether this company which started off as a co-op have now advanced to the stage where they are speculators&mdash; there is no other word for it&mdash;and are speculating in all kinds of property.  If so the only profit coming from all that operation that the private motorists get is an application for a 35 to 50 per cent increase.  I do not accept that this is the kind of thing the PMPA were set up for.  I do not accept in any case that that is the proper behaviour for a company that was set up as a co-op for the protection of private motorists.  I am here to represent people and to try to do what is right by the people, and the Minister of State is in the same position.</P>

      <P>The Deputy across the way was very anxious to interrupt me and to knock me off the track.  I must be getting under his skin when he is at that game because I do not go in for that in this House.  I believe in letting everyone make his own point and I am trying to make mine as well as I can.</P>
      <P>I was saying when I was interrupted that the Minister and I are here to represent a majority of ordinary people.  There is no doubt that the majority of ordinary private motorists have their insurance with the PMPA. Six out of every ten have.  The Minister in sanctioning this has done an injustice to the majority of these people.  I will quote a little further from that article in the newspaper which, as I have previously stated, has been known down the years to be a Fianna Fáil paper.  It says:</P>
      <P>There is, also, no case to be made for playing premium income against claim.  The sole reason insurance companies are investing in property, gilts and re-insurance is that they can meet their claims.  It is high time that they were seen to be met from these sources and not from premium income, which should merely oil the insurance machine.</P>
      <P>These are not my words.  They are the words of the editor or whoever writes the editorial for the well known Fianna Fáil paper <i>The Irish Press.</i>  There is no doubt about the affiliations of that paper and its editorial policy.  That is what they think about the Minister in this case and about the PMPA.  I quote them further:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time, too, that the investment policies of the PMPA were analysed in public.  For years this company has been buying property, garages, office blocks and recently even a department store.  Why is it that these investments are not put towards paying claims instead of hitting <Col N="1004" /> their insured, the small people the PMPA was originally formed to protect?</P>
    <P>That is exactly the case I have been making.  The Minister apparently did not assess properly the situation before agreeing to the increase.  From the wording of the motion he has tabled it would appear that the increase was not recommended by the NPC.  I understand that the commission regarded the matter as being too big an issue for them, that they would not be in a position to have all the factors.  If that is so all the weight of this decision must fall directly on the Minister.  The editorial continued:</P>
    <P>It simply is not good enough for Mr. Joseph Moore to say that the premium rises are not what they appear to be because of their 60 per cent no claims bonus.</P>
    <P>Earlier I referred to the question of the no-claim bonus.  Such a bonus ceases to operate after three renewals so that thereafter the full increase is applicable to the policy holder.  Admittedly there is a 60 per cent no-claim bonus originally but from that point on every increase is carried to the full extent by the insured.  Therefore, in many cases the increase will be even greater than the percentages I have mentioned.  <i>The Irish Press</i> editorial said that these only apply to people who have a no-claims bonus.  Most of those who have been paying insurance to the PMPA for the past ten years do not in effect benefit from no-claim bonuses because the period during which the no-claim bonus is allowed has been exhausted for many years. Consequently, the increase being levied will apply to all of these people.  An increase of between 35 and 50 per cent takes no account of the no-claim bonus but is levied on the total premium.</P>
    <P>I am informed reliably that the PMPA are very slow in paying claims, that payment can be delayed for as long as three years during which time the company by law, have the money on reserve, can make extra revenue by their use of that money during that time when, too, there is very little upgrading of the claim.  I am not talking of claims decided before a jury but of <Col N="1005" /> the many claims that are settled out of court, perhaps three years after the incident concerned had taken place. The result is that the money paid after a period of three years bears little relevance to what would have been its value had it been paid three years earlier when the claim was made.</P>
    <P>I know of a person who approached the PMPA recently in regard to obtaining cover for his car.  This would have been his first insurance in his own name because for many years he had been supplied with a company car. Although he had a great deal of driving experience he was quoted a figure of £312 for a third-party, fire and theft policy.  That is the sort of thing that is going on in insurance generally but particularly in the PMPA.  They seem to have no set rate and ask for whatever amount they wish.  In all these circumstances it is difficult to understand how the Minister, apparently without having carried out a full investigation of the situation in respect of efficiency and so on, could sanction the increase.  Therefore, I urge the Minister strongly to consider seriously the motion we have tabled.</P>
    <P>It is time to study the question of the setting up of a State motor insurance business.  The Minister may say that this would not necessarily lead to greater efficiency but I would not agree with that argument.  If there is profit to be made from motor insurance, that profit should be going to the State.  A State-run company would give policy holders protection as well as insurance cover.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that a proper investigation has been carried out into this whole area.  According to the leader writer in <i>The Irish Press</i> the Minister was not prepared to announce the increase to his own faithful.  There-fore he must have been in some doubt as to how his announcement would be received on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to put the case of the ordinary worker or of the small businessman who has been depending on this company both for insurance cover and for protection but the Minister has allowed the company to <Col N="1006" /> deviate from their role of protector and to increase premiums in a grossly unjust and unnecessary manner.  I appeal to the Minister, even at this late hour, to have an investigation carried out into the whole field of motor insurance and to ascertain whether it would be possible to set up a State insurance business which at least would ensure that any profits would accrue to the State.  The PMPA have millions of pounds to invest.  They got all of this money from the private motorist.  I trust that the Minister will consider the point I have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said during the recent Adjournment Debate on the same subject, no Government like to have to approve of increases in any sphere and least of all in the motor insurance sector where so many members of the community are affected. However, we have price control, or in this case premium control, and it must be realistic in facing up to the problems which the reality of costs presents, and the Minister must take decisions which are politically difficult but which are forced upon him through circumstance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent increase allowed to the <Col N="1007" /> PMPA Insurance Company has resulted in alterations to premia for individual policyholders ranging from small reductions over the 1977 rate to those with comprehensive cover, to a 50 per cent increase for those with third party only cover.  To give an example of how the increase is being applied, in the case of a 1,000 cc car, the old position of third party, fire and theft, less 60 per cent no claim bonus was £55.20.  The new position, after the increase, for third party, fire and theft results in a figure of £61.40 or an increase of £6.20.  The value of the car taken here in this example is £1,600.  For a car of £2,000 average value and somewhat bigger size the difference after adjustments will be £10 in approximately £100 or about 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The company are, therefore, using every effort to bring about a satisfactory alignment of rates to the underlying reality of costs, with the minimum impact on their policyholders. They necessarily, however, have to increase third party rates sharply, but these increases are heavily offset by reductions in fire and theft rates.  The full increase falls on third party insurance only.  Third party has been a heavy loss maker, and it is significant that any of the new schemes introduced by the other companies concentrated their competitiveness on elements other than third party insurance.</P>
    <P>The fact of the PMPA's case is that the increase was necessary to offset substantial underwriting losses.  Even with the increase, a loss of nearly £1 million on underwriting for 1978 is expected.  It is primarily the claims costs over which the company have no control which have made the increases of this magnitude necessary.  In addition, it is accepted insurance practice that an insurance company must produce growth in free reserves corresponding to the growth in underwriting liabilities.  This has always been the case for all companies.  It has now been reinforced in Irish law by Statutory Instrument No. 115 of 1976 implementing the EEC Non-Life Directive and it is the Minister's <Col N="1008" /> responsibility as supervisory authority to ensure that these reserves exist and are maintained.</P>
    <P>The PMPA engaged until recently, when they went into general insurance business in a small carefully controlled way, in motor insurance, acknowledged as the least profitable sector of insurance in recent years.  This fact cannot be contested.  It is the fastest growing insurance company in Ireland and in less than ten years they have captured nearly 70 per cent of the private car insurance market.  This has made it all the more necessary for the company to maintain increasing free reserves. Part of the reason for the growth is the fact that the PMPA have been prepared to offer cover without major limitation at a time when other insurance companies were curtailing their motor operations and nursing safe and reduced portfolios. They had virtually closed shop and refused to compete in any open sense. The position in which the company find themselves is in one sense a very great tribute to their initiative; it can certainly not be described as monopolistic in any sense, with 19 other insurers in the market, and the concentration of the private car sector with this company can largely be said to have been thrust upon them by the attitude and policy of closing for business which the other companies adopted.  In addition, as Deputies will well know, some insurers left our market altogether, throwing thousands of policyholders on to anyone who would take them, rather than carrying on in a non-profit situation.  In most cases the PMPA took these on.</P>
    <P>It is not fully accepted that this was due to the lack of profitability on the accounts of other motor insurers, rather could it be said to be a transfer of responsibility for motor insurance to a company which was new, prepared to offer insurance which, after all, was compulsory on the motorists.  The PMPA were excluded from the calculations of the increases given to companies in 1975.  Because they had the lowest rates of insurance, the across-the-board market increases given in recent years left them consistently in a worse relative position.  The present <Col N="1009" /> level of increase will not mean a break-even underwriting position at the end of 1978, but with the addition of investment income the company will be in a position not only to meet the EEC solvency requirement but will have a surplus over that requirement which it is felt is consistent with the size the company have now become. In other European countries it is normal practice that companies would have an excess of two or three times the statutory solvency margin.</P>
    <P>Referring to investment income, I said previously that this was an integral part of the insurance operation and must be balanced against underwriting losses, a drop in asset values, taxation, dividend and operating costs. This company have had a most successful investment record, without which even higher increases would be necessary.  The improved underwriting position which should improve all the more in the years to come by virtue of the drop of inflation rates will make it easier for the company to attract further share capital to support further growth in the volume of business.</P>
    <P>On the question of the costs of claims there are no simple and facile solutions as to how such costs can be kept down.  Much of the increases can be attributed to the increased costs of imported spare parts and materials and to the fact that unfortunately our driving habits and standards of vehicle maintenance to say the least, leave a lot to be desired.  I know reference has been made in the past to the fact that if the repair of a vehicle is &ldquo;an insurance job&rdquo; estimates and expectations can be exaggerated.  This is a very difficult matter to substantiate, but I would indicate that it is in each driver's long-term interest to ensure that costs of claims are kept to a minimum.  If these are increased beyond what is strictly necessary, it is the totality of motorists who will eventually pay in terms of the increased premium.</P>
    <P>Much has been said over the past few weeks in relation to the legal framework within which motor insurance operates in Ireland.  It is reckoned that as much as 16 per cent of claims costs go in legal expenses and it is a <Col N="1010" /> fact that Ireland is one of the few countries where juries decide both the culpability and the level of award.  In saying that changes will have to be made in this system one must be careful to avoid infringing the rights of individuals, but it is the responsibility of the State to ensure that any unnecessary waste in the administration of justice should be avoided.  It is a matter of concern to the Government that the settlement of claims should take such a long time.  Furthermore, the level of awards and their unpredictability make it impossible for companies to make accurate claims provision.  We must see if the jurisdiction levels of the courts are suitable at present and if it is possible to reduce the incidence of expensive legal assistance.</P>
    <P>It is an observed fact that where legal proceedings are involved there is considerable delay in processing claims.  Claims are settled on the steps of the court after years of delay and if matters do go to the court the delay in having cases heard and the fact that senior consel and solicitors are involved mean that the costs of the claim will be all the more.</P>
    <P>In the Interim Report of the Committee of Enquiry into the Insurance Industry in 1972 many recommendations were made with regard to the legal system and I can say that these recommendations will be examined afresh and, if necessary, implementing legislation will be adopted.  Also in that report, considerable airing was given to the fault versus the no-fault issue.  I have no strong feelings at this time towards one or other systems but the change to a no-fault system is radical having implications well beyond that of motor insurance but it is known to exist in other countries such as New Zealand.  This is another matter which we must examine in greater detail.</P>
    <P>Having explained why the increase was necessary, both in terms of the increased cost and in the light of the Minister's supervisory function, I would indicate to the House that the Department continue to monitor the whole insurance market very closely. They have given a detailed analysis <Col N="1011" /> of the claim from a &ldquo;cost of the product&rdquo; point of view and the solvency needs of the company together with their functions within the supervisory capacity which they exercise to the National Prices Commission.  It is hoped that increases of the order recently given will not have to be repeated in the future.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of nationalisation I would repeat my comment last week that I have nothing in principle against State ownership of motor insurance.  The implication of the proposal in this motion is that the taxpayer should bear the losses which motor insurance throws up.  It is also striking that the nationalisation call has not come in respect of the more profitable elements of insurance.  I cannot understand how the Deputies from the Labour Party proposing this motion can so lightly consider that motor insurance operated by a State corporation would be less costly and more profitable.</P>
    <P>I could see some merit if they had asked for a national corporation for all classes of insurance.  Some classes are profitable and whatever might be said of a proposition that the State engage in all, there should not be the simple assumption that the State could reduce the cost of motor insurance without benefit of a subsidy from the over-burdened taxpayer.  Is this what is asked?  Is this the policy I am asked to follow?  Do the proposers want a national motor insurance corporation within a no-fault system where it would be almost impossible to lay a heavier cost on those who are reckless with many accidents and claims or within the present fault system?</P>
    <P>Let me give the House the motor experience in the United Kingdom for 1976 of some of the leading major insurers in the worldwide business.  For example, the Commercial Union Company had premiums of £393 million with an underwriting loss of £22.9 million.  The Guardian Royal Exchange Group had premiums of £218 million with an underwriting profit of £0.8 million.  The General Accident Group had premiums of £302 million <Col N="1012" /> with an underwriting loss of £5.5 million.</P>
    <P>Let us consider some of the figures that were outlined in the interim report on motor insurance&mdash;this is the committee of inquiry into the insurance industry.  On page 117 of that report it referred to the combined underwriting experience of insurance companies, excluding the Lloyd syndicate, from 1951 to 1971.  During that time, with the exception of two years there was not an underwriting profit in any of those years.  The exceptions were in 1963 and 1964.  In the other 18 years they sustained losses.</P>
    <P>In the case of the PMPA, form 1968 to 1976 they had premiums of £40,466,475 and they had an underwriting loss of £2.6 million.  We are to assume that by nationalising the industry we will change these figures. I see little ground for believing that the solution commended to us would be the panacea that the Labour Party suggested.</P>
    <P>I consider the existing insurance industry in Ireland to be rendering a good service to the community both in terms of the policies offered and the commitment to national enterprise. Our insurance industry is at present faced with competition from the opening of our market under EEC rules to foreign insurers.  I have a high regard for the integrity and professionalism of those in charge of our industry and would consider it a matter of speculation as to whether the administrative cost ratios of the insurance companies would be improved significantly. Certainly, the PMPA company have one of the lowest expense ratios. Where the cost of claims accounts for nearly 80 per cent of all costs, a drop of say 20 per cent on the expense ratio would have a minimal effect on insurance rates.</P>
    <P>The commitment to Ireland of the life and non-life offices is evidenced by the fact that over 85 per cent of the reserves of the industry as a group are invested in Ireland.  In non-life insurance, the Irish companies, including the PMPA have nearly 100 per cent localisation of assets in Ireland.  This amounted to some £52 million in 1976 <Col N="1013" /> while the foreign based non-life companies had nearly £25 million invested here in the same year.  Under the administrative rules at present in force, a localisation requirement of 50 per cent of technical reserves operates on all companies.  Last year this level was 40 per cent and next year it will rise to 60 per cent.  This provision has meant that as much as £7 million extra has been invested in Ireland which might otherwise have been invested elsewhere. This means that more Government securities will be purchased, and more funds will be made available directly to the private sector.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is such a high level of investment by the insurance industry in Ireland has never been fully appreciated and obviously it is not appreciated by the proposers of this motion.  In recent years when levels of return dropped considerably, the insurance industry maintained the funds in Ireland and showed a praiseworthy commitment to and involvement in the economic life of the Irish community.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the point that the recent increases in PMPA rates will offset the advantages for the motorists in the withdrawal of certain levels of motor taxation.  This is a generalised, ill-informed and misleading comment in that in some instances the rates of insurance with the PMPA have been reduced and in overall terms the PMPA increase will realise an extra £8 million in 1978 in premium income, whereas the tax withdrawal would have realised as much as £28 million in a full year.  Even if the motor tax had not been withdrawn, the PMPA would still have had to get an increase of this size.</P>
    <P>To say the increase is a substitute for the withdrawal of the tax is completely wrong.  Furthermore, within the PMPA package, comprehensive insurance cover has now been opened up for the first time to young drivers.  This is a desirable trend in that for far too long comprehensive and fire and theft rates have subsidised the third party element.  This has enabled competition to be enjoined on the profitable sector but not on the third party side.  Ireland has one of the lowest rates of comprehensive cover in Europe.  For <Col N="1014" /> example, in the UK over 80 per cent of motorists are comprehensively insured while in Ireland less than 12 per cent are similarly insured.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat that the Government find it regrettable that an increase of this magnitude was necessary. The Minister did not make the decision lightly and is anxious that every effort to reduce the cost of claims should be availed of.  It is now policy to deal with insurance companies' claims on a case by case basis.  There will no longer be the approach of a global or average increase to all companies. A company's actual individual experience will determine the increase in premium it gets.  This is a more equitable tailormade approach and much fairer to the policyholder and more appropriate for each company.</P>
    <P>I expect companies to fulfil the role they are there to fulfil and to give the policyholder the compulsory insurance the law of the land requires he should have.  It is believed that increases in the future will be more closely related to the annual rates of inflation and that improvements in the legal framework will not only help to reduce costs but also provide a more efficient service to motorists and third parties.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to a couple of items mentioned by Deputy Bermingham.  He referred to the policy of the PMPA and said in their earlier days the PMPA aimed at the safe driver market and quoted good rates as a result.  Their critics then said their rates were too low.  Now with 65 per cent, nearly 70 per cent, of the private motor insurance market, they must be getting a cross-section of the market&mdash; good and not so good.  Their premiums must reflect this.</P>
    <P>Secondly, since they are the principal takers of new insured that fact alone must mean they are getting a high proportion of the younger market with a higher incidence or risk.  Now their critics say their rates are too high. If this is so, what are the other 19 insurance companies doing and why do other insurers leave the market?  We are all familiar with the fact that, in the past number of years, three or four <Col N="1015" /> different Lloyds operators left the market and left thousands of drivers without insurance.  As I said earlier, the PMPA picked up most of this business because they were meeting their commitments.  I should like to emphasise that there are 19 other companies in the market and I should like to see them carrying a greater share of the market.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham made a number of references to the investment policies of the PMPA.  Policyholders profit from the successful investment of their funds by insurers.  This leads to growth and to increased competition in the longer term.  The investments of the PMPA are carefully scrutinised with the aid of professional expertise to ensure that they are prudent and sound investments consistent with the need at law that assets must always exceed liabilities.</P>
    <P>In the Department the Minister has made administrative regulations which now govern the nature and spread of these investments so that dangerous speculations or excessive concentrations would not be practised by the investment side of any insurance company. This goes beyond the PMPA.  It goes right across the board to all insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The suggestion put forward by the Labour Party that motor insurance, as such, should be nationalised surprises me to the extent that they are suggesting the Irish taxpayer should carry the burden of the continuous losses of motor insurance.  That has been proved in the interim report of the motor insurance industry on the figures I quoted from 1951 to 1971 which showed losses consistently with the exception of two years when minor profits were made on underwriting.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party should not have suggested that the motor insurance burden should be loaded onto the shoulders of the taxpayer.  If the overall situation is examined, it will be found that it would be more appropriate to suggest&mdash;and I am not saying I would be in favour of it&mdash;that the other elements of insurance, the profit-making side of the business, should <Col N="1016" /> also have been considered in their proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The only information of any consequence which has emanated from the Minister of State's contribution is two fascinating pieces of information.  The first piece of information, which is a most startling disclosure to the House, and which I am sure will be of great consolation to the 150,000 policyholders of the PMPA, is that even with this phenomenal increase of 35 per cent to 50 per cent this year the PMPA will still have an underwriting loss of approximately £1 million.  The accounting implications of that figure for 1978 bring me right back to the point I made when I asked whether the Minister was suggesting that under the EEC directive, the Statutory Instrument of 1976, for all practical purposes the company were deemed to be virtually insolvent.</P>
      <P>The second most interesting figure we got from the Minister this evening was the admission that they forecast&mdash; and I have not heard any representative of the company make this admission in public; and I presume one would always forecast in a very modest way in matters of this nature&mdash;that the increased premia will bring in £8 million extra in 1978.  This means that to keep the PMPA going and to protect their assets of £60 million-odd in order to keep them solvent and in a position to contribute an investment income to meet operating underwriting losses, the Irish taxpayer&mdash;in effect, the motorist&mdash;must hand out another £8 million this year.  I assume that in submissions to the Department it would not overestimate that.  It may be £10 million or £12 million.  They do not know the extent of new business in 1978.  Naturally, the company would not state the lowest possible figure in its negotiations with the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central point of this debate is that anybody reading the successive reports available to Members&mdash;there are not many such reports&mdash;can see how the chairman and managing director of the PMPA, in his submissions to the Fair Trade Commission waxed eloquent against the alleged restrictive <Col N="1017" /> practices of the major motor insurance companies here.  There is available to Members the Motor Premiums Advisory Committee Report, the interim report of the committee of inquiry into the industry, the O'Connor Report and various reports of the National Prices Commission.  We are all aware that to get clear, coherent, reliable and verifiable&mdash;I use the word legitimately in its accounting sense&mdash;information from motor assurance companies operating here is like going into a jungle expecting to clear out every insect in it overnight. There is not a hope in hell of getting that information.  The Department conceded time and again that despite repeated seeking of information, even of a statutory nature, even information based on the non-life directive enacted into Irish law in January 1977, the data supplied by companies to the Department, more particularly to the National Prices Commission which for all practical purposes has washed its hands of trying to do anything with motor insurance here because of the political and major problems of handling it, is not much use.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that what he has trotted out this evening in terms of interpretative, subjective and very arbitrary underwriting losses reports and investment reports is, by and large, a charade.  I say that as a person who has some knowledge of insurance accounting.  It depends on the person one is talking to, which accountant is employed, how it is presented to the Department, and God help the Department from then on.  I say that as one who before becoming a politician had to sign the Official Secrets Act when acting on prices advisory committees. The situation is unrealistic in terms of the statements made by the Minister. The rates quoted by the Minister have no relation to reality.  For example, in relation to about seven out of ten policies the quotation given depends on the loading, whether there is a loading in relation to the Dublin area or an urban loading in relation to Cork. Specified occupational groups also have a special loading and there are loadings for the age of the car and the age of the person seeking cover.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> The quotations presented to the Department and the reality facing the motorist in terms of getting a quotation based on his domestic situation and his medical record are totally different to the spurious reality the Minister spoke of.  I recall the Motor Premiums Advisory Committee stating that these loadings, the scientific assessment of them, were completely arbitrary and, apart from the accident ratio in the Dublin city area, other loadings by and large did not have much bearing on reality.  We are faced with a situation that we are dealing with a company that has emerged as a monopoly of private motor insurance here.  The company has 60 per cent of the market and after that a company does not need anything else, it can do what it likes.  In effect the company has said to the Minister that they want £8 million from the Irish motorists this year and told him that he need not worry but that accounts will be presented to him this year showing that it is still losing £1 million.  Why does the company do that?  The company does it because the managing director gaily said, without batting an eyelid, that he would be coming back for another 10 per cent.  He has stated that the company will have to look for another increase in rates in 1979.</P>
    <P>The company is now in a monopoly situation.  As a social democrat I object to that.  I should like to point out that in relation to the federal law of America there is not an American Senator or Congressman who would not be kicking up at the idea of an American insurance company having 60 per cent of the market.  Such a company would be brought before every commission possible and ruthlessly dismantled overnight in accordance with American monopoly law.  That situation would not be tolerated.  No west European country would tolerate that situation.  The laws in those countries would not allow it to happen but now we have that situation here and that has been compounded by the Minister with this increase.</P>
    <P>I treat with a great deal of cynicism and jaundice the information presented by the Minister with such absolute certainty and the kind of nonsense <Col N="1019" /> he went on with tonight.  He told us that his Department, and the expert consultancy staff of the National Prices Commission, with a fine comb went through the £60 million portfolio of the PMPA every year to ensure that everything was going all right.  Who is the Minister trying to cod?  Who are the people who prepared his brief trying to cod?  I have the gravest doubts that that kind of expertise exists in the Department.  I doubt if even an attempt was made to get to grips with the investment portfolio of this company. If that was done I know where they would be told to go.  They would be told to hump off and take a running-jump off the top of McBirneys into the River Liffey.  They would not get very far with their investigations.</P>
    <P>The NPC and other advisory committees failed because of the lack of hard solid information, verified audited information, in relation to the operation of such companies and their subsidiaries. The lack of that information is self-evident and is a matter of concern. There is a strong case to be made, therefore, for a public inquiry into the situation.  I would even go so far as to suggest to the Minister that he might reactivate the O'Connor Commission. I say that as a social democrat conscious that the distinguished gentleman I have mentioned could not be regarded as a raving socialist.  I believe that by now even Mr. O'Connor and his colleagues on that committee would come out in favour of the concept of a State-sponsored national motor insurance corporation.</P>
    <P>Who do we think we are kidding in this regard?  One would imagine that the two PPs in PMPA stood for philantrophy and protection, that this was the most glorious protection given to the Irish people at enormous expense. They have had an underwriting loss this year, even with £8 million handed over to them, of £1 million. What are they in business for?  They are in business because they are doing very well out of it and the Minister knows this.  They are doing exceptionally well.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows perfectly well that within the laws of privilege in the House and the precedents the word &ldquo;they&rdquo; does not necessarily refer to PMPA.  They and they alone are doing very well out of it. I distinguished between alleged insolvency of an underwriting nature and the assets which a company have and maintain in a flourishing condition as a result of their investment policies arising out of the payments made by Irish motorists.</P>
      <P>Anybody can own a bingo machine. Anybody can play bingo and anybody can have a slot machine.  If you have enough fools to put money into a slot machine you will make a lot of money and your investment will not cost you very much.  I believe there is a solid case for a public inquiry into the operations of this company.  I believe it would be most illuminating and we would find out the real facts of the situation.  The real facts, with respect, do not relate to the proposition put before us by the Minister rather blandly that between 1968 and 1976 the PMPA premium income was £40 million and the underwriting loss was £2.6 million.  That kind of simplistic accounting does not cod anybody. Even the most humble uninitiated financial commentator of <i>Hibernia</i> magazine, for instance, would not fall for that.  That is saying something in terms of financial consultancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am intrigued by the Minister's comment that in principle he has nothing against&mdash;he used the word, we did not&mdash;nationalisation of motor insurance.  We want to see a State-sponsored body established similar to the way in which a previous Government, not Fianna Fáil, sponsored the setting up of the VHI.  This party believe it is outrageous that our lawyers should have the cream of Irish motorists' premiums.  Every year <Col N="1021" /> they cream off 16 per cent of every premium I pay or anybody else pays. It is a lawyers' ice cream parlour. They get a straightforward payment into their pockets every year arising out of the settlement of claims.</P>
    <P>I will say one thing about the American system.  If one has a bash in America one will get a straight quotation.  One will be told: &ldquo;We will settle it for you for 33 per cent of the award and we will do a straight knock for knock&rdquo;.  Here you finish up paying your 16 per cent.  One should see the way some of the costs are inflated.</P>
    <P>We have a jury system which is pure bingo.  One is likely to emerge with a series of settlements which have no bearing on reality.  We should have a State-sponsored motor insurance corporation. Even the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, conservative as he is, agrees with me that we should have it.  The Cabinet would never agree with this.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, in principle, is in favour of it. If one had that one would be able to lay down&mdash;the Government had no difficulty in doing it in relation to ground rents&mdash;a scale of fees for particular legal charges in relation to motor insurance claims.  There is a certain pattern of work to be done the same as there is in relation to occupational injuries and other such matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour knows very well in relation to redundancy appeals tribunals, occupational injuries claims and the full range of State insurance that it is no less difficult to operate in relation to them than it would be in relation to motor insurance.  We do not accept, as the Minister has suggested, that it would be quite impossible to operate.  We suggest there are many ways it can be done.  I believe a State motor insurance system would be healthy for the country.  A previous report told us that garage repairs take up 83.6 per cent of all expenditure in relation to claims.  I believe that it would bring a little honesty into Irish life and into the system of motor car repairs if we had a State motor insurance system.  In relation to motor insurance and the settlement of claims <Col N="1022" /> the bills which one gets for motor car repairs arising out of work done in garages is almost immoral in the context of Irish work.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the Chair's approval, to share some of my time with the Labour Party spokesman on education, Deputy John Horgan.  The immediate occasion of this request for an adjournment debate was the reply of the Minister today to the question about the plans he has for the preservation and development of second level education in the north central area of this city.  The plight of the central parts of this city in relation to the provision of living neighbourhoods, residential areas, is well known. The question of urban renewal in the centre of Dublin has received a good deal of attention lately.  Part and parcel of the same struggle to maintain viable living communities in the centre of Dublin is the requirement that the educational centres in this part of Dublin should be preserved.  Deputy Horgan asked the Minister if, in view of the latest announced intention of the authorities in the Dominican Convent in Eccles Street to close that school, the urgency of the question is the more marked.</P>

      <P>The question before us is question No. 9 in the name of Deputy John Horgan to ask the Minister for Education the plans he has for the preservation and development of second-level education in the north-central area of Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the announced intention of the authorities <Col N="1023" /> in Eccles Street to close the school. That brings to the fore the need to consider as a very high priority special plans in education for this part of Dublin.  One has only to look at the figures in a recent study of educational opportunity in Dublin by Father McGrale.  From the figures for the north and south city centre it can be seen that only 1.8 per cent of young adults reach university, the number reaching complete secondary is 10.9 per cent and national schools, 73.6 per cent.  The possible decision to close down the Eccles Street girls' school comes after the announced intention to close down the Maria Assumpta school in Gardiner Street and the decision to be made as to the future of the Holy Faith School with its 399 pupils.  The possible decision to close down Eccles Street School comes in the wake of decisions to close some schools and possible decisions to close other schools in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that many of the pupils attending these schools come from other parts of the city but quite a number are from the area.  The closing down of the Maria Assumpta school is especially regrettable.  That was a secondary top school that had developed from the primary basis and it drew its pupils from the surrounding area.  From what we can gather, the Minister's answer to the closure or possible closure of these schools, is that a vocational school with 800 places would be provided and that there was an intention to extend the Kings Inns Street school.  The Minister also referred in general to the developments at second level for the north city suburbs.  These plans for the north city suburbs, for additional educational second level establishments extend as far out as Portmarnock.  If schools were closing down in any other parts of the country at the rate they have been closing down in the centre of the capital, and the Minister of the day said that alternative education would be provided ten or 15 miles from the centre, there would be a great public outcry.  The additional schools being provided on the perimeter of the city will simply be filled from the waiting <Col N="1024" /> lists there at present.  They will not compensate for the loss of educational places in the city centre.  I am not denying that economic, staffing and maintenance problems may have been encountered by the authorities in the schools in the centre of the city, but the Minister should meet these problems in an effective way.  The Minister should accept that it is equally important to maintain schools in the centre of Dublin as it is to preserve residential neighbourhoods.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the standard of education provided by these schools has been satisfactory.  There was a question today to the Minister for Education asking &ldquo;if he will state, in relation to Maria Assumpta School, Gardiner Street; Dominican College, Eccles Street; and Holy Faith School, Dominick Street, whether the schools in question are considered by his inspectorate to be providing a satisfactory standard of education&rdquo; and the Minister's reply was in the affirmative.  It is not an effective response to the gradual close-down of schools in this area to say that a vocational school will be opened, or to point to plans far out in the suburbs on the north side.  The Minister should get the answers to the problems these schools have met with.  The Minister would meet with a great deal of approval if he could ensure that the educational authorities in this part of the city were enabled to continue their work.  The schools have been there a long time, they are part of the social fabric, they are near city services and so on.  The standard of education being provided there is up to the standard elsewhere and the figures produced by Father McGrale suggest that it is ludicrous to be resigned to the close-down of educational establishments at secondary level in a part of Dublin where the figures show that participation in secondary education is so low. It is not impossible to ensure that there is a greater follow through by pupils coming from the area in these schools.  A very interesting experiment has been going on for some years in Rutland Street.  That has shown what particular and special treatment can achieve in areas of severe deprivation. In Rutland Street the Van Leer <Col N="1025" /> foundation assisted in a pre-school effort, continued to junior school, and I would hope that the Van Leer experiment could be followed elsewhere. I hope the Minister and his officials are examining the positive results of that experiment to see what could be done along these lines in other areas. There is no conviction in an educational policy the protagonists of which stand idly by and see this part of Dublin deprived of long established schools.  It makes nonsense of urban planning to accept a situation in which these schools, for whatever good reason, close down one by one.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is an important move on directed towards the preservation of the social fabric of the centre city area.  If the schools go, then an important element in this evolution goes.  I would hope that the Minister would look again at the alarming trend in regard to second level education in this part of Dublin, meet the authorities concerned, discuss with them their problems, see if solutions can be found, see if more aid can be given to such areas, examine the problem or lack of man- or womanpower, consider the economic problems encountered and find out exactly where and how we can maintain educational establishments in this part of the city.</P>
    <P>We raise this matter on the adjournment because we are concerned not alone with the possible closedown of Eccles Street but with the whole back-ground of the possible closure of second level education in this part of the city.  We believe it is a retrograde step.  The Minister and his Department must be about their business and must produce more positive plans than we have seen so far on the evidence available to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The threatened closures of the schools raise a very substantial general principle from the point of view of the central city area. I have some sympathy with the Minister faced with this situation which is largely not of his own making but is caused by the action or actions of groups, which the Minister says he has no power to prevent doing what they <Col N="1026" /> propose to do.  To that extent I have some sympathy with him, but we are faced with a situation of some seriousness, a situation calling for very determined and radical action.</P>
      <P>At the core lies the central city area problem.  The centre of Dublin, especially on the north side, is a shambles.  In that shambles the schools are the last to go.  But there is no reason why they should go and there are many reasons why they should stay and be used as part of the foundation necessary in rebuilding the centre city to human scale with communities intermingling with commercial and business activity.</P>
      <P>City centres the world over, and not least here, have a tradition of second level schools.  That is not to say that those living in the area have a tradition of going to second level schools or that the schools are freely open to the children who flock around their doors. One of the reasons for this is because in the old days the centre of the city was actually inhabited by the higher socio-economic class and these people liked to have schools on their door-step. As they moved out the schools remained and transport routes developed to bring children in from the more affluent suburban areas to the centre city schools.  That pattern has remained up to now.  It is still quite a strong pattern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the pattern is due to the fact that not all of the schools in the centre of the city take children from around their own environment.  This is a pity. There has been a change in some respects and I believe Dominican Convent, Eccles Street, is one of the schools which has over the past few years tended to take more pupils from the immediate area than it did earlier on.  Again, the Maria Assumpta school drew a very large proportion of its intake from the immediately surrounding area and, therefore, the educational prospects of the children in the area will be very seriously affected by its closure.  Given the frightening low participation rates there must be, Ministers for Education, not excluding the present Minister, must have wondered what they would do if participation rates in the case of centre <Col N="1027" /> city children matched those in the more affluent areas because they just would not know where to put the children.  We have unfortunately no plan to take advantage of the patterns and structures that have developed.</P>
    <P>Father Comiskey, the secretary of the Commission of Religious Superiors, said in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday, 4 March:</P>
    <P>While the religious are not closing schools, they were withdrawing from them, perhaps the better to spread their personnel and, indeed, perhaps their cash as well among the community schools in which they are now involved.</P>
    <P>He also appealed to the laity to play a greater part in the running of their schools.  This is unreal to a certain extent.  Let the laity run them by all means but let them first have the assets.</P>
    <P>When we look at the schools, effectively all we see is a new vocational school with 800 places and an extension of Henrietta Street.  What we want to know is how many new places will be provided in these two schools to replace the 1,300 or 1,400 places lost if all three schools proposing to close do so.  Many of the schools mentioned by the Minister are miles away and transport routes do not necessarily suit the children who would have to travel out to these schools.  Indeed, in many areas places are already mortgaged up to the hilt.  In the Bayside area in Sutton and in the Howth deanery area there is already a shortfall and these schools will not, therefore, be able to take the children set adrift by these closures.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Evening Herald</i> of today there is an extraordinary bannerline: Dublin Gets £10m. School Boost.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education is embarking on a £10,000,000 building spree to provide 8,000 urgently needed new post-primary school places for the northern part of Dublin city and suburbs.</P>
    <P>Later on there is the following:</P>
    <P>Details of the new schools have been given in a Dáil reply by the <Col N="1028" /> Minister for Education, Mr. Wilson, to Labour education spokesman, John Horgan.</P>
    <P>That question was answered a few days ago and one wonders why it suddenly found its way into this evening's paper. I give credit to the Minister where credit is due but the new schools will not be provided where they will help the children put at risk.  Many were planned before the Minister took office and will, I expect, be paid for long after he has gone.  If the Minister were to put this £10 million into the 1978 Department of Education Estimate I would be happy to underline that bannerline.  What we need to do is take advantage of what exists and build and organise in the centre of the city its own post-primary education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to deal with the alarmist campaign getting underway on the Labour benches.  As I said today, and as I said several times over the last few days, there is no certainty that Eccles Street school will close.  Those who speak as if a decision to close had already been made are not helping the situation in any way.</P>
      <P>With regard to Maria Assumpta, which has suddenly become a cause for alarm for Deputy O'Leary, the decision to close this school was taken three years ago when the Deputy was a Minister in Government.  Did I or anybody else hear one squeak from him then about the closure of the Maria Assumpta school?  Not a single squeak.  Not one word.  Perhaps the close and professional interest which Deputy Keating is taking in the constituency now has prompted Deputy O'Leary to take a greater interest in 1978 than he was able to take in 1975. Did I hear a word from Deputy O'Leary, a Minister of the then Government, when, in 1974, the Dominick Street school was threatened with closure?  Not a single squeak, but suddenly now there is an enhanced interest in education in Dublin north-central and I think it is not entirely unconnected with the fact that Deputy Keating is keeping the former Minister on his toes.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy and I do not intend to allow him to interrupt me.  I am fully convinced that the policy of the living inner city which was mentioned by both Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Horgan is sound.  I fully subscribe to it and in so far as I can keep life in it educationally I shall do so.</P>
      <P>The specific question put down and about which we had had enormous talk which I decry&mdash;it can only do harm to pupils and parents in the area &mdash;was:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education the plans he has for the preservation and development of second level education in the north central area of Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beginning with preservation, I want to say, first, that both Deputies, seeing the weakness in their case did admit that people were coming in from outside to schools in that specific area, but I intend to preserve and enlarge, if necessary, the following existing schools in the north city centre area: St. Josephs, CBS, Fairview; Rosminian College, Grace Park Road, Drumcondra, a new community school; CBS Brunswick Street; O'Connell Schools, North Richmond Street, Coláiste Mhuire, Parnell Square; Belvedere College, Great Denmark Street; Loreto College, North Great Georges Street; St. Joseph's Stanhope Street, which is a new one; St. Theresa's College, Presentation Convent, George's Hill; St. Joseph's secondary school, Mountjoy Street; Mount Carmel secondary school, Sisters of Charity, Kings Inn Street; and also vocational schools, Marino vocational school; Parnell Square vocational school; and North Strand vocational school.  Parnell Square, as I already told the House, and Great Denmark Street are still in existence but they are to be replaced by an 800 pupil new school.  Dublin Vocational Education Committee thought they had a site for that school; now unfortunately it seems that the possibility of using that site no longer exists but they are still actively in search of a <Col N="1030" /> site for a school in that area.  This relates to the word &ldquo;preservation&rdquo; which was used in the Deputy's question.</P>
    <P>Now, to cover the point made by both Deputies that into this area people come from various other areas, I want to list the new schools that are being developed and, rather ungenerously, they were referred to by Deputy Horgan, again by people who have a new found interest in the place for whatever reason it may be.  Generally in the north city there is a movement from the suburbs into the centre city as was admitted.  Deputy Horgan made an attempt to give socio-economic reasons for it and, to a certain extent, his reasons are valid. But I want to point out again that the VEC are planning an 800 pupil school for the north central area; that there are four community schools to take 1,000 each which will have an effect on the whole area.  North central does not become an educational unit because a Minister in the former Government decided it was going to be a constituency nor does it become an education unit suddenly because a professional educationalist, Deputy Keating is expressing interest in it and so arouses the interest of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Blakestown, 1,000 pupils, Bayside, Sutton; Corduff; Ayrfield, The Donahies; Portmarnock, Beaumont-Artane, Swords vocational school, Rosminian school, Drumcondra; Castleknock community school are all planned for the area and will have an effect, as I said, on the intake into all schools in the area.  It is ridiculous to try to divide up educational units on the basis of a political constituency however much they motivate people to raise educational questions here.  I am not complaining about that but I just want to point out to the House what the whole game it about.</P>
    <P>In regard to Kings Inn Street convent&mdash;these are developments&mdash;I have approved a major scheme of extension and re-construction in this secondary school.  Accommodation will be provided there for 475 girls at an estimated cost of almost £500,000. Planning is well advanced and it is <Col N="1031" /> hoped that work will begin this summer. I already mentioned Stanhope Street Convent.  A new school to accommodate 500 girls was completed in that area last year.  An extension to Marino vocational school has recently been completed to add to the intake possibilities there.</P>

Payment on their eligible mountain sheep can now be made to three of these applicants on confirmation of the area of mountain grazings in their possession within designated disadvantaged areas.  In three other cases the applicants are ineligible for payments on mountain sheep because the mountain grazings on which their flocks were maintained are not located in designated disadvantaged areas.  Payments will, however, be made shortly in these cases at the lowland rate on all eligible hoggets.  In the remaining case a decision as to the eligibility of the applicant for payments on his sheep will be taken on production of documentary evidence as to his mountain grazing rights.  Payments were originally withheld in these cases pending clarification of the extent to which the individual applicants possessed mountain grazing rights.</P>

It is considered that the provision of this type of equipment should be within the competence of the farmer himself.</P>

The salary being paid by the board is in excess of the recommended maximum and the matter is under consideration in consultation with the Minister for the Public Service.</entry>
            <entry>The chief executive is chairman of one State board and a member of two others.  He is in receipt of a director's fee for one having been in receipt of this fee prior to the adoption in 1974 of the concept of &ldquo;one man one salary&rdquo;.</entry>

      <P>The last report of the National Prices Commission to be published was that for November 1977 which was published on 13 January 1978 and contained details of price increase proposals on which the commission made recommendations <Col N="902" /> during the period 26 October 1977 to 22 November 1977. The information requested by the Deputy, therefore, covers the period 23 November 1977 to 3 March 1978. During this period, two applications were referred by the commission to their consultancy unit for examination, while no applications were referred to outside consultants.  All other applications were examined in detail in the prices division of my Department to ensure that only vouched unavoidable cost increases were allowed for compensatory price increases.  As the remainder of the information requested by the Deputy is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have it circulated with the Official Report.</P>

      <P>The site at Ahabeg was acquired by the IDA in 1976 as a possible location for the construction of concrete platforms for use in connection with offshore oil and gas exploration.  The previous owners had obtained planning permission for platform construction at the site.</P>
      <P>Since then the IDA have carried out a programme of work aimed at collecting the technical information necessary in connection with the construction of concrete platforms at the site. The site will be offered for short-term leasing by the IDA to platform builders in the event of discoveries of offshore oil or gas leading to a demand for such facilities.</P>

      <P>The increased fees are expected to yield additional receipts of £500,000 in 1978.  The last increase in court fees was in 1970 and the increases which are now being imposed take account of the general increase in costs which has occurred since then.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I recently launched an intensive three-year programme to promote Irish goods on the Irish market.  All State agencies will be actively involved in promoting the objectives of this programme.  Under the programme, the Irish Goods Council have been requested by me to have special regard to industrial purchasing.  This is an area which at present involves a significant quantity of imported capital goods and associated components capable of being produced by Irish suppliers.  Architects and consulting engineers are among those who are being provided with up-to-date information regarding suitable Irish suppliers, as part of the efforts to bring about a switch to the purchase of Irish-made goods.</P>

    <P>The numbers of dwellings which will be completed in 1979 and subsequent years by these authorities will depend on the level of the capital allocations which will be made available in these years for their housing programmes. The allocations will be determined at the time in the context of the overall provision in the Public Capital Programme for each year and with regard also to the relative scale and urgency of the housing needs in these authorities' areas and elsewhere in the country.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will state in the case of tenants purchasing local authority houses under tenant purchase schemes where transfers are held up because of local authority title or mapping difficulties, whether they will be given credit against the purchase moneys for rent paid during such periods of delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Sales of local authority houses are effected by means of transfer orders, made under section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966, which are in a prescribed form and specify the date on which the sale becomes effective.  In accordance with section 106 of the Act the transfer order cannot be made until the local authority are satisfied that the house is in good structural condition and a certain amount of time will normally elapse between the making of an application <Col N="924" /> to purchase by the tenant and the making of the transfer order, particularly if structural repairs to the house are required.</P>
      <P>Tenants who have applied to purchase their houses continue to pay rent on the normal basis until the sale becomes effective and they become owners of their houses.  An allowance of tenancy discount at a rate of 3 per cent per annum off the gross price of the house continues to accrue to the tenant up to the effective date of sale subject to the relevant maximum deduction of 30 per cent in built up areas or 45 per cent in other areas.</P>
      <P>It is not possible, therefore, to allow credit against the purchase moneys for rent paid prior to the effective date of sale.  Where, however, inordinate delays occur in the making of transfer orders through no fault of the local authority or of the tenant, I am considering the possibility of granting some concession in so far as the amount of rent payable is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the steps he proposes to take to deal with the fact that road deaths in the second half of 1977 at 344 were the highest on record for a half year period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the figure quoted for the six month period referred to is disturbing, it will be noted that the provisional figure of 576 road deaths for the whole year, is, apart from 1976, the lowest since 1972.  As the Deputy is aware, there was also a substantial increase in the number of vehicles on the roads.  However, I wish to make it clear that I am anything but happy with the figures for death and injury on the roads.</P>
      <P>But, until a detailed analysis of the accident information for 1977 has been made, I cannot say what special measures, if any, may be appropriate. Efforts to promote road safety in relation to the road, the vehicle and the driver will, of course, continue to be made by my Department, the local authorities and the National Road Safety Association assisted by the research activities of An Foras Forbartha, but it is well to remember that the individual road user, whether he be a motorist, cyclist or pedestrian, is at all times responsible for his own safety.  A personal decision to exercise care, courtesy and consideration and to avoid driving under the influence of alcohol is the greatest personal contribution that can be made to road safety.  A special responsibility rests on parents in relation to their children.</P>

      <P>Sanction for the provision of a new national school for Protestant pupils in Clonmel was given by my Department on 4 November 1977.</P>
      <P>A site at Mary Street has been offered and the Commissioners of Public Works will report to my Department as to its suitability.  I have no information as to its cost.</P>

      <P>Present indications are that a school having accommodation in two standard classrooms with a staff of two teachers will be sufficient to meet immediate and future requirements. Such a building would give accommodation for 50 pupils but it would seem that enrolments will be appreciably lower than that figure.</P>
