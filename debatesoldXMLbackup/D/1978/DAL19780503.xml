      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of our discussion on the amendments, it appears that the cost to the householder will be far greater than originally anticipated.  I would ask the Minister to give further consideration to the question of reducing the over-all cost to the householder of acquiring his freehold under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, I would ask him to give consideration to the question of ensuring that the title which the householder will get will be a freehold absolute registered title.  It is clear from our discussions on this section <Col N="161" /> that the title which the householder will get under this Bill will not be a registered title.  The Bill merely provides for a vesting certificate which would not be legally acceptable as a good title.  After going to the expense of obtaining such a vesting certificate under the Bill, the householder will now have to go to the additional expense of registering this title.</P>
    <P>In some cases, particularly where a registration under the provision of the registration of title is involved, that is a registration in the Land Registry, the expenses involved could be very considerable, because it could involve the cost to the householder of obtaining a map for production to the Land Registry.  This could be quite a considerable expense in view of the cost of the Ordnance Survey sheet and the cost of getting it marked by an engineer. It might involve an application equivalent to an application for first registration in the Land Registry.  In that case substantial costs would be involved.  In all cases cost will be involved to the householder.  Even in a simple straightforward case there will be the cost of registration in the Registry of Deeds.  This will involve the preparation of a memorial which is a rather complicated legal document, together with the payment of fees to the Registry of Deeds.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that in no case will a householder obtain an acceptable conveyancing title on payment of the minimum fee of £5.  I have done some investigation and calculations on this matter and it seems to me that the average cost to the householder will probably be of the order of about £50. This type of additional expense could be obviated if the Minister were prepared to agree that the householder should get a registered title having resorted to the provisions of this Bill to acquire his freehold.</P>
    <P>I appreciate this is a general point at this stage but I urge the Minister to give further consideration to the point that the householder will end up with a registered absolute freehold title.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support some of the points made by Deputy <Col N="162" /> O'Keeffe.  Part III deals with the vesting of fee simple in dwellinghouses.  It would appear from what was stated on the last occasion this matter was debated in the House that the Minister is furnishing only a vesting certificate. He said he was providing a scheme to lead to the abolition of ground rents.  I put it to the Minister very strongly that furnishing the vesting certificate on its own is not sufficient.  It is absolutely essential to provide that the person obtains the full fee simple, that he obtains the equivalent of a land certificate which is the basic title deed in relation to farms and quite a large number of houses in Dublin.  Added to that land certificate there will be lodged in the Land Registry a map of the land.  Those are two simple but nevertheless absolutely fundamental and essential items which will be required.</P>
      <P>This whole procedure we are going through in great detail, basically is sidestepping the real issue unless we furnish a full absolute title.  I cannot over-stress the importance of this point.  Our work has been wasted unless we furnish to people buying out ground rents a full absolute fee simple. Basically we are tying in the lesser interest with the superior interest and merging the two.  We must ensure that a person obtains an absolute registered title in the Land Registry and obtains a full land certificate after the completion of all necessary work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that this vesting certificate on its own will not be sufficient.  People will be furnished with vesting certificates to which maps will not be attached and they must have themselves registered.  That was basically the Minister's point.  I said earlier that it is essential that county registrars should do this work and, titles having being fully investigated, the Land Registry would then register them.  We are now providing that a person will be furnished with a vesting certificate and must then have himself registered as owner.  This will lead to an application in the Land Registry for first registration and this is a slow and tortuous procedure.  Maps must be measured precisely and the matter must be looked into by an engineer; <Col N="163" /> all the necessary affidavits must be furnished and the matter must be investigated by the Registrar of Titles. Whether a person gets a possessory title or an absolute title will be decided in the first registration.  It is essential that all of this should take place at the one time and a person should have an absolute title registered in the Land Registry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 23 is a fees section.  The question of whether the vesting certificate does or does not carry with it registration of title has no direct connection with section 23.  It might be appropriate to discuss it in the context of section 22 (3) and section 22 (5) which deal with registration aspects of the vesting certificate procedure.  The registration of title issue might come up again and again and cause serious confusion.  We must be careful of this because we might give the wrong impression and seriously damage this worth-while legislation. We must never get away from the purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not compel purchasing tenants to register their new title. It is not correct to say that the title so acquired is useless without registration. That is not so.  It will be a perfectly good title, whether the house is built on registered or unregistered land.  It will be a statutory title declared to operate as a conveyance free from incumbrance of the fee simple and any intermediate interests.  In addition, it is proposed to keep separate registers of such certificates and of arbitrations.  In these two regards, the vesting certificate will be a better instrument than a privately drawn deed of transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point was made that another purchaser for value could acquire title to property if the vesting certificate had not been registered in the Registry of Deeds.  That is unreal.  There would not be any question of the second purchaser's getting possession of a house which is not the landlord's to sell.  If it is only the ground rent that has been sold to him, he has no security for it while the former tenant has a statutory fee simple.  Why the <Col N="164" /> second purchaser should purchase such property is beyond understanding.</P>
    <P>If registration were to be compulsory it could only be justified on the basis of giving the service free.  This was fully considered in the context of both the former Minister's Bill and the present one and it was never the intention to give such a service.  As I pointed out here, this Bill proposes the reduction to minimal proportions &mdash;and I use those words purposely&mdash; of the legal costs of purchase.  The Government's financial commitment is substantial and there cannot be a question of the taxpayer having to foot the bill for registration, either in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds.  In addition, the physical impact of having to register as many as 250,000 extra cases over five years could be very serious.</P>
    <P>It is accepted, of course, that registration is desirable and consideration is being given, as I have already said, to designing procedures which will encourage house owners to register, particularly where they acquire the fee simple in unregistered land.  The cost of registration of the vesting certificate in the Registry of Deeds would be £4; the cost of first registration of a house valued at £20 in the Land Registry would be £5.50; the cost of transfer from the leasehold register to the freehold register of a house with a ground rent of £10 would be £2.90 and the cost of registering the fee simple of a house valued at £20 on registered land would be £5.60.  A map would be required only in the second example, that is, first registration in the Land Registry, and that would have to be paid for by the applicant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spelled out the position on a number of occasions during discussion on the amendments. It should come as no surprise to anybody who understands the purpose of the Bill and the purpose of my predecessor's Bill.  We all want to see this problem being tackled; it is not a political football.  I believe that what we are enacting through the Oireachtas <Col N="165" /> will provide a scheme whereby people may buy out their ground rents at minimal costs.  I have dealt with the question of registration and I am quite prepared to give every consideration to encouraging people to register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister possibly underestimates the necessity to register. He agrees that it is desirable, but any practising lawyer will tell him that an unregistered title would not be acceptable from the conveyancing point of view.  In that context it is not only desirable but virtually essential.  I accept that it is not essential in most cases to convey the freehold but anyone who owns his house must be in a situation where he can freely sell that house.  In some cases it is essential and that applies in the area of compulsory registration where, under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, the document of transfer is inoperative unless it is registered within six months.</P>
      <P>The people should not be misled on this.  I agree with the Minister that people should be encouraged to use this Act but it must be made clear that in the context of registration anybody wishing to benefit from this Act should register their title.  In relation to the cost, the fees mentioned by the Minister relate solely to the fees payable to the relevant Government Department, be it the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds.  The fee which one would pay to the Land Registry in relation to an application for first registration is quite small but the Minister may not be aware that it is normally necessary to prepare an affidavit about five pages long covering all sorts of historical background, making the case for registration. In addition rulings on title are issued which are often very complicated and involve further expense in getting certificates from the Valuation Office, the Registry of Deeds and so on. If the Minister considers that registration is such a simple procedure he should be made aware that it is not so simple that any ordinary person could do it without legal assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take considerable encouragement from the Minister's reference to simplified procedures for registration.  This is highly desirable.  In many cases <Col N="166" /> where unregistered property is involved, to register a deed it is necessary to prepare a document called a memorial, and to have this sworn before a commissioner, and a person without legal experience could not do this.  If the Minister as part of this scheme were prepared to look at the simplification of registration procedures, it would be a considerable addition.  Subject to that, and subject to the householders and the ground rent tenants knowing what the situation is, we can leave the matter rest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In endeavouring to minimise the costs involved in this matter the Minister has made a special effort.  In some instances we are dealing with quite valuable properties and what may be occurring is that in the efforts to minimise the costs the Minister is going some of the way but not all of the way.  In relation to the application for first registration which the Minister referred to it is not good enough to say that the fee involved is £2 or £3.  The preparation of the application for first registration will take a long time and will be expensive as there is a lot of work involved.  It is essential that the application be made immediately upon the issuing of the vesting certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of a difference between us as to whether we should compulsorily require people to do it or encourage them to do it or to do it for them.  Registration becomes essential in relation to land before a sale takes place and until such time as another transaction takes place one can encourage people to do what they want to do rather than cause the terrible problems which compulsion would cause.  In an effort to encourage people certain procedures can be worked out to give people an incentive to go ahead and do what we all believe is best.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>A middle course would be to simplify the procedure so that in effect people could do it themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

      <P>In page 13, lines 40 and 41, to delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>This section gives me some concern. This section deals with the duty of the Registrar of Titles as to applications under Part III of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the vesting of fee simple in dwelling houses.  The section deals basically with the order in which they are received under this part.  Does the Minister intend to extend the five-year period mentioned earlier in the Bill?  If a number of people do not move to have their fee simples purchased until about four-and-a-half years after the passage of the Act it could occur that quite a large amount of applications that are not processed will be on hands at the end of the five-year period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill says:</P>
      <P>No action shall lie against the Registrar in relation to the duty imposed upon him under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That section is unnecessary.  Any Government Department or semi-State body involved in a matter of this nature should be accountable for any mistakes they make.  They must be liable to pay any costs that arise from actions brought against them in court. Otherwise a Government Department <Col N="168" /> is being exempted from liability and responsibility in court.  That sort of exemption should not be included in legislation of this nature.  Professional people, Government Departments and semi-State bodies should be required to stand by their decisions and should be held accountable for their mistakes. In this House if anybody makes a mistake he or she has the press and the public to answer to and that is a good thing. I cannot see why the Minister is asking the House more or less to indemnify the registrar against his responsibilities under this section.  I can see no reason why the registrar should be exempt from responsibility in our courts.  Until I hear good reasons from the Minister for this situation I shall continue to hold that view.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have answered the first question raised by the Deputy.  In answering the second one I probably answered the first also. The Deputy is right in assuming that the Bill covers a five-year period and no more than that, but I assure him that any application received before the expiry of the period will be processed. Once notice of an application is given the rights of the person concerned are protected all down the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that no action shall lie against the registrar in relation to a duty imposed under the section, that is the duty to deal with applications in order of receipt.  Section 24 (1) imposes a duty on the Registrar of Titles to deal with applications in order of receipt.  This is tempered by the discretion given by the registrar in subsection (2) to depart from the strict order of receipt in very clearcut circumstances.  This is an unusual statutory provision; rarely does a statute regulate details of administrative procedure.  It is considered necessary in this Bill because of the likelihood that the scheme will attract a very large response on the passing of the Act.  It would be most inappropriate <Col N="169" /> if a legal action should lie against the registrar because of the way he uses or refuses to use his discretion. I believe it could defeat the purpose of the section which is to achieve maximum efficiency in dealing with applications if such actions could be brought.  I also believe, and I hope the Deputy will accept, that ridiculous results could ensue if the registrar were open to an action.  Cases to be dealt with today would have to be held up until a more difficult case which had priority had been completed.  I think the Deputy and I are <i>ad idem</i> on this, that there is a long delay in matters being dealt with in the Land Registry.  I gave a very considered opinion earlier in the debate that at least 25 per cent of the delay is due to the fact that people want to jump the gun in having their applications dealt with.  I am as guilty as any Deputy in respect of approaches of people I represent, whether professional people or others who want jobs done, in going to the Land Registry to get ahead of somebody else.  That accounts for at least 25 per cent of the actual delay.  I am strongly advised that for proper working of this Bill we will ensure maximum efficiency by having it as it is.  I think this is commonsense.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister in relation to the priority being given to applications under the Bill.  The Bill may be a little loose as regards the circumstances in which the registrar would exercise discretion to take a particular application out of its normal place in the list but, knowing the common sense of those who work in the Land Registry I think the provision will be used sensibly by them.  I <Col N="170" /> can see situations of considerable difficulty relating to somebody selling a property or possibly obtaining a mortgage where a special effort has to be made to complete the job as quickly as possible.  I approve of the section, having shared to some extent the reservation of my colleague.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this section.  I have already given some reasons for my views.  I believe that this is a matter that ideally should be dealt with at the different levels by the county registrar in the various counties. Now, as outlined earlier by the Minister, when people will receive only a vesting certificate and where the registration is not actually concluded and the person not actually registered in the Land Registry as a result of an application under this Bill, I feel more strongly than ever that the matter can be dealt with quite simply and efficiently by the county registrars.  All our county registrars are skilled in legal matters and have many years experience and they would have little difficulty in dealing with these applications and furnishing vesting certificates.  If the matter were brought under the jurisdiction of county registrars it would mean additional staff being employed in the 26 or 27 offices throughout the country.  It would mean decentralisation which would be spontaneous and proper.  Much of the decentralisation has been of a forced type but in this <Col N="171" /> instance it would be on a proper basis. When dealing with this section I believe it is essential that the Minister should give this view serious consideration as it is most important.</P>

      <P>The Chair would like to point out that we had a very long debate on this matter already and also a division, if I am correct.  I do not want to curtail any discussion on this section but it is only right to point out what is the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

      <P>Ideally the applications should be processed through the county registrars and my view was reinforced when we were told that the vesting certificates will be furnished.  This could be done by the county registrar and the person could then go to the Land Registry or to the Registry of Deeds at a later stage to have registration effected.</P>
      <P>If my first choice is not accepted, my second choice&mdash;one that has not been proposed by any party up to now &mdash;would be the Land Commission. There is not the same shortage of staff as in the Land Registry.  Have the Department considered that there are many qualified legal advisers in the Land Commission offices in Dublin? I accept that there may be some difficulties with the various Land Acts and the setting up of the Land Commission but I doubt it.  In the Land Commission offices throughout the country there are people skilled in mapping, who are <i>au fait</i> with legal technicalities and familiar with local circumstances. The annuities on many of the holdings throughout the country are almost bought out and, consequently, there are people in the collection branches in the Land Commission who might be able to help with regard to this Bill.  I know that the people concerned are quite busy but many of the estates with which they are dealing have been bought out and the Minister may be able to use those people to help in implementing the measure before the House.  These people might be attached to the Land Commission offices throughout the country or based in Dublin or Castlebar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> The functions, powers and duties to be conferred on the Registrar of Titles will be limited enough.  They will be limited to the furnishing of the vesting certificate and dealing with arbitration and so on.  They will not furnish the full absolute fee simple. They go only a certain distance and this could be dealt with more effectively first by the county registrar or, secondly, through the Land Commission. I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.  The functions and powers could be much more appropriately dealt with by those two bodies.</P>

      <P>I wish to comment on the section from another angle. The section purports to permit the powers and duties to be delegated to officers, I presume to officers of the Land Registry, not of the Department of Justice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

      <P>Under the provisions of section 21 the arbitration powers and duties provided for in the 1967 Act will apply for the purpose of this measure.  Therefore, the position is that the powers and duties that can be exercised by the Registrar of Titles or by any of his officers as shall be authorised include the powers and duties that are superimposed as a result of the earlier provisions in the 1967 Act.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to look at the extent of those powers and duties.  Under section 17 (3) these powers include the right to make an order for security for costs, discovery and inspection of documents and interrogatories, the giving of evidence by affidavit and, most important, the examination on oath of any witness.  It is clear to me that any person who has such powers is carrying out a judicial function and in so doing we must look at the type of person that will carry out that function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Minister to the discussions that took place on the 1965 Bill that was subsequently enacted in 1967. I was not a Member of this House at the time but I understand that exception was taken to a similar power in the 1965 Bill, to some extent in this House and to a greater extent in the <Col N="173" /> Upper House, on a number of points but particularly on a constitutional basis.</P>
    <P>The points made at the time were accepted by the then Minister and the particular power of delegation was withdrawn.  I am concerned that we have this power in the Bill before the House.  I appreciate the necessity for it.  It results from the fact that we are transferring the arbitration powers from county registrars throughout the country and centralising it with the registrar and he will not be able to deal with all of them.  It is a by-product of that decision.  In arbitration proceedings under the 1967 Act every single one had to be conducted personally by the county registrar and where the county registrar for one reason or another&mdash;particularly if he had a personal interest&mdash;could not deal with the arbitration himself he nominated the county registrar for the adjoining or other county to deal with the matter. In effect, it was the county registrar himself who dealt with the matter.</P>
    <P>Previously I raised the question of the Registrar of Titles carrying out a judicial function.  I am not referring to the present Registrar of Titles personally but I think it relevant to look at the basis and the requirements of the appointment.  Normally the county registrar has practice and experience in the courts but there is no necessity for such practice and experience on the part of the Registrar of Titles.  Even more so, what will be the qualifications of the officers nominated to carry out these judicial functions?  If such power of delegation had been left in the earlier Act, the messenger in the courthouse could have been nominated to carry out arbitration proceedings because he was an officer who would come within the terms of that provision. I am concerned about the constitutionality of the matter.  The Minister has assured me that he has looked into it.  I do not know if the points I am now raising have been considered. I am also concerned from the point of view of justice not alone being done but being seen to be done.  I have absolute faith in the impartiality of the registrar and I have faith in the fairness and impartiality of the <Col N="174" /> people in the Land Registry.  We must ensure that the people who carry out arbitrations, those who carry out judicial functions, are qualified to do so.</P>
    <P>I am raising the question of constitutionality and I am also raising the latter point that anybody going before an arbitrator must be assured that the person carrying out that judicial function has the proper qualifications to do so.  This can be done by having a further look at this section, by limiting it to people with such proper qualifications.  In the light of what has been said from this side of the House in a non-political sense and in an effort to make sure that the Bill will be a good one when it leaves the House, the constitutionality aspect might be looked at again.  The question of tightening up the provisions of this section to ensure that anybody carrying out arbitration has proper qualifications to do so should be looked at.  The House and the public should be assured that those who carry out arbitrations are members of the Land Registry who have qualifications and, if possible, experience in dealing with the type of matters which would come up on an arbitration.</P>

      <P>Section 25 is a provision somewhat on the lines of section 13 of the Registration of Titles Act, 1964 and provides, as is agreed is obviously necessary, that any of the powers and duties of the Registrar of Titles under part 3 may be exercised and performed by such other officers of the Land Registry as the Minister for Justice of the day may authorise in that behalf.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright might not hold it against me if I do not deal with his suggestion about the Land Commission because I would probably be out of order in dealing with it.  This is a very wide area and I do not think that I could deal with it under this particular section.

However, I am very definitely assured of the constitutionality of the overall position concerning arbitration by the Registrar or by his officers.

      <P>I move Amendment No. 46:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (2), line 4, to delete &ldquo;acquisition of the fee simple&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the lease or for the period during which any part of the purchase price of the leasehold interest remains unpaid, whichever is the greater&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment is intended to go practically all the way towards meeting the point of Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment. The Deputy wants the 25-year period in which local authorities are being allowed a measure of control over houses bought from them at fee simple to start to run not from the date of <Col N="176" /> the acquisition of the fee simple as in the Bill but from the earlier date on which the leasehold interest was acquired by the tenant.</P>
    <P>My amendment achieves this except in a case where the tenant has not in effect purchased the house, although he has been given a lease, for the simple reason that he has not completed the payment of the purchase price.  This is necessary because the lease or transfer order under which the house was originally leased also operates as a mortgage agreement.  The principle of the Deputy's amendment, however, is being conceded, that is that the 25 years are to run from the time when the tenant effectively becomes the owner of the house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's approach to this particular problem.  The reason I put down the amendment was that I felt it was unfair that the clear freehold should date from the date of the operation of this Bill to acquire the freehold.  We could find a situation where somebody with a local authority lease going back many years would have a further 25 years added on to his term whereas somebody who had purchased under a tenant purchase scheme, perhaps in the previous 12 months, would then only have an additional 25 years added on.  It seems to me to be unjust and unfair.  I accept that the Minister has made a gallant effort to deal with the point.</P>
      <P>It is not really of much use to a local authority tenant to have his freehold while the lease term lasts or while a part of the purchase price for the leasehold remains outstanding.  In effect, all the other conditions will apply during that time.  I can see that there are difficulties in that area and that there is need for some control for a limited period.  The effect of the amendment now proposed by the Minister at least provides a greater amount of fairness and equity between local authority purchasers.  On that basis I am prepared to accept that a fair attempt is being made to do that.</P>

      <P>The Minister is continuing some of the terms and conditions in the lease for a period.  If <Col N="177" /> the tenant pays the purchase price that is due on the property why is it necessary to impose any terms and conditions further?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a strong desire on the part of local authorities to preserve their stocks of houses.  As the Deputy is aware, they are not open to people who are not eligible for housing. This, I believe, is an effort to try to preserve stocks of houses.  There are certain counties, in particular seaside counties, where local authority houses would be very comfortable summer homes for a lot of people who are not eligible for subsidised housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

People buying out their house from a local authority must pay the market value and they are being restricted in their dealings with the property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

      <P>In so far as the restriction on the terms and conditions only affects the right of resale to people who come within the meaning of the Labourers Acts&mdash;they are very wide and cover a multitude of people&mdash;I would go along with the Minister in this.  The Minister's amendment states:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (2), line 4, to delete &ldquo;acquisition of the fee simple&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the lease or for the period during which any part of the purchase price of the leasehold interest remains unpaid, whichever is the greater&rdquo;.</P>

If I get a loan from a building society to build a house and later decide to sell it there is no prohibition on me, but there is a restriction on those living in local authority houses even though they pay the full market price.  People must pay between £8,000 and £9,000 for a county council semi-detached house with a small front garden and in many cases no rear garden.  Would the Minister give more thought to this because those people are entitled to a fair crack of the whip.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 29 and 30, to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9) Where a housing authority has not the fee simple in any land on which it has provided dwellings under the Housing Act, 1966, the authority shall be entitled to acquire the fee simple and for that purpose the provisions of Part II shall apply to the authority.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is essentially a drafting amendment intended to cater for the situation where the local authority must give the fee simple but has only a leasehold interest itself.  Under section 3 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, the local authority is deemed to be the lessee and as such has of course the right to acquire the fee simple.  However, a doubt has arisen as to whether this provision of the 1931 Act can be properly applied. If applied it could be held that the local authority must act for each individual tenant in the acquisition of the fee simple from the superior lessor and this is not what is intended.  What <Col N="179" /> is wanted is that the local authority can move to get the fee simple of all or any of the land on which it has built houses so that it can comply with the Act.  In cases of dispute, for instance, as to the purchase price it is the 1967 Act procedure which will apply and not Part III of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The section provides that it shall operate in relation to the leases to tenants of dwellings provided by the housing authority under the 1966 Housing Act.  I am concerned about the situation in relation to houses provided by housing authorities prior to 1966.  I accept that under the 1966 Act there is a provision which incorporates houses provided under earlier housing Acts.  I want to ensure that the terms would not be confined to those who purchased under the 1966 Act and that tenants who got a lease of a local authority house under a <Col N="180" /> tenant purchase scheme prior to that year would also be entitled to the benefit of this section.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the position I would like to go on record as welcoming this section.  The entitlement of a person to take possession of a dwelling-house if the occupant failed to pay the rent, which was often quite small but may have been a sizeable amount to the tenant concerned who had rights in the dwelling-house, was a great bone of contention and caused widespread unrest throughout the length and breadth of the country. This provision which prevents landlords from entering upon property and ejecting tenants for non-payment of rent is welcome.  The provision whereby the Minister allows the landlord to sue for moneys due as an ordinary debt is welcome also in that it does not take away the right of the landlord to moneys due to him.  It prevents him from acting like an oldtime landlord using the iron fist, coming <Col N="182" /> in and taking possession of a dwelling-house and ejecting the occupants. That was a scandalous situation which went back to ancient times.  It is good that the provision of right of entry is being scrapped.  This whole section is very welcome and Deputies on all sides of the House must be in agreement with it.</P>

      <P>I would like to endorse what Deputy Enright has said. The old concept of eviction brings up memories of our historical past.  I agree totally with the suggestion of the Minister that the right of re-entry, the right in effect of eviction, should be withdrawn.  It is no harm to make it clear, however, that such right is withdrawn only in the case of ground rents, and we are dealing solely with ground rents in this Bill.  Hopefully, in the near future problems in other areas of landlord and tenant will be before this House.  There is great urgency in that area, but we will clear the ground rents question first.  We have nearly finished the Bill.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the drafting of this section?  The right of re-entry arose first of all under a normally specific term of these leases, and it also arose by way of ejectment for non-payment of rent.  There are other rights of ejectment which possibly could arise; ejectment for breach of covenant and so on.  No right of ejectment should arise in any case where a ground rent is involved; where in effect the person who owns the house is the person in possession who is obviously paying only a few pounds a year in ground rent.  That is the owner of the house, and in such cases all rights of ejection or eviction should be removed.  I can see situations arising where the landlord could be raising a point on breach of covenant.  Perhaps the Minister would look at this aspect as to whether all rights of ejectment and eviction in such cases should be removed.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a) Notwithstanding sub-section (2) of this section, if and whenever the Minister, as respects a local financial year, so provides by order, a rating authority (within the meaning of the said Local Government Act, 1946) shall not apply the Act aforesaid to a person, as respects that local financial year, if the valuation of all the tenements of agricultural land in the rating area of the authority in respect of which he is rated equals or exceeds the amount standing specified, on the first day of that year, in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974.</P>

    <P>This amendment will enable the provisions of section 1 to be modified by ministerial order in relation to a particular year.  As circulated, the Bill would limit the relief to holdings of less than £75 land valuation in 1978. For the purpose of the limit, the total of the land valuation of a farmer anywhere in the State would have to be taken into account as the Bill stands now.  The amendment will allow the position to be eased.  This will mean that each county council will take account only of any holding a farmer may have in its own rating area.  If the amendment is agreed it is my intention to make an order in respect of 1978, the effect of which will be that the less widespread form of aggregation provided for in the amendment will operate in 1978 instead of the national type of aggregation provided <Col N="186" /> for in section 1 (2) of the Bill as it stands.</P>

      <P>To delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) Whenever an order is proposed to be made under paragraph (a) of this subsection a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft order has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am having some difficulty in understanding the effect of the amendment moved by the Minister.  Section 1 (2) provides that section 1 shall not be applied by a local authority to any rated occupier if all the hereditaments of which he is rated, wherever they are, exceed the specified figure.  If section 2 is to stand as it is, the effect will be that if a farmer has a valuation of, say, £50 in county A and of £30 in county B, he will not get any agricultural relief grant this year.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment says simply that:</P>
      <P>In page 2, after line 19, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a) Notwithstanding sub-section (2) of this section, if and whenever the Minister, as respects a local financial year, so provides by order, a rating authority (within the meaning of the said Local Government Act, 1946) shall not apply the Act aforesaid to a person, as respects that local financial year, if the valuation of all the tenements of agricultural land in the rating area of the authority in respect of which he is rated equals or exceeds the amount standing specified, on the first day of that year, in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="187" /> That is clear.  If the Minister makes this order the Act shall not be applied to a farmer who may have several different ratings in the same county or rating area if all those ratings together are equal to or exceed the specified amount.  If my thinking is right&mdash;I am doing the Minister's work for him&mdash; but if I understand it the new sub-section (3) will be in addition to and not in substitution for the existing section 2.  In that case when the Minister by order brings into operation the new subsection (3) he is not taking any power to suspend the existing subsection (2).  The existing subsection (2) and the new subsection, if I am correct, would be in force at the same time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

If the amendment is accepted and I make an order excluding that particular rated occupier's holding in a rating authority area other than the one in which he lives, it will be excluded for 1978.  If a man has a £50 valuation in county A and a £30 valuation in county B he will get relief because the aggregate will not count in 1978.  It may appear complicated but the draftsman and particularly my legal advisers have assured me that this is how it will work.</P>

The specialists may have a better knowledge of this than I have and their opinions may be worth more, but anybody can make a mistake.  I could understand the amendment if it read:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, if and whenever the Minister, as respects a local financial year, so provides by order, subsection (2) shall stand suspended and...</P>

It is amazing that if my total <Col N="190" /> valuation exceeds £75 I am lucky enough to get this remission but a farmer with a total valuation of £80 situated wholly in Offaly gets no rates remission whatsoever.

Why does the Minister not extend the remission to everybody? This is necessary if he is to be fair because he is discriminating against people who have land in one county only.</P>
      <P>A farmer with a valuation of over £75 is not getting any relief in regard to educational or health matters, but if his land is in two counties he gets rates relief.  That is amazing and unusual. The number of people involved is relatively small but I can see no logic or common sense in what the Minister is doing.  We agree with the amendment but it should be extended to cover everybody.  The Minister intends to give rates relief to farmers with valuation under £75 in 1978 and £60 in 1979, but he should extend this concession to everybody.</P>

      <P>It is not discriminatory in any way.  If it is, the rating system has been disciminatory for years.  The Deputy must know that if his friend had a valuation of £40 in County Offaly and £40 valuation in County Tipperary for some years, he got full primary allowance in Offaly and Tipperary since the allowances were introduced <Col N="191" /> and he also got full supplementary allowance in Offaly and Tipperary. This is not unusual.  It cannot be described as amazing because this is the way it always happened.  My amendment means that they will not be aggregated.  If a man had two holdings of £40 valuation in Offaly heretofore they were grouped under one total valuation of £80 but if he had £40 valuation in another rating authority, they were not grouped.  There is nothing unusual here; it is not discriminatory. It is not a new departure.</P>

I have no objection to that because any relief is better than none but it is absurd in the extreme.  As Deputy D'Arcy pointed out this year a man can have a valuation of £200 provided it is in four different counties and will enjoy rates relief but if he has a valuation of £200 in one county he will be penalised.  This is absurd and shows the complete and utter absurdity of the rating system which the Minister comes here to defend.  That is unjustifiable.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask about the amendment which is allowing the Minister to prevent the aggregation of valuations from one county to another.  Is it possible to construe the amendment as allowing the Minister to reduce the threshold under section 15 (3) of the Finance Act 1974 by order?  On my first reading I must say I did not get the full import of the amendment and it is only now that I realise there is a possible alternative interpretation.  Section 1 (2) provides that:</P>
      <P>A rating authority (within the meaning of the Local Government Act, 1946) shall not apply the Act aforesaid to a person, as respects a local financial year, if the valuation of all the tenements of agricultural land in respect of which he is rated equals or exceeds the amount standing specified, on the first day of that year, in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974.</P>
      <P>I should like an assurance from the Minister that it will not be possible to use this procedure to reduce the amount specified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act is designed to give £38.5 million relief and, if the aggregate comes to £75 or more within a rating year, the authority may not apply the Act&mdash;in other words, may not apply the relief.  The Act gives supplementary and primary reliefs but it may not be applied by a single rating <Col N="193" /> authority if the aggregate of a person's rated holdings comes to £75 or more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of a farmer with a valuation of £80 who is in Peamount Sanatorium, a married man with a wife and children attending secondary school who do not qualify for higher education grants. That man qualifies for no benefit under the Health Acts.  He will get no benefit from rates relief.  A neighbour with a holding valued at £40 in Offaly, another valued at £40 in Tipperary and a third holding valued at £40 in Wexford will be entitled to full rates relief in each of the three counties. There will be no aggregation.  I believe relief should be given to the farmer I mentioned who is ill in Peamount Sanatorium.  For him there will be no right of appeal.  He will have to pay. Surely there is a question mark over a rating system which permits that kind of thing to happen.  The Minister has been involved in politics for many years.  I am astonished at our passing a Bill like this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the arguments are in favour of a national aggregation of all the holdings.  This would place an additional burden on the amount available and would mean less relief for all.  If rates cause severe hardship, as would appear to be the case in the instance Deputy Enright gave, the county manager at his own discretion can give a waiver.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, at his recent meeting with the British Prime Minister, he discussed with the latter the recommendation of the Speaker's Conference to increase the number of Northern Ireland seats in the Westminister Parliament from 12 to 17, which recommendation has since been accepted by the British Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My views on the recommendations of the Speaker's Conference are well known to Mr. Callaghan to whom I expressed concern at our meeting last September on the grounds that implementation could be regarded as evidence of greater integration. I obtained a firm assurance that there was not a scintilla of a move towards integration and, further, the Prime Minister expressed the view that the British people would not agree to such a move.  The Copenhagen meeting looked back to that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short term, I am satisfied that proposals for a system of limited devolution of powers to an elected <Col N="195" /> body remain on the table and that British policy is to achieve a devolved administration involving power sharing, participation or partnership&mdash; however described&mdash;on a basis acceptable to both sections of the community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, however, I remain firm in my belief that the only basis for a just and lasting peace there and for the social and economic progress of which the area is capable, is in the coming together of the people of this island in reconciliation and under agreed structures. I believe that a British declaration favouring such a move would help greatly to make it a reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the report which he gave to the House on the September meeting the Taoiseach said he was pleased to have received an assurance from the British Prime Minister that there was not a scintilla of a move towards integration.  Surely that is not in accordance with the acceptance now by the British Government of the Speaker's Conference recommendation for increased representation at Westminister for Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I can accept that interpretation of the statement made to me and the assurance given by the British Prime Minister in September.

As I have indicated, I got an unequivocal indication that there was not a move towards integration and I accepted that in good faith, and I think my acceptance is still justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Care has to be taken in drawing inferences from the ratio between the number of High Court judges and the number of courtrooms available to High Court judges in the Four Courts since High Court judges have duties to discharge elsewhere also as, for instance, in places other than Dublin when on circuit.  In fact courtroom accommodation for High Court judges in the Four Courts has not been a serious problem though on occasions an extra room would have been utilised if it had been available and this would have been of some help to the judges in disposing of cases.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are well advanced which, <i>inter alia</i>, will have the effect of making an extra courtroom available to the High Court in Dublin in the course of the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that on occasion judges go on circuit, but is it not true that there are ten High Court judges and that there are eight rooms available, occasionally nine, but there is one judge who, with the recent increase, is receiving £14,221 per annum, who has no courtroom available to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the opening part of my reply in which I said that care has to be taken in drawing inferences from the ratio between the number of High Court judges and the number of courtrooms available.  I understand the number of High Court judges, including the President, is ten and the number of High Court courtrooms in the Four Courts is eight.  Courtrooms Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, are High Court courtrooms. The equivalent of the time of one High Court judge is devoted to sittings of the Special Criminal Court. On occasions when the Court of Criminal Appeal is sitting, the time of all ten High Court judges could be taken up by sittings in Dublin, because a Supreme Court judge and two High Court judges sit simultaneously in this court.  At present, the Court of Criminal Appeal on average sits on one day per fortnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as sitting in Dublin, the time of High Court judges is taken up <Col N="199" /> hearing appeals and some original actions at provincial venues on circuit. Judges go on circuit in October and March each year for three weeks, approximately, on each occasion, and usually two judges, including sometimes Supreme Court judges, go to each of four circuits simultaneously. Two judges go to Cork in January, April and July for two weeks on each occasion for the hearing of original actions, mostly jury cases.  Judges work in their chambers on the preparation of reserved judgments, the vetting of stenographers' transcripts and the writing of notes in cases where stenographers' notes were not taken on cases appealed to the High Court, and the reading of relevant papers for sittings of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The Deputy therefore will see why care should be taken when speaking of the number of rooms and the number of judges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for raising this is because quite a number of practising barristers have told me that on occasions they have seen judges with no place available to sit.  It is because of this that I raise it.  In Deputy O'Keeffe's question he asked the Minister about the delays in High Court trials.  In his reply the Minister said a courtroom would have been utilised if it were available.  In other words, he admits there is a lack of available space.  Is the Minister aware that, if a High Court trial is put down for hearing today, it will not be heard this year?  Is the Minister aware that a simple action like an action involving a car accident takes approximately 12 months to be brought on for hearing? Is the Minister aware of the inconvenience and the losses this is causing to clients, insurance companies, and so on?  Has he any statement to make in reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that, during the course of Committee Stage on the Landlord and Tenants (Ground Rents) No. 2 Bill, which we finished today, reference was made to this subject.  I should like to say again it is expected that new court accommodation in an office block adjacent to the Four Courts, which was <Col N="200" /> Ormonde House, will be ready for occupation very soon&mdash;I would hope at the end of May or perhaps in June. This new accommodation will include a court chamber and ancillary accommodation for the hearing of High Court family law cases.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the delays in the courts.  As I understand it, the statistics of High Court business for the Michaelmas Term show there has been a considerable increase in the volume of business compared with the corresponding period in 1976.  The average delay from the date of setting down to the date of hearing was nine months in the case of jury actions and three months in the case of non-jury actions as compared with seven-and-a-half and two-and-a-half months respectively on 31 July 1977.  It is proposed to discuss the position as regards the increasing volume of business and the increased delay period with the President of the High Court in the near future particularly in the light of the new court chamber becoming available in Ormonde House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that some new ground rents have been created since the Bill to prevent the creation of such rents on dwelling-houses was initiated, it is not possible to get any precise information <Col N="205" /> as to the number of such rents.  However, the information available to me would suggest that in anticipation of the legislation the practice of selling new houses in fee simple has largely replaced the former practice of selling them leasehold.</P>
      <P>The legislation in question is, as the Deputy is aware, framed in terms of voiding ground rent leases made after its passing.  It would not be appropriate that a provision of this kind should operate retrospectively.  However, lessees under the leases to which the question relates have the right to acquire the fee simple at any time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Some builders may have no choice but to continue to give leaseholds until the Bill becomes law because they may have only leaseholds themselves.  Under the Bill they would be able to get a fee simple and to pass it on.  Until the Bill becomes law the sale of the leasehold is lawful and cannot be made unlawful retrospectively.</P>

      <P>The arrangements, including protection arrangements, that are made for the movement of public money must take account of a variety of factors, but I believe that any attempt on my part to go into detail as to why certain procedures are or are not adopted would only play into the hands of persons planning similar crimes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative change to which the Deputy refers is presumably the restoration of the &ldquo;right of option&rdquo;, that is to say, the right accorded to persons detained under emergency legislation to opt to leave Argentina and go into exile in any country that will accept them.  I am aware that this right was suspended by the Argentine authorities in March 1976 and was restored on 27 September 1977 subject to some limitations, by a new Institutional Law (21.650).</P>
      <P>Applications by aliens to enter Ireland are judged on a case-by-case basis, and each case is decided on its own merits.  Any application from an individual detainee from Argentina would have to be considered in the light not only of the position of the individual concerned, but also of the situation in which he would be likely to find himself on admission into Ireland, and his general prospects of being able to integrate successfully here.</P>
      <P>I understand that the term &ldquo;prisoners of conscience&rdquo; is used by Amnesty International to refer to persons who are imprisoned because of their political beliefs and who do not advocate violence as a means of bringing about political change.  The Deputy will be aware that many persons were arrested in Argentina in 1976 and 1977 and that all of them would not necessarily fall into this category.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under a procedure instituted in 1975, the British authorities furnish to my Department on a weekly basis a list of terrorist incidents which, they allege, have their origin within or a connection with the Republic. Figures are not compiled attributing responsibility for incidents to specific organisations.  In the course of 1977, 28 incidents were alleged by the British authorities to have a connection with the Republic.  This is 1.06 per cent of the total number of terrorist-type incidents in Northern Ireland during 1977, as published by the British authorities.</P>
      <P>I have not received from the British authorities any evidence which would justify putting any other construction on their statistics than that less than 2 per cent of the violence in the North has a direct connection with the Border.</P>

      <P>No.  One of our concerns was that our very success would be turned against us.  I am not suggesting that the implication in the Deputy's question is such.  This again is a case of the vigilance and effectiveness of our security forces.  It is fair to say that their record stands up very favourably in comparison with the record of any other security forces on any side of the Border.  When we apprehend any particular criminals or any sources of arms this should not be used as an implication that in fact we are less than successful in dealing with it.  It is the very opposite.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that at the meeting which the Taoiseach and I had with the British Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in London on 28 September it was agreed that it would be of mutual advantage to improve practical co-operation between the two countries on economic matters and that officials of the two Governments would meet to review the arrangements and opportunities for economic co-operation with particular reference to Northern Ireland.  It was agreed they would review current and proposed cross-Border studies and identify subjects and areas for further examination with EEC assistance where appropriate.  At their meeting in Copenhagen on 7 April the Taoiseach and British Prime Minister reaffirmed the agreement reached at the London meeting.</P>
      <P>Officials of the two Governments have had a number of meetings since September 1977 and have recently submitted reports to their respective Governments.  These reports are now being considered and I expect to be in a position to make a further announcement on the matter in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will also recall that on 13 December 1977 the two Governments <Col N="219" /> published the report of a study by consultants of cross-Border communications in the Derry and Donegal area.  Both Governments are at present studying the recommendations of the consultants in relation to the various aspects of communications dealt with in this report with a view to working out programmes of action, with EEC aid where appropriate, based on these recommendations.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that cross-Border discussions in relation to co-operation only started as a result of the September 1976 meeting? Were there no such discussions prior to this?

      <P>No.  I am not suggesting that they only started in September 1977.  I can fairly say that they were given a new priority and impetus in 1977 and since.  I am not suggesting that they should only be at official level.  That obviously is the first stage.  The political level follows.  I can assure the Deputy that this will be the pattern of the discussions in the first instance, official analysis, and in the second instance, political agreement.

    <P>The provisions of the UK Prevention of Terrorism Act within Great Britain and Northern Ireland apply to <Col N="223" /> all persons irrespective of citizenship. Any Irish citizen who is in any doubt about his position under the Act should contact my Department or the Irish Embassy in London, where every effort will be made to give all appropriate information.</P>
    <P>The administration of the Act is of course the responsibility of the UK authorities and I have direct information only about such cases as are drawn specifically to my attention.  I am, however, aware from figures published by the British authorities that 2,222 persons were detained at ports in Great Britain under the Prevention of Terrorism Acts from their entry into force up to 7 April 1978. This figure can include those leaving as well as entering Britain.  While no official information is available on the citizenship of those detained, I understand that the vast majority of those detained have Irish citizenship.  There is no breakdown available by calendar year of the numbers detained at points of entry into Britain but the following numbers were detained at ports in consecutive periods since the entry into force of the 1974 Act:</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that from the point of view of our citizens this shows a continuous escalation of harassment of our people coming from and going to Britain and that he has a responsibility to be interested in more than the people who are drawn to his attention?  Surely it is the responsibility of our diplomatic service to know what is happening to Irish citizens in such circumstances, and he should take a more positive attitude to this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>For clarification, I agree that when figures are read like that it might seem to show an escalation. It does not; if anything there is <Col N="224" /> a diminution.  That is not to say that we are very satisfied.  Our Ambassador and our Embassy in London have taken a very positive role in relation to this.  They have maintained constant liaison and contact with the British authorities to ascertain as quickly as possible what citizens, if any, are being held from time to time and what assistance and advice are available to them. I assure the Deputy that this is a matter in which we will continue to ensure that our citizens are fully and properly advised and also properly protected as to their rights.</P>

      <P>The Minister has suggested that anybody who is worried should write to his Department to find out what the position is.  Is it not our responsibility to tell our citizens here and everywhere else what the possible implications are for them under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, so that if they go to Britain they will go with their eyes open and not be surprised? It is no good asking somebody who is detained under this Act to write to the Minister to ask what is the position. It is too late then to shut the stable door.</P>

      <P>First I wish to ask the Minister a question in connection with what he said regarding hardship cases so far as county councils would be concerned in dealing with large bills.  Is it not the position that the guidelines laid down by most county councils would not include in this consideration a farmer whose valuation was to the extent of £80?  I understand that the guidelines are in the region of £32 in a case of a farmer who had a wife and three children, before any hardship case could be considered.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to be in a generous mood but the particular area of his generosity will not affect me in any way nor indeed will it affect many people.  However, I would ask him to take into consideration the question of equity so far as valuations are concerned.  The present system of land valuation is totally out of date and does not take into consideration the income of the person concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of Standing Orders it is not possible for me apparently to move an amendment on the lines I have in mind.  I have been told that if an amendment has financial implications it cannot be moved by anyone but a <Col N="250" /> member of the Government.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to propose an amendment to the effect that any landowner with a valuation of £75 but of less than 80 adjustable acres should enjoy the present rates remission. There are several reasons for this suggestion. First, I understand that the effect of this legislation will be that next year, by way of Ministerial order, people with valuations of £60 will no longer qualify for rates remission.  No doubt the Minister has been a long-serving member of a local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>At any rate I am sure that the Minister has a fair knowledge of the rating system.  Is the Minister aware that in County Wexford people with valuations of £60 will have as small a holding as 60 adjustable acres. There is a section of land in Wexford known as the Macmores.  It comprises 45,000 acres and the valuations in respect of it range from 55p to £1.10 in the £.  There are men in that area who do not qualify either for health or for education grants but who are responsible for the full rate from 31 December 1978.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): On these amendments it is necessary that the record be as clear as possible.  As the Bill stands it is clear that if a ratepayer's total valuation <Col N="251" /> on agricultural land equals or exceeds £75 this year or £60 next year, regardless of where the land is situated in the State, the ratepayer will be given the benefit of rates relief.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is intended to provide that only land which equals or exceeds £75 valuation this year or £60 valuation next year in a rating area shall deprive the owner of rates relief.  I doubt very much whether the amendment will have that effect but the Minister says he is advised that it will have this effect. Presumably this is because of some rule of construction.  If that is so I should like the Minister to confirm it but from my general knowledge of law that is the only way I can see it would work as the Minister says it would work.  However, if the amendment works in the way the Minister says it will work, this will emphasise the inequity and the absurdity of the rating system.  The Minister says that as soon as the Bill is through he will make an order in this regard for 1978. The effect of that would be that if a farmer has a poor law valuation of £100 in one county and the rate is £10.21 in the £, his rates will be increased this year by £408.40 whether he is liable to pay income tax or not. However, if instead of having a PLV of £100 in County Kildare he has a PLV of £50 in County Kildare and a PLV of £50 in County Meath his rates will not be increased at all.  I do not know what is the difference between having a farm with a valuation of £100 in County Meath and having one with a valuation of £50 in Meath and one with a valuation of £50 across the road in Kildare.  It is even worse than that.  If he has a valuation of £50 in the urban district of Naas, and Naas is one of the urban districts with a very big area of land&mdash;Bal-linasloe is another&mdash;and if he has a valuation of £50 in the county of Kildare he will have no increase at all.  I want to put on record that I believe this is an absurdity and I believe it is a good reason for scrapping this system of raising money by rates on valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> It is not today or yesterday I started to advocate the abolition of the rating system.  It is a system that has no regard for the income of the person who is taxed or for the capacity of that person to pay.  The Minister is consolidating that system in this Bill. Until such time as the Minister gets round to abolishing rates altogether he should certainly not increase them. This Bill is the first measure in living memory, with the paltry exception of the £17 employment grant in 1976, in which the agricultural grant has been dealt with to the disadvantage of the farmer.  Any relief is welcome but an absurd position is being consolidated here.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the Bill as introduced provided for aggregation of valuations thoughout the State.  It is quite obvious that representations were made to the Minister by some people who have land in different counties. Perhaps they have valuations of under £20 in one county and are paying no rates on that land.  It is obvious that the Minister does not want to stir up the pot.  It would be better to stir up the pot and to expose to all and sundry the absurd system we are operating here.</P>

I would like to hear him justify how a man with a valuation of £100 in County Galway will have his rates increased by £408.40 but if he happens to have a valuation of £50 in Galway and one of £50 in Roscommon he will have no increase.  If <Col N="253" /> County Galway amuses Deputy Killilea, I will take the example of a man having a valuation of £100 in Kildare who will have his rates increased by £408.40 but if he has a valuation of £50 in Kildare and one of £50 in Meath he will have no increase.

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I will be able to carry on without him, Sir.  That is the sort of legislation the Fianna Fáil backbenchers are being asked to enact with their feet but they are not allowed to speak on it.  It would be hard to defend it and I suppose it is better not to ask them to defend the impossible but I would ask the Minister to explain the commonsense in it, if there is any.  There is no use in the Minister saying that this has been the practice since 1898 or from 1973 to 1977.  That is no answer.  We are increasing rates this year from 66? per cent to 87 per cent.  This is the time to expose this sort of nonsense.  It is bad enough that this sort of thing has been going on unnoticed for several years but when we are increasing the rate for a person with a valuation of £100 in one county from 66? to 87 per cent and we are not increasing it at all if his farm straddles a county border, it is time this sort of nonsense was exposed.  We should have an explanation from the only person who is entitled to give it, the Minister.  Indeed, on a measure like this we might have the benefit of the wisdom of the Minister for Agriculture because once this is enacted it is the people for whom the Minister for Agriculture is responsible who will pay the piper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also have an explanation from the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture but perhaps he, coming from Galway, would, like Deputy Killilea, treat the whole thing as a joke because it does not concern him.  It concerns many farmers and we should have explanations.  I <Col N="254" /> would welcome a common-sense explanation from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained to Deputy Enright before the adjournment, there is nothing new in this. The people with valuations of £50 in Clare and £50 in an adjoining county always enjoyed full primary and supplementary allowances because they were under two rating authorities. There is no departure from that now.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite have been referring to the inequity or the equity of the rating and valuation systems and the fact that nothing has been done about them, that they have gone unnoticed for years.  Deputy Fitzpatrick watched it for four-and-a-half years in Government.  We were only one day in Government when we derated householders and farm outhouses. This year we are providing £80 million from the Exchequer for this purpose. In this Bill we are providing £38½ million for the agricultural community, an aggregate of £120 million.</P>

He will continue to get relief on the £50 in County Kildare, under a separate rating authority.  He will continue to get supplementary and primary allowances in 1978.  I suggest that the Deputies opposite who are so opposed to the amendment should vote against it.</P>

I will put a few questions to the Minister.  In your original statement you said you hoped to recoup £7 million.  I ask what will the exact cost of this amendment be to the Exchequer.  I think it will be relatively small, no boon whatsoever to the farming community.  Why did you not have this provision in the original Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister not include this amendment in the original Bill?  The reason is that the Minister did not realise the opposition this Bill would have from the farming community and belatedly he decided under pressure to give ground by way of this amendment.  &ldquo;The Drover&rdquo; in the <i>Farming Independent</i> dealt at length with this.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's advisers and his colleagues in the Cabinet and a number of backbenchers read it and made him realise the strength of the opposition to the Bill among the farming community.  He believes this small measure of relief may satisfy the farmers.  Again I put it to him that he should accept the case made by this side to have the rates relief to farmers continued as heretofore.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was correct when he said the Minister for Agriculture should be in the House throughout this debate.  On the Second Stage I asked why that Minister had not come in to make a statement on the Bill.  This Bill affects the people of rural Ireland, the farming community, and it is the job of the Minister for Agriculture to ensure that those people will get a fair deal, that they will not be discriminated against, as this Bill is doing.</P>

      <P>Before the lunch interval the Minister said a county <Col N="256" /> manager would have power to grant rates relief to a person who, through ill health, got into financial difficulties and found himself unable to pay the rates levied on his farm.  I should like to ask the Minister two questions.  Is he aware of the small amount of money allocated each year by local authorities towards relief of rates?  If a county manager refuses to grant a waiver of rates to a farmer who may be ill in hospital, or who may have heavy bills coming in from a hospital or from doctors, and whose children may be debarred from higher education, has the Minister power to over-rule the county manager?  Has he power to grant a rates waiver to that applicant? He has not.  The Minister has no power to over-rule the county manager.  The county manager makes the decision and the Minister cannot intervene in any way.  The Minister knows that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to look at amendment No. 7 in a different context from that of my colleagues. As I said already, I have a small worry about the way in which this amendment is worded.  It could allow the Minister to alter the terms of the rates relief by order without coming back to this House and having the matter dealt with in the way we are now dealing with this alteration of the existing relief.  It is established precedent in the House that this matter should not be dealt with by order but by legislation.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's reply to my query before I make a final judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is the case that this amendment will allow the Minister to remove the relief from people whose valuation exceeds £50 or £40 by order, obviously this would be objectionable.  I know <Col N="257" /> the Minister has said, and I know it is the opinion of other Members of the House present, that it is not his intention to take this power at the moment and that this amendment would not confer the power on him to alter the relief provided in this Bill by order.</P>
    <P>My reading of the terms of this amendment suggests that the possibility exists that the Minister could decide to remove the relief by order and not by legislation from farmers whose valuations are £40 or less.  I will explain how I think that could be done.  It would be possible for the Minister for Finance to introduce an amendment to the Finance Bill on Committee Stage, when it comes before the House in a month, to alter the prescribed figure under section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974. I take it the prescribed figure is £60 in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Because the effect of the present Bill will not expire until 1979, it would be possible for the Government in the current Finance Bill or the next Finance Bill to decide to alter the amount standing specified and bring it down to £40, or £30 or £20.  Once that was done in the Finance Bill, if this amendment were adopted, there would be no need for the Minister to come back to the House with a new Bill, such as the one we are now considering, to make a change in rates relief consequent on changes in the amount standing specified in the Finance Bill which is the amount which determines whether a farmer above that valuation, the one to be specified, would be liable to income tax.  To my mind it would be very undesirable, to put it at its very mildest, that this matter, namely, withdrawing the relief, could be dealt with by order.</P>
    <P>I will say more specifically why I think this is possible.  I do not think this construction is shared by the Minister or by my own colleagues but I should like to tease it out so that we will know exactly what we are passing.  If there is any legitimate doubt it should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) (a) in the amendment provides that:</P>
    <P>... if and whenever the Minister, <Col N="258" /> as respects a local financial year, so provides by order, a rating authority ... shall not apply the Act as aforesaid to a person, as respects that local financial year, if the valuation of all the tenements of agricultural land in the rating area of the authority in respect of which he is rated equals or exceeds the amount standing specified, on the first day of that year, in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Finance Bill is that the amount standing specified on the first day of 1979 shall be £60.  It is on that assumption that this Bill is being processed through the House. It is possible by an amendment of the Finance Bill, or a subsequent Finance Bill to be enacted at some stage during this calendar year, and not necessarily by an amendment of this Bill, although that is probably more likely, for the Minister for Finance to bring the specified figure to be operable from 1 January 1979 down from £60 to £20.  That could be done by amendment to the current Finance Bill.  If there is a mini-budget next autumn it could be done in a Finance Bill enacted later this year.</P>
    <P>I contend that, under the terms of this amendment, it is impossible for the Minister to withdraw the relief from those farmers who were being brought into the income tax net as well, let us say for the sake of argument, farmers between the levels of £20 and £60.  It would be possible for the Minister for the Environment to take the concomitant step of withdrawing the relief of rates from farmers between the levels of £20 and £60 by order under this amendment. It was on that assumption that I put down amendment No. 3.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about amendment No. 3. Paragraph (6) of the amendment provides that wherever an order is proposed to be made under paragraph (a) of the sub-section a draft of that order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft order has been passed by each such House.  That requires that there must be a debate on any order <Col N="259" /> that the Minister makes under the Bill as he proposes to amend.  It would be a <i>sine qua non</i> of accepting the Minister's amendment, if it has the effect which I argued earlier it might have, that any order the Minister might make&mdash;for instance, removing the present reliefs from farmers with a valuation between £20 and £60&mdash;would have to be discussed in this House in the way I have outlined, regardless of whether a Deputy puts down a motion to annul it.</P>
    <P>If, as the Minister may argue&mdash; although he may accept my reading of the ways in which the amendment could be used&mdash;it could not have that effect and if the only type of order which could be introduced under this amendment is one dealing merely with the problem which arises when people have holdings in more than one rating authority area, there is still a case for requiring that that order be discussed of necessity in this House and could not take effect until it has been approved by this House.</P>
    <P>Deputies from this side who have spoken earlier, while not opposing in any way the Minister's amendment, have pointed out that it reveals the basic injustice of the rating system. In order that the rating system and the inherent injustices be better understood by the public, there is a case that orders made under this proposed amendment should be properly discussed and approved in this House before they take effect and should not take effect automatically without any discussion.  That is a relatively minor point.  The major point on which I wish to have the Minister's response is the one regarding the fear I have expressed that this amendment could be used, if there is an amendment to the Finance Bill, so that the Minister could by order ensure that farmers with valuations between £20 and £60 would be deprived of the reliefs they now enjoy and would enjoy under the Bill as now being considered by the House.</P>

      <P>The amendment gives me the power to put down an order to give relief.  It does not give me the power to put down an order which <Col N="260" /> would cause any additional burden, so this does not arise.  It is an order to give necessary relief with regard to the aggregation of holdings in different authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 states:</P>
      <P>In page 2, after line 19, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, if and whenever the Minister, as respects a local financial year, so provides by order, a rating authority (within the meaning of the said Local Government Act, 1946) shall not apply the Act aforesaid to a person, as respects that local financial year, if the valuation of all the tenements of agricultural land in the rating area of the authority in respect of which he is rated equals or exceeds the amount standing specified, on the first day of that year, in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974.</P>
      <P>(b) An order under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the Bill stands without the amendment, it means that the aggregation of all valuations, regardless of whether they are in one, two or more local rating areas, would be taken into account.  The amendment gives me the power to put down an order which would change that and would mean that where there are valuations in different rating areas they would not be aggregated for that purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I am arguing that the amendment gives the Minister powers over and above that to change the position regarding reliefs to farmers between £20 and £60 valuation.  The amendment is not confined in its wording to dealing <Col N="261" /> solely with the problems of farmers who have holdings in different counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has misunderstood my point.  If the amount standing specified in the Finance Bill is changed, the Minister may by order under this amendment remove the rates relief from people below the present amount standing specified and above the new amount standing specified by the amendment to the Finance Bill.  The Minister said in his reply to my contribution that this amendment is confined in its wording to the granting of relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment deals with valuations in two particular administrative areas and nothing else.  The Deputy's amendment deals with orders made under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend that this amendment gives power to the Minister to deal not only with the problem of disaggregation of the valuation of a particular farmer whose valuation consists of holdings in two separate counties.  It is clear from the wording of subsection (3) (a) of the amendment that the Minister may by order say that a particular local authority shall not apply the Act aforesaid to a person if that person's valuation equals or exceeds the amount standing specified in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act.  Let us analyse what it means to say that the Minister may say that the local authority in question shall not apply the Act.  That means that the reliefs are withdrawn.  The Act grants the reliefs and if the Minister says that the Act shall not apply it means that the reliefs are withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amount to be specified were <Col N="262" /> altered, say to £20 as I have argued, in this year's Finance Bill or in any Finance Bill to be enacted during 1978, it would be possible under this amendment for the Minister by order to take the consequential step of withdrawing rates relief from people whether they had holdings in two counties or in one.  At the moment I think the amount specified for valuations is £75.  If an amendment to the Finance Bill were introduced changing that figure to £20, the Minister by order could withdraw rates relief from people with valuations between £20 and £75.  In adopting this amendment we are giving the Minister power to do this by order.  If he had not this power he would have to come to this House and introduce a Bill such as the one we are discussing now in order to make the change.</P>
    <P>The House must be vigilant.  We must look at every possibility and every potentially evil construction that can be put on an order-making power being granted to a Minister where it is granting such a power.  If no such power is granted the Minister must come here with legislation to change the law but if an order-making power is granted he can change the law without having to come before us.</P>
    <P>The amendment, as introduced for the purpose stated by the Minister, is acceptable to us.  However, if it has the potential to be used in the way I have described, I do not know if it would be acceptable to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 will become subsection (3) of section 1.  It gives me the power to make an order and to place it before the House. Taken in conjunction with the two existing subsections in section 1 it will have the effect of not aggregating all the holdings in different local authority areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the argument that it might give me the power to make an order reducing the £75 threshold for this year to £20 next year, I wish to state it does not give me any such power.  The specified sum is stated in the Finance Bill.  The Finance Bill has specified £60 which will become effective from 1 January 1979.  If the <Col N="263" /> amount is to be reduced that will be done in a Finance Bill, not in any order made by me under this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has enlightened me somewhat on this matter. The present Finance Bill specifies £60 as the threshold for income tax and the removal of rates relief.  If that Bill were amended, or if another Finance Bill were introduced during this year, is it the case that automatically the rates relief would be withdrawn from farmers with valuations between £20 and £60 if that sum was specified in the Finance Bill?  Is it the situation that there would be no need to come back to the House with a Bill dealing with the consequential removal of rates relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>I said on the Second Stage&mdash;this is relevant now&mdash;the trend in recent years has been to get away from the rating system as a means of taking in revenue.  The National Coalition initiated the most recent trend in this direction when they removed the health charges and housing subsidies from the rates in 1975.  That was a substantial benefit to all rated occupiers. The National Coalition carried that proposal a step further when they derated all private dwellings by 25 per cent last year and intimated that they proposed, progressively and without borrowing money, to derate private dwellings altogether by next year.  It is true that Fianna Fáil went a step further in an election promise and borrowed £821 million for this purpose among other purposes.  I agree with them derating private houses from 1 January of this year.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): My argument is against subsection (2) of this section.  I submit that the argument I propose making is relevant.  The step by the Government to completely remove rates from private dwellings was a speeding up of the National Coalition policy to do the same thing.  We now have an absolute reversal of that policy.  The Minister would have us believe that section 1 is a proposal by him to grant relief to farmers.  The relief to agricultural holdings was granted over the years by Bills introduced here which lasted for one or two years.  The last Bill which granted relief to all farmers with a valuation of £20 and upwards without any limit on upper valuation expired last year.  The Minister could have introduced a Bill to replace that expired Bill.  This Bill does not replace it in full.  I object to this.  It only replaces the expired Bill in relation to farmers whose valuation does not exceed £75 this year and £60 next year.  The effect of it this year is to impose a blistering increase, assuming a rate of £10.21 in the £, of £331 on farmers with a poor law valuation of £75.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am doing that.  The effect of this section is to impose a blistering increase of over £330 on farmers with a poor law valuation of £75 and £408 on farmers with a poor law valuation of £100.  The argument was made by the Minister on the Second Stage that farmers could deduct their rates from the amount of income tax they would be called on to pay.  I asked the Minister on the Second Stage to make sure, by introducing an amendment on Committee Stage, that the increase would apply only to farmers who were liable to pay income tax and that if the amount of income tax they were liable to pay did not exceed the amount of the increase in their rates caused by this Bill that this section would not apply to them.  The Minister kept away from that argument on the Second Stage and he has not brought in an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this measure is to increase rates by sums varying from £300 up to a couple of thousand pounds on farmers whether they are liable for income tax or not.  About that there is no doubt.  Many farmers will not be liable for income tax because of family commitments, bank interest, agricultural wages, contractors' wages and hard luck in the wholesale death of stock.  Yet they will be called upon under this Bill to pay a blistering increase of from £300 up to the sky, depending upon their valuation.  It is an outrageous proposal.  When I insisted on this measure being debated <Col N="268" /> at length in this House it had not got over, as Deputy Clinton said, to the agricultural organisations, nor had it got over to the farmers who were being affected.  It has got over to them since they have now got their demand for rates and they know what is involved.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil backbenchers in this House have treated this measure with complete contempt.  They are honourable men who could not defend the indefensible, and they decided to keep quiet.  We put in speaker after speaker to emphasise and demonstrate the case I am making.  We put in practically every Deputy in the Fine Gael Party and all we had from Fianna Fáil were a few words from Deputy Filgate from Louth and a few words from Deputy Conaghan from Donegal.  A wholesale attack is to be made on the farmers through this Bill, and it is not going to be a single-armed attack.  It is going to be an attack implemented and augmented by other measures.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I ask the Chair to bear with me for a brief submission.  This Bill, if it is about anything, is, according to the Minister, about giving or claiming relief.  If a farmer claims relief under this Bill it will be open to the county manager of a local authority to go prying into his business through the Inspector of Taxes.  If that is not relevant I do not know what is.  If this Bill is about anything it is about relief on rates, but to qualify for relief on rates under this Bill a farmer will have to submit to an inquisition into his affairs by the Inspector of Taxes under section 45 of the Finance Bill in this year of grace 1978.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am entitled to make a speech against this wretched, unjust and inequitable section.  It is wrong that the machinery of the Revenue Commissioners and the Inspector of Taxes should be brought in to see whether a man is entitled to agricultural rates relief or not.  Of course, this Government have gone mad, because they are using the same wretched inquisition section now to see whether a man is entitled to a housing grant or not.  I make only passing reference to that because to discuss it would not be in order.  We hear about thumb-twisting and undesirable practices in Long Kesh and elsewhere but this is bordering on that. I have never heard of a more outrageous performance.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to deal with this subsection (2) when he gets an opportunity, and I ask him to deny, if he can, that this is a proposal to extract more rates from farmers. Whether or not they are liable for income tax has no bearing on it.  I defy him to contradict that there will be many farmers throughout the country who will not be liable for income tax but who will have their rates increased by substantial amounts. If he does not deny that, I invite him to give it further consideration and, even on Report Stage, to put a simple amendment into this Bill which will provide that only farmers who are liable for income tax in excess of the amount by which their rates would be increased by this Bill will have their rates increased.  That is a fair challenge if the Minister is genuine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some sinister idea here that, lest farmers might get away with income tax, they should be ground down by having them pay additional rates. This is in a situation in which there cannot be argument about profit and loss, valuations or anything else.  There is an idea that, lest the farmer get away with some income tax, the situation should be copperfastened by extracting this additional amount from them by way of rates.  Is that provision <Col N="272" /> applied across the board?  Is it applied to the private sector or to the professional man?  Doctors are very much in the news this week in relation to their salaries and incomes.  Doctors send in returns as do other professional men such as solicitors and accountants. Shopkeepers and all others make returns of their income, but let us take the doctor as an example.  According to this section the farmer must be screwed down in order to ensure that regardless of whether he is liable for tax, this extra amount will be extracted from him.  Is that situation applied in the case of a doctor?  Have his rates been increased on the place where he makes his money?  They have not been increased.  The direct opposite has occurred.  Rates have been abolished on his house, his surgery and his waiting room.  The doctor is asked to pay income tax but he is not asked to pay a penny in rates although he earns four times as much as a farmer.  There is no question of saying to the doctor that he must pay increased rates in order to ensure that he does not get away with income tax.  That is a comparison I am anxious to put before the House by way of exposing the proposed unfair and unjust treatment of the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is genuine and wishes only to collect rates as an instalment of income tax from farmers he has a clear way of saying that.  This proposal to take away the agricultural grant has become combined, both in the mind of the Minister and in the minds of some people, with an income tax on farmers.  I think it was in the Budget Statement that Fianna Fáil undertook not to ask farmers to pay their income tax in advance.  But when the former Minister for Finance asked farmers in the opening years of taxation to pay their income tax on the first day of September instead of the first day in January there were cries of discrimination against farmers.  We were told that they were being treated unfairly. What do we find here?  We find that the rates the farmers will pay now, the savagely increased rates, will not be credited against their income tax for a period of 18 months.  In other words, the Minister for Finance will <Col N="273" /> have the use of all the farmers' rates if they are a credit against income tax. Therefore, the big increase in rates from £300 to £1,000 or £2,000, depending on valuation, will be at the disposal of the Minister interest free for 18 months before the farmer is called on to pay the tax against which the rates are supposed to be a payment on account.  Let us have that out in the open and hear from the Minister what he thinks about it.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to refer to my assertion that what is proposed here is an extraction of increased rates from farmers irrespective of their liability for income tax.  Secondly, I want the Minister to comment on the disgraceful performance of setting the Revenue Commissioners and the Inspector of Taxes on farmers because they dare to claim relief of rates. Thirdly, I wish the Minister to deal with the proposal that in a situation in which the rates are regarded as a credit against income tax the Revenue Commissioners will have the use of the money for 18 months in advance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has no answer to the logic of this argument.  There is no point in his going back and telling us what Fianna Fáil did in respect of rates for farmers in the £20 valuation category.  Neither need the Minister tell us about the abolition of rates on private dwellings.  He and his party won the general election on a promise to treat the farmers well and on an assertion that the National Coalition treated the farmers badly.  Fianna Fáil promised that if they were returned to power the farmers would hear no more about income tax or about rates. Now the Minister must explain to the House, to his backbenchers and to the country what sort of right-about-turn in policy has occured between 16 June 1977 and this year in regard to farmer taxation, to rates on agricultural land, to inquisitions into farmers business by the Inspector of Taxes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to concentrate on the different categories of farmers involved, on the farmers in the £60, £75 and more than £100 valuation categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> During the Second Stage discussion there were many aspects of the Bill that were not discussed because of the non-availability of information, some of which would have to be obtained through a Deputy's local authority. To give an example of what I mean, I recall that when speaking on Second Stage I was not aware that 611 farmers in my county with valuations of £60 would make an extra contribution, apart from their ordinary rates, of £183,000.  The same applied upwards along the line, but to a greater extent. What we have here is a red herring. The Minister says that the rates can be regarded as an instalment against income tax; but the situation is, for example, that a man whose valuation is deemed to be £100 is faced anyway with income tax.  There is a certain concession here but in so far as the £75 valuation is concerned fewer people would be involved in the income tax net.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a high percentage of people who would not be in the income tax bracket at all.  This is extra taxation behind a smokescreen. We come now to the people with valuations of £60.  Only a very small percentage, if any, will become involved at all.  What will happen in my county is that 611 people will make an extra contribution of £183,000.  We must give the Government credit for one thing and that is that they are being consistent.  The people with the valuations of £100 in a way are deriving a benefit.  We remember the Finance Bill and the wealth tax of £10 million. This is on the same line.  The smaller farmer is being hit.  I do not think that is right and if Fianna Fáil had said that that was their intention before the last election I do not think the Minister would be sitting over there today.</P>
    <P>Were any of the farmers' organisations called in to discuss this Bill? When we were in power, each day or at least each week we had farmers' organisations in the corridors.</P>

      <P>Before the final Stage of this Bill the farmers' organisations should be asked for their opinions.  Advice was readily available to the farmers' organisations 12 months ago.  There were people running around constituencies meeting farmers' organisations and telling them how hard we were on the farmers. They were promised that there would be no farmers' taxation and there was no reference to rates.  In my county next January the figure involved will be well over £½ million. We heard much about the abolition of the domestic rate.  I believe it is being subsidised by the farmer.  The farmers' organisations should now have an opportunity of discussing this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing that has annoyed the farmers is the speed with which the Government got back to them with a demand for extra money through the rating system.  In the last fortnight the demand notes have reached the farmers.  The farmers' organisations or the farmers individually did not realise what was involved in the removal of the remission of rates.  Since the demand notes have started to arrive I have had telephone calls from farmers saying that there is a mistake in their rates.  Three people rang me over the weekend and said that their rates had gone up by £500 and £600.  People are finding that there is a tax in the region of £320 to £700 in their rates bills for 1978.  Many promises were made and the farmers were deceived at the last election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought the Minister had been a member of a local authority.  It is only when one is a member of a local authority that one realises the variations in the valuation system.  I understand it varies from 30p in the £ to 110p in the £.  I said earlier that in this Bill the Minister is discriminating against certain sections of the community.  The Minister says this has been there for the last 30 or 40 years.  That is no excuse.  It is the Minister's duty to try to bring a little equity to this situation. There will be people who in 1979 will have to pay their full rate at perhaps £12 in the £ in some counties <Col N="276" /> irrespective of their income.  People with valuations of over £60 have never qualified for benefit under the Health Act and now they find they do not qualify for grants under the Education Act.  The Minister may say that the county manager has a discretion in cases of hardship but the majority of county managers will not entertain areas of people with valuations of £60. We in Wexford County Council have laid down guidelines for the payment of rates so far as hardship cases are concerned.  Under those guidelines a man with over £32 per week with a wife and four children will not be considered.  I understand that the same applies in most counties.  The Minister should be looking at the question of removing rates completely from agricultural land whose owners pay their share through income tax if their incomes are big enough.  It was no problem to take rates from private dwellings&mdash;the inter-Party Government had made a move to derate by 25 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go back to relate the valuation to the acreage of the land.  Because of Standing Orders I was unable to put down an amendment. It was news to me that only a Minister can move an amendment which has financial implications.  I now ask the Minister to put down an amendment to the effect that any landowner with a £75 valuation will get remission of rates if his adjustable acreage is less than 80.  That is a fair and honest request, an attempt to bring some element of equity to the rating system.  As a result of this Bill farmers are discovering that they will get bills for rates which they cannot afford to pay.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be familiar with the Macamores where we have 44,000 acres with a valuation of 76p per acre.  Next year the landowners will get bills for adjustable acreages of 60.  If we multiply that by £12, which is the likely rate in the £, we get £720. There is not anything more unjust than the present rating system.</P>

      <P>It is not £7 million less.  The Deputy spoke about the inequity of the valuation system.  We all acknowledge that there is something wrong with it, but it is a matter the Deputy should raise with the appropriate Minister, the Minister for Finance.  The Valuation Office comes under his Department, not mine. Deputy Fitzpatrick said that all ratepayers, whether businessmen or farmers, must pay rates, but he said there is a difference.  There is not. All people liable to pay rates must pay them.  Deputy O'Brien said that farmers are being asked to carry the burden for domestic derating.  The Exchequer is providing £80.75 million for the purpose of domestic derating and the agricultural grant is providing £38.5 million for relief for the farming community in the current year.  The Bill had to be brought in for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being deceptive.  We all know that the Act had to be reviewed once every two years, but on every previous occasion the reliefs were left at the previous level with the exception of the year when the employment allowance was withdrawn.  This year the reliefs are being withdrawn from farmers who are liable to income tax.  That is a very significant withdrawal of relief <Col N="278" /> by comparison with the situation if the practice heretofore had been adhered to, namely, that the Bill would simply renew the existing provisions.</P>
      <P>To pretend that the Bill grants a measure of relief is not only deceptive but not in accordance with reality.  It is a mere accident of parliamentary practice that the Act has been renewed every two years, and this Bill is far worse in its provisions than previous Bills or the Bill which the House would have had every right to expect this time.</P>
      <P>Members of the farming community who have received their rates demands in recent weeks&mdash;few of them have&mdash; appreciate the reality and realise that the Minister is only pretending as far as this Bill is concerned.  The most deeply worrying part of the section&mdash; that which was discussed earlier in a general way on the amendment and which I propose to deal with more fully now&mdash;is that in effect a blank cheque can be written in so far as rates relief is concerned.  From now on the Minister for Finance may decide by amendment to change the income tax threshold.  He could decide this year to reduce the threshold to £20 and, <i>ipso facto</i>, rates reliefs which previously existed would be withdrawn on the enactment of the Finance Bill.  The Department of the Environment would then find a way to take from the House the power to discuss rates relief specifically. That, to my mind, is not only a danger to the farming community, indicating the intention of the Government progressively to lower the threshold for income tax&mdash;there would be no cause for this Bill otherwise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

All that is necessary is to change that figure by a single section in the Finance Bill.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The objectionable features of this withdrawal of relief are manifold.  They measure significantly the level of rates which will have to be paid by farmers.  The argument is made that these rates may be set off against income tax.  Those rates are payable in April 1978 and in July 1978.  Yet, the vastly increased rates payable under the provisions of this Bill cannot be set off against income tax until 1 January 1980.  In other words, the money must be paid in more than 18 months prior to the <Col N="280" /> time when a possible relief against income tax can be obtained in respect of those moneys.</P>
      <P>We heard the farming community and Deputies who are now sitting on the Government side of the House on their behalf complaining bitterly about the fact that they were being asked to pay income tax on 1 September which was two or three months prior to the time they might otherwise have to pay it.  Under this Bill they will be asked to pay money 18 months in advance of when they should have to pay it. The State will have the use of their money for 18 full months without interest payments whereas, under the proposals in relation to income tax to be paid on 1 September, a significant rate of interest would have been payable on any excess of income tax paid on 1 September which it transpired was not due because the income had not accrued and the money had to be paid back.  That money would have been paid back with interest which exceeded the going market rate.  This does not apply in the case of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Another point which needs to be made very forcibly is that if a farmer dies and his widow has to take over, it is likely that for a few years after his death she will not have a full grip on the business, and she will not be able to make the maximum out of the farm.  As a result of not earning as much from the farm as the farm would have earned if her husband were still alive, she would not be liable for income tax at all, but she will have to pay much increased rates.  There will be no income tax against which to set off the rates because she will not be liable for income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, what we are doing in this Bill is imposing a much heavier burden on farmers with low incomes than on farmers with high incomes.  A farmer with a high income who is paying his full income tax will be able to set off the entirety of his rates against his income tax.  Farmers with small incomes, and who may be liable to little or no income tax, in many cases undoubtedly will find that their rates will well exceed any income tax they may be liable for.  They will not get their money back, or an equivalent of <Col N="281" /> their money in terms of allowances, because there will be nothing to allow it against.</P>
    <P>In economists' terms this is described as regressive taxation, which is taxation that takes more from those who can least afford it than it takes from those who can afford it.  This taxation&mdash;and, in effect, that is what it is, because it is withdrawing a relief which has been there since 1946 and which is accepted as being part of our over-all fiscal system&mdash;will give more relief to the farmer who is making a good income, because he will be able to set off the entirety of his increased rates against his income tax, and give less or perhaps no relief to the farmer with a low income.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to make is in relation to the possible increase in rates which could occur and which would obviously affect farmers more severely now that they are being deprived of the supplementary and primary allowances of which this Bill proposes to deprive them, farmers with valuation above £60.  We are told this year there is an 11 per cent limit on all increases of rates whether they be domestic rates which will be paid by the Exchequer, or business rates, or farming rates which will be paid by the person concerned.  This is fair enough, if you like, because there is equality between what the State will pay and what the farmer or the business persons will have to pay in terms of an increase.</P>
    <P>There is no guarantee in this Bill or elsewhere that, in some future year, the Minister for the Environment might not say: &ldquo;We are a bit short of money this year so we will allow you to increase domestic rates by 5 per cent only.  In other words we will let you ask us to pay a 5 per cent increase but you are perfectly free to make up the difference, if you are short of money for any scheme, by increasing the rates on the farming community and the business community by anything up to 30 per cent if you so wish.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have made my point. There are a number of farmers whose valuations are excessively high by comparison with what their farms can earn. They will be more severely affected by this Bill, which takes no account of their income, than will farmers whose farms are less highly valued and who are making a good income.</P>
      <P>The Minister should introduce an amendment along the lines of the amendment which was rightly ruled out of order as being impossible for a Member of the Opposition to introduce. This suggested that the restrictions on allowances which are being made operable by this Bill should apply only to farmers who are liable to pay tax and who are therefore in a position to make use of the rates allowances in the Finance Bill, that the Act should apply only to them and not to farmers who do not make enough money to be liable for income tax and who cannot claim for their rates against their income tax.</P>
      <P>It is possible for the Minister to introduce such an amendment.  If he is sincere in what he says about this Bill being intended to allow farmers to set off their rates against income tax, there should be no objection whatever to the introduction by him of an amendment along the lines suggested by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I hope the Minister will consider the matter favourably.</P>

      <P>One of the greatest guides that the Minister can have in regard to the legislation before the House is the sight of empty Fianna Fáil benches.  He is sitting there on his own because nobody else in Fianna Fáil desires to be associated in any way with this measure.  Members have come in and stood at the top of the stairs and then left the House because they were not happy with the measure and did not want to become involved.</P>

      <P>The position was similar on Second Stage.  Two Fianna Fáil Members spoke on this measure in a most half-hearted manner.  They knew it was unwise, unfair and discriminatory.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister has received a resolution from Offaly County Committee of Agriculture.  This committee is comprised of representatives of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, the IFA and various farming organisations. The resolution demanded that the Government should reconsider their decision to withdraw the allowances to farmers with a rateable valuation over £75.  It went on to mention the withdrawal of subsidies, but that is not relevant at this stage.  No member of the committee spoke or voted against that resolution.  They were unanimous that the Government should reconsider this matter because they realised the unfairness of what was happening.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that this measure is not wise and that the farming community are totally opposed to it. In County Offaly there are 383 farmers with valuations over £75 and a total of £163,000 must be paid in this county alone under this measure.  The situation would be somewhat similar in County Laois.  The farmers in County Offaly will pay an average of £423 each and this is to be collected directly with the rates.</P>
      <P>The removal of rates on houses was Coalition policy.  We felt it was inequitable that there should be rates on private houses, but it is absolutely wrong that, while private domestic dwellings are exempt, farmers as well as having to pay rates find that some of their benefits are being withdrawn. There is no justification for that.  The farming community are very aggrieved about this measure and the Minister should reconsider the position even at this late stage.</P>
      <P>The absence of support from backbenchers is significant.  They can say when they go back to the country that they did not have anything to do with this measure, thus leaving all the odium on the shoulders of the Minister. He must accept responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong to look for another £7 million from the farming community. <Col N="284" /> Even if a farmer is not liable for income tax he still has to pay rates.  A farmer has a right to appeal against an assessment for income tax and a right to show that he is not liable, but he must pay his rates on demand. Fianna Fáil now decide, in contradiction of their statement before the general election, to seek a further £7 million from the farming community. If Fianna Fáil had stated before the general election, either in open debate or in their manifesto, that they intended to seek an extra £7 million in this dictatorial manner they would not have 84 seats in this House.  The Minister should look at the matter and make the necessary amendments on Report Stage.</P>

The number of people affected in County Wexford is 640 and they will have to bear an extra burden of £330,000.  In Wexford, and I presume it applies in other areas also, the rates were struck before the National Wage Agreement.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am not saying it in any disagreeable or bad-tempered way but this House is not being treated properly in regard to this measure. Only a member of Fianna Fáil can put down an amendment that will be effective and that I accept, but we expect at least that the Minister would justify certain consequences of the Bill.  We expect him to answer arguments that we put forward.  I regret that the Minister is simply relying on the 84 Fianna Fáil Deputies and he does not think it necessary to put forward any argument in support of the measure.  Fianna Fáil Deputies are so thoroughly ashamed of the measure, even Deputies from the Minister's constituency, that the nearest they will come to the Chamber is to look across the barrier.  I do not blame them for that but at least the Minister should answer points raised by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The first point I put to the Minister was to ask him to deny that this is a measure to extract more rates from farmers irrespective of their liability for income tax.  On Second Stage he asserted that farmers could set off the increased rates against their income tax.  I invited him to put down an amendment to exempt farmers from the savage increase that will result from this Bill unless they are liable for income tax.  I repeat that invitation now and say I am entitled to an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I put to the Minister was to comment on the disgraceful method being adopted to investigate the entitlement of farmers to relief under this Bill by invoking the Inspector of Taxes or the Revenue Commissioners and making it obligatory on them to discuss confidential information given by taxpayers.  I should <Col N="286" /> like the Minister to comment on that and to say how he justifies it.</P>
    <P>The third point with which I asked him to deal was to explain why farmers are expected to pay their income tax 18 months in advance if this is supposed to be a payment on account of rates.  If it turns out that they are not liable to pay income tax, not alone will they not get interest on their money but they will not even get back the capital they have paid.  I should like the Minister to answer those three points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the last point first.  Naturally after one year there will be no discrepancy in the time with regard to claims.  They will be able to claim the previous year's rates as they go from year to year. There may be an interval in the first year but that is all.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Finance Bill, I suggest that Deputies raise this matter on the Finance Bill.  That Bill states that a secretary or clerk of a local authority can look for information relating to the occupation of land by the claimant and the rateable valuation thereof.  That is all that is stated in the Finance Bill.</P>

It takes £7 million from farmers this year in addition to the subsidies on fertilisers that were withdrawn.  At the current rate a sum of £9.3 million will be taken from farmers next year. There is no defence for this measure. Every Fianna Fáil backbencher knows that and the Minister knows it.  The Minister has not been honest about this Bill.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) repeats what has been done for a long time.  Subsection (2) extracts rates from farmers without reference to their liability for income tax and the Minister should be man enough to admit it.  The Minister for Agriculture, the guardian of the farmers' rights, should have come to the House to say something about this measure.  I wonder what he said at the Cabinet table?

      <P>Subsection (2) states that the effective ceiling for the relief is the amount standing specified on the first day of that year, in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974.  The figure contained in the 1974 Act was £100.  The section is interpreted in such a way that any subsequent amendment in a Finance Bill to section 15 (3) of the 1974 Finance Act automatically takes effect.  It will not then be tied to the £100.  Would the Minister not be prepared, rather than leave the thing open as it is so that in any subsequent Finance Bill the figure could be altered to £40, £30 or £20, to specify in this Bill £75 for this year and £60 for next year.  What objection would there be to doing that?  That would not impose any charge on the Exchequer because the money has already been provided on that basis. It would merely tie the Minister to having to come in here again if he wants to make any change in the ceiling above which the reliefs do not operate.  Would the Minister consider incorporating the figures £75 for this year and £60 for next year in the Bill?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1974 it was £100 and it has been amended from year to year.  It is the section as amended.  The section as amended last year specifies £75 and <Col N="290" /> in the current Finance Bill it will be £60, so there is no great difference between doing it that way and introducing an amendment specifying the same thing.</P>

We cannot discuss that now because we do not know what might be contained in a future Finance Bill.  If that change were to be made and if the reliefs were to be withdrawn from everybody from £20 valuation up there should be another Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill coming before the House to discuss that major change in policy.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister a very reasonable thing which complies with what his intention is, to confine the operation of subsection (2) of this Bill to valuations in excess of £75 this year and £60 next year.  Why could the Minister not put in an amendment to that effect?  That is what he wants to do anyway.</P>

It now stands at £60 and he could reduce it by an amendment to the Finance Bill, which has not even been discussed on Second Stage let alone Committee Stage.  The figure at the moment is £60 for next year.  This could be amended at any moment during the passage of the Finance Bill or in a subsequent Finance Bill.  The argument for this Bill which the House is being asked to accept is that this only extends to people above £60 valuation.  Why does the Minister not specify that in the Bill and we could have a discussion on the matter in another Bill if there is any change.</P>

Anybody reading it would not know what it meant unless he consulted the Finance Act, 1974.  In that he would find the figure of £100 and he would say : &ldquo;What does this mean&rdquo;?  He would have to read every Finance Bill since 1974 to find out if there were any changes made in section 15 (3), and that would be an immense legal exercise for anybody who wanted to enquire what in effect the legal position was.

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I with my colleagues have done my best to try to get the Minister to justify this Bill.  I tried to get him to argue out the merits of it.  In the absence of any right to put down amendments I have tried to invite the Minister to consider reasonable amendments so as to protect the poorer bracket of farmers within this group from an increase in rates, but he has refused to do it.  Obviously he has decided to betray the farmers and to go back on all the promises he made to them.  It is quite obvious that because he has a majority of 84 in the House he does not give a damn about the farmers and he hopes they will forget.  He is not prepared to talk or reason this out.  He is prepared to rely on his majority of 84 steamrolling this Bill through the House.  I would be wasting my time if I tried to get him to argue in a reasoned way the merits and demerits or to justify this Bill.  It is obvious that the Fianna Fáil contribution to this Bill would be a steamrolling operation.  The back benchers in this Dáil did not speak on this Bill because either they were excluded from this House or they could not be got in.</P>
      <P>We have done a good service to the farmers and to the people by ventilating the dishonesty of the Fianna Fáil Party in Government in going back on the solemn promises in their manifesto at the election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, the Title of this Bill is a misnomer.  The reality is that this is not a relief Bill, it is a withdrawal of relief Bill and it should be so described.  Allowances which have traditionally been available to farmers have been withdrawn <Col N="296" /> and that should be incorporated in the Title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Most Deputies were shocked when they read this Bill.  On the Order Paper, the Bill was described as the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1978.  When Deputies got the Bill in the post they expected to find a Bill to relieve rates on agricultural land.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  If this were a new Bill, dealing for the first time with the subject of rates on agricultural land, and if it did not have any predecessors there might be an excuse for calling it a rates relief Bill.  As we know, agricultural land has been relieved from rates for many years.  It is clear from the very citation in the Bill that there has been relief from rates since 1939 at least.  In effect, what has been done in this Bill is to take away part of the relief that has been enjoyed by a category of rated occupiers of agricultural holdings for a great number of years.  The Minister keeps on saying that in effect it is a Bill to provide for relief to the tune of £38 million for farmers.  That is true but I say &ldquo;thank you for nothing&rdquo;. There is nothing new about that.  That has been the position for at least 30 or 40 years.  What is new in the Bill and what would identify it in the minds of the public, in the minds of farmers, in the minds of those affected, is that it is a Bill to deprive farmers with valuations of £75 or over this year of relief in rates and to deprive farmers with valuations of £60 from relief in rates as from next year.  How the Minister can describe it as a rates relief Bill I do not know.  It would be much more accurate to describe it as a relief withdrawal Bill.  If the Minister wants to split hairs about it he could go so far as to call it the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief and Withdrawal of Relief) Bill but its present title is completely erroneous.  The record should show that Deputies who think it worth their while to contribute to this debate understand the Bill for what it is, a procedure to deprive farmers of £7 million this year and of £7 million to £9 million next <Col N="297" /> year.  I would like the Minister's views on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be remembered that the Bill brought in in 1976 for the relief of rates on agricultural land has expired and if this Bill were not introduced and passed by the House it would not be possible to give any relief on the agricultural rates this year or next year.  This Bill is giving relief to the tune of £38.5 million and it is beyond my comprehension how the Bill could be named in any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely a legislative accident and no more that the Agricultural Land (Relief) Bills in the past have not been of unlimited duration. This is a legislative rarity with very little justification because most Government expenditure is justified by Bills which are of unlimited duration. As it is drafted this one must be renewed every two years but there was nothing to stop the Minister, if he so wished, from saying: &ldquo;This Bill shall apply until further notice.&rdquo;  As we all know the reality is that the reliefs contained in the 1976 Act had existed in previous Acts for a considerable length of time and in the normal course of events the 1976 reliefs should have been reintroduced this year.  The effect of this Bill is to withdraw reliefs, and that reality should be reflected in the Title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1978. I have described its purpose and why we had to introduce it.  In 1976 we had the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1976.  The effect of that Bill was to withdraw the employment allowances but the Coalition Government then did not decide it was wrongly named.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I will not again go through the history of land policy in the past number of years but I will summarise it.  The policy under Coalition and Fianna Fáil Governments has been towards the abolition or the reduction of rates, towards the elimination of various hereditaments from rates.  If this Bill were to follow that <Col N="298" /> pattern it would have extended or increased the reliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Instead of increasing the percentage reliefs it has been drastically reduced in this Bill because farmers' rates this year will be increased in category by 66? per cent at £75 up to 80 per cent in another bracket.  How in the name of goodness can the Minister honestly say this Bill is similar to others in previous years?  This is part of the make-believe the Government are engaged in.  They try to tell the people they would have reduced unemployment by 25,000 by the end of this year yet they have by some means succeeded in reducing it by only 6,000 so far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am making only passing references to these matters.  They are making believe that they are reducing prices when prices are being increased. They stick a label on something and hope the people will accept it.  This Bill is another part of the make-believe but its provisions will rub salt into farmers' wounds because it will increase the rates on agricultural land, though the Government say it is a relief Bill.  It would drive anybody round the bend.  It is no wonder Deputy Daly over there could not sit in one seat.  He wriggled from place to place until he finally left the House in disgust. If people fall for this sort of thing they deserve the treatment they are getting.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should do the honest thing and introduce an amendment on Report Stage to change the Title to the Rates on Agricultural Land (Increase) Bill.  Then people looking for the Act in the Stationery Office would know where to find it.  When they find this Bill and look at its title they can go on holidays in expectation of reliefs they will never get.  It is very hard to be patient with this sort of codology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): That is only repeating the prescription.  Those in the £75 valuation bracket next year and those in the £60 valuation bracket the following year will not be too concerned with that £38 million because they will say it is for the other fellow.  There will not be the slightest rejoicing among them.  The people in the lower brackets who will get relief will say: &ldquo;That is what we expected.  That was the position last year and the year before.  We expected a little more.&rdquo;  They will say: &ldquo;Thank you for nothing.&rdquo;  I suggest that the Minister should become frank with the people and put the record straight by calling this Bill by its proper title.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): We are on section 2 which gives the Title of the Bill and I suggest the Bill should have the proper Title so that people looking for it, lawyers or ordinary laymen, will be able to find it.  They will know under what description to get it in an index.  No man, or his mother, if I may put it that way, would expect to find this Bill containing the provisions it does under its present title and I ask the Minister to have another look at it between now and Report Stage.  I may add we will be putting down an amendment on that stage to the Title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred perhaps with some justification, to the title of the 1976 Bill pointing out that that Bill also withdrew a relief, namely, the employment relief.  Perhaps it was mistitled too and, if it was, I am prepared to accept that, but I am not prepared to accept that there is any real proportionality between the withdrawal effected in the <Col N="300" /> 1976 Bill and the withdrawal being effected by this Bill.  Remember, the employment allowance at that time had remained at the same level for many years and had no real effect in either reducing rates or encouraging employment on the land.  To have had an effect it would have had to be increased very drastically and to try to equate that minor relief and its withdrawl with the very radical withdrawal being effected under this Bill is to equate two things which are not equatable.  The Minister should reconsider this Title by withdrawing altogether the word &ldquo;relief&rdquo; or finding a more apt title such as that suggested by Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>
      <P>My last point is&mdash;the Minister might consider responding to this&mdash;that this Bill is very difficult to read.  There is a tremendous number of cross-references&mdash;the Finance Act, 1974, the Local Government Act, 1946, and the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946&mdash;and one has to consult all these to understand fully what the position is.</P>

      <P>This is a most comprehensive Bill.  In his introductory speech on 25 April the Minister dealt at considerable length with a number of improvements from the point of view of safety in industry.  The improvements are ones to be commended but I believe there are further improvements that should be included and I shall elaborate on them later.  Any improvements designed to safeguard workers are important.  Any improvements in working conditions are also important. The Factories Act, 1955, is a very elaborate Act but it is 23 years old now and it requires to be updated. Again, we must welcome any improvement which will bring it up to present-day standards where we use modern technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to see improvements being made and also that an effort is being made to make workers' employment <Col N="302" /> safer.  When this Bill is passed I would not like to see a situation where, due to lack of adequate trained personnel in the Department, this legislation could not be enforced. This is very important.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed in this Bill are very wide-ranging and deal with noise, safety to eyes, safety with regard to lifting equipment, work on docks, quays and warehouses, fire-escapes, warning of fires, testing of machinery, lifting of cranes and weighing machines and the removal of inflammable and corrosive substances.  To enforce these regulations the Minister will have to employ many skilled personnel.  He, I am sure, will agree that this is essential and I hope when he closes this debate he will deal in considerable detail with the numbers of additional personnel who will need to be employed.</P>
    <P>I want to raise one point on which the Minister might think over the next few days.  This Bill deals with industry in general.  We have a music industry. Does this Bill encompass dance halls, lounge bars and so on?  Recently I was attending a function with a group of doctors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to get across to the Minister is that the hearing of our youth is in serious danger.  There is a danger that in years ahead we will have a generation coming out of dance halls and lounge bars whose hearing will have been impaired by 20 or 30 degrees.  Have the Department made a study of this, or perhaps this comes under the Department of Health?  The music industry is expanding and affects thousands of people.  The musical instruments and equipment, hi-fi and the elaborate gear used by bands for putting across louder and louder sounds is far above the normal that can be <Col N="303" /> listened to comfortably.  The group of doctors told me they felt this was causing serious injury to the present generation of young people.</P>
      <P>I will be returning to this at a later stage because it is essential that some effort be made by the Department to ensure that the sound in dance halls, lounge bars and so on is kept to a reasonable level.  Young boys and girls are very happy to go to these places. I appreciate that and understand it and participate myself but we will still have to make some effort to ensure that their hearing in later life is not impaired by excessive noise.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - House Building Costs : Motion.</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick (<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>) on Tuesday, 2 May 1978:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann expresses alarm at the unreasonable increase in the cost of house building and deplores the Government's failure to take remedial action&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;expresses confidence in the steps taken by the Government to regulate house building costs&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for the Environment.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to do something which the Minister did not do yesterday and that is stick to the facts, which are very startling.  It was revealed to me today by way of written answer that, whereas we were expressing concern yesterday at the rate of increase in house prices the true depths of that increase and its horrific dimensions were not fully appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the six months from June, when the Fianna Fáil Party were elected, to the end of that year the price of houses increased at an annual rate in excess of 40 per cent.  That figure is made up of an increase in the price of new houses of 21.5 per cent from <Col N="304" /> June to December and in the price of secondhand houses of 21.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>These are not my figures.  They are the Government's figures.  They lead me to one conclusion only.  Not merely is there no control on the price of housing or the rate of increase, but there is no interest in controlling or even being apprehensive about the rate of increase. On the contrary, I suspect there is pleasure in some Fianna Fáil quarters at the rate of increase which is militating against young couples all over the country and is in direct conflict with the promises of the now Government party at election time when they said in their manifesto they would give people an opportunity to buy houses and make it easier and cheaper for them to keep their houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not believe that, did he?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on record.  I am dealing with facts.  I want to reiterate that the increase in the price of new and secondhand housing is unprecedented in the history of the State. Even in the worst days of recession in the decades since we got our independence, the highest percentages I can discover were considerably lower than in excess of 40 per cent on an annual basis.  That is the current fact. No amount of evasion, argument or diversion of attention will take away from that fundamental fact.  It is a scandalous fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second fact is that within three months of the £1,000 grant scheme coming into operation, it had been totally eroded and the cost of new, and secondhand houses which it did not concern, had increased by in excess of £1,000 per house.  Within three months the £1,000 grant, that wonderful Utopian gesture which was held out to couples all over the country, was meaningless.  On 5 June in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, and in many other papers, there was a full page advertisement under the benign and smiling eyes of the now Taoiseach which said Fianna Fáil would give a £1,000 grant to first time house purchasers. It is there in black and white. It was in copies of the manifesto issued <Col N="305" /> all over the country.  It was not in the official manifesto, a limited number of copies of which were printed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in the Fianna Fáil Party paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said by their spokesmen and couples all over the country were deceived callously and deliberately into believing they would get a grant of £1,000 as soon as Fianna Fáil were in Government, in many cases to help them with their deposit. They were lies.  This was one of the most inflationary gestures in relation to houses in the past number of years. The outcome was to put into the pockets of certain Fianna Fáil builders very substantial sums of public money.</P>
      <P>There are mercenaries associated with Fianna Fáil and they rule the roost.  They are now reaping the harvest of the support they gave prior to last June.  There is no concern in that party about the rising cost of houses.  If there were, the Minister would have made some gesture to show he was concerned about it and to show he meant to take action about it. Instead, he fell back weakly and defensively on his record.  The record is there for all to see, an annual rate of increase in excess of 40 per cent.</P>
      <P>Deputies need not take my word about the £1,000 grant scheme.  One of the principal spokesmen, a member of the executive committee of the Construction Industry Federation was quoted in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 21 March this year as saying that ironically the system which was intended to help first-time buyers had turned around to act against them.  He said they found there were major problems involved in the administration of the scheme and they were unhappy with the way it had worked so far.  He said more, but time does not allow me to quote him.  What did he mean by that? He meant that, although there are approximately 11,000 applications before the Government, a paltry number of hundreds have been paid out, usually after enormous effort by a variety of people often including public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This must also be considered in the <Col N="306" /> context of an extraordinary tightening up on the issue of certificates of reasonable value which I find questionable and which should be looked at more closely.  The strategy in the White Paper dealing with housing is clearly calculated to encourage more people away from the local authority sector&mdash; a legitimate aspiration if they so wish&mdash; into the private sector, not to create more homes but to create more profit for people whose roots are in Fianna Fáil.  This leads me to one conclusion. Leaving as much political bias out of it as any party politician can, any reasonable person must conclude that if we are witnessing a rate of increase of the order which I not only suggest but state as a categorical fact on the Government's own figures, there must be a full public inquiry into the soaring cost of house building in order to defend home owners, decent builders who are entitled to their profits and who are creating jobs, and people who are publicly concerned, such as we on this side of the House.  Nothing less will suffice.</P>
    <P>There can be no justification for that rate of increase.  It will not taper off.  Only last week we heard the head of a major building society say in resigned tones that there will be a similar increase over the next six months.  There is no reason to believe the mercenaries in Fianna Fáil who are holding the reins at present will let go for a considerable time.  A vast rip-off is going on and people are pocketing vast sums of public money. By my estimate as much as £10 million to £11 million has gone into the pockets of major builders associated with Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>If that is not the truth I want the Minister to deny it and to explain how prices have increased by in excess of 40 per cent.  There is no explanation for it.  When you take the various strands together, when you look at the reneging on the promise given to young people to give a grant to first time house purchasers, young people who want to live here, who want to believe in parliamentary democracy and who, I have no doubt will now want to join the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party, <Col N="307" /> you realise they were misled shabbily and callously.</P>
    <P>The only way to clear the air is to have an open inquiry into where the money is going.  No responsible politician and no responsible builder will fear such an inquiry.  We do not.  I wonder can the Minister say the same. The White Paper on national development has been quoted occasionally.  I want to say very sincerely that the references to housing in it are not accidental. They are part of the Government's strategy.  Some months ago I was naive enough to feel it had a misguided social bias.  Now I see a deeper level of meaning for the increased scrutiny which local authorities will be requested to apply to housing applicants.  In the White Paper I see part of a strategy not to further boost home ownership by decent couples trying to establish a fundamental constitutional right but to put more money in the pockets of certain people. It is shoddy and shameful.  If the Minister wants to deny anything I have said, I will be very pleased to hear him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Keating expressed consternation at the scale of the increases over the past year in the cost of house building and tried to convey the impression of a Government completely complacent at this trend.  Obviously the sponsors of the motion did not relish the facts presented by the Minister, especially that during the year ending 31 March 1978 the house building cost index rose from 145.5 to 160.4, an increase of only 10.2 per cent compared with an increase of 22.2 per cent in the 12-month period ending 31 March 1977 and an unprecedented 36 per cent in the first year of the last Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keating finds these facts so unpalatable that he dismisses them as history.  If he cannot listen to the truth he should leave the House.  History remains on the record for future reference.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Deputies opposite have taken only a superficial glance at the trend in new house prices. Since the change of Government last July, new house prices have increased by approximately £2,500 on average. By introducing the £1,000 new house grant and raising the loan limit under the SDA scheme, the Government made available an extra £3,500 for most SDA cases.  Deputies Fitzpatrick and Keating failed to recall what happened between 1973 and 1977.  Let me refresh their memories.  Between June 1973 and June 1977, the average price of new houses for which loans were approved by the main lending agencies increased by about £7,500. During that period the Government failed to increase the SDA loan limit by a penny; they made no adjustment in the new house grant and they imposed stringent income and valuation restrictions on eligibility for their new house grants.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick last night selectively quoted the increases recorded in the house building cost index for the second, third and fourth quarters of 1977.  He conveniently ignored the fact that in the first quarter of 1977 building costs went up by 7½ per cent&mdash;an all-time record for any period of three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At no stage have the Government sought to cloak the way in which house prices have increased during the past year.  The facts are in the records published by my Department.  As the Minister pointed out yesterday, house building costs cannot be considered in isolation. In particular, trends in the level of housing costs must be considered in relation to the normal outgoings on the <Col N="309" /> part of a house purchaser and the level of his income.  Over the past 12 months the average income of adult male workers engaged in transportable goods industries has increased by about £700 a year.</P>
    <P>The average gross price of houses for which loans were approved during the quarter ended 31 March 1977 was £13,500.  The interest rate on loans advanced by building societies at that time was 13.95 per cent, so that over a repayment period of 25 years a purchaser receiving a 75 per cent loan would have to pay £1,467 a year.  The average price of new houses for which loans were approved in the quarter ended 31 December last was £15,784, an appreciable increase, but interest rates charged by building societies had decreased in the meantime to 9.5 per cent, so that loan repayments on the basis of a 75 per cent loan would have decreased to £1,247.  It is highly relevant also to remember that since the beginning of the present year and in pursuance of their election manifesto the Government have ended the rates burden on residential property.  This is an important aspect of the situation.</P>
    <P>There is no question of the builders of any grant-type houses or flats making exorbitant profits because the price of each dwelling has to be submitted for scrutiny to my Department and a certificate of reasonable value issued before the grant is payable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to repeat the advice which the Minister gave yesterday to house purchasers to make sure that they see the certificate of reasonable value before committing themselves to purchasing a house and also to make sure that they are not paying more than the price approved on the certificate.  This advice cannot be repeated too often.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>They are being issued faster than the Deputy thinks. There can be no doubt that the CRV system has had a beneficial effect on house prices since its introduction. <Col N="310" /> Since the beginning of the present year alone it has resulted in reductions in proposed house prices totalling some £200,000&mdash;savings secured for house purchasers.  Yet that figure, impressive though it is, is by no means a full measure of the effectiveness of the controls. Builders have been compelled to adopt a more disciplined approach to costing and pricing their houses because they know that prices which are unreasonable or unjustifiable will not be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot have it both ways.  In addition, the controls have been instrumental in persuading many builders to adopt fixed prices&mdash; not including price variation clauses in the contract&mdash;while the house building cost index and the fact that price variation charges may be subject to Departmental scrutiny have helped to ensure that purchasers are not being exploited under these clauses.</P>
      <P>Deputies Fitzpatrick and Keating alleged that the CRV system is being used to avoid paying grants and that there is a cut-back in the number of CRVs being issued to achieve this end. Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no basis whatever for this allegation.  In the first four months of this year 692 certificates were issued compared with 474 in the same period last year&mdash;an increase of almost 50 per cent.  These are facts and figures which are in the records and they can be checked.  In those four months the average time between the receipt of a properly documented application for a CRV and the issue of a decision was 21, 17, 21 and 16 days respectively.  Steps are being taken by my Department to increase the professional staff dealing with applications for CRVs in order to process the applications more expeditiously. In the light of the Deputies' <Col N="311" /> allegations I have had a random check made on current applications for new house grants.  This clearly establishes that only an insignificant proportion of applications are held up because a CRV has not been issued.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that land speculators are circumventing the CRV controls by selling sites to small builders at exorbitant prices; these builders then establish the price they have actually paid and base their applications for CRVs on that consideration. While considerable weight is given by the Department to such evidence, it is not necessarily accepted if, for instance, the site price is considered to be unreasonably high having regard to other information available regarding site values in the same or a comparable area.  Therefore, if a builder pays an exorbitant price for land he cannot assume that this will automatically be accepted in full for CRV purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>While site prices are increasing this trend should be put into proper perspective.  A comparison of CRV applications made about three or four years ago and some current ones shows that the developed site cost as a percentage of the total price remained at about 23 per cent in both instances.  This is a very interesting statistic.  During the recession site costs remained fairly static despite rapid inflation and, therefore, lost real value.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite have cast doubts on the effectiveness of the £1,000 house grant, and they have been particularly critical of the long time the grants have been taking to mature for payment. Let me give a few figures that will indicate what has been happening.  Since the scheme was introduced last July and until the end of April 1978 more than 11,700 applications for the grants were received; 6,672 have been approved and 1,794 have been paid. Many more are in the course of payment. The rate at which payments are being made has been growing steadily, and last month alone 570 grants were paid.</P>

If Deputy Keating or any other Deputy has a problem in relation to a grant application I shall be very glad to discuss the matter with him and we can then sort it out.</P>
      <P>The experience in regard to the flow of payments following the introduction of the new scheme of grants is exactly the same as that which occurred in 1932 when Fianna Fáil launched a new scheme of housing grants.  Only 803 grants were paid in the first year of operation, but that number quadrupled in the following year and was 4,777 in 1934-35.  Again, when Fianna Fáil promoted the Housing Act, 1948, which greatly increased the existing housing grants, the number of payments in the following years grew sharply.  History is repeating itself now. I have no doubt that the £1,000 new house grant scheme is a fabulous scheme, and it will provide a tremendous incentive in the coming years for people to build their own houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick criticised the fact that the grant is not paid until a house is completed and occupied.  He raised this issue previously when speaking on the Vote for the Department of the Environment.  It is a condition that the house must be for the applicant's own occupation and the applicant must be qualified in so far as he has not previously built or bought a house for his own occupation, so payment cannot be made until the house is occupied. However, the arrangement should not give rise to any appreciable hardship. <Col N="313" /> It is common practice for applicants to arrange to have the grants paid to them c/o a bank or a builders providers. Banks normally will facilitate house purchasers to the extent of the £1,000 once the applicant produces a copy of the certificate of approval and agrees to authorise payment being made c/o the bank.</P>

The provision is intended only to give the Minister power, in the occasional case where he may have doubts about an applicant's eligibility, to inquire whether his tax record confirms that he did not purchase or build a house previously.  The ordinary applicant making a truthful declaration has nothing whatever to fear from this provision.  There is absolutely no evidence that eligible persons are foregoing the grant on this account, as alleged by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern was expressed last night at the drop in recent months in the net inflow of funds to building societies. It is true that there has been a drop but nevertheless the inflow for the January-March 1978 quarter at £21.3 million was well up on the total of £17.8 million in the corresponding quarter last year.  The inflow of £5.7 million in February 1978 was disappointing. This increased to £5.9 million last month, and present indications are that the level of inflow will pick up somewhat to reach a total of £7 million for this month.  As the <Col N="314" /> Minister indicated last night, the position in this respect is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>Listening to Opposition Deputies one might conclude that the Government should increase public capital expenditure on housing.  Looking back at their own record, we find that total public capital expenditure on housing dropped from £115 million in 1975 to a miserable £99 million last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must have regard to the facts.  This year the Government have increased the provision for public capital expenditure on housing by over £41 million as compared with last year.  That is a significant amount in any language.  Surely it is not being suggested that additional moneys should be provided from the public purse?  The provision of such moneys might well tend to over-heat the situation and to generate further price increases.</P>
      <P>Of course the Opposition do not mention that house completions this year will probably be about 2,000 up on last year and show an increase of more than 2,500 on the level of completions achieved in 1976.  So far this year new house completions are more or less on target.  During the first quarter of 1978 an estimated 6,730 dwellings were completed compared with 5,673 in the corresponding period last year.  This trend is encouraging.</P>
      <P>Housing output generally represents about 40 per cent of the total output in the building and construction industry. Nobody will dispute the fact that the industry is in a healthier state now than it has been since 1973.  To illustrate this point, I should draw attention to the trend in domestic sales of cement, which give a good general indication of the state of the building and construction industry from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1977 home sales of cement increased by 1.1 per cent compared with 1976.  Sales for the period from 1 January up to 23 April are a massive 16.8 per cent up on the corresponding period last year.  The latest year on year increase is 8 per cent.  The case for pumping more state money into house building or indeed the building and construction industry over and above that provided in January last has not been established. There is no better criterion than the sale of cement.  Any such action would not alone push up house prices but would also create rather than solve other problems in the industry.</P>
      <P>The Deputy again raised the now familiar phrase of the Coalition for local authority housing based on their misrepresentation of or inability to interpret what was said in the White Paper on local authority houses.  I can assure them that their lament is premature. The local authority housing construction programme is alive and doing remarkably well.  We came into this year with 8,962 dwellings in progress, compared with 8,281 at the end of December 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of men employed on the programme at the latest date for which returns are available, 28 February 1978, was 6,454.  This shows an <Col N="316" /> increase of 664 on the 5,790 employed on the corresponding date last year. Yet we are supposed to have run down the local authority programme.  Since the Deputy appears to be claiming that the increased number of houses in progress at the end of last December was somehow attributable to the efforts of the previous Government, I might emphasise that the number of houses in progress at 31 July 1977 was 8,159. By 30 September 1977 it had risen above 9,000 and stood at 8,862 by the end of last December.</P>
    <P>It is no harm, however, that Deputy Keating seems to have woken up to the fact that there has been a change of Government and that private housing is once more getting proper encouragement and emphasis.  I think it well to spell out again for him and for other Opposition Deputies who persist in reading what they politically want into the White Paper reference to local authority housing that no decision has been taken to run down the local authority programme; that, on the contrary, the PCP allocation this year is a full 9 per cent up on 1977; that the design of the houses being built and the quality of the construction has never been higher; and that increased emphasis is being given to the total housing environment, not just the houses, in planning new schemes.</P>
    <P>One other matter needs clarification. Certain press reports, which appeared today, of comments which a CIF spokesman, and the manager of their National House Building Guarantee Scheme are alleged to have made about NBA schemes, seem to imply faults in design and low standards in the houses being provided by the National Building Agency.  I should make it clear that the quality of the design and construction of NBA houses being built at present is the best in the history of the State, and is generally superior to most comparable private housing schemes.</P>
    <P>I have, naturally, a special interest in Kerry.  There have been public comments too about the inadequacy of moneys made available to Kerry County Council for their housing programme.  Taking account of the high level of existing commitments <Col N="317" /> nationally, the special provision made for the local authorities in the Dublin area, and the consequent tightness of the balance available for new work, Kerry County Council have done reasonably well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister fully appreciates the degree of housing needs in Kerry and is most anxious to give them more capital when the resources are available. Deputy Keating had not the correct figures when earlier this evening he claimed that house prices increased by an annual rate of 40 per cent between June and September 1977.  The average gross price of new houses for which loans were approved by the principal lending agencies increased from £14,306 in the April-June quarter to £15,784 in the October-December quarter, representing an increase of 10.2 per cent or an annual rate of 20.4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the motion put down by the Opposition was put down in haste and without due consideration given to it.  It was badly timed.  Obviously they did not check their facts; they did not check the records; they did not take into account the effect which the £1,000 grant is having on the house building programme in general.  They did not take into consideration the substantial increase in loans being made available by local authorities now under Fianna Fáil. They did not take cognisance of the fact that when they were in Government and had a chance to do something about it they did a most despicable <Col N="318" /> thing on 1 January 1976 when they withdrew, without any notice whatever to the public, grants for the vast majority of our people who would be building homes for themselves despite the fact that many of those people had their application forms filled, had got planning permission, had their applications fully documented and were ready to submit them to the then Department of Local Government for approval.  They found out that there were no grants available for them. That was the most despicable thing that was ever done in the history of housing in the country.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil commenced the housing grants programme in 1932 which led to revolutionary changes in the building of houses in the country.  It led to an increased number of houses being built at a greater rate year by year.  It is now a question of history repeating itself.  I have no doubt that this year and in the years to come we will see more houses being built by both the public and the private sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has called the ground upon which he wants to debate this.  He talks about confidence. He expresses confidence in the steps taken by the Government to regulate housebuilding costs, and last night he spent most of his time raking over the coals of history.  The Minister of State, who is leaving the Chamber now, talked about history repeating itself. Since the completion of the quotation is, &ldquo;Once in tragedy and the second time in farce&rdquo;, I suggest to the Minister that I will deal with his record on the basis of what he and his colleague in Government do.  If he wants to talk about the past let us swop places.  I will go back to the Seanad, the Minister can come back to this side, and we will talk about what was happening in the past on that basis.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with the here and now and with the promises of a Government who have a massive democratic mandate.  The members of my party and I know what we did in Government and we make no apology for that.  We are dealing now with the Minister who has responsibility for it, and he is asking us to express confidence in his ability and that of his Government to regulate house prices.</P>
      <P>I do not believe it is possible to operate any governmental system without some attitude to social values, and in order to find that values system in the present Government I went sequentially through the documents that would be relevant to that. The manifesto upon which the Government obtained a mandate&mdash;though they had not indicated that they were going to change the name of the Department&mdash;contains a statement on page 26 which I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A forward looking and socially committed Department will be the centre of our Local Government policy.  An immediate injection of an extra £30 million for the building and construction industry will <Col N="320" /> create 5,000 new jobs in the first year of Government.  Because Fianna Fáil believes that as many families as possible should own their own homes, it will be made easier to buy a house and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>wait for this:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;cheaper to keep it.</P>
    <P>That is what they said before they got in.  In the White Paper <i>National Development 1977-1980</i> the phraseology is pretty much the same.  The priority of concern was also the same. &ldquo;Infrastructure Development&rdquo; is the title of section 5 on page 41 and we start, not with a socially committed Government or Department, but first the building industry, then housing, then private housing, and then local authority housing.  On page 42, paragraph 5.7 they state under &ldquo;Private Housing&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>It is the Government's policy to help and encourage as many as possible to provide their own homes. Finance for house purchase loans is now more readily available than it has been for a long time and interest rates generally are much lower.  The new £1,000 grant for first time owner/occupiers of new houses will considerably ease the other major problem of potential house buyers, namely the raising of a deposit.</P>
    <P>That should sound familiar.  I continue:</P>
    <P>The Government believe that in the period to 1980 private sector institutions must continue to provide the bulk of the mortgage finance needed for private house purchase.</P>
    <P>Finally, in terms of getting some indication of what the Government's policy is, the Minister in his Estimate speech on 9 March reported in the Official Report, Volume 304, column 1227, stated, and I quote:</P>
    <P>It is a basic tenet of the Government's housing policy that as many families as possible should be helped and encouraged to provide their own houses.</P>
    <P>Not many people in this House would disagree with those suggestions, but <Col N="321" /> we are being asked tonight, in effect, to express confidence in the Government's ability, through their policy of regulating housebuilding prices, to achieve the objectives outlined in those three statements which, taken sequentially, run over a period of approximately nine months.</P>
    <P>What did we get last night from the mover of the amendment?  We got nothing of that.  We got figures.  Now I am neither a Minister O'Donoghue nor a former Minister Garret FitzGerald. I have to see figures in black and white before I can do my sums fully, and I do not think I am abnormal in that regard.  We did not get anything from the Government side or from the Minister that would give me any confidence to suggest that he has the ability to regulate house prices.  We got no analysis of the housing market, no analysis of housing demand, no analysis of what the population increase is, of what the headship rate is, of what the regional breakdown of that headship rate is, of what the impact of that headship on a regional basis is likely to be in areas of rapid urban growth.  Therefore we do not know in real terms what the demand is.</P>
    <P>We know, taking a quotation from another section from the White Paper on national development that the estimates, going back to an NESC publication, talk in terms of something between 21,000 and 28,000 necessary to satisfy housing demand.  I have seen a similar aggregate figure produced for the Dublin region expressed in terms of what Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council refer to as the Dublin sub-region.  I defy any public representative in this Chamber to relate the achievements of those aggregate figures to the endless housing queues that will arrive at any one of our clinics, and then to say to somebody, &ldquo;You will be housed on the basis of aggregate demand being supplied. Mind you, it will not be on the basis that you need it, but it will be supplied nevertheless&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The words of the Government policy were about houses and homes.  Making a house into a home needs a certain <Col N="322" /> number of factors to be available, and I will return to that point.  The Minister who moved this amendment gave us no analysis of what demand for housing is in real terms and no kind of breakdown of that demand.  I would be the first to admit&mdash;with regret&mdash; that we did not have a 1976 census, the first figures of which would now be coming through and which would provide some of that.  For a Government who are so full of ideas about creating new jobs something parallel to the 1975 Labour survey might have done this job and would have given us some indication&mdash;particularly in the key areas of growth which have already been identified&mdash;as to the real extent of the demand.</P>
    <P>The Minister can come back to me on that and say that local authorities effectively, by processing their housing applications, have a fair assessment of what the housing demand is.  I would say &ldquo;Not so&rdquo; if that is going to be the reply, because it is dealing with only one-third of satisfied demand at the best of times.  If you take a figure of 24,000 houses, and indeed if you go to the figure that is likely to be built this year of 26,500, it is less than one-third.  We are being asked by a Minister to vote confidence in him on the basis of his ability to regulate house prices.  We get no profile in his speech of what the demand is.</P>
    <P>The other component is the costs. We get no analysis of what constitutes housing costs or of the factors which go up to make them.  There is more involved than merely the building costs.  Last evening we were given figures in regard to the house building index but with respect I might say that we were not given much that made sense.  Housing costs include the cost, self evidently, of land, labour and materials.  In these days of increasing urbanisation and rapidly expanding suburbs there are involved also, if one talks about turning a house into a home, transport costs and the cost of providing neighbourhood facilities.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that a Government that aspired to regulating building costs and to turning into reality the social objectives outlined in the manifesto and upheld in the national <Col N="323" /> development plan, would at least begin to try to do the sums in regard to the costs involved.  One would have thought that a Government that were so endowed with the benefit of a think-tank in Opposition plus the benefit of many years' administrative experience of Government would have been able to start attempting to assess what the real cost is of providing houses.  I am not talking merely of four walls and a roof but of all the other factors such as serviced land, schools, churches, neighbourhood centres and so on.</P>
    <P>In my innocence I asked a question of a Minister who, strangely, is very silent these days.  Does anybody remember the Minister for Economic Planning and Development?  I asked that saviour of the soldiers of destiny the following question as reported at column 1300 of the Official Report for 9 March:</P>
    <P>.... if his Department have undertaken any studies whereby the cost of providing housing in expanded suburban areas can be properly compared with the cost of providing infill housing in existing built-up areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the reply was in the negative, and I shall not waste the time of the House repeating the remainder of his reply since most of the members were present then anyway. The Government do not know the relative cost <i>in toto</i> between suburban housing and infill city housing but they say that the high cost of inner city housing and the subsidies it entails must be subject to critical review, that the high cost of inner city housing cannot be carried on indefinitely.  I could put on the record the precise wording from the White Paper but I shall not use my time in that manner.</P>
    <P>I should be fascinated to hear the Minister tell us how it is proposed to have a critical review of something in respect of which the Government have not had the full picture.  How can they review critically the cost of providing one form of housing as against another?</P>

      <P>Until such time as the Department affirm authorship for that report I will not level it at the door of that Department.  The question was addressed to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the answer came from him.  The net effect of that kind of review, in the absence of adequate facts and figures, will put off the provision of such housing.  In my quotation from the manifesto I referred to Fianna Fáil's objective of trying to keep down the cost of running a house.  If you push people out to the suburb to areas where there are no facilities and over a stretch of inadequate roads for which CIE have increased their fares recently by 20 per cent, you are not reducing the cost of housing.  An example of what I mean relates to Dublin County Council's development plan.  This is a county council that is due to grow in terms of population size from a base figure in 1971 by 300 per cent by 1991; that is the scale of growth and the demand is being aggravated by forcing housing into the suburbs on the basis of totally inadequate costing.  Families going to live in those new suburbs find that there is need to build a church and a primary school, and in real terms this requirement for each family in an area of 5,000 people or 1,200 families per the county council's development plan based on the Share figures for the Dublin archdiocese is £1,000 per family based on 1972-73 figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These, then, are some of the factors that are involved in the real cost of housing, but these factors were not recognised in the reply given to me by <Col N="325" /> the Minister for Economic Planning and Development on 9 March.  Neither was there any indication last night from the Minister who is responsible for regulating house prices that he is aware of these factors.  Yet, he asks us, by way of amendment, to vote a motion of confidence in his ability to regulate house building costs.  How can we vote confidence in anybody who appears not to know the full equation?</P>
    <P>If I am doing the Minister an injustice I shall be happy to be corrected. It is early days yet.  We are not out of the first lap of this year, and if the Minister has information that will answer some of the questions I have asked I shall be very glad to hear them. The problem is on too large a scale for us to be playing party politics with.</P>
    <P>What is the social impact of what has occurred since Fianna Fáil were returned to power in terms of their housing policy?  I would suggest that there has been an impact in two areas among many.  The abolition of rates on domestic dwellings makes for cheaper running costs for all houses.  That was a popular move.  Perhaps in terms of the necessary reform of an updated system of property taxation it was long overdue, but its immediate effect was regressive in terms of the redistribution of wealth.  They abolished car tax on cars of up to 20-horsepower but people owning cars of a greater horsepower than that would hardly need help.</P>

      <P>I accept the correction. I am making the point about the net effect of the parcel of housing policy provided by Fianna Fáil, that my assessment&mdash;and I do not believe enough dust has settled to fully assess it&mdash;is that it has been inflationary in terms of the immediate input, in terms of the capital cost of housing.  The shift of resources in real and absolute terms away from the local authority sector into the private sector and in some cases into the private sector that did not need it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The net effect of the car tax measure plus the rates has been inflationary, but there has been another measure, or another lack of decision from the Minister, which also has disastrous implications for the cause of keeping the running costs of houses within a socially acceptable range.  I am paraphrasing the objective of the manifesto.  I am referring to the draft regulations for builders.  The Minister, in the perfectly reasonable ideological choice that he and his Party made, decided that the private sector should be boosted, a perfectly reasonable choice if you happen to represent the private sector.  I would have thought that the least the Minister could have done would be to ask that the private sector house building section maintain, if not increase, the standard of housing insulation that is applied to local authorities, and that he would have brought into effect much sooner the draft building regulations, because outside some major urban areas there are no building bye-laws regulating the construction of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may contradict myself and just refer to the fact that the Minister in his role as Opposition spokesman was extremely vocal on the question of energy and energy conservation and indeed was a very good spokesman in that field, it is my regret that he seems to have forgotten a lot of what was said when he occupied these benches and talked about such a policy.  In terms of energy conservation and consequently of attempting to attain the objective of keeping down the cost of housing, two decisions, one a positive one and the other an omission or non-decision of the Department, to date have directly resulted and will directly result in increased energy costs which <Col N="327" /> are a component in running any house whether you are travelling to or from it or whether you are trying to keep it warm, and that is going to make it dearer to live in your own house and that is not keeping down the cost of houses.</P>
    <P>The Government are asking us to vote for an amendment in the name of the Minister for the Environment expressing confidence in their ability to regulate house prices.  The Government have demonstrated since they came into office their clear bias in favour of the private sector.  I would have thought that the least we could have expected from that Government would be some understanding of the way in which the housing market operates and that the least we could have expected from a Minister, not of Local Government but of the Environment, would be some overall analysis, first of all, of the problem and, second, concern and, finally, would it have been too much to expect that some of the social objectives outlined in the manifesto might have been readily demonstrated by concrete policy measures?  They are absent.  I regret that they are absent because I do not think that housing lists are a political football.  The kind of mentality that wrote the section on housing and on local authority housing contained in the national development document is the mentality in real political terms that has never had to face a young couple and try to explain to them why they must continue sleeping in a bedroom at home with a brother and sister in it in the interests of national development.</P>
    <P>The Minister for State at the Department of the Environment talked about history and the great role of the Fianna Fáil Party in terms of housing.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Corish, refers to 1932.  My parents were not even married in 1932.  Nineteen thirty-two is a long time ago and the recent history of the role of housing within the Fianna Fáil Party is not one that I would boast about in terms of what was done in the early 60s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> I will conclude by saying that we are faced with a population growth of totally unprecedented proportions relative to the collective experience of this House.  One does not have to be a professor of economics to realise that that growth will have an extraordinary impact on the demand for housing and that that impact, in an open market situation, where the private sector is encouraged, will create havoc with the cost of houses.  Some of the components of housing supply such as serviced land and materials and uncontrollable items such as the weather, as the Minister recognised in his Estimate speech last year, are factors which cannot be turned on like a tap.  The net effect in a squeeze market will be rapidly escalating prices in the kind of society that we unfortunately have and which Fianna Fáil are happy to operate whenever the market comes to play on something as basic as housing, which is enshrined in the United Nations declaration as a basic human right. When the market gets its hands on that commodity it is always the poor and the weak and the defenceless who go unhoused and who have to wait until the private sector has been accommodated first.  I do not know where it is written down that that should be.  I do not know what law or what divine right says that that is how it should be, but that is the way it happens, and this Government in what they said tonight, in what the Minister said last night when moving this amendment, and in what they have done since they came to office, have given no indication whether with regard to land prices, with regard to controlling the cost of materials or with regard to seriously and responsibly operating the CRV system, that they will in any way change that market system.  They are doing it at a time when the country's population is growing at a rate we have never seen before.  How can we have confidence in a Government to regulate house prices when we have already seen what they can do before the first lap is over?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my confidence in the Minister, in the measures he is taking and in those he will take in the future.  Deputy Quinn <Col N="329" /> has said that Fianna Fáil promised to make houses easier to buy and cheaper. I would refer Deputy Quinn for a start to some of the measures which have been taken by the Minister.  He has stimulated the building industry and, therefore, we will have more houses in this year&mdash;26,500 in 1978 is the target. He has provided more finance.  He has indicated that the amount of the SDA loans will be increased from £17 million to £39 million, an increase of £22 million this year, and that building societies project an increase of £30 million&mdash;a total increase of £52 million for housing from those sources alone in the year.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also given assistance to the first time house purchasers with the £1,000 grant.  He has helped those buying houses through SDA loans by increasing the amount of the loans to £7,000 and the income limit to £3,500.  He has made it cheaper for houseowners to keep their houses because he has abolished rates.  Building society interest has been reduced and SDA loan interest has been reduced from 12½ per cent to 11½ per cent. The cost of electricity which comes into these houses has been reduced, ground rents are being eliminated and existing ground rents have gone virtually. The CRV indicates the Minister's intention in this sphere of activity.  I say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to the Minister.  He has made an excellent start and we can have every confidence in him.</P>
      <P>In regard to the future, Deputy Quinn said we should not look on these matters as a political football.  I will not do that but I would have expected to have heard from Deputy Quinn some constructive suggestions if he has not been looking at it as a political football.  I was glad to hear the Minister say he will give us a review of the situation in his Estimate speech.  My main concern is in relation to first time purchasers on low or moderate incomes, in particular those who will be buying houses in the £8,000 to £16,000 bracket.  The present SDA loan of £7,000, plus the grant of £1,000 and, perhaps, savings of £1,000, give a total of £9,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister might <Col N="330" /> consider bridging the gap between that £9,000 and the present average house prices by looking at the possibility of a two-tier system of home loans for people with incomes of less than £5,000.  There could be SDA loans of, say, £3,000 on a fixed interest rate for 35 years, with building societies or other financial institutions providing the balance.  Such a system will be needed in the future.  Though I have every confidence in the effectiveness of the steps the Minister has taken, I suggest that he would consider the possibilities I have been putting forward.</P>
    <P>It is important that the full burden of the increased SDA loans should not be left on the State.  I suggest that the financial institutions should be asked to contribute to a home loans fund and that they would be helped to contribute to the administration of such a fund through a home loans board.  I was glad to hear the Minister saying last night that he will examine the Kenny Report on the price and availability of land and that he intends to take any practical steps he considers feasible.  He has made an excellent start and I am confident that he will continue along those lines.</P>

      <P>Despite what the Minister of State has said, this motion, to which my name is appended, was put down in a serious manner as a result of the unreasonable rate of increases in house prices.  I am intrigued by the Minister's amendment, which states that confidence should be expressed in the Government and their ability to regulate house building costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago in the House I sought without success to have housing included in the ambit of the Consumer Information Bill, now an Act. Vague reasons were given for my lack of success.  The end result is that houses and housing costs have been increasing at an alarming rate.  We have been accused of dealing in fiction. No later than today, as Deputy Keating has stated, the percentage increases&mdash;I am quoting from an official reply given today&mdash;in the average gross prices of houses in the Dublin area for which loans were approved <Col N="331" /> by the main lending agencies since June 1977 was 8.8 per cent in the case of new houses and 8.6 per cent in the case of previously occupied houses in the three months ending 30 September 1977.  In the following three months the percentage increases were 12.7 and 12.5 respectively.  Information in respect of the quarter ending 31 March last is not yet available, and God help us when it becomes available.  I have been reading from an official reply, and I put it to the Minister of State, not now here, that it is far removed from the increases he suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We are grateful for the correction.  The figures speak for themselves.  Housing is a very serious area of activity for any Minister or for the people of any society because of its far reaching social implications.  On assuming office the Minister stated&mdash; it had been already stated in Fianna Fáil's manifesto&mdash;that as far as it was possible people would be encouraged to own their homes.  In this country we have a proud record of house ownership. We have the highest percentage of home owners in any country probably in the world.  It has been a tradition with us.  Encouraging people to own their homes is a worth-while aspiration, but encouraging is only part of it.  Forcing them is a different matter&mdash;forcing people who are not capable of meeting the financial demands of agencies to pay for these homes.  That is what I object to, and the Minister cannot deny that force is being applied.  By virtue of the fact that he has ploughed millions of pounds into the private sector, the public sector is paying the price, the price being a reduction in public sector housing, social housing.  I will quote two or <Col N="332" /> three examples from figures given by the Minister in a tabular reply some weeks ago.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State is here now because one of the examples I will give concerns his county.  The demand in County Kerry for work to be started before 31 July is £1.017 million and the allocation made is £470,000.  In my county&mdash;in case the Minister of State would think the Minister for the Environment had anything against him&mdash;we looked for £969,000 and we have been told we will be getting £290,000, less than one-third of what we need.  It shows that the money being pumped into the private sector is costing the public sector dearly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Deputy Woods mentioned interest costs and the ESB.  Deputy Woods is an intelligent man who knows exactly why the rate of interest came down and ESB rates came down.  It was not because of any effort on the part of his colleagues but because of world trends in world markets and changing money values.  The Minister for the Environment smiles.  Does he believe his colleague, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, who stood up in those benches and said that, as a result of consultation with the board of the ESB, he was proud to confirm a reduction of 5 per cent?  We all know that 5 per cent reduction came about as a result of forward purchasing by the ESB.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>And fuel oil.  These are facts concerning the rate of interest <Col N="333" /> of the ESB.  When we were on that side of the House we were castigated for holding down the level of SDA loans to £4,500.  I looked up the records.  The main problem according to the Opposition was that the unfortunate house purchaser had to make up £2,500 to £3,000, which represented the shortfall between the SDA loan and grant and the cost of the actual house.  I took myself away from here for an hour and a half today.  I visited three auctioneers' premises.  Deputy Woods mentioned a figure which I will now confirm.  I must have checked some 20 or 30 houses in the three different establishments.  The average three-bedroomed semi-detached house is selling in the region of £14,000 to £16,500.  When one looks at the £7,000 &mdash;this enormous amount of money now given as a loan&mdash;what is the shortfall? One is talking of a shortfall of £7,000 to £9,000.  This is what has happened, and the Minister and his Government do not seem to know this is what has happened and is happening.  The increases taking place now are going very quickly beyond the reach of the ordinary person who should, and I emphasise this, be really looked after by what I call social housing.  These are being forced into these £15,000, £16,000 and £17,000 houses because the Minister simply does not care and will not provide social housing. Remember, the National Coalition Government provided on average 25,000 houses per annum, and that at a time when the country was in the middle of a very, very severe world recession.</P>

If the concern so loudly expressed in certain documents were implemented we should be talking now of 28,000 to 38,000 houses.  These are not being provided, and unfortunate purchasers are forced into £15,000 and £16,000 semi-detached houses, people who <Col N="334" /> should be going into local authority housing.</P>
      <P>As a public representative I am sure the Minister has come across applicants for this famous £1,000 grant.  We know now that so many obstacles are placed in the way of these applicants that this grant is of no use to them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the percentage increase in house prices, both new and second-hand, in the Dublin area for the three monthly periods since June 1977; and if he is aware of recent statements by representatives of the Construction Industry Federation and various auctioneers as to the lack of effectiveness of the £1,000 grant scheme and the role it has had in relation to increases in the price of houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentage increases in the average gross prices of houses in the Dublin area for which loans were approved by the main lending agencies since June 1977 were 8.8 per cent in the case of new houses and 8.6 per cent for previously occupied houses in the three months ended 30 September 1977.  In the following three months the increases were 2.7 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively.  Information for the quarter ended 31 March 1978 is not yet available.</P>
      <P>Regarding the second part of the question, I have seen press reports of conflicting statements, attributed to the federation and to some auctioneers, about the effectiveness of the £1,000 grant.  I do not accept the suggestion that this grant has been ineffective and that it has been responsible for the increase in house prices.  In July last the scheme of house price control operated by my Department was extended to all State-aided new private houses and flats being provided for sale.  The grant is payable direct to the first-time owner-occupier so that the builder does not &ldquo;pocket the grant&rdquo;. In 1977 house prices throughout the country increased by 20 per cent, which was generally in line with increase in the average earnings of adult male workers engaged in transportable goods industries.</P>

Ar an dáta sin bhí 656 dhuine fostaithe go lánaimseartha i rannóga trádála Ghaeltarra.  Sa bhliain 1965 tugadh cumhachtaí breise do Ghaeltarra chun tionscail a chur chun cinn agus tosaíodh ar an eagraíocht a neartú chun feidhm a bhaint astu.  De réir a chéile tháinig fás ar an bhfostaíocht faoi scáth Ghaeltarra (is é sin, ina rannóga trádála féin&mdash;a ndearnadh fochomhlachtaí díobh tar éis tamaill&mdash; agus sna tionscail ar chabhraigh sé leo): fás de bhreis ar 400 ar an meán in aghaidh na bliana a tháinig le seacht mbliana anuas.  B'é líon na bhfostaithe lánaimsire faoi scáth Ghaeltarra in ndeireadh na bliana ná 1,857 i 1972, 2,366 i 1973, 3,502 i 1976 agus 4,213 i 1977.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, during the first and third weeks of April 1978 officers of their investigation staff conducted a comprehensive survey of traders in the Clonmel area calling at a total of 366 premises.  The purpose of the survey was to ascertain the level of compliance with the requirements relating to PAYE and VAT.</P>
      <P>It is normal practice not to attempt to enter into discussions with traders in the public areas of business premises and to request that the discussion should take place away from the trading area.  Where this request cannot be met and it is found necessary to have discussions in the public area the greatest care is taken to avoid being overheard.  The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that these practices were fully maintatined during the operations in Clonmel.</P>
      <P>Advance notice is normally given where a detailed examination of a trader's records is proposed.  For the kind of survey carried out in Clonmel it is not the custom to give notice and it is not proposed to change the present practice.  Where, however, arising from the initial visits a further visit for the purposes of a full investigation is found necessary advance notice will be given in accordance with normal practice.</P>

    <P>Inquiry has been made as to whether the Church of Ireland Board of Education and the Secondary Education Committee would wish to be invited to meet the Minister for Education for discussions on the provisions of the draft model of trust for the community schools.</P>
    <P>Invitations to a meeting with the Minister in relation to this matter have not so far been issued to any other organisation or group.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the present draft of the model lease in relation to representation on the management board are set out at paragraph (3) of the First Schedule of the Lease.  A copy of the lease was placed in the Library of Dáil Éireann on 6 May 1976.</P>

If this matter is satisfactorily resolved the appointment of the additional teacher will be authorised.</P>
