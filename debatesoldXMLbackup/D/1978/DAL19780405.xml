      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>) asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the report commissioned by the Turf Club from which it appears that the stakes for horse racing have not increased in real terms since 1950; and if, in view of the importance of the racing industry to the economy of the country, he will take steps to allocate a substantial amount of the money collected by way of tax on betting to the Racing Board so that stakes may be increased, having regard to the present cost of keeping horses in training and other expenses incidental to racing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount collected by the Racing Board from levies on course betting, including totalisator betting, <Col N="2" /> after operating expenses have been met, is applied by the board for the benefit of horse racing.  In 1977, the board contributed £1,575,000 towards stake money which represented 64 per cent of total prize money in that year.</P>
    <P>I have no plans for supplementing the Racing Board funds for the purpose of increasing stake prize moneys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Presumably the Minister appreciates the importance of racing to the economy.  Is he aware that there are at least 10,000 people employed in the industry?  Is he also aware that the cost of keeping a horse in training has increased dramatically to an average of £45 a week, that it is estimated that it takes the stakes of two races to defray the cost of keeping a horse in training for one year and that about 50 per cent of all horses in training never win a penny?  I believe&mdash;I ask the Minister <Col N="3" /> to comment on this&mdash;that the receipts from off-course betting are very substantial. Presumably the Minister has the figures and he can give them to us. Will he not consider making some of this money available to the Racing Board so that they can increase the stakes substantially?  I suggest that a sum of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy ask a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am asking a question.  I suggest to the Minister that a sum of £1,575,000 is a very small contribution to the stakes from the receipts from taxes on racing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I presume the Deputy appreciates that the figure I have mentioned simply represents the board's contribution towards the stake money but not the total contribution of the board towards various aspects of horse racing.  I am, of course, aware of the importance of the industry and I am also aware of the substantial increase in costs to which the Deputy has referred.  I presume the Deputy is also aware that the statistics in recent years in relation to betting, attendance at race meetings, the number of runners and so on, are on the upward trend. That would suggest, on the face of it, that whatever difficulties may be encountered are not such as to be operating unduly to the detriment of the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Would the Minister give the amount that the levy of 20 per cent brings in?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I suggest it is in the neighbourhood of £20 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to have been little over £8.9 million for 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the owner is the backbone <Col N="4" /> of the racing industry, that it is costing at least £3,500 to keep a horse in training and that if the owner goes out of business&mdash;many of them are finding it very hard to continue&mdash;the industry will face serious difficulties in the years ahead?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The bookies and other sections may be making money out of it.  Surely the Minister will have to admit that none of that money is going back to the owners?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Is the Minister aware that the report I have referred to and that he has seen states that the value of stakes has not increased since 1950? Does he not agree that it is a very unfair way of treating the owners, particularly the small ones?  We hear about the £50,000 stakes but it is the owner who is only getting £300 or £400 a race, when he wins it, who is the backbone of the industry.  I am sure if the Minister's colleague in the seat beside him were in his seat he would be more sympathetic.  Would the Minister make a substantial contribution from this £8 million to the Racing Board so that they can increase the stakes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the present tax system for the self-employed was introduced by the Revenue Commissioners because of problems associated with the backlog of work prior to the appointment of 250 inspectors, or for ease of collection; and if he will revise the system to increase revenue yield from the self-employed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I take it that the Deputies' questions arise from recent reports in the news media of changes in procedures in relation to the examination of accounts.</P>
      <P>Changes were made early last year by the Revenue Commissioners in the methods of examination of tax liabilities of self-employed people.  The aim of these changes was to eliminate unproductive correspondence, to allow more time to be devoted to the kinds of cases where evasion is likely to have occurred, to expose understatements of income and to deter evasion of tax.</P>
      <P>I feel satisfied that accurate assessments of tax liability can be expected under the system.  The new procedures are designed to improve efficiency and there is no question of their causing any loss of revenue to the Exchequer. The operation of the new system and the staff needed to administer it will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 13 and 14 together.  The Revenue Commissioners are alive to the dangers of footwear smuggling and I am satisfied that a high level of surveillance is being maintained to combat it.  It is not feasible from the information furnished to identify the particular case to which the Deputy refers.  I can state, however, that there have been some recent seizures of footwear by the customs and investigations in these cases are continuing.  Legal proceedings may ensure and in view of this it would be inappropriate for me at this stage to comment further.  I might add that as a general rule seized goods such as footwear which are subject to import restriction are not disposed of for sale on the home market.</P>

      <P>Accurate statistics are not available on the number of cot deaths occurring annually in the State.  This is because these deaths are not at present specifically identified in the World Health Organisation's classification of diseases which is the basis of our mortality statistics.</P>
      <P>However, the number of deaths to infants under one year for which no obvious cause of death was available was 65 in 1975 and 85 in 1976.  The corresponding figure for 1977 is not yet available.</P>

      <Col N="24" /> Some research has been carried out in other countries into the causes of sudden deaths of non-specific cause in infancy.  In Ireland the Department of Community Health in Trinity College Dublin has undertaken reasearch into the causes of such deaths.</P>

      <P>There was a development in this matter of which, perhaps, the Deputy may not be aware.  When we decided to proceed with the immediate construction of Beaumont Hospital it seemed to me that if the same team were on Beaumont and <Col N="28" /> Cavan, one or other project would not proceed as rapidly as it should, so at my request the team appointed for Cavan withdrew to concentrate on Beaumont and a new team was appointed for Cavan.</P>

      <P>The Mater Hospital will be developed as one of the six major general hospitals in the Dublin area.  The planning of the development of the hospital is being undertaken at the moment by a project team comprising representatives of the hospital and of my Department, and, pending detailed planning, it is not possible to say how the hospital will ultimately be developed.</P>
      <P>In order to provide for this development, the hospital authorities have acquired certain properties in the vicinity of the hospital.  Apart from a grant towards the purchase of 40 Eccles Street, no subvention was made from public funds towards the cost of these properties and the purchases were negotiated privately by the hospital authorities.  Accordingly, it would not be a matter for me to furnish the details requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I have under consideration recent applications from the hospital authorities for grants towards the cost of some further purchases but it would not be appropriate to furnish details of the properties involved at this stage of the negotiations.</P>

Secondly, is the school which is next to it, and which is currently the subject of some controversy, one of the properties that is likely to be acquired in the near future?  Is the Minister sympathetic to the hospital's application for that property also?

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised that in certain areas of testing and research, for example, haemolysis and mutagenesis, alternative tests have replaced tests on live animals to some limited extent.  In this regard I can assure the Deputies that in granting licences for experimentation upon live animals, regard is always had to the possibility of the work being done by alternative methods.</P>
      <P>So far as intensification of research in this country for alternative techniques is concerned, I am sure that the Deputies will appreciate that there are only limited resources available in this country to devote to medical research and that the work to be done must be determined by the priorities in our situation and also with regard to work which is being done elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The determination of the priorities in medical research within the resources allocated to them is a matter for the Medical Research Council.  I will draw the Deputies' request to me to the council's attention and ask them for their views as to the desirability and feasibility of intensifying such research here.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 to 55, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>With regard to Questions Nos. 51 and 52, I presume the Deputy is referring to the total number of children in care either in residential care or boarded out.  The number so involved is 2,586.  Of that number, 1,965 are in the care of health boards, and of those 945 are accommodated in residential care and 1,020 are boarded out.</P>
      <P>With regard to Questions Nos. 53 and 54 I should explain that my colleague, the Minister for Education, has responsibility for the categories of residential homes mentioned by the Deputy, apart from a small number of voluntary homes which are approved under the Health Acts as being suitable for the reception of children into residential care through the health boards.  The information being sought by the Deputy in regard to these homes was contained in a reply by the Minister for Education to a related question on 28 February 1978 (Official Report, Volume 304, No. 3, columns 387-390).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="42" /> I have no statutory responsibility for any of the residential homes and, accordingly, the question of the employment of inspectors by my Department to oversee the administration of the homes does not arise.  However, there are very close working relationships between the homes and the health boards, and the social work adviser on child care services attached to my Department maintains regular contact with both the health boards and the homes.</P>
    <P>The procedures for the boarding out of children by health boards are set out in the Boarding-Out of Children Regulations, 1954 (S.I. 101 of 1954). Apart from these regulations, guideline circulars are issued to health boards from time to time advising on various aspects of the child care services. In addition, the administration of those facilities is kept under constant review and discussions are now held regularly with representatives of the authorities of the homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the efforts of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to bring the telecommunications dispute to an end.</P>
      <P>Let me say first that the Government and I are fully conscious of the difficulties being experienced by the public as a result of the protracted disruption of the telephone and telex service and of the importance of bringing the industrial action to an end as soon as possible.  I need hardly say that those who are suffering hardship and loss as a result of either the non-availability of telecommunications services or unsatisfactory service are, quite rightly, not slow in bringing that fact to my notice or to the notice of other members of the Government.  There is nobody more conscious than the Government of how essential it is to have this dispute ended and nobody more anxious or concerned than the Government to see that it is brought to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But in our anxiety to have normal services restored the Government and I must continually bear in mind that the settlement has to be one which will ensure the continued use of orderly means for resolving claims and problems in the civil service and which will not contain the seeds of much greater disorder.  A settlement on any other basis would have the most serious consequences, and would clearly not be in the interests of the <Col N="62" /> public or, indeed, of the staff.  The Government are concerned to secure a settlement that is fair to all concerned and ask for no more than that. Proposals for a settlement on this basis have been made on a number of occasions; they have been accepted by me but have not unfortunately resulted in an ending of the industrial action.</P>
    <P>The most recent of the efforts to resolve this dispute followed the intervention of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions early last month.  Representatives of the executive council of the congress had discussions with representatives of the Irish Post Office Engineering Union and of the other unions representing the 21,000 staff in the Department.  Following this they had extensive discussions with the Minister for Labour and myself, and arising from all these consultations, the congress representatives formulated proposals for a return to work.</P>
    <P>The congress proposals provided for the lifting of all suspensions, the immediate re-employment of all staff laid off, the ending of industrial action and no victimisation of staff for participation in the industrial action.</P>
    <P>The proposals provided also for the immediate resumption of discussions on the union's reorganisation claim under the chairmanship of a mediator to be nominated by the chairman of the Labour Court.  They provided that staff should not be instructed to do work involving changes in work practices or procedures claimed to be significant and likely to have a bearing on a productivity agreement until such time as discussions had taken place under the mediator; and, where changes were identified in those discussions as significant, arrangements should be made to have them quantified and taken specifically into account in the settlement of the reorganisation claim.  I should explain that it has been claimed by the union from the outset of this dispute that what was primarily at issue was that the Department were eroding the basis of the reorganisation claim or productivity claim, as it is commonly known, by introducing changes that involved increased productivity and that if the <Col N="63" /> Department continued to do this there would be no scope for supporting their claim on a productivity basis.</P>
    <P>As will be evident from what I have said, the congress proposals tackled this on two fronts.  First, they provided for the introduction of a mediator nominated by the chairman of the Labour Court to preside over the discussions on the reorganisation claim.  The injection of an outsider with no brief for either side and who would have experience of negotiations of this kind and could be expected to see ways around difficulties should certainly prove helpful.  He could be relied on to ensure that consideration of the claim was pressed forward to an early conclusion.  Secondly, changes claimed to be significant which could reasonably be expected to have a bearing on the productivity claim would be identified and, where it was accepted in discussions under the mediator that they were signified, the resultant productivity savings would be evaluated and taken specifically into account in an agreement.  This disposed, therefore, of any grounds the staff might have had for fears in regard to their re-organisation claim and should have removed it as an area of dispute.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the election manifesto, the Government were committed to undertaking a review of staff rules and regulations in the Department with a view to promoting better labour relations.  I had set up a departmental group last October to undertake a fundamental reappraisal of staff rules and regulations.  In January last the staff organisations were invited at the departmental conciliation council to put forward their views on the changes they would wish to have made and their suggestions in regard to how staff-management relations in the Department could be improved. The congress representatives regarded it as important that an outsider should also be introduced to assist with this examination in the light of his experience of practice in industry and other organisations.  Their proposals provided, therefore, that the discussions that had taken place should continue to be carried out at the <Col N="64" /> departmental conciliation council but under a mediator nominated by the chairman of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Again, Deputies who followed the course of events in this dispute will be aware that there have been allegations that what were described as archaic rules and practices were responsible, in part at any rate, for the staff action in this instance.  The course of action now proposed under the congress proposals should ensure that this examination will proceed quickly and should enable any staff complaints in relation to these to be considered fully.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, congress proposed that, in relation to specific grievances, as distinct from claims for improvements in pay and conditions, a mediation committee consisting of an equal number of union and departmental representatives presided over by a mediator also nominated by the chairman of the Labour Court should be established as a further step in the existing grievance procedure.  This committee would deal not only with specific grievances that the union said were causing concern at present but would also deal with grievances and problems in the future. I ask the House to note that on three different occasions mediators were taken in from outside.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These comprehensive proposals were, as I have said, formulated by representatives of the executive council of congress only after detailed consultations with the Post Office Engineering Union and with other unions representing staff in the Department as well as with the Minister for Labour and myself.  The congress representatives recognised, quite rightly, as one would expect from men of their vast experience in the industrial <Col N="65" /> relations sphere, that a solution to the present dispute could not be found without taking into account the impact which proposals for a solution might have on other unions in the Post Office, all of whom are parties to the same agreed negotiation machinery as are indeed the civil service generally for most of the negotiation arrangements involved.  The congress representatives included the congress president, Mr. Mulhall; the vice-president, Mr. O'Sullivan; the immediate past president, Mr. Griffin; the general secretary, Mr. Roberts; the assistant general secretary, Mr. Nevin; the industrial relations officer, Mr. McGrath; the general president of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, Senator Kennedy; the general secretary of the Workers' Union of Ireland, Mr. Cardiff; the general secretary of the Post Office Workers' Union, Mr. Quinlan and the general secretary of the Civil Service Executive Union, Mr. Murphy.  All of these are men with long experience of industrial relations and occupying key positions in their own organisations. The fact that they were prepared to strongly recommend the proposals they had formulated for acceptance by an affiliated union is sufficient guarantee that the proposals fully safeguarded the interests of the members of the Irish Post Office Engineering Union and provided a means of resolving the dispute satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The proposals covered all the areas of alleged staff dissatisfaction and, indeed, dealt not just simply with resolving the present problems but also, provided an improved framework for settling industrial relations difficulties in the future.  Anyone who studies the proposals and the complaints of staff dissatisfaction could be in no doubt that the congress representatives had briefed themselves fully on the issues.  I should add that this was the second occasion on which the congress representatives intervened. They had given generously of their time to this dispute previously in November last and were, therefore, fully aware of all the difficulties and problems.  I accepted the congress proposals and I remain prepared to implement <Col N="66" /> them to the full, not only in the letter but in the spirit also.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the ICTU proposals were put to a ballot of their membership by the Irish Post Office Engineering Union.  The ballot resulted in a narrow majority against acceptance by the 4,500 of 6,500 members who voted.  I understand that the proposals were accepted by 31 of the 44 union branches but that all six Dublin branches and seven other branches voted against.  Naturally, I am most disturbed that the proposals formulated by the representatives of the executive council of the congress who gave many hours of their time in preparing and discussing them and of whose efforts I cannot speak too highly, should not have been accepted by the union members.  I cannot, of course, say why individuals voted against the proposals but there are certain factors which I believe must have contributed to this result.</P>
    <P>First, and this should in ordinary course have been a matter of surprise since the proposals were so strongly recommended by congress, the union executive made no recommendation to the union members regarding the proposals formulated by a body to which they are affiliated.  The reason for this can, I suggest, be found in the internal politics and divisions within the union executive to which I shall refer again. Despite the executive's decision not to make any recommendation, nevertheless certain members of the union executive campaigned strongly for a rejection of the proposals.  Indeed, one such executive member was reported in the news media subsequently as describing the proposals as being plausible on the surface but when examined in greater detail as being riddled with catch phrases and full of potential dangers for the union.  It is hard to believe that such criticism of the work of the prestigious men who formulated the proposals could have been made by a member of an affiliated union but he was so reported and such criticism if voiced during the balloting could not but have affected the outcome of the ballot.</P>
    <P>It was, of course, ludicrous to suggest that the members of the Executive Council of the congress who strongly <Col N="67" /> recommended these proposals to the union executive either did not understand what they were doing or attempted to so mislead a constituent of congress as to foist on them proposals that were full of potential dangers for the union.  Such criticism could only be partially excused if due to a total lack of understanding of the proposals.  For my part, the congress proposals represent a comprehensive and reasonable basis for ending the industrial action once and for all and they go further in so far as they provide not just simply for dealing with the current problems but future ones as well.  They are, I would stress, the independent proposals of congress, not my proposals.</P>
    <P>It might be helpful at this stage if I were to retrace briefly the course of events in this dispute.  The industrial trouble is, I should say, a problem I inherited from the previous Government but I am not making any political capital of this.  I am stating it as a historical fact.  The trouble began in May 1977, in my predecessor's time when some members of the union, against the instructions of their executive, refused to hand up departmental records in breach of their conditions of employment.  Following the union's annual conference and changes in the union executive, the staff action which was in breach of the agreed means of resolving problems was made official. Since then, industrial action has continued in an unbroken series of strikes and other acts of indiscipline which have involved groups of staff for different periods in many centres. Sometimes those actions were official and sometimes unofficial.</P>
    <P>The recent proposals by the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have not been the only attempt to bring this industrial action to an end.  In August, the Steering Committee of the Employer-Labour Conference made recommendations for a resumption of normal work which both the union, executive and I accepted.  However, the union did not honour their acceptance and the industrial action continued.  As Deputies probably know, the Steering Committee consists of representatives <Col N="68" /> of the Federated Union of Employers and other employer bodies and of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions under the chairmanship of Professor Basil Chubb.  In November, arrangements for a return to normal work were again formulated following intensive discussions which I had with representatives of the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. All aspects of the dispute were discussed in detail at that time with the result that the congress representatives already had a first-hand knowledge of the problems when they involved themselves in the dispute again last month.</P>
    <P>Briefly, these recommendations and arrangements for settlement of the dispute provided, like the recent congress proposals, that the Department would lift suspensions, that the union would cease industrial action, that the union would undertake that the staff would carry out instructions and that any claims, problems or proposals would be processed speedily through the agreed negotiating machinery.  I would like to stress here that both the Employer-Labour Conference and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions recognised the need for settled procedures for the processing of claims, problems and proposals, in an orderly way in a public utility, such as the telecommunications service.  I accepted the proposals in both instances and I honoured them.  The union executive also accepted them but did not honour them.  In accordance with the recommendations of the Steering Committee of the Employer-Labour Conference, I lifted suspensions and restored the suspended men to duty on the basis of the union executive undertaking that, as provided for in the recommendations, the staff would carry out instructions. When, however, the staff were asked to do the work which the union had undertaken they would do, they refused again, on the instructions of the union executive.</P>
    <P>Eventually, it was only after they had to be suspended again that most of them did the work, but some continued to refuse.  The staff response to the Irish Congress of Trade Union's proposals in November was even less <Col N="69" /> satisfactory.  Some staff did not seek a resumption of work at all, but almost all those who did refused again to carry out instructions despite the undertaking given on their behalf by the union executive that they would do so.  From this brief recital of facts Deputies will have some appreciation of the difficulties in bringing this industrial action to an end.</P>
    <P>Unofficial industrial action was still continuing last January in three centres &mdash;the Central Telephone Exchange, Distillery Road in Dublin and Letter-kenny, although in the case of staff at the Central Telephone Exchange the staff were on duty and drawing pay, but refusing to carry out instructions.</P>
    <P>The stated grounds for industrial action have shifted many times during the course of this whole dispute.  When one issue was settled another was started.  But the alleged issues on which the industrial action is being taken could not, on any rational basis, be the real reasons.</P>
    <P>When this trouble started in May last, the alleged cause of the staff grievance was the slowness of the Department in reaching a productivity agreement.  As I explained previously in the House, the Department have been more than willing to enter into a productivity agreement.  In negotiations at the conciliation council in 1976, under the conciliation and arbitration scheme informal agreement in principle was reached on many features of such an agreement; the Department had suggested that 1975 be taken as the base year for purposes of measuring productivity which would give the staff the benefit of any productivity improvements that might result from developments taking place between them and the time an agreement is entered into; the Department had also suggested a tentative introduction date for a productivity agreement.</P>
    <P>The Department are also on record as stating that there is ample scope for considerable benefits to the staff in such an agreement.  The telecommunications service is in a period of rapid growth and the Department are more than anxious to conclude an agreement under which opportunities <Col N="70" /> for increased efficiency could be availed of to the benefit of the service and of the public and under which the staff would stand to benefit substantially. In fact, one of the unfortunate results of this industrial action from the staff point of view is that, apart from other losses they could have all been earning more pay for the past year or so if the union had returned to the negotiating table and concluded a productivity agreement instead of having recourse to industrial action.</P>
    <P>I might add again that the recent congress proposals dealt not merely with the productivity issues but also with other individual issues that were raised by the union.</P>
    <P>On 3 January, the executive of the union wrote to assure me that all the industrial actions taking place at that time were unofficial, stating the staff concerned had not gone along with the executive's requests in these instances. Yet I learned later from their own union journal that the union executive were financing these unofficial actions. Incidentally, at the same time as the union executive were writing to me in this vein some members of the executive were reported in the newspapers as threatening to bring the Department, and might I stress that is the community, to their knees, and to reduce the telecommunications services to chaos, and that the basic objective was complete capitulation by the Department.</P>
    <P>At the end of January, what was described as a &ldquo;truce offer&rdquo; was made by the union.  Effectively what the union asked for was that the agreements which had been negotiated through the Employer-Labour Conference and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and all the agreed negotiating machinery which, as I said earlier, applies not only to the engineering staff but also to all the other staff in the Post Office and to the civil service as a whole, should be set aside and instead that the demands of groups engaged in unofficial indusstrial actions, which the executive themselves had stated were in defiance of their own instructions, should be acceded to.  That proposal could hardly have been intended to be taken <Col N="71" /> seriously and, in my reply, I invited the union executive instead to honour their previous undertakings, thus allowing suspensions to be lifted.  The union reaction to this was to notify that they proposed to call out on strike personnel in key areas with the declared objective of crippling the service.  These personnel were duly withdrawn with effects which I will describe later.  They were, I should point out, withdrawn from areas where at the time the Department had taken no action.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the reasons advanced in support of the industrial action could not be the real ones.  The real reasons are to be found in divisions within the union executive where some members have simply refused to accept the decisions of the executive, and have campaigned openly against them, as they did in walking out from an executive council meeting at which the Employer-Labour Conference recommendations were being considered and, more recently, in advocating rejection of the recent congress proposals. I dealt with the evidence for these divisions and with their effects on industrial peace in the Department in some detail in a previous debate in the House and I do not propose, therefore, to rake over this ground again.  It is not for me to ascribe motives for these divisions.  I do not know what the groups who sponsored the industrial action at those centres where it was taking place last January and who continued it in defiance of the union executive hoped to gain by the course they adopted.  Neither can I understand why the union executive subsequently joined in industrial action in support of dissident branches acting in defiance of the executive's own instructions or why they embarked on a course of action designed to cripple the service and to bring the Department&mdash;as I said before, that is the community&mdash;to their knees.</P>
    <P>It has been said in an attempt to explain the executive's stance in this matter that it is not unusual to find that the members of an executive are not in complete unanimity.  But I want to emphasise that what has been happening <Col N="72" /> within the union executive has not been normal.  I can readily accept that there would be a diversity of views within a union executive but it would be reasonable to expect that when a decision is reached by a majority it would be accepted and implemented by the executive as a whole.  The opposite has happened here; the majority decisions have not been accepted by the minority and the minority have campaigned to have the majority decisions set aside.  This has been at the root of the failure to have this dispute resolved earlier.  Indeed, the editor of the union's own journal, <i>The Relay</i>, found it necessary to comment on this matter when in an editorial in the November/December 1977 issue of the journal he stated as follows:</P>
    <P>Within our own union, during 1977, we have witnessed the results of terrible bitterness at national executive level.  For months past the friction has been obvious for all to see and unfortunately it has done nothing to enhance the reputation of the IPOEU or to improve its functioning.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I urged the union early in February to end the industrial action in accordance with the arrangements previously made with the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The response of the union was a decision to call out key men in the Central Telephone Exchange and in one of the telex exchanges.  Two technicians were withdrawn from the Central Telephone Exchange and 13 from the telex exchange in pursuit of the stated objective of crippling the telecommunications services.  The withdrawal of the men would not, of itself, have resulted in a crippling of the services, but in practice the telephone trunk service worsened rapidly over the following few days to a point where approximately half of the trunk circuits from Dublin were out of service.  This was in a situation where all but two of the maintenance technician staff were on duty in the Central Telephone Exchange.  The technicians concerned were reassigned to other duties on 11 February.  Some senior management staff moved in at the weekend, found that much equipment <Col N="73" /> had been disabled and began to restore it with a large measure of success.  On 13 February, some technicians staged a sit-in at the exchange and a court order had to be obtained to get them out. When the technicians left the building the telephone and telex trunk system serving Dublin nationally and internationally was found to have almost totally collapsed.  Management staff again moved in and have been restoring disabled equipment since then.</P>
    <P>There were instances of interference in all areas of the Central Telephone Exchange, over 40 instances in all. The interference took a number of forms.  Power and other essential supforms. Power and other essential supplies were disconnected by the removal of fuses and by the misoperation of control switches.  Controls were maladjusted so that equipment could not function.  Equipment of the plugin type was positioned in such a way that it could not function. Wires were broken off within the equipment.  There were several instances where hundreds of trunk circuits were out of service.  In switching/ signalling equipment, wiring was found to have been inserted between circuits so as to render them useless. Essential records were missing from the exchange.  Electro-mechanical devices were maladjusted and in some cases seriously damaged.  The overall effect of the interference was to make it virtually impossible to make STD calls in to or out of Dublin or for operators to dial calls through Dublin. More recently, when staff in the second telex exchange in Dublin went on strike, the exchange was found to have been put out of commission by the application of colourless nail varnish to electrical contacts thereby immobilising the exchange.</P>
    <P>Let me say that I am not recounting this matter with any sense of pleasure or with the slightest desire to score a point.  On the contrary I record it with very great regret and I am doing so simply to put the full facts before the House.  I want to make it clear that I do not believe that the great majority of the staff would regard this type of interference with other than abhorrence, but it would appear that a small group <Col N="74" /> would be prepared to go to desperate lengths to bring about disruption.</P>
    <P>The factor which I believe is responsible for this dispute continuing so long is that certain members of the union executive appear to be interested in something other than an honourable settlement of this dispute.  Opportunities for such a settlement were provided in the recommendations of the Steering Committee of the Employer-Labour Conference and in the arrangements formulated twice by the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions but were not availed of. The conclusion must be reached that those within the union who have been claiming that they would bring the Department to their knees and create chaos in the services and who insist that nothing less than total capitulation by the Department will satisfy them have succeeded in persuading many less well-informed than themselves to continue the campaign of industrial action.  It is important that there should be a full realisation and appreciation by the public generally of what is involved in this dispute and why it has dragged on so long and caused so much hardship.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that I was not making any political capital out of the fact that this dispute started before I assumed responsibility for the Department. This dispute is, in my view, far too serious to take advantage of it for political purposes.  However, I must record, with regret, that there are Deputies about whom I cannot say the same, whose untimely and unhelpful public comments have done nothing but delay the ending of this dispute.  I was particularly shocked by the unwarranted criticism by Deputy O'Leary, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, of the recent proposals by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which he described as not dealing with the real issues in the dispute.</P>
    <P>The Government and I have been called upon by businessmen, business associations, doctors and many others to bring this industrial action to an end at once.  I can well understand and sympathise with these calls.  Those who make them are no doubt frustrated and angered over this whole business but there is, I regret, no magic wand that <Col N="75" /> the Government or I can wave that will bring this action to an immediate end.  I explained this in some detail to representatives of the Associated Chambers of Commerce on Monday last and I cannot do better than quote from their own statement issued after the meeting.  They said:</P>
    <P>Having heard the Minister's view, the Association is satisfied that no stone is being left unturned by him and his officials both to effect an improvement in the service and to achieve a settlement.</P>
    <P>The only courses open for an ending of the dispute are a resumption of normal work on a reasonable basis acceptable to both sides, or a capitulation by one side or the other.  As I have outlined earlier, various recommendations and proposals have been made for the ending of this industrial action on a basis that was fair both to the staff and to the Department and also consistent with the Department's position as a supplier of public services to the community.  These did not, regrettably, bring about a return to normality for the reasons I have already given.</P>
    <P>As regards capitulation by one side or the other, I have not asked the union to capitulate and the recent proposals by the congress, which I accepted, certainly did not seek a capitulation by the union.  Is it being asked of the Department that they should capitulate and yield to the demands of a minority group within one of the Post Office unions?  If concessions of the kind they require were to be made, the users of Post Office services, and indeed users of services provided by the State generally, could expect to be deprived of those services every time an individual or group felt aggrieved, for whatever reason.  It is essential in a public service that there must be orderly means of resolving claims and problems.  The Steering Committee of the Employer-Labour Conference and the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions both recognised this, as indeed I think would any person who stops to consider it.  An orderly way of resolving <Col N="76" /> problems does not mean that the staff surrender their position in any way; it simply involves a recognition of their position as providing a public service and acting accordingly.  That is what the existing negotiation machinery agreed with all the unions in the Post Office and in the civil service generally provides, and the changes suggested in the recent congress proposals would have preserved that concept.  I believe the users of the telecommunications services are conscious of the serious implications of abandoning the orderly means of resolving problems and of making concessions to unwarranted industrial action and would not wish me to do this, badly hit though they are by the present strike.</P>
    <P>Some Opposition Deputies and others were critical of the fact that I did not agree to meet the union recently when they asked me to do so, and seem to suggest that such a meeting was the panacea for all ills.  There is, of course, no basis for such an assumption.  On the contrary, to negotiate with the union in present circumstances in breach of the agreed negotiations machinery would be open encouragement to every disgruntled individual or group to take the law into their own hands and to disrupt public services, and would result in an intolerable situation for civil service unions generally.</P>
    <P>The fact is that to negotiate with the union while they are engaged in industrial action would be in breach of the agreed scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the civil service, to which they and all other unions in the civil service are a party.  If I were to condone a breach in this instance, then of course, the scheme would have been broken by both sides and the implications of that would be far-reaching.</P>
    <P>The industrial action is also a breach of the arrangements which have been agreed by all sides for processing grievances in the Department, and if these arrangements are to be set aside for one organisation and negotiations are to take place outside them, the way is being opened for similar action by every individual or group in the Department, with consequences that I spelled out earlier. <Col N="77" /> Those outside the union calling for such a meeting, and I want to stress this, have failed to realise or have chosen to ignore what the Steering Committee of the Employer-Labour Conference and the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions recognised, and that is, that is an organisation providing public services, as the Post Office does, it is essential to have an orderly means for resolving claims and problems and that such means cannot be set aside at the whim of one group.  I have indicated already that the Government and I are committed to maintaining orderly means of negotiation in the interests of the public, the civil service unions and of the staff themselves.</P>
    <P>It is also the position, as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions recognised, that any one organisation in the Post Office cannot be treated differently from the others, and congress formulated its proposals for a return to work only following consultations with all the staff organisations in the Post Office.  I want to stress again that the congress formulated their proposals following discussions not only with the union involved and with the Minister for Labour and myself, but following discussions with all the staff organisations in the Post Office.  It was for these reasons when the union executive asked me last week to meet them to discuss settlement proposals that I offered to meet the congress representatives for clarification discussions.  I trust that in the light of what I have said, it will be accepted that I acted reasonably and responsibly and in the only helpful way open to me.  I might add that immediately there is a return to work I will be glad to meet the union executive.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, before criticising me for not meeting the union recently, Opposition Deputies would have found if they had checked, that when they themselves were in office and when the Irish Post Office Engineering Union took official strike action, the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs did not meet the union representatives and I object to Opposition Deputies now attempting to force me to adopt a stance they did not take when in office themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> The Government's interest and my interest in this whole matter lie in the earliest restoration of services that is compatiable&mdash;and this is the key point&mdash; with maintenance of agreed, orderly negotiating procedures in the Post Office and in the civil service generally. I want to repeat that it is my firmly held view and that of the Government that it would not be in the interests of anyone, either the Department's customers or the staff, if the Department adopted a policy of seeking the restoration of services without any concern for the terms of settlement of the dispute.</P>
    <P>Such an outcome would mean that any group having the power to inconvenience a significant section of the public could hope to coerce that section into supporting any of their demands, however unreasonable.  That would have the most adverse and far reaching consequences for the public service as a whole, not just the Post Office, in terms of continuity of services, costs and efficiency.  In stating that agreed, orderly negotiating procedures must be maintained I want to underline the fact that neither the Government nor I am opposed to changing the existing procedures but such changes must come by way of agreement with all the staff unions concerned and not from the disruptive action by a minority within one union.</P>
    <P>Some members of the Opposition have, as I said earlier, been vocal in calling on me to settle this dispute.  I want to put it to them now to say if they are advocating that I should make concessions to industrial action designed to disrupt the agreed, orderly ways of settling problems.  If they are, I would like them to say what they believe the consequences of such a course would be.  Do they want Post Office services to be disrupted whenever any group of staff have a grievance, real or imaginary?  That would be the consequence of what they appear to be pressing.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the Government and I are most anxious to see this dispute settled immediately on an equitable basis.  The recent proposals by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions provide such a basis, and I would hope that the union executive will reconsider <Col N="79" /> their position.  If the union executive require any clarification or any reassurance, they should seek them from the congress and I told the union executive in a letter on 31 March that if the executive council of congress required any clarification discussions with me I would be available to them at short notice.  I sincerely hope that the union executive will do this and that there will be an early resumption of work by the staff generally.  I have made it clear on several occasions and now repeat it that when normal work is resumed I can be relied on to play my part in finding solutions to whatever problems the staff may have.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that in the light of the position as set out by me the House will agree that everything possible has been done by me to bring this industrial action to an end and I therefore ask the House to support the motion that I have moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;regrets the inactivity of the Government in seeking a settlement in the telecommunications dispute, deplores their provocative attitudes and demands urgent action to bring about an early settlement.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the Minister's long speech&mdash;almost 45 minutes&mdash;and looking at the state of utter chaos to which the business, financial and social life of this country has been reduced by the prolonged telecommunications dispute, I must confess that I am absolutely appalled, as I am sure the country will be appalled, at the tone and content of the Minister's speech.  This long speech did not contain a single new idea or new initiative or one conciliatory gesture which might help to bring about a speedy resumption of normal working conditions in the Minister's Department.  From start to finish the tone of the Minister's speech was one of righteous indignation and the Minister was on the defensive.  He told us about all the efforts that have been made and the chronology of the <Col N="80" /> events which have taken place last May.  The Minister still refuses, despite repeated requests from Deputies on this side of the House and from many spokesmen from various sectors, to make the one gesture that is now demanded, that is, to open his door and bring in representatives of the IPOEU. I do not agree with the Minister's suggestion that this would not produce a magic formula.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in a very special position of responsibility.  In the case of industrial disputes in semi-State bodies or in the private sector in which the intervention of the Department of Labour or the Minister might be called for, a refusal to intervene might be defended.  The Minister in this case is the employer and I know of no circumstances in the private or semi-State sector where an employer would refuse such a request.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech is typical and very revealing of his attitude and approach to this issue since he assumed office.  In addition, the Minister's speech and the attitude which he has adopted for several months now is typical of the industrial relations policy of the Fianna Fáil Government since they assumed office. Not very long ago in this House, prior to the Christmas recess, we had a special debate on the catastrophic result of that policy when 1,400 workers in my constituency lost their jobs in the Ferenka factory because of the failure of the Government in the field of industrial relations.  I am appalled at the Minister's speech.  What we are interested in is what the Minister proposes to do and what action he proposes to take.  We want action, not a history of events in an attempt by the Minister to justify his own inactivity. The Minister carries the major part of the responsibility for the developments leading to the present situation; he is the employer.  His approach to this dispute during recent months has been characterised by two things, inactivity and provocativeness. I am convinced that the Minister has contributed to an escalation of the situation by his inactivity and by the provocative manner in which officials of his Department have been involving themselves in this dispute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> Not merely the members of this party but most people must condemn certain industrial relations practices initiated or at least condoned by the Minister in relation to this situation. The Minister and his Department stand guilty of practices in the field of industrial relations which are reminiscent of 1913.  The Minister's Department ordered officials of that Department to leave an area in which they were working and to report for duty in other centres when the Minister and the Department knew that at those centres there was an official union picket.  This action by the Minister was subsequently the subject of a High Court action and I quote from the report of the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 22 February 1978:</P>
    <P>The direction given to 50 Post Office technicians to report for duty to the Mill St. (Dublin) depot of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was the result of a carefully thought-out plan by the Minister (Mr. Faulkner) and his advisers, Mr. Justice Kenny declared in the High Court yesterday.</P>
    <P>He said he had no doubt of this and that the Minister and his advisers knew that the men would not pass the picket at Mill St. &ldquo;I am convinced that by doing this they were seeking to provide themselves with a reason for suspending the plaintiffs&rdquo;, the Judge said.</P>
    <P>Anybody with even the most basic elementary knowledge or appreciation of industrial relations must condemn this action by the Minister and his Department in suspending these men, having first of all directed them to report for duty in a place where there was an official picket and then suspending them for not having done so.  I believe this action by the Minister has contributed more than anything else to the escalation of this dispute, to the worsening of the situation and to the continuing of the deadlock.</P>
    <P>On the question of the suspensions, I should like to quote from another source, <i>The Irish Press</i> of 11 February 1978, which contained a statement from the representatives of two management unions in the Post Office calling for an urgent independent investigation of <Col N="82" /> industrial relations in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The statement is:</P>
    <P>The suspensions of many technicians over the past few days does nothing but add fuel to the industrial fire.  The actions of the Department are not in any way likely to bring about a much needed atmosphere of reality into the industrial relations arena.  Such an intransigent attitude makes it increasingly more difficult for negotiations to commence, and indeed is only making a bad situation worse.  Only by using ordinary common sense can the matter be remedied.</P>
    <P>I have been informed, and I chalenge the Minister to say whether it is true, that during the past weekend engineers in the Department have been directed under the threat of instant dismissal to do work normally done by technicians.  I want the Minister to confirm or deny this, a matter on which I have been reliably informed.  If this is so it indicates that the Minister is determined to continue with his stonewalling attitude, that he is not prepared to take extra initiative to open the door.</P>
    <P>I and many people throughout the country have grave doubts that the Government understand the serious implications of the consequences of this prolonged dispute throughout the whole of Irish life.  I have here statements by many people in different businesses, spokesmen for national organisations, which it would take me hours to quote, and I have no intention of doing so. There are several aspects of this dispute that have been giving cause for grave concern.  The Government were elected because of their major priority to generate new industrial development and to promote employment.  Is the Minister aware that this prolonged dispute is making the job of the IDA almost impossible?  I have put the IDA first because they are of paramount importance in the field of job creation, and I will quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 11 February 1978.  Under the heading &ldquo;Overseas Investment is Halting&rdquo;, there is the following report:</P>
    <P>Overseas investment is grinding to a halt because of a telecommunications <Col N="83" /> blackout to the outside world. The operations of Irish semi-State bodies, science, and industry based in the United Kingdom, are also being seriously disrupted.  The damage to our attempts to attract industry is immeasurable, a spokesman for the Industrial Development Authority said in Birmingham on 10 February.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Industrialists,&rdquo; said the spokesman, &ldquo;tell us that telex communications are one of the most important aspects of their business.  The image the blackout is giving of Ireland is very grave&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is from the IDA in February. How much worse must the situation be now?  The London office of Córas Tráchtála has not been able to send telex or telephone messages.  Substantial contracts have been lost because potential customers have been unable to obtain immediate quotations from Irish firms.  The IDA spokesman quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> article, continued:</P>
    <P>Overseas offices of Córas Tráchtála have been sending urgent messages to their London office in an attempt to communicate with Dublin.</P>
    <P>The same situation obtains in the Irish embassies abroad.  I could go on to quote at length in relation to this.  If the Minister would not mind ceasing his conversation with his colleague, I want to draw his attention to another aspect of this dispute which should be causing him grave concern.  In addition to being Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, he is also responsible for tourism and transport.  In the past ten days he received a submission from the National Tourism Council indicating the almos impossible circumstances and conditions in which the tourism and travel industries are compelled to work.  I know of tour operators and travel agents in various parts of the country who have staff in residence in Dublin hotels during the past five or six weeks to enable messages to be sent up and down by road daily. I know of firms&mdash;I am sure the two Ministers sitting on the other side must be aware of them&mdash;who have set up temporary communication centres in London and elsewhere.  As late as <Col N="84" /> today we find another alarming consequence of this dispute which might be described as a life and death situation. A major Dublin hospital which has been crippled during the past month by this dispute is facing a mass walk out of the workers tomorrow.</P>
    <P>From the quotations I have given from a selection of statements made in recent months, we can see that industry, tourism, exports, hospital services and ordinary telephone subscribers have been the victims of this ridiculous situation which should not have been allowed to happen.  It is utterly chaotic and indefensible.  From inquiries I have made in the past few days I understand that there are 10,000 telephones now out of order.  Even when the dispute has been settled there will be an enormous backlog to be caught up with in getting those telephones back into service.  I assume that the same applies to telex and computer data equipment.</P>
    <P>I emphasise these aspects of the dispute because they are the ones with which I am most concerned.  As I said at the outset, I am utterly appalled at the apparent lack of concern shown by the Minister who, in his lengthy speech, dealt with part of the history of the industrial relations in the Department. Since this dispute started many suggestions have been put forward as to how a resumption of work might be brought about in the shortterm. Many other suggestions have been made in regard to the long-term industrial relations situation in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The Minister has been critical of Opposition Deputies who have spoken recently on this dispute.  Every time the spokesman for this party has gone before the public, we have endeavoured to be practical and constructive as well as criticising the Minister for his lack of activity.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the Minister were now to make the obvious gesture of inviting the IPOEU to meet him this would, as has been suggested by a number of my colleagues, including Deputy Michael O'Leary, pave the way for the laying down of guidelines for a formula for an immediate resumption of work.  In relation to the <Col N="85" /> long-term situation, there have been a number of calls for a public inquiry into the situation.  It has also been suggested that an independent commission be established to examine, analyse and assess the causes of the present industrial relations problems in the Minister's Department and that this commission would formulate recommendations in relation to future strategy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not given any real indication that he has considered any of these suggestions.  He has been at pains to explain why he himself could not meet the IPOEU.  We say that he should meet them and that he should have taken this initiative long ago.  I appeal to him at this late hour to take this first step, to make this initial gesture, towards solving the problem.  I am convinced from the various discussions I have had on the question of industrial relations in the Department that the time has come for an independent commission of inquiry.  Call it a public inquiry, call it a sworn inquiry, call it whatever you like, but it is obvious that the time has come for an independent commission of inquiry, a suggestion which was put forward from this side of the House on several occasions recently.</P>
    <P>Let us face facts.  It is obvious that there is something radically wrong with the industrial relations situation in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Therefore, the Minister must meet the union.  Secondly, I suggest an independent commission of inquiry, which was hinted at in the election manifesto and to which the Minister referred on a previous occasion when he undertook to review the situation. The time for reviewing is now past and action must be taken.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to respond now by taking those two obvious steps. First, he should meet the union, be man enough to do it and get the parties involved around the table.  Cut out the nonsense, forget about the red tape and the regulations and get these men around the table.  I have no doubt whatsoever that with goodwill and common sense a formula can be found for the immediate resumption of work. Second, I believe that the guidelines and the <i>modus operandi</i> for tackling <Col N="86" /> the question of industrial relations in the Department can also be settled.</P>
    <P>The consequences of this dispute are frightening.  I am sure the Deputies on the opposite side are as aware as we are of the hardship, inconvenience, loss of business and loss of jobs which has resulted from this dispute.  I know of one foreign industry with whom the IDA had been negotiating who have terminated the negotiations.  I am led to believe that this has happened because of the present telecommunications dispute.  At the best of times this small country has a vital dependence upon an efficient telecommunications system.  The Minister is aware of this from his experience in the Department of the Gaeltacht in trying to promote industry in remote areas and so on. Exports are our life blood.  Our ability to attract investment, to generate new exports, which is essential for the creation of new jobs, depends on the availability of an efficient, modern and reliable telecommunications system.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, this dispute has implications above and beyond the making of telephone calls. In recent years industry and tourism have become more and more dependent on sophisticated communications equipment, data processing and the development of computers.  Some time ago I was in Galway at the headquarters of Gaeltarra Éireann where there is a modern computer complex which provides services for many industries and which has been completely disrupted. Worst of all, Gaeltarra Éireann headquarters could not communicate with their subsidiary in Donegal.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the approach adopted today by the Minister. The Minister will have to change his tune very quickly if our economic life is not to grind to a halt.  Mar focal scoir, ba mhaith liom a iarraidh arís ar an Aire an doras a oscailt agus ba chóir dó suí timpeall boird in a oifig féin le ionadaí on gceard chumann agus na fadhbanna a phlé. Táim cinnte má dhéanann an tAire é sin go mbeidh toradh fónta agus go mbeidh gach aoinne ag obair arís le cúnamh Dé.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have endeavoured, in anything I have had to say on this very serious dispute to date, to speak with a sense of responsibility. I believe all Deputies in the House, whatever their party, understand the havoc which is being caused as a result of this particularly serious dispute, especially in industry and tourism as well as in the health sector.</P>
      <P>When I had responsibility for some of those matters I often found myself in the position of the Minister, explaining where I felt rightness lay in a particular dispute.  I do not think I often found myself explaining my position, as I saw it then, with so little to point to by way of concrete action taken by me as is the position of the Minister in the dispute in question.  I hope this debate is not simply a public relations ploy by the Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>There has been a remarkable change in the attitude of the Government to debate this question.  The Opposition were given to understand some weeks ago that the Government did not think anything helpful would be served by having a discussion in the House.  I welcome the chance to discuss this dispute this afternoon in the hope that it may spur the Minister to act.  It is not that anything that we may say here will produce an instant solution to this difficult question but there is the hope that the Minister may, as a result of our discussion, change his mind on what I consider still to be the vital question of meeting the union concerned, meeting the executive of the people who are on strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed at the statement made by the Minister this afternoon. It gives no evidence of any fresh thinking of how this dispute is to be settled. Almost three-fourths of his speech was devoted to propagating once more the proposals that were so recently rejected. I am glad he was able to distribute his speech to members of the Press.  That is a very good practice as the Press must know what the executive think on any issue.  I thank the Minister for his courtesy in making copies of his speech available to members of the Opposition when we requested them.  Members of the Press and members of the Opposition will <Col N="88" /> search in vain for any hint in that speech of what the Minister proposes to do to settle this dispute.  Many pages were used to explain how much he favours the recently rejected proposals. Surely he realises that those proposals, even if narrowly rejected, have in fact been rejected?  Where do we go from here?  What is the point in regaling the House on the virtue of proposals so recently rejected?  What does the Minister propose to do now?</P>
    <P>The whole point of this debate is that when it comes to the Minister's turn to answer the debate, having heard once more from Opposition Deputies that this industry is threatened, that export orders are threatened, that there is trouble in a particular hospital and that members of the public have approached Opposition Deputies on this dispute, he will be able to enlighten the House and the country on what he proposes to do now.  When one is searching for a solution to a particularly difficult problem one must constantly reassess the situation, consider why that proposal was rejected and see if there is another road which may be tried.  I am not underestimating the difficulties of this problem but the Minister must give very serious consideration to the possible benefits that might arise from meeting the executive of the union concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to be taking refuge in a kind of righteousness while the telecommunication system is crackling to a halt.  The country needs more from the Minister than a recitation of past events.  We had in the Minister's long statement almost verbatim lifts from previous speeches of his on the same topic.  I am sure that if we had time to look over the speech we would find whole chunks of the speech distributed to the Press are mere repetitions regarding a dispute which is several weeks old now.  We can only be depressed that the Minister appears to be showing no evidence of fresh thinking on this dispute.  He simply treated the House to a rehash of previous statements which were wrung from him by members of the Opposition in the House.  Does the Minister not appreciate, however right he may feel he is, that in his present position the country is not interested in elegant <Col N="89" /> statements but is more interested in hearing what is his programme for settling this dispute?</P>
    <P>I do not know why we have got this debate this afternoon.  We have put down Private Notice Questions but up to now the Government have felt that the less said about this dispute in Parliament the more speedy a solution would be found to it.  I do not know if the newspaper editorials on this dispute in the last few days have had anything to do with getting us this debate today.  The Minister for Finance in a discussion last Sunday about this dispute appeared to think that newspapers should not criticise the Government when it came to their handling of this dispute.  The Minister for Finance, on the evidence of his few words last Sunday, appears to be a first testy casualty to the sin of arrogance by the member of a Government still only a few months old.</P>
    <P>I have not lost the hope that the Minister in his reply will indicate what steps he proposes to take.  I believe that this debate, from the Government's point of view, will be more than a public relations ploy.  I hope the debate can encourage the Minister to take some initiative.  I believe he has a role to play in the settlement of this dispute.  I am not one of those who think that ministerial interventions in industrial relations disputes are good to be used occasion after occasion. When I occupied one of those benches opposite I said that a Minister should only intervene in a protracted dispute and only in one which the public interest was seriously jeopardised and only in one where existing procedures had failed to bring about a solution.</P>
    <P>Does this dispute answer those criteria?  Is the public interest damaged as a result of this dispute?  Have existing procedures brought about the necessary solution?  Is there any possibility of any solution in the near future?  I believe this dispute meets the very careful criteria for intervention which I set down when I occupied one of the benches opposite and which any other man opposite who looks at these problems must abide by.  There are criteria which should guide a Minister in intervening in a <Col N="90" /> dispute; the question of very serious judgment to be exercised.  Let us admit that even when a Minister intervenes where existing procedures have failed, where the public interest is threatened and where there is little likelihood of a settlement there is a risk of failure.  Indeed, when I was Minister I had some failures even though I worked hard to get a solution. The country cannot forgive ministerial inaction and cannot forgive the Minister for coming in here, in a dispute which threatens the livelihood of those in industry, and rehashing speeches that are weeks old without giving any indication of what steps he will take to reach a solution.  That is not good enough.  I hope the Minister and his officials will consider what they are to do in the wake of this debate.  There is no point in rehashing the virtues of proposals that have been rejected.  I congratulate the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who worked so hard in bringing forward those proposals. The Minister in his speech appears to be attempting to cast the congress in the role of intregral industrial relations unit for his Department and the Department of Labour.  That is not the role of congress.  The congress acted in the guise of honest broker, attempting to get proposals through which would gain the approval of the unions and the Department.  The congress is the only body which attempted to get settlement of this dispute.</P>
    <P>The Minister not for political advantage or profit but just for the purposes of the Official Report felt that he must point out that this dispute goes back to the wicked days of the Coalition, that this problem comes from the locker of bones left by the Coalition and has nothing to do with this pristine Government of 84 Deputies.  The Taoiseach also gently pointed that out.  The Taoiseach, like the present Minister, is not in the game of politics.  How many industrial relations problems are there which began last week?  At the very heart of this dispute is a question of productivity. Many of the productivity problems began years ago.  Productivity bargaining here started around 1968.  I can think of one productivity dispute in the <Col N="91" /> public transport company that goes back to 1961, but where does this argument about the origin of disputes get us?  It does not get the Minister off the hook in terms of the necessity for him to act.  The Minister cannot escape his obligation to intervene at this point. The Minister would not endanger existing procedures by intervening.  There is a public requirement that the Minister should intervene.  The House would have less criticism to offer if the Minister could come in here today and point to his intervening efforts in a dispute which has been going on as long as this.  After all the Minister is a member of a Cabinet which is publicly committed to a big drive on job creation.  How many jobs have we lost as a result of this dispute?  Public money is being spent on the public service to provide more jobs and the taxpayers are asked to foot the bill, yet day by day, for all we know, jobs are being lost as this dispute continues on its merry, unimpeded way.  Surely there is a contradiction here.  The Minister believes that all existing procedures would fall to the ground if he met this union, but existing procedures have brought forth no solution so far.  Who would object if the Minister met the union concerned to see whether any return-to-work formula could be arranged?  It is not as if one went to these meetings with a preconceived solution.  Solutions to such difficult problems are arrived at through teasing out the problems and in personal confrontation with the disputants concerned to know where they see their way back to a work situation. No one can say that this union is not anxious to get its members back to work as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech criticised statements I made as being unhelpful.  I have attempted to be responsible in the many comments I made on this dispute. The Minister attempts to cast me in the role of critic of the congress proposals. I hope I have made it clear that one must be grateful that at least one body attempted to get a settlement.  The congress proposals were not successful and with hindsight, and anyone in the congress or the trade union world will admit, the basic reason for the rejection <Col N="92" /> of the proposals was the suspensions by the Department.  It is not a coincidence that the largest body of voters against the recent proposals came from the areas where most suspensions occurred.  It follows that we must find a solution to the problems associated with suspensions if we are to get a return to work formula.  It also follows that some resolution must be found to the conflict between the disciplinary policy of the Department and the Minister's role of seeking a solution to the dispute.  Whilst the Minister has been standing back from the dispute saying that it is not his business to intervene, his Department have not been standing back but have been suspending people. Unless our settlement faces up to all the problems posed by the suspensions it is clear that 700 people are labouring under a deeply felt grievance that they have been unjustly treated over the past seven or eight weeks by being directed to go to work and to pass their own pickets.  Mr. Justice Kenny in the High Court stated that he had no doubt that the direction given to the plaintiffs to report for duty to the depot at Mill-street&mdash;the plaintiffs being the union members&mdash;was the result of a carefully thought-out plan by the Minister and his advisers all of whom knew that the plaintiffs would not pass the picket at Millstreet, and that he was convinced that the Minister and his advisers by doing this were seeking to provide themselves with a reason for suspending the plaintiffs.  The judge also said he thought that the direction to work at Millstreet was given when the Minister and his advisers knew that the plaintiffs would not, indeed could not, obey it. The Department are working with their disciplinary procedures and the Minister is standing back from the dispute saying that he is powerless to act and is waiting for the congress to come forward with proposals.  The congress came forward with proposals which were rejected, and looking back it would appear that the main reason for the rejection was the grievance felt by many people who were suspended in the course of this dispute.</P>
    <P>In an effort to be helpful to the Minister in his job I question also whether he is wisely advised to continue the policy evident since the start <Col N="93" /> of this dispute.  This is what is so depressing about the Minister's contribution today.  It shows no evidence whatsoever of any fresh thinking on his part from the first statements he made in this dispute.  He has neither changed his advisers nor rethought the whole position.  He continues with the same black and white version with which he started out.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the union is divided.  How does the Minister think that his role as a person who can bring about a settlement will be helped by these public attacks on the union? How many industrial relations situations have occurred here in which everyone knew there were divisions of all kinds both on the side of the management and union?  Settlement of such disputes is not helped by the Minister saying there is division in the union, that it is the union's fault.  Where does that get us?  It gets us interest in newspaper copy; it gets us lots of strong condemnation of the union's position. Presumably the Minister's paramount interest in all of this is to get a settlement. We, the public, exporters, industry and everybody else affected are not interested&mdash;indeed trade unionists in other jobs whose jobs are threatened are not interested&mdash;in who is right or wrong in this matter.  It is a settlement we are after.  A settlement is not helped by public sniping of this kind and, least of all, from the Minister.  I never indulged in it.  I often had a personal opinion about who in a particular instance was wrong, but it did not help me to come out and state that, because my primary role was to get a settlement. That is and remains the Minister's primary role.  The Minister is not there to be a recorder of right or wrong.  He is there to get a settlement.</P>
    <P>I believe that in regard to any settlement or return to work formula&mdash; without getting down to the major job still remaining to be done, that of general agreement on a productivity deal for the entire Department and the Minister is right in saying that eventually this will involve other unions&mdash;the Minister or somebody acting on his behalf must look at the question of the suspensions, facing up <Col N="94" /> to the issues raised by them, to the sense of grievance felt by so many people who have been suspended&mdash; wrongly, as they see it, directed, as they were, to pass pickets of their own unions.  I have already quoted what a judge of the High Court&mdash;one might say, not a biased observer&mdash;had to say on that policy.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister to meet the executive of that union in an effort to get a return to work formula.  I do not see how this will endanger existing procedures.  I might ask him another question in relation to his work in seeking a settlement of this dispute.  We have heard from his own lips what congress have done to try to settle this dispute.  Most people looking at what congress have attempted to do up to now can have nothing but praise for their role.  They have been very actively seeking a solution, have met the union, the Department and so on.  One must ask when did the Minister last meet the Industrial Relations Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Has he met them since the proposals were rejected? Has the Minister sought any meeting with the union side since the rejection of the recent proposals?  Has the Minister examined why those proposals were rejected?  I have not at my disposal any information on any survey in the matter.  I can rely merely on my own instinct in this respect when I think that the suspensions were basically the main reason for the rejection of the recent proposals, that the proposals did not appear to constitute any settlement of the grievances to those who had been suspended.  That, as I see it intuitively, was one of the major reasons for rejection on the last occasion.  I may be wrong in that, but the Minister is the person who should be in touch with the entire situation. Presumably he has at his disposal sources of information directing him in that regard.</P>
    <P>I might put another question to the Minister.  At this moment in time does he know what constitutes the union's minimum conditions for a return to work?  Is he in possession of that information? Can he inform the House? The Minister says he is ready to meet <Col N="95" /> congress for clarification.  If the proposals have been rejected what exactly does the Minister mean by clarification of those rejected proposals?  I should like to hear the Minister on what point there is in this meeting with congress limited to the purpose, as he has said already, of simple clarification of proposals. After all, the proposals are a matter of history now; they have been rejected.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not native in thinking that this debate is not purely a public relations exercise on the part of the Minister, one in which he merely invites the Opposition to offer their solutions, because that was the rather truculent approach of the Minister for Finance last Sunday: if one did not have an instant solution to this dispute one should keep one's mouth shut. Indeed up to quite recently it was the attitude of the Government that one should not even discuss it in Parliament because that was unhelpful.  But, for Members of the Opposition&mdash;and I have some experience of how settlement of matters such as those now facing the Minister can be reached&mdash; it is difficult without having at one's disposal all relevant information, reports of the most up-to-date meetings, dispositions of the parties on both sides, their attitudes, their bargaining positions, what they might settle for, all of these questions necessary for reaching a settlement.</P>
    <P>Obviously informatíon of the kind in departmental hands is not at the disposal of Opposition Deputies.  But I will say this to the Minister&mdash;just so that we may gag him should he conclude this debate simply by resorting to the kind of abuse that the Opposition did not come up with any solution to this dispute&mdash;I have indicated already what I think was the basic reason the last proposals were rejected and where the search for new proposals should be concentrated, namely, on the question of suspensions. Further than that it is difficult for me to go without acquaintance with the files in the Minister's possession.  I will say further to the Minister: if he will give me access to all the facts in the possession of his Department, together <Col N="96" /> with the assistance of officials of his Department, I will intervene.  I will be ready to offer myself as mediator in this dispute, subject to all the risks that offer has for me.  I have some experience of intervention in these areas. There is absolutely no guarantee I will be successful but, if the Minister will not intervene, I will intervene on those conditions.</P>
    <P>I have listened to Opposition spokesmen when I was over there make outlandish statements in relation to industrial disputes.  I am not speaking about backbenchers' contributions.  I think of a contribution last year in regard to a dispute in Irish Steel when the present Minister for Labour and a Member of the then Opposition party, now in the European Parliament, Deputy Brosnan, behaved disgracefully in this House on an Adjournment Debate in regard to a very difficult industrial dispute, one which was not going untended, one which was being given constant attention by the Labour Court and in relation to which there were many meetings held.  Yet that Members treated me and other members of the Government of that period to the most wild abuse and did not care very much about the accuracy of what he said.  However, I do not wish to go down that road now because I know how serious is this dispute.</P>
    <P>I am willing, if the Minister gives me all the information in his possession, together with the assistance of officials of his Department, to intervene personally.  It is a poor substitute for intervention by the Minister himself.  After all he has been given the democratic mandate to deal with this matter, but that is a challenge I throw down to him.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is wrongly advised on the nature of congress itself if he thinks there can be further profitable intervention by congress in this dispute because the relationship between congress and the affiliated unions is such that when union members are on strike congress exists chiefly to assist the members of that union.  Congress is assisting this union.  Congress considers the dispute to have a legitimate basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister has offered to meet congress simply for clarification <Col N="97" /> purposes in regard to recent proposals which have been rejected.  Since they have been rejected with the best will in the world I cannot see what role is now left for congress.  The Labour Court cannot intervene in civil service matters of this kind without a specific request by the Minister for Labour under section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act.  Will the Minister for Labour ask the court to intervene?  So far there has been no evidence to show that he will.  This dispute is adversely affecting industry throughout the whole country.  It is now statemate. The Minister maintains he is right and all the evil belongs on the union side. To what can the country look forward? Will the Minister have some proposal to make when he winds up the debate?  If the Executive says confidence must be voted in Deputy Faulkner, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in his handling of this dispute, that is it.</P>
    <P>What lies behind the Government's total inactivity in this dispute?  Are they anxious to turn the public and the media against one trade union in the hope that a similar attitude will grow towards all trade unions?  There must be some explanation for the Minister's inactivity.  Is he listening to some advice in his Department about the possibility of hiving off the more profitable sections of the phone section of his Department to some private company like Ericsons?  Is he trying to prove it is impossible to run the Department and that it should be split up?  Is he trying to demonstrate that so unreasonable have the unions become nothing else will solve the present problem?  One has to look for wayout suggestions to explain the inactivity of the Minister.  Have I another minute, Sir?</P>

      <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have behaved admirably throughout this dispute. There may be further scope for their intervention.  I do not know.  Certainly they can be excused if they do not see any scope.  They have worked hard <Col N="98" /> to find a solution.  The Minister says that if he intervenes existing procedures will be damaged.  In the manifesto which brought the Minister into office there are specific references to the need to review procedures in the Post Office.  There was no reluctance to meet the members of the Post Office workers' union prior to the election last June, and no reluctance to meet any other union, and the impression created by the Fianna Fáil manifesto was that if Fianna Fáil were returned to Government they would immediately review industrial relations in the Post Office.  The Minister in his own manifesto gave very clear undertakings to do precisely that.  He says he is willing to review the whole rule book.  He admits the rules are archaic. What damage then could be done if the Minister met the Post Office workers' union in an effort to get a return-to-work formula?  What damage could be done if he discussed the suspensions and considered what has to be done to meet the grievances of those suspended?  Unless that is settled the proposals the Minister defended here to day are dead.  They were rejected, admittedly by a narrow margin, but they were rejected by a democratic vote.  Something else must now be tried.  The Minister must intervene. He must start by abandoning the thinking so evident in his speech here today. He must agree to meet the executives concerned and sit down with them in an effort to get a return-to-work formula, subsequently considering the whole question of productivity.</P>
      <P>One could say a great deal more.  I have attempted to be constructive.  I am personally prepared to intervene if the Minister gives me the documentation and the assistance of the officials. I will start tonight by calling the union executive together.  In the hope that the Minister will favour me with a meeting to discuss the dispute I will proceed to intervene tonight in an effort to find a solution.</P>

      <P>This dispute is but one of many which shows the disgraceful deterioration in industrial relations since the return to office of what was rightly described in one newspaper this week as &ldquo;this most <Col N="99" /> dreadful Government&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech today was a repetition of a speech he gave before in this House.  The Minister sought once again today to prove that his hands are clean.  If they are clean it is because he has not seen fit to soil them by working to resolve this dispute.  The Minister was unable to give one single instance of any effort made by him to bring about a settlement.  He said that the Association of Chambers of Commerce, having heard his view, were satisfied no stone was being left unturned by the Minister and his officials both to effect an improvement in the service and to achieve a settlement.  What did the Minister tell the association that he did not tell the House today?  Or are they all Fianna Fáil?  I prefer not to think so.</P>
      <P>I said last week that the lack of any initiative by the Minister and the Government is both puzzling and appalling.  The Minister spoke at length of the efforts of the Employer/Labour Conference and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to resolve the dispute. The Minister praised the efforts of the congress and I want to be wholeheartedly associated with that praise. This side of the House greatly respects and values the role of congress, not only in this dispute but in industrial relations generally, a subject I hope to return to later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said already, the Minister's speech was a carbon copy of the speech he delivered to this House twice already.  He has not budged one inch from the position he was in several weeks ago.  The Minister remains in his bunker and refuses to budge.  The burden of his speech was to blame the whole dispute on a perceived division in the IPOEU.  Indeed, he repeated not once but several times that it was a minority within the union <Col N="100" /> executive that was responsible for the dispute but, at the same time, he has chosen to ignore the democratic vote within the union where the terms were turned down, albeit by a small majority. The Minister continues with his head-in-the-sand attitude, that only a minority within the union is responsible for the dispute and, therefore, that no action whatever on his part is necessary.</P>
    <P>Given the praise the Minister rightly had for the intervention and aid of congress, especially in view of the small majority against the proposals, one would imagine that he would have sought at least to have discussions with the Industrial Relations Committee of congress in order to discover what exactly were the problems with the proposals and what, if any, amendments to those proposals would reverse that majority and get a return to work.  The Minister was unable to tell the House today that he has approached congress again because the simple fact is that he has not approached it.  He has done nothing.</P>
    <P>Again today the Minister has also sought to isolate the union that he has continuously attacked in the most strident way.  He has singled out the IPOEU as if they alone of the Post Office unions were critical of him.  Just to show the fallacy of that assumption I shall quote from reports in the papers during the past two months.  On 11 February <i>The Irish Times</i> stated:</P>
    <P>And last night the Department's action in suspending technicians came under attack from two post office unions representing middle management, who called for an independent investigation into industrial relations in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>On 21 February <i>The Irish Times</i> reported as follows:</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, there were conflicting reports yesterday about the state of the telecommunications service.  The Department maintained that international telephone and telex services were &ldquo;generally normal&rdquo; and the telegram service was &ldquo;mostly normal&rdquo;. The problem areas now were internal phone and telex services to Britain and Belfast and the Department <Col N="101" /> appealed to the public to refrain from making calls where possible.</P>
    <P>The Irish Postmasters' Union, on the other hand, claimed that the situation was deteriorating.  It questioned the Department's motivation for issuing misleading statements about the strike, and said that &ldquo;as the postmasters of the 500 sub-offices with manual telephone exchanges, we are aware that the situation did not improve and is deteriorating.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 22 February <i>The Irish Times</i> stated:</P>
    <P>The Irish Post Office Union branch representing 1,000 phone operators, which passed a vote of soliarity with the technicians involved in the prolonged dispute, accused the Post Office of misleading the public about the extent of the disruption to the phone service.</P>
    <P>A spokesman for the union said few calls could be made from Dublin ....</P>
    <P>These quotations show that, contrary to what the Minister would like the House and the country to believe, the IPOEU are not alone among the Post Office unions in being severely critical of him and his Department.</P>
    <P>I accuse the Department of war propaganda, of untruths, of omissions and distortions.  I assert that the mentality that motivated the ignorant propaganda is the same mentality that lies behind this dispute.  Given the archaic set-up of the Post Office, that mentality is understandable from those who have had to work there for many years but it is inexcusable from a man so recently appointed to that Department.</P>
    <P>What then explains the behaviour, the total lack of activity on the part of the Minister, other than the activity of gross provocation so roundly condemned by Mr. Justice Kenny in the High Court and which was referred to by Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy O'Leary?  Despite exhaustive talks and inquiries, I cannot come to any other conclusion but that the Minister is the hostage of a Government decision to grind the IPOEU into the ground.  It would seem that the IPOEU are to be <Col N="102" /> made a lesson of, so that in the minds of some members of the Government the whole trade union movement will be put in its place.  If that is the hope of the Government, in my view it serves only to illustrate the ideological right-wing situation into which the Fianna Fáil Party have been delivered and which will smother them unless there is a change of course.</P>
    <P>That is why I want to refer to the role of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, not only in this dispute but in similar disputes and in industrial relations generally.  The congress have shown their sense of responsibility time and again.  As I have said before and I repeat now, they have shown practical patriotism that is not as apparent from other representative bodies of large interest groups.  Yet the Government, or at least some of their members, seem bent on industrial confrontation in the mistaken belief that the atmosphere will be created for trade union legislative reform.  If that is the case, not only are they wrong, they are stark, staring mad, or perhaps stark, staring schizophrenic.  I challenge the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to deny that the Government are seeking a confrontation.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister for Labour, who has been strangely quiet, to deny the Government are seeking confrontation with the unions.  Like the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the Minister for Labour is a hostage to his superior officers in the Government, notably the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  We have had no action from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or from the Minister for Labour.  How striking is the similarity between this dispute and the Ferenka dispute to which Deputy O'Donnell referred.</P>

      <P>It will not help the Government and it will not help the people.  You are quite right, a Cheann Comhairle.  The same inactivity by the Minister for Labour which caused the loss of 1,400 jobs in Ferenka is repeated in this dispute.  The Minister for Labour will not be able to speak in this debate unfortunately, but I challenge him to tell us what he has done in this dispute, what action he has taken to solve it or to bring about a settlement.  The only words from him were words of support for the provocation of his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Therefore the Department of Labour were rendered useless as a possible arbitrator in this disgraceful and sad strike.</P>
      <P>I referred to the madness of the schizophrenia of the Government.  The same madness seems to be permeating this dispute.  Confront, beat, vanquish &mdash;these are the terms in which the Government think.  This is a return to the same thinking which led the Fianna Fáil Government in the sixties to bring in anti-worker legislation in the ESB dispute.  They jailed workers and ended up sending them home in taxis.  Unless there is a radical change of course, I foresee a similar conclusion to this dispute.</P>
      <P>The House deserves to hear from the Minister in his winding up address what it did not hear in his 45-minute opening speech, what it has not heard in the several replies which have been extracted from him by us in this House.  This question was first raised on 2 November in an adjournment debate by Deputy B. Desmond.  On the same question I received a reply dated 8 November.  That reply is but a precis of what he said today.  At the beginning of February he replied again to Deputy B. Desmond and said much the same as he had said before.  No change.  Not an inch budged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He replied to me at a little more length on 9 February, again without one centimetre of movement from him and again with provocative words and statements.  We had an adjournment debate in which Deputy O'Donnell, Deputy J. Ryan, Deputy L. Cosgrave and I spoke.  I asked the Minister if he would not accept the unions' offer <Col N="104" /> of one month's truce and a return to work so that some negotiations could go on during that month.  The Minister would not budge.  His speech in this House during the adjournment debate on 8 February is almost a replica of what he said here today and of what he said on 8 November.</P>
    <P>We raised this question again in the Dáil by way of Private Notice Question on 14 February.  The Minister's reply could be extracted from this draft speech which must have been prepared last October.  It is exactly the same, the same wording, the same provocative style.  On Wednesday, 22 February the Minister for Labour had the floor and we had some omnious words from him.  In part of his reply to my question he said:</P>
    <P>I would also like to put on record my view that departure from the negotiated procedures accepted by the Department and the unions could have adverse consequences for industrial relations in the future.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for regret that the people in their wisdom chose to return a Government with such a massive majority who have not got one iota of a clue about industrial relations or one iota of a clue about the problems and attitudes of workers.  It is fair to assert that, if the National Coalition Government were still in office, this strike would have been settled long ago.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said this dispute started in May of last year, five weeks before the general election.  The then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was advised to suspend workers but he and the Government decided in their wisdom that there would be no suspensions because that would merely provoke the dispute and in no way lead to a settlement.</P>
    <P>This Government were returned to office and, before long, we had suspensions and more suspensions.  As was said in the High Court, situations were contrived in which people could not but be suspended and in which they could not possibly behave other than as they did.  Workers who were happily and productively at work elsewhere in the city were put into contrived suspension situations by being <Col N="105" /> ordered into places where they never worked before, places on which official pickets had already been placed.  The Minister also worsened the situation by laying off 500 workers needlessly.  This was described not only by the unions but by several newspapers as an attempt by the Minister to destroy the union.  Let us ask the Minister to explain something he has not yet explained.  Why did he find it necessary to suspend those 500 workers?</P>
    <P>On 2 March an important American industrialist wrote to the managing director of the IDA, Mr. Michael Killeen, concerning this dispute.  He also forwarded copies of the letter to local TDs.  The letter, written by the managing director of Hanson Limited of Clevaragh Estate Sligo, stated:</P>
    <P>Dear Michael,</P>
    <P>The attached copy of Protective Notice is self-explanatory.</P>
    <P>We have known each other for over ten years and you are well aware of how I have supported the work of the IDA.  You also know that we have tried to do our best to keep our operation in Sligo efficient and competitive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of newspapers published the letter.  The letter continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult even when operating normally to communicate and run a world sales operation from the west of Ireland.  Unfortunately the Irish phone system is a &ldquo;mickey mouse&rdquo; set up operated by improperly motivated <Col N="106" /> and trained people.  It is a disgrace to Ireland and it certainly must make your job to promote industry very difficult.</P>
    <P>We shall continue to do our best under the circumstances as you would expect, but the continuation of this communications problem certainly has upset any growth plans we have.</P>
    <P>As much as I have been a booster for the IDA I now in good conscience cannot recommend Ireland as a place to establish a business.  This is regrettable considering the fact that I have boosted Ireland for over 17 years.  Hopefully some changes will be made to restore the creditability of Ireland.</P>
    <P>A copy of that letter was sent to the Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service, Deputy MacSharry, a representative in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency.  His Department are connected in a big way with this dispute. I am sure that the IDA also sent copies of it to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and to the Government.  It is alarming to think that in spite of such clear-cut statements the Government have refused to budge.</P>
    <P>What can possibly explain the Government's behaviour, their provocative actions and their lack of any sort of conciliatory activity other than a wish for confrontation, a hope to destroy the IPOEU?  I appeal to the Government to have sense, to change their course and have consultation and not confrontation.  The Minister should meet the union now because, inevitably, he will have to do so.  Eventually this strike, like almost all strikes, will be settled.  It should be fixed sooner rather than later.  I do not think the Minister's willingness to have direct talks could, by any stretch of the imagination, be construed as a climb down for him.  If the Minister thinks that the IPOEU are the only union with complaints about the Department he has another think coming.  A number of other unions recently asked the Minister to have direct talks with them.  I believe it would enhance the Minister's reputation if he agreed to talk with the IPOEU and to bury his <Col N="107" /> pride.  If that is too much for the Minister I ask him to adopt the suggestion put forward by Deputy O'Leary, that he should intervene on the basis of having all the files available.</P>

      <P>At the risk of being repetitious I should like to quote for the House the undertaking given in the Fianna Fáil manifesto in relation to labour relations within the Department of Posts and Telegraphs:</P>
      <P>To undertake a detailed examination of Staff Rules and Regulations in an effort to promote better labour relations which are of vital importance where such a large work-force is involved.</P>
      <P>That was a great promise and I am sure it made many of the staff of that Department wonder, I am sure many of them decided to vote Fianna Fáil on the basis of that and other promises. Last December, as spokesman on industrial relations for my party, I made an appeal, through the national Press, to the Taoiseach to intervene in this dispute.  I did so because I anticipated a serious escalation of the dispute if the Taoiseach or his Minister did not get involved.  My call went unanswered. There was no response from any quarter. My appeal was met with complete indifference and an attitude of hoping for the best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of an Adjournment Debate in January many Members requested the urgent involvement of the responsible Ministers in this dispute. The Minister for Labour told us he could not intervene although the normal procedures through his Department were not making much headway. The Minister involved have shown little concern throughout this dispute. I find it difficult to accept that the Minister for Labour is the same fighting, belligerent Opposition spokesman who was in this House between 1973 and 1977 and I can imagine what his performance would have been last year were he still in Opposition.  He would have been swinging from the rafters screaming for the resignation of the Government.  Where has all that dynamic enthusiasm gone?  What has that <Col N="108" /> Minister done to show his concern for industrial peace?  Are we to see a repetition of the Ferenka debacle?</P>
    <P>Last lear Fianna Fáil were elected to govern the country and accepted full responsibility for the national wellbeing and the genuine effective resolving of all our important national issues. It is no wonder that an editorial in a recent issue of <i>The Irish Times</i>, in a reference to this dispute, described the Executive as a most dreadful Government. I should now like to refer to the non-activity of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Two months ago it was stated in a court that he was plotting to suspend some of the workers involved.  Is that not a terrible accusation? If such a statement is correct, as I believe it is, how can one blame the workers for becoming more belligerent and, despite the Minister's statement to the contrary, more united and determined to fight on regardless of the cost to themselves?</P>
    <P>Is the situation not further aggravated by the Minister's adamancy in not meeting the union involved?  Surely outdated regulations and labour attitudes must be set aside in an effort to resolve this dispute?  How can the Minister lose face by talking to the union concerned?  Or, can he not once again, ask for the ever-present and helpful contribution of the Industrial Relations Committee of the ICTU? How can he stand by when all sections of the community and all aspects of our life, including industrial development, tourism and export programme down to the very fundamental protection of the health of our people, are affected?  The situation at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, is a frightful example of the effect of this dispute on community services in general.</P>
    <P>I believe that unless the Minister takes a courageous stand and calls in the union or the Industrial Relations Committee of the ICTU we shall face a total collapse of the telex and telephone services, a frightening prospect. To the ordinary citizen watching television or reading the papers it seems that there is a complete lack of interest in this dispute situation and its deterioration, an acceptance, in fact, of a substandard service by the powers that <Col N="109" /> be&mdash;I refer to every member of the Cabinet from the Taoiseach down.  Or, as Deputy Mitchell said, can there be something more sinister, more devious in allowing this dispute to escalate to an extent that may warrant anti-trade union legislation?</P>
    <P>These are question to which the people require answers.  Where now is the election slogan of 1977: &ldquo;Let us get the country moving again&rdquo;?  The Government's performance is not good enough.  In this situation which is worsening day by day, where have all our Minister gone?</P>
    <P>Finally, I say to the Ministers involved: &ldquo;Get on with your job with some humility.&rdquo;  As Deputy Mitchell pointed out, humility in this situation may earn the Minister and his Department much goodwill.  Otherwise the situation will worsen considerably and may extend much beyond the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Repeatedly here and outside I have stressed the urgent need for an industrial review of labour regulations which I consider outdated, meant for 1878 instead of 1978.  Whether this be done by the Minister's Department, by a neutral person or independent body or in conjunction with the trade unions, it is urgently necessary.</P>
    <P>I realise it is not an immediate solution; the immediate solution is for the Government to put the boot in and get the dispute fixed up as soon as possible. We speak of job creation and youth involvement in work, but I would refer the Minister to the fact that this is a situation where there is need for involvement in job retention.  We have a big workforce; we want to keep them working and we are all concerned that they should get on with the job.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Mitchell's amendment and I call on the Minister to involve himself immediately in the dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened over the past one and a half hours to the Opposition with interest but certainly with very little profit.  From statements they have been making consistently for the past while one would imagine <Col N="110" /> that this strike could be easily ended and I suppose I had some right to assume that when they spoke here today they would have given an idea of how they thought the dispute could be ended.  Above all, I was led to believe that Deputy O'Leary would be able to find where the basis of this problem lay and succeed where the Employer-Labour Conference had failed and where the ICTU had not as yet succeeded in finding a basis for ending the dispute, which I must repeat, I inherited from the previous administration. I was very interested to hear some of the Deputies opposite, particularly Deputy Mitchell, referring to the dispute as if it were something which came into being after we had come into office.</P>
      <P>We are concerned about ending this dispute on a fair and equitable basis, fair to the staff and to the public.  I very much regret that practically every Opposition speaker denigrated the proposals put forward by ICTU.  I said in my original speech that I was particularly surprised and shocked to find Deputy O'Leary refer to them in a manner which one would not expect at least from a Deputy on the Labour benches.  Despite the fact that during my opening statement I gave detailed reasons for feeling that I cannot meet the union executive to discuss settlement proposals as they have asked, Deputies opposite continue to criticise me for not meeting the union and continue to urge this course of action on me and seemingly suggest that if I were to meet the executive of the union it would lead to an ending of the strike, Of course none of them explained how or why this would be achieved by such a means.  Do they claim that after many hours of discussion the union representatives failed to get across to the representatives of the executive council of ICTU what their problems and grievances were?  Or are they stating that the congress representatives failed to grasp and appreciate the problems and grievances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In commenting on the recent congress proposals I draw attention to the fact that it covered all the alleged areas of staff dissatisfaction, the productivity agreements, the introduction of significant <Col N="111" /> changes in work practices, updating of rules and regulations and the revision of grievance procedures as well as&mdash;this is very important&mdash; providing an improved framework for setting industrial relations problems in the future.  Moreover, I understand that in reporting back to congress on the outcome of the ballot on the congress proposals the union executive did not claim that there were areas of staff dissatisfaction not covered in the congress proposals.  In that situation what is the base of a claim that meeting the union executive would produce a settlement?  In those circumstances apart from any other, is it not reasonable that the union executive should seek whatever clarification or reassurance they require from congress on the proposals?  I urge them strongly to adopt this procedure.</P>
    <P>Of course the Deputies critising me for not meeting the union executive did not address themselves to the consequences of action on these lines which I spelled out in my opening speech in this debate.  These were conveniently glossed over or ignored, but you cannot deal with industrial relations problems in this way.  If you hope that by breaking agreements once, what you have done will not be noticed or will be ignored, you are simply burying your head in the sand.  Realities have to be faced, and, in breaking agreements once, you are clearly saying that you are prepared to accept and tolerate disorder in industrial relations with all that that implies.  Even if you were to negotiate new agreements in those circumstances, you would have to recognise that these too could be set aside unilaterally by any disgruntled individual or group.  The position has to be faced up to squarely. Either we are going to preserve agreed, orderly negotiation processes or we are going to encourage disruption.  The Government's view and mine is that, serious though the hardships and difficulties resulting from the present dispute are, it is in the interest of the community and the staff&mdash;I emphasise the staff&mdash;that orderly negotiation processes should be maintained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> If there is dissatisfaction with the negotiation procedures which are there presently then let us have this whole matter re-examined but in conjunction with the other unions who represent many of the other workers in the Post Office.  By agreement these things can be changed, but it is essential that the negotiation procedures should be there and if it is found necessary to change these then let us do it in a rational and orderly fashion.  The Deputies who have spoken at length about the loss and inconvenience caused by the strike are the very people who would seize every opportunity to complain loudly in normal times about any inefficiency that might be in the telephone service.  On reflection I feel that they can see that if certain disruptive elements had their way it is unlikely that there could ever again be efficiency and good work practices, no matter who is responsible for running these services.</P>
    <P>I repeat that I am not looking for confrontation nor do I want capitulation by anyone.  The recent congress proposals, which I accepted, did not involve capitulation for them.  They provided for a reasonable and honourable settlement.  Equally I, as representing the community, should not have to capitulate either.  It is not a question of losing face.  If the situation were such that nobody was involved in the industry except one union, then certain things could be done which it is not possible to do in circumstances where there are quite a large number of workers who are members of other unions and who have the same agreements and the same negotiation rights as have the IPOEU.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made on a number of occasions here to the Fianna Fáil manifesto and to what we have said in reference to labour relations. The Government have been conscious of the importance of having staff rules and regulations that are relevant to present-day conditions and of the contribution that these can make towards improved labour relations in the Department.</P>
    <P>Listening to some of the Deputies here one would imagine that nothing has been done, because they do not <Col N="113" /> want to know what has been done, and it is not because I have not already announced it on a number of occasions.  The Opposition have adopted the attitude that nothing has been done by anybody in an effort to improve labour relations and to end this industrial unrest.  I have acted on the provisions of the manifesto, and last October I set up a Departmental group to carry out a far-reaching review of staff rules and regulations.  In January last the staff unions were invited to give their views on the changes they would wish to have made and how they considered that changes could be made which would improve industrial relations in the Department. Regrettably, of course, it has not been possible to carry out this examination as effectively as I would like because industrial action has been taken by one of the unions, the IPOEU, and because I want to get their views as well as the views of the other unions in the Post Office as to how we can improve relations.  In accordance with the proposals formulated by the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions recently, that review will now be carried out by the Departmental Conciliation Council on which, as Deputies probably know, there are representatives of management and of staff, but under a chairman nominated by the Chairman of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary in the course of his speech referred to the Labour Court and wondered whether something could be done to involve them here. They are being involved not only once but three times.  They are being involved in the productivity claim, in the efforts to improve the rules and regulations, and in the problems which are of immediate concern. Therefore, to say that we have been doing nothing is the height of nonsense.</P>
    <P>I have also had from a number of Deputies here what they have already been announcing to the public, that there ought to be a public inquiry. I think it was Deputy Kelly who called for an inquiry into industrial relations in the Department and he suggested that this would lead to an <Col N="114" /> ending of the present strike.  Of course he did not indicate what basis he had for that suggestion.</P>

Might I add that Deputies opposite are very late converts to the need for a fundamental examination of staff relations in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.

      <P>The Government recognise the need for such examination and include it in their election manifesto. As I explained, that examination is in train.  I was astounded at some of the points Deputy Mitchell made.  He said that during the Coalition's term of office suggestions had been made that the officials of the Department had recommended that members of the <Col N="115" /> union should be suspended but that the Coalition Government had refrained from so doing and had stated that this was not the way to end the strike.  I am afraid the Deputy must be living in cloud cuckoo land because when I came into Government I found members already suspended.  I also found that not only had a considerable number of the members of the IPOEU in Limerick been suspended, but they had been informed that unless they returned to work they would be treated as having abandoned their posts.  Might I futher add that I had a document in my Department in which my predecessor had approved a proposal to put before the Government to have the two suspended technicians dismissed.  It was lucky I got into office and countermanded that.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to one particular matter raised by Deputy M. O'Leary on the radio and again here today, and that was the suggestion that this Government were anxious to destroy the union and were using this strike to bring in anti-trade union legislation.  I am a trade unionist and have been all my life.  I have been an active trade unionist and chairman of the branch in my area.  I do not want to break the union, but the opposite. I would be very anxious to see this a very strong trade union.  This is what I want and I want the union to understand that.  Nobody knows better than I do the value of a good trade union.  Nobody knows better than I do the destructive influence which would arise were a trade union to be destroyed.</P>

      <P>I want the union to understand that.  I have no personal animosity against anybody.  I am simply concerned with trying to end this industrial unrest on a fair and equitable basis, on a basis where nobody is asked to capitulate or is asked to do something which I would not be willing to do myself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained where the problem is in regard to this and I think the union understand <Col N="120" /> that now.  It is not anything that refers to intransigence on my part.  I have to be concerned about the effects of damaging negotiating machinery. Negotiating machinery can be changed by agreement; it cannot be changed unilaterally and if I were to break through that negotiating machinery now it would create problems in the civil service generally that would not be overcome for many a day.  I have no doubt that were I do not that the Deputies opposite would be the first to scream at me when those problems would arise.  Some of them are trade unionists and they know what the procedures are.</P>
      <P>I should like to end on a somewhat personal note.  I have been reluctant&mdash; and perhaps the media could blame me for it&mdash;to say more in public about this dispute than what I regarded as the essential minimum.  My main endeavour was to bring about a lasting and peaceful settlement of this dispute, which as everybody knows I inherited from my predecessors.  For that reason I have refrained from replying to many of the facile complaints and cries for intervention from Opposition Deputies and others.  I have put up with a fair amount of uninformed criticism on similar lines from various quarters.  I did this because I was anxious that no unguarded word of mine might be misrepresented as provocative or as making the way to a settlement more difficult.  Instead, I have worked quietly and persistently through the various channels open to me which might provide for a settlement. I am not terribly perturbed about the Opposition shouting at me that I have not done anything.  I could, perhaps, have a very much better public relations system operating and in fact be doing nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I should not like my restraint in this matter to be misunderstood. It is not the first time I have been faced with this type of pressure.  Deputies will remember that during my previous period as Minister I also had to put up with a considerable amount of sniping about two issues in particular&mdash;community schools and parity for teachers.  I was accused by some of going too quickly <Col N="121" /> and by others of going too slowly, but the one thing I can say is that when my term of office was up community schools were established so well that the Coalition could not destroy them and there are demands for them now from every part of the country. Equally, teachers had parity and for the first time in history the three groups of teachers came together.</P>
    <P>In relation to this matter, I can assure the House and the country that, while I may not be demonstrative, I nevertheless believe in what I am doing.  I am not doing it out of any intransigence on my part.  Knowing me as many of the Deputies do, I do not think that anybody could suggest that I am provocative or that I am not amenable to reasonable suggestions and proposals.  I simply want to say that I can assure the country that <Col N="122" /> my intention is to settle this dispute in a way that would be fair and reasonable to both the staff and the public.  Hopefully, before I leave my present office we will have a more efficient and productive telecommunications service.</P>

      <P>All I ask for is the co-operation of all concerned.  I can assure the union that I have their interest very much at heart.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the following Regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Industrial and Provident Societies (Financial Limits) Regulations, 1978.</P>
      <P>a copy of which Regulations in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 9th March, 1978.</P>
      <P>These regulations are about increasing the financial limits which apply to industrial and provident societies. These are incorporated bodies which may be set up to carry on any trade, business or industry.  The governing legislation, that is, the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts of 1893 to 1971, impose certain financial limits.</P>
      <P>The limits are:</P>
      <P>Firstly, the amount a person (other than another registered society) may hold in shares in an Industrial and Provident Society: this is £1,000 at present and I propose to make it £3,000;</P>
      <P>Secondly, the amount of property in such a society a member may nominate, i.e., leave to any named person or persons on his death, with the minimum of formalities (a nomination is legally a will).  This is £1,000 at present and I propose to increase this figure also to £3,000;</P>
      <P>Thirdly, on the death of a nominator, the limits on the amount of shares a nominee may receive if he is also a member of the society&mdash; he may only receive such amount as would bring his total shareholding in the society to £1,000, this being the present maximum individual shareholding.  I propose to increase this figure too to £3,000;</P>
      <P>Fourthly, on the death of a member who has made neither a will not a nomination, the amount of his property in the society the committee may distribute among such persons as appear to be legally entitled to receive the same.  This sum is £500 at present, and I propose to raise it to £1,500.</P>
      <P>Sections 4, 25, 26 and 27 of the 1893 Act, which set out the original limits, were last amended in 1966 when the present limits on shareholding and on nominations were fixed.  They have not been changed since.  The regulations now before the House are designed to do just this for two main reasons, both of which are interconnected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, time has taken its <Col N="125" /> inevitable toll on the monetary sums fixed in 1966.  The real value of these sums has been severely eroded due to the decline in money values.  This fact automatically brings one to the second factor.  Because of the decline just mentioned, a serious strain has been placed, and this is particularly so in the agricultural co-operative sector, on the adequacy of the capital structure of societies.  It is, therefore, with a view to compensating for the drop in money values and relieving any capital constraints that may exist, particularly in the agricultural co-operative sector, that I am proposing the present regulations.</P>
    <P>Of the increases proposed, the new figure of £3,000 for maximum shareholding by an individual in a society is by far the most important.  I regret that I cannot introduce at the moment a greater increase in the case of agricultural co-operatives.  My inability to do so is due to a technical difficulty in the existing law which provides me with the power only to apply the same limits to all classes of industrial and provident societies without distinction. Credit unions are, of course, industrial and provident societies and notwithstanding the splendid achievements of that movement, I am not satisfied that the time is right for a limit higher than £3,000 on an individual's shareholding in a credit union.  I shall, however, introduce amending legislation shortly which will enable me to fix different limits for different classes of society, and I intend to use this power to increase certain of the limits now fixed in the case of agricultural cooperatives.</P>
    <P>Such, therefore, is the background to the preparation of the present regulations. I am confident that, given their nature, and, more importantly, their aims, they will meet with the full approval of the House.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to say a few words on the general subject of deposit taking by industrial and provident societies.  As I have already mentioned, the relevant Acts permit societies to carry on almost any kind of business, and this includes the business of accepting deposits from the public which would <Col N="126" /> normally be thought of as banking business.  Deposit-taking societies are not subject to the same supervision and controls as banks are under the Central Bank Act, 1971, and accordingly they do not offer the public the same safeguards as banks.  While there is no reason for concern about the position of most deposit-taking societies, it would not be possible, in the absence of banking type controls, to be confident about the position of all such societies and, as I have earlier announced, I am preparing legislation designed to provide a suitable system of supervision.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I refer again to the present regulations.  I strongly recommend their approval by the House for the reasons I have already outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Fine Gael have no objection to these regulations and have no fault to find with their substance. I am glad to hear from the Minister of State that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is shortly going to introduce legislation which will enable him, as he says, to fix different limits for different classes of societies in regard to individual shareholding.  I am also interested to hear that he proposes legislation which will have the effect of securing depositors against possibilities arising out of the movement through the societies not being subject to the same stringent control as the banks.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the House and of the Minister of State to a couple of minor matters in connection with the drafting of these regulations. I do not represent them as being anything more than minor or trivial.  I realise that the Minister of State may not be in a position to consider them on her feet, so to speak. I am not quite sure what to suggest in that case if there is any substance in what I want to point out.  Perhaps her advisers might look at these regulations between now and the Seanad or possibly even adjourn this debate if they think there is any substance in what I have to say.  They are trivial points but nonetheless worth pointing out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 35(1) (i) of the Credit Union <Col N="127" /> Act, 1966, empowers the Minister to make regulations about, among other things, the alteration of limits of the kind which these regulations now propose. The paragraph reads in part: &ldquo;altering from time to time the financial (including percentage) limits or time limits prescribed by paragraphs ...&rdquo;. Then follows a long list of paragraphs in which he is entitled to make alterations by regulation.  This paragraph ends: &ldquo;.... and Part I of the Schedule to this Act,&rdquo;.  There is nothing whatever in that paragraph of the 1966 Credit Union Act&mdash;I advance this as a drafting consideration and I may even be wrong about that&mdash;to which the attention of the world is directed by the opening words of the regulations, about the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893.  The Minister is proposing on the face of it, although I know perfectly well what is meant and I am not misled by it, in Regulation 2 to make amendments to the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, in purported exercise of powers conferred by section 35 (1) (i) of the Credit Union Act, 1966.  The latter paragraph does not mention the 1893 Act at all.  It mentions part 1 of the Schedule of the 1966 Act.  That Schedule effects changes in the 1893 Act.  What is really happening here is that that Schedule is being amended by the increase in limits.  There may be an aspect of this that I have overlooked and I do not advance this as anything more than something for the Minister and her advisers to look at. It seems to me that what the Minister in effect is aiming to do, and the only thing on the face of it she has any legal power to do, is to make changes in part 1 of the Schedule of the 1966 Act and not what she says she is doing &mdash;making changes in the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893.  I know that in substance it is the same thing but I do not think we should let a drafting slip&mdash;perhaps I am the one who has made the slip&mdash;go through without calling attention to it.</P>
    <P>The second drafting matter&mdash;an even more trivial one but I had better mention it&mdash;occurs in the third of the four boxes in the Schedule to the regulations, the box with section 26 and in <Col N="128" /> brackets &ldquo;inserted by the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1913.&rdquo;  Section 26 was not inserted by the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1913.  All that Act did was to insert new provisions for the first subsection of section 26. The House can take it from me that the 1913 Act does not insert section 26 but has the effect of inserting a new subsection in section 26.  I quite realise that those are things one may need to think about and I do not expect the Minister to reply to them completely now.  I welcome the enactment of these regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I give these regulations a cautious welcome in so far as they improve the existing situation.  I have some reservations about the decision of the Minister of State to raise the limit to £3,000, particularly in relation to credit unions.  We are aware&mdash; the Minister referred to it&mdash;of the outstanding work of credit unions throughout the country.  I am uneasy that the Minister still holds the view that the time is not yet right for a limit higher than £3,000 on an individual's shareholding in a credit union.  A sum of £3,000 today is rather little.  If one considers the average industrial earnings of a male adult it is no more than about nine months salary and is no more than what one would consider in the context of a booking fee and a deposit on a house.  I would have gone for a limit somewhere in the region of £5,000, bearing in mind, even with the low level of inflation this year, that it will be some time before those limits are increased again.  I believe the decision was unduly cautious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse the caution rightly entered into by the Minister of State in relation to the supervision and control of industrial and provident societies. There are, unfortunately, still a number of people who when they come into small amounts of money decide to lodge them in industrial and provident societies.  We all know that the majority of those societies are efficiently run and fulfil a certain function in our society. As public representatives we have to underline what the Minister said: that the deposits taken by such societies are not subject to the same controls as <Col N="129" /> they would have in banks under the Central Bank supervision.  One knows that a few chancers may be floating around.  It is very easy in a fly by night operation for such societies to take in substantial deposits.  While the depositors have certain redress under ordinary deposit regulations in that they may claim back and may take legal action in the conventional sense, their redress may be too late.  I welcome the caution by the Minister of State in relation to such deposits.</P>
    <P>I urge all depositors in such societies no matter how acceptable a level of business they may provide on a regular and systematic basis, to ensure that their deposits are in safe keeping and that they are rigorously audited. I know that this is a normal practice in all societies but it is only after the horse has bolted that one wonders why some people were so gullible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister that legislation is being prepared to provide a suitable system of supervision of such societies.  I am concerned that the drafting of this form of legislation inevitably takes a great deal of time and one becomes impatient at times about the drafting.  The Government have now been in office for eight or nine months and we are reaching the stage of asking where is the legislation, even the amending legislation to the Central Bank Act which was promised by the Minister for Finance in relation to another banking situation.  I hope that the necessary legislation promised here will come soon.  Where there is a vacuum, as there is now, one can have the chancer moving in.  In this area it is most important in the public interest to protect depositors and securities from being taken for a ride on occasions. I make these comments in welcoming the regulations and we can find them non-contentious in that context this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kelly and Deputy Desmond for the welcome they gave to this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> In relation to the point made by Deputy Kelly about the Credit Union Act, 1966, section 35 (1), our legal advice, as Deputy Kelly knows, comes to the Department officials and to myself from the Attorney General's Office, and his advice was sought on this query.  We have been assured that it is legal.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Desmond's point on the limit of £3,000 on credit unions, £3,000 as we all know, could be a person's life savings, and if a credit union collapses the person loses all.  The credit unions are very happy with the limit of £3,000 and at this stage there is no need to raise it.</P>
    <P>As regards the fears expressed by Deputy Desmond in connection with industrial and provident societies generally.  I am very well aware of these fears.  All Deputies on both sides of the House, together with many other people, are aware that these fears exist.  Until we have legislation which provides controls over industrial and provident societies we cannot have a suitable system of supervision.  When I present this legislation to the House I hope I will have the support of both parties opposite in getting the legislation through fairly quickly.</P>

    <Title>Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1978: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The legislation which provided for relief of rates on agricultural land by way of the agricultural grant expired on the 31 December last.  The purpose of the present Bill is to continue the application of the agricultural grant with modifications in respect of 1978 and 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> The agricultural grant is paid from the Exchequer to local authorities to enable them to give certain abatements of rates to occupiers of agricultural land.  In the present financial year the grant will amount to £38.5 million.</P>
    <P>The scheme of allowances provided under the Bill includes a primary allowance giving relief of 100 per cent of the general rate in the £ in respect of land holdings the valuation of which does not exceed £20.  This means, in effect, the complete derating of these holdings.  In the case of holdings between £20 and £33 valuation, the primary allowance relieves 100 per cent of the rates on the first £20 of the land valuation leaving the rated occupier liable for rates on the remainder of the valuation only.  The next category of land holdings embraces those with valuations in excess of £33 but less than the income tax threshold for wholetime farmers applicable on 1 January of the relevant local financial year.  These holdings will qualify for a primary allowance of 80 per cent in respect of the first £20 of the valuation and a supplementary allowance of 30 per cent on the remainder of the valuation.</P>
    <P>The only change from the existing arrangements is that farmers whose land holdings have a valuation which equals or exceeds the income tax threshold for full-time farmers will no longer benefit from the rates reliefs on agricultural land.  Since the income tax threshold stood at £75 at the beginning of this year, it will remain at that figure for the reliefs in 1978.  The reduction of the threshold for income tax purposes to £60 land valuation was announced in the budget.  That reduction will not affect the upper limit of eligibility for Agricultural Grant reliefs until 1979.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (2) of the Bill as drafted would, in line with the income tax law, require aggregation of holdings on a national basis for the purposes of applying the income tax threshold to allowances under this Bill.  The administrative implications of this form of aggregation are being examined but it appears that there would be considerable practical difficulties in implementing this form of aggregation in relation <Col N="132" /> to 1978.  Accordingly I hope to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to change this to an enabling provision.  This will clear the way for having aggregation on a rating area basis rather than on a national basis in 1978.</P>
    <P>All farmers will, of course, benefit from the abolition of rates on their domestic dwellings along with all other domestic ratepayers and from the Government's decision to abolish rates on farm outbuildings.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to commend this short Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This Bill is entitled Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1978.  Section 2 of the Bill says: &ldquo;This Act may be cited as the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1978&rdquo;.  Never has a Bill come into this House with a more misleading or dishonest title.  From its title one would imagine that the object of the Bill was to grant relief in respect of rates on agricultural land.  The direct opposite is the intention of the Bill. As the Minister has stated, over the years substantial grants have been provided for agricultural land in respect of rates.  For example, taking this year and assuming a rate of £10.21 in the £, a farmer with a valuation of £75 would, but for this Bill, receive a grant in relief of rates amounting to £331.82; if his valuation were £90 he would receive a grant in relief of rates of £377.77; if his Poor Law Valuation was £100 he would receive a grant of £408.44p.  These reliefs and grants are being abolished by this Bill whether or not an agricultural holder is liable to income tax.  The pretence behind this Bill is that the farmer may deduct his rates from his income tax, as an instalment of the tax&mdash;all very well if he is liable to income tax with a poor law valuation of £75.  But supposing he is a married man with substantial family commitments, supposing he employs labour, is paying contractors' fees and bank interest&mdash; when all of those are taken into account he is not liable to income tax &mdash;his rates will be increased by £331 if his valuation is £75.  Then we are <Col N="133" /> told it is a Bill to grant relief from rates on agricultural land.  It is stated somewhere that under the income tax code a farmer will be given one date on which to pay income tax and that that date will be the last day of the financial year.  But the Minister will make sure that he grabs a slice of that farmer's income tax, if he is liable, well before that date because he will pay the first instalment of rates about the end of June and the second about 1 October, thereby paying his income tax, if he is liable, well in advance, earlier than he ever did before.</P>
      <P>Another mean and contemptible aspect of the Bill the Minister did not even think it worth while referring to is that it abolishes the employment grant right across the board irrespective of whether a poor law valuation is £75 or £10 because subsection (1) of section 1 says:</P>
      <P>(1)  Subject to subsection (2) of this section, the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, shall apply to the local financial years ending on the 31st day of December, 1978, and the 31st day of December, 1979, and shall so apply subject to the modification that no employment allowance shall be made.</P>
      <P>This is a Government that came into office with the intention of boosting and giving incentives to employment. I admit&mdash;and I make a present of this to the Minister&mdash;that the annual allowance of £17 was very small.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): If the Minister was serious about it he should be increasing the allowance and, if it was abolished, should be saying so instead of confirming here that it will not apply.  I shall revert to the details of the Bill before I conclude but the Minister is thoroughly ashamed of this Bill and has every right to be so.  He comes in here with it after 7 p.m. in the evening when he hopes it will receive no publicity but will be glossed over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is acknowledged that the rating system is unjust and has been condemened <Col N="134" /> over the years by people who took an interest in it on the basis that the system of collecting revenue through rates does not have any regard to the income or capacity of the ratepayer to pay.  That is the view my party have taken of the system of rates for several years and I hope to show that we have acted accordingly.  The Fianna Fáil Party, now in Government, have had different views about rates and rating systems from time to time.  As I hope to show from a short history going back to 1972, they appear to find it very difficult to make up their minds in regard to rates.  Therefore it is not surprising that they introduce this Bill this evening, the result of which will be to increase the rates&mdash;assuming a rate of £10.21p in the £&mdash;from £331.82p or 77 per cent on a poor law valuation of £75 to as high as £408.40p, or 66? per cent on a poor law valuation of £100 this year.</P>
    <P>As from 1 January next&mdash;assuming an increased rate in accordance with the Minister's guidelines and a rate next years of £11.23 in the £&mdash;the rates will be increased from £314.44p, or 87 per cent in the case of a farmer with a poor law valuation of £60, to as high as £449.20p, or 66? per cent in the case of a farmer with a poor law valuation of £100.  And these increases will take place whether or not the farmer is liable to income tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his advisers know perfectly well that many farmers with a valuation above the threshold will not be liable to income tax for one reason or another.  In the case of farmers who are not making a profit and who produce accounts they will be exempt from tax.  Yet they will have to pay this savage increase in rates imposed by this Bill.  If they rely on the notional system of paying income tax I want to put on the record that many farmers&mdash;because they are married, have a number of qualified children and, in addition, are paying contractors' fees, employing labour, paying bank interest&mdash;will not be liable to income tax yet will have their rates substantially increased.  That is the position for this year.  Next year the position will be even worse because the threshold will be £60, unless the <Col N="135" /> Minister has been told by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, that he proposes to put up the multiplier next year from 90 to well above 100. If the multiplier is left at 90 great numbers of farmers who are married men with the commitments.  I have mentioned already will not be liable to income tax on a threshold of £60. Yet the Minister for the Environment will do the dirty work for his colleague, the Minister for Finance, and ensure that this savage increase in rates is extracted from the agricultural community without any regard to the ability of that community to pay or to meet family commitments.</P>
    <P>I said I would like to give a brief history of the approach of the Fianna Fáil Party over the past few years to rates.  It is right that it should go on the record.  In December 1972 the Fianna Fáil Government laid a publication, <i>Local Finance and Taxation</i>, before both Houses and in that publication they committed themselves: without qualification to the rating system as the only system for financing local government.  The reference is page 10, chapter 4, paragraph 421. They said that only the local rate satisfies the criteria referred to and the real issue is not the abolition of the rating system but the reform of the system so as to eliminate undoubted defects.  They were not talking about rate reliefs.  They were talking about closing gaps and doing away with grants so that they would extract the last penny by way of rates.  They were committed to continuing the old, unjust system of local taxation without regard to the capacity of the ratepayer to pay and without regard to his income.</P>
    <P>That was December 1972.  On 3 January 1973 the Taoiseach, without apparently having communicated with his party in advance, called a general election.  The National Coalition parties, Fine Gael and Labour, having considered the question of rates and realising the hardship the rating system was imposing on all sections put before the people in that election their policy to remove the health charges and housing subsidies from the rates. <Col N="136" /> They put that clearly before the people as one of their 14 points.  They realised the system was unjust and inequitable and, as a step towards abolishing rates altogether, they proposed to remove the health charges and the housing subsidies from the rates.  As we know, the National Coalition implemented that promise and during the four-and-a-half difficult years they were in office they kept the rates several pounds lower than they would have been if the health charges and housing subsidies had not been removed from the rates.</P>
    <P>What was the reaction of the Fianna Fáil Party in February 1973?  They went into the election campaign brandishing this document, <i>Local Finance and Taxation</i>, ridiculing the proposal of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties to reduce the rates as a first step towards abolishing them.  They said the proposal was pie in the sky.  They said it could not be done.  It would bankrupt the country because the money could not be found.  It would remove discretion from local authorities and vest it in the Custom House.  Towards the end of the campaign they stopped. They thought.  They did a right about turn.  They ditched <i>Local Finance and Taxation</i> which they had solemnly laid before both Houses two months previously.  They threw it into the wastepaper basket.  They said they would go one better.  They would abolish rates on private houses.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil made this turn about without telling the present Minister for Justice because, while the present think-tank here in Dublin was churning out a policy to go one better and abolish rates completely on private houses, Deputy Collins was down in West Limerick churning out 1,000,000 circulars ridiculing the proposal of the National Coalition Parties to abolish rates.  With a record and a history like that is it any wonder we now have a Bill like this?</P>
    <P>We have fortunately further information about the thinking and the promises of the Fianna Fáil Party now in regard to rates on agricultural land. The Taoiseach, speaking in this House as Leader of the Opposition on the Financial Statement on 4 April 1974, was advocating extension of the relief <Col N="137" /> of rates on private houses to agricultural land if income tax for farmers was to continue.  He said a good case could be made for derating agricultural land completely.  He practically wept for the farmers, At column 1515 of the Official Report of 4 April 1974 he stated:</P>
    <P>In making that point,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that was a point against income tax</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;they indicate that rates are already a heavy imposition on many of them, especially the progressive ones.  Therefore, there would now be a much stronger case to extend the Fianna Fáil policy of relieving homes, to relieving agricultural land from rates, if the incidence of income tax is going to bear more heavily on farmers as time goes on. It has been pointed out&mdash;and I think the point has been well taken&mdash;that farmers are the only producers whose means of production would be subject to income taxation. Another point which I think has been well taken is that about 50 per cent of their output, 50 per cent of their product, goes for export, whereas those in industrial production enjoy complete freedom of taxation from profits deriving from those industrial exports.  This is a point the Minister will have to take into account&mdash;obviously he has not done so at this stage&mdash;in order to ensure that fair taxation will be applied across the board.</P>
    <P>If that quotation means anything it means that not alone was the Taoiseach advocating the abolition of rates on agricultural land but he was also leading farmers to believe that income tax should not be proceeded with, that they should be tax free because they were engaged in an export business.  In the light of that, could anything be more disreputable or dishonest than the Bill before the House?</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister will make the case that the Bill will not involve any additional imposition on farmers. He will tell the House that they can deduct it from their income tax.  I would remind the House that there is no such provision in this Bill.  The Bill simply states that the agricultural grant will go and that the rates will <Col N="138" /> be increased to the extent I mentioned. I say without fear of contradiction that many of the 22,500 farmers will be brought into the income tax net by this Bill.  According to the budget statement of the Minister for Finance the number of farmers with a valuation in excess of £60 is 22,500 approximately. Many of them keep books and are not making a profit that would bring them into the income tax net.  If they produce accounts to show they are not liable for tax they will not have to pay income tax but they will be responsible for this huge increase in the rates brought about by this measure. Many of the farmers who work on the notional system of 90 times the PLV of £75 this year&mdash;I have a suspicion that system will be more than 90 times next year&mdash;will not be liable for income tax because of family circumstances, commitments and liabilities. However, the Minister for the Environment is going to do the dirty work of the Minister for Finance in extracting this large amount of money from the farmers.</P>
    <P>I question the <i>bona fides</i> of the Minister for the Environment.  I want to put it to the test in this matter. If he tells us it affects only farmers who have income tax to pay in excess of the increase brought about by this Bill, is he prepared to amend the Bill on Committee Stage?  Is he prepared to write into it a subsection that will ensure that only farmers who have income tax to pay will suffer this increase in rates?  Will he ensure that unless farmers are liable for income tax for an amount exceeding the increase in rates brought about by this Bill he will not extract the increase from them?  He need not come to the House and tell us that it is meant only for farmers who are liable for income tax unless he undertakes now to write such a safeguard into the Bill on Committee Stage.  I invite him to deal with that point when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>I do not think the enormity of the measures has hit the farming community yet.  From speaking to some farmers I know they think it is only the agricultural grant that affects the portion of their PLV in excess of £75 or £60 that will be affected.  I want to warn them that once their PLV exceeds <Col N="139" /> £75 this year every penny of grants to which they were previously entitled will go.  The primary and supplementary grants will go and they will not get any allowance.  They will pay the full rate from the first £ of their valuation to the last £.  I do not think that is generally realised by the farming community.  I want to put it on the record of this House and I invite the Minister to contradict me if I am wrong.  I am satisfied that what I have said is right.</P>
    <P>I also believe that this is a move towards abolishing the agricultural grant altogether and towards consolidating rates on farmers notwithstanding the fact that Fianna Fáil canvassed during the general election last year on the basis that all people had to do was to return Fianna Fáil to office to see the end of farmers' taxation. In their very first budget they reduced the threshold from £75 to £60 and they increased the multiplier from £65 to £90, a nice performance from the party who went as the Taoiseach wept on 4 April 1974 about the treatment the National Coalition were meting out to farmers, a nice performance by that Taoiseach having regard to his performance in this House on 4 April 1974.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that in this Bill they have taken care of the agricultural grant not only for 1978 but also for 1979.  This is the thin end of the wedge, the tip of the iceberg.  It will not be long until the agricultural grant is reduced to £50 and to £40, and then it will be gone altogether.  Is that the Minister's intention, or can we have an assurance from him, that there will be no further reduction in this grant?</P>
    <P>I have given a brief history of the Fianna Fáil Party's record on rates from 1972 to the last election. They issued the now famous manifesto and, in the immortal words of one Fianna Fáil Deputy, it will go down in history.  I do not think there is any doubt about that, but how it will go down in history is another question, and what will be written about it is another question, Fair play to it, it dealt with rates and agricultural taxation.  The manifesto <Col N="140" /> has a paragraph dealing with rates.  Under the heading of local government it dealt with rates at some length but it did not say a word about abolishing the agricultural grant.  It dealt with all the nice things they would do for the private householders. It said they would be looked after and that rates would go as from January 1978, and go they did.</P>
    <P>One would have thought the Fianna Fáil Party would have given their entire proposals on rates when they thought it fit to put in black and white this substantial paragraph in their manifesto.  When I read that it occurred to me that I had better check to see if they had said something about it when they were dealing with farmers' taxation.  It would be equally relevant there.  I turned to another part of the manifesto and I found a whole page dealing with farmers' taxation.  They said what they would do and how much would be saved by this and that proposal by Fianna Fáil on farmers' taxation and income tax.  But I did not find one word about their proposal to abolish the agricultural grant and to extract between £300 and £600 from farmers who might not be liable to rates at all.</P>
    <P>Then I thought the Fianna Fáil Party might have decided to put only the goodies into the manifesto and leave out the baddies.  I wondered did they mislead anybody, and sure enough they did.  In the last line of the part of the manifesto dealing with rates they said tax payments will fall due at the end of each financial year.  I want to charge the Minister with dishonesty in that regard.  That line is sheer dishonesty because not only did it say nothing about his proposals in this Bill to withdraw agricultural relief but it led farmers to believe they could go merrily along until the end of each financial year without being asked for one penny in income tax, and now he trots in here with this Bill increasing rates by abolishing the agricultural grant under the pretence that this is part of their income tax.  They will be asked to pay six months, if not more, before the end of the year.  Is the Minister not ashamed of that performance in the light of the manifesto?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> It is no wonder Fianna Fáil want to hear the end of the manifesto and that they think it is being laboured too much.  It is an historic document according to Deputy Leydon and we must have regard to it.  So much for that.  When the Fianna Fáil Party told town dwellers and owners of private houses they would relieve them of rates they did not tell them at the same time that they would ask the farmers&mdash;and I will be relevant shortly&mdash;</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>):&mdash;&mdash;to pay their rates for them as they are asking them to do in this Bill.  This money which is being extracted from the farmers will go into the Exchequer and presumably it will go towards making up rates on private houses.  I am glad rates on private houses have been abolished, but Irish farmers should have been told rates on private houses would be shifted from private householders to farmers with valuation of £60 and so on.</P>
      <P>Perhaps this money will be used to make good the £8 million relief on wealth tax.  It is more than a coincidence, I suppose, that in this year's budget the Minister for Finance is making a present of about £8 million to very wealthy people by relieving them of wealth tax and asking farmers with moderate means to pay £7 million. One could just balance the other. Perhaps that is what will happen. This is a discreditable performance, a confidence trick.  This year's performance will extract £7 million from 15,000 farmers.  The Minister should tell the House how much more will be extracted from farmers next year as a result of the introduction of this Bill and assuming an increase of 11 per cent in rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to put on record the effect this Bill will have on farmers in an average county.  Taking an average rate of £10.21 in the £ if this Bill was not passed a farmer with a PLV of £75 would be paying £433.93 but after the Bill is passed he will be liable for £756.75.  On the same rate a farmer with a valuation of £90 would be paying <Col N="142" /> £541.13 if the Bill was not passed but if it is passed he will be paying £918.90.  A farmer with a valuation of £100 would be paying £612.60 if the Bill was not passed but if it is passed he will be paying £1,021.  That is the position for this year.  In County Wexford those figures will be a lot higher because valuations are much greater.  Assuming there is a rate of £11.23 next year a farmer with a valuation of £60 would be paying £359.36 if the Bill was not passed but if it is passed he will be paying £673.80.  A farmer with a valuation of £75 without this Bill would be paying £477.28 but if it is passed he will be liable for £842.25.  A farmer with a valuation of £90 without the Bill would only be liable for £595.19 but if it is passed he will be liable for £1,010.70.  A farmer with a valuation of £100 without the Bill would be liable for £637.80 but if it is passed he will be liable for £1,123.</P>
    <P>That will be the position whether a farmer is liable for income tax or not because there is nothing in the Bill about income tax.  The Bill is an effort to extract money from farmers whether or not they are liable for income tax. If the Minister is serious about this statement to the effect that he will allow rates on agricultural land as an instalment of a farmer's tax bill he should amend the Bill accordingly.  If he does not do that he is extracting money from farmers contrary to the promises in the manifesto and all the undertaking given by Fianna Fáil canvassers during the election.  If I made a mistake about the miserable £17 employment allowance I make the Minister a present of it.  If the Minister wishes to make the point that it was removed in 1976 I wish to point out to him that his party gained power on a promise to create more jobs and encourage farmers to employ additional workers and for that reason he should restore it and increase it substantially. The Minister has at his disposal a lot more money than the previous Government had.  The Government have borrowed £821 million and I cannot think of any better way of spending that money than to restore that allowance and increase it substantially. <Col N="143" /> That would be an incentive to farmers to employ more people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach on 4 April last dealt with the fact that farmers' means of production were being taxed.  Exports from agricultural activities produce a great source of income for the country and farmers are doing reasonably well, and not before their time.  They are doing better than they were.  I come from a farming background and I have experience of living on a farm in bad times.  I invite those who are envious of our farmers now not to forget that for many years our farmers were poor people and their wives were slaves.  In many cases families living on farms had very little.  It is not long ago since farmers' wives were using flour bags to make all sorts of garments for themselves because of their poverty.  City dwellers and industrial workers who are envious of farmers because they are able to live reasonably well now for the first time in living memory should not forget that they were slaves long enough.  For many years they stood between the rest of the country and economic disaster, when we had nothing to export except agricultral produce.  Because we had agricultural produce to export we could buy goods from abroad such as tea, coal, steel and oil.  For many years it was the activities, sweat and underpaid labour of the farmers that provided capital to import those goods. As long as I am in public life I shall never stand idly by and listen to people sneering at the farmers as a lot of fat cats who should be skinned at every opportunity.  Their contribution to the country should be borne in mind by the Minister for the Environment when he thinks of introducing a Bill like this and by the Cabinet when they decide on farmers' taxation.</P>
    <P>I repeat that this is not a Bill to relieve agricultural land from rates; it is not a Bill that will only accept rates from farmers in part payment of income.  No, it is a Bill the only object of which is to increase a rate on agricultural land by £331.82 or 77 per <Col N="144" /> cent on poor law valuations of £70 to as high as £408.40 or 66? per cent on a valuation of £100 in 1978 and much more in 1979.  There is no use in saying anything else.  That is what it does and that is the effect of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be as brief as possible on this rather brief Bill.  I am sure the Minister is surprised that it has evoked the response it has evoked.  I should like to put on record that I think Deputy Fitzpatrick is perfectly entitled to make the criticism he has made.  He made it at length and in a way which leaves the House in no doubt as to the real purpose of this Bill.  It is only fair to the Minister for the Environment to say that he is caught between budget strategy on one hand as announced by the Minister for Finance in February and the Finance Act which is forthcoming, on the other, and that it is his sad function to act as tax gatherer on behalf of the Minister for Finance who in the budget dodged the issue of taxing farmers as a response to the promises trotted out in the famous manifesto last June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go over ground already covered but I want to take up Deputy Fitzpatrick's final theme, taxation of farmers.  I and members of my party and people who broadly might be considered to represent urban Ireland have, it is said, called for the taxation of farmers.  This is not the correct interpretation of what has always been insisted on by Labour Party members which is that farmers who can pay tax should pay tax. Farmers who are now in the position of being able to pay tax should be treated on the same basis as anybody else whose income puts him in the category of being liable to tax. Nobody to my knowledge in the farming community or in farming organisations disagrees with that.  Naturally there will be discussion and bargaining about the degree of taxation but that is normal and to be expected.  But Fianna Fáil when in Opposition attempted to suggest that if they were returned to power the taxation as proposed by the then Coalition Government would be dramatically <Col N="145" /> reduced and that all that was required was the right decision last June.</P>
    <P>We saw the budget that followed in February and the suggestion of comparatively mild proposals on taxation of incomes of farmers in the coming years.  With all due respect to the Minister for the Environment he is being made tonight to do the dirty work of the Government in general and in particular of the Minister for Finance who has dodged the issue of taxing farmers as much as his budget strategy would require him to do.  I feel a certain sympathy for the Minister for the Environment in this regard but there is an issue above and beyond the Minister's difficulties&mdash;he is well able to look after himself&mdash;there is the issue of equity.  While my party's position has been that there should be an equitable form of income taxation for farmers who have never held nor do we now hold that the rating system is an equitable form of taxation for householders or farmers.  The net effect of this Bill is to increase the rateable taxation load on land and small farmers generally.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, despite any statements that may have been made by the Minister&mdash;I was not present for his speech but I read it subsequently&mdash;there is no mention of credit against possible income tax bills.  Therefore the Bill must be taken on its face value.  So, we are left with a Bill which attempts to con from the farming community taxes and revenue which the Minister for Finance had not the courage to levy in his budget this year.  Arising from that we have the secondary result of that lack of courage and that is that the form in which this tax will be levied will be far more unjust and inequitable than any increase in income tax which could possibly have been proposed in February last.</P>
    <P>I may appear to wander slightly from the Bill but in fairness the Bill must be seen in the context of the budget speech last February and the coming Finance Bill.  It is the misfortune of the Minister for the Environment that he is here tonight in the role of tax gatherer for the Department of Finance because that is quite simply why he is presenting this Bill <Col N="146" /> when really it should be presented by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I am more than disappointed that the Minister did not take the opportunity when presenting this measure on behalf of another Minister to refer to the whole mess in which local taxation now is.  I would have expected some indication in the Minister's speech that there were thoughts or proposals or&mdash;to use some of the &ldquo;in&rdquo; phrases of the present day&mdash;task forces, working parties or special committees or think-tanks considering the whole matter of local taxation.  I do not think any Deputy can now seriously suggest that the relics of the rating system and the form of local taxation on which it is based is in any way acceptable to modern democracy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, who is now well established in the office which he holds and is surely aware of the issues confronting his large Department, must realise that this is a central issue that must be reformed and not merely tinkered with.  Regrettably, the speech introducing the Second Stage of this Bill and the statements so far from the Minister for the Environment give no indication that arising from this Bill there is going to be any change in the way in which rates are to be levied or local taxes are to be collected.  This is the second indictment that can be justifiably laid at the door of the Government.  As I have said previously, as a party and an administration they have many years of experience in Government, many years of combined wisdom among the members of different Fianna Fáil Government and administrations; yet we see no evidence whatsoever in this Bill or in the speeches from the Minister for the Environment or his Minister of State of a change in the method of levying rates.</P>
    <P>I am not going to prolong my comments on this very short Bill.  I will take a leaf out of the Minister's book in this regard, but I reiterate what I have said already, that this Bill, regrettably coming from the Minister for the Environment, is no more than a <Col N="147" /> con job on the farming community to extract from them by way of rates money which the Minister for Finance had not the courage to levy on them in his budget of last February.  In so doing they are collecting taxes in what is admitted on both sides of the House as the most inequitable form that exists.  This is dishonest and it is unjust.</P>
    <P>My second major criticism, and I am directing this at the Minister for the Environment, is that I am disappointed, to say the least, that there is absolutely no evidence or suggestion in the Minister's speech presenting this small piece of legislation, that he has any proposals whatsoever for clearing up the mess that now is local taxation. Because of the borrowing of the present Government, because of the strengthening of the £ sterling, because of a certain buoyancy in the world economy in a comparatively comfortable economic stage at the moment, we are in an expansionary stage as regards public expenditure.</P>
    <P>I say now to the Minister what I said to him in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of the Environment, that when money begins to get tight in our economy and if restraints begin to come to public expenditure the mess that is local government taxation is going to be a noose around the neck of whoever is the incumbent in the Custom House. Regrettably, there is no evidence to suggest that the Minister for the Environment or the combined wisdom of the Fianna Fáil Party is awake to that difficulty.  To conclude on that point, it is a problem that will confront any incumbent in the Custom House for the simple reason that no party or combination of parties in office in central Government will control equally every county council in the country. There are real strains implicit in that situation.  The time is running out on the honeymoon that has been enjoyed as a result of the enormous benefit of 84 seats.  To quote the closing remarks of a leading article in one of the newspapers, this is more evidence of a dreadful Government in office unfortunately, after a very short time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers, I have my views regarding the title of the Bill.  It should be titled the Abolition of the Rates Relief (1978) Bill.  The Government are reluctant to accept a reference to rates. It is impossible to discuss this Bill without referring to rates.</P>
      <P>In October 1977 a circular was sent out from the Department requesting county councils not to prepare their estimates untill they heard from the Department.  That was a most unusual procedure.  The county councils had no option but to accept that.  Some time later we were notified that we could prepare the estimates but we would have to keep the rate to a ceiling of 11 per cent on the 1976 rates.  That in itself automatically eroded the powers of the local representative.  It must be accepted by us all that the day of the striking of a rate was a sort of day of joy for the public representative. He felt at least that he had some say in the administration of his county and he felt a certain pride in that.  Now, as far as the local representative is concerned local power in local government is gone.</P>
      <P>Coming to the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1978, as it is titled, I remember before the last general election Fianna Fáil canvassers knocking on doors of farmers and telling them &ldquo;If you have not a change of Government, income tax will go up; if you do not do away with the Government who are wrapped up with socialists, the ceiling for farmers' taxation will be down to £60&rdquo;.  While we criticise the people who said that, we must say that they were right because they did bring it down to £60, and it was not a Socialist Government who brought it down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened in my country?  Nobody can be accused of being localminded when speaking about rates, and as a member of Limerick County Council I know more about that county than about any other.  The abolition of the domestic rate cost the Exchequer £1 million.  In other words, the Department will be making a contribution of £1 million to Limerick County Council.  Now as a result of the abolition of the agricultural grants on <Col N="149" /> valuations of £75 upwards-and £60 upwards from January 1979&mdash;the agricultural community will be making a contribution of £.25 million.  Instead of making a contribution of £1 million the Department are now making a contribution of £750,000.  In my view this is most unjust because we and the agricultural community are asked to accept that what we pay in rates will be set off against our income tax.  This sounds like a double-barrelled affair&mdash; if you are missed by the first you are got by the second.  In other words, if you are not caught by income tax you are caught by the agricultural tax. This means our farmers will be making a contribution of £7 million.</P>
    <P>This is dishonest because at the last general election the people were asked to vote on a certain policy and the Fianna Fáil Party handed out their policy known as the manifesto.  When I heard about the abolition of the agricultural grant the first thing I tried to find was mention of it in the manifesto, but I could not find it.  For that reason I believe the Government have been most unfair to the farming community. There is no doubt that that community resented the fact that the previous Government introduced income tax for farmers.  Their bitterness was aggravated by Fianna Fáil telling them how they were being had and how they were being wronged.  They told the people that they had a policy under which they would not have to pay income tax.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the present Minister for the Environment because the baby was handed to him.  As was mentioned earlier, this is a direct tax and the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Economic Planning and Development should have introduced this Bill. We all agree that rates are a very unfair form of taxation.  When the Coalition removed 25 per cent off the rates they did so without any tie.  The <Col N="150" /> 25 per cent was met by the Exchequer and there was no reference to anything else.</P>
    <P>Another aspect I would like to mention is what my council and most councils had to face, that is, a reduction in our estimates.  As a result of the Department's circular my council had to alter our prepared estimate by £130,000.  That money would play a major role for additional works in my county.  At the moment we have no money to do the many small jobs which come under the administration of the local authority, such as road deterioration as a result of storms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to speak on this Bill without dealing with rates.  Not alone have the Government made provision as regards the abolition of rates for 1978 but, most unusually, they have also made provision for 1979.  In two years' time agricultural rates will be abolished completely and this is only the thin end of the wedge.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out the reaction the abolition of rates will have in his own county and the same applies to every other county.  The Minister was involved in rates at one stage and has a good knowledge of them.  Perhaps the abolition of rates would not have the same impact in some counties as in others.  If a farmer is not caught in the income tax net he should not be caught in the other net either.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 April 1978.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy is not entitled to disability benefit as he does not have sufficient insurance contributions to qualify for payment of that benefit.</P>
      <P>A claim for injury benefit under the Occupational Injuries Acts was, however, received from him in January last in respect of an injury to his knee which he alleged was received in an accident at his work rendering him incapable of work from 10 December 1977.  As his employer was at that time unable to confirm that an accident had occurred, further inquiries were necessary in the matter.  These inquiries have now been completed and injury benefit has been awarded to him for the period of incapacity for work as a result of his injury, viz., 10 December 1977 to 18 February 1978.  Medical certificates received after the latter date show a cause of incapacity which is not attributable to the injury and injury benefit is not payable in respect of that incapacity.  The last medical certificate received from the claimant is dated 6 March 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending completion of inquiries regarding his entitlement to injury benefit, the claimant was paid supplementary welfare allowance which is recoupable from the amount of injury <Col N="48" /> benefit now awarded.  A cheque for the balance has been issued to the claimant.</P>
