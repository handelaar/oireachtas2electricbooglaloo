      <P>The changes mentioned by the Deputy are being looked at as part of the preparatory work on the proposed Green Paper on National Development which should be ready for publication in June.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development the reasons for the departure from the precedent of having an independent chairman of NESC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution and Terms of Reference of the National Economic and Social Council indicate that the membership of the council shall comprise a chairman appointed by the Government in consultation with the interests represented on the council.  This procedure was followed.  A number of names were canvassed and the only person who was acceptable to all the interest groups was subsequently appointed as chairman.</P>
      <P>The Government expect the new chairman to act independently in his chairmanship of the council.  I totally refute the implication in the Deputy's question that the new chairman will not act independently or that he was appointed in order to curtail the independence of the council.  There is no such intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, even though the nominated chairman is of very high calibre, the fact is that he is the secretary of a Government Department and in that sense is not independent of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that he is the secretary of a Government Department.  Could I point out that the predecessor to the NESC, the National Industrial Economic Council, was for many years chaired by Senator Whitaker, who was then secretary of a Government Department, and I do not recall a suggestion at any stage that he failed to act independently or fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that that previous body is not the same as this body because this is a much wider body which was set up with the intention of providing a forum for discussion and to give advice to the Government.  From the <Col N="997" /> public's point of view, it would be much more desirable if it was seen that the chairman was independent of the Government themselves.  I want to be quite careful and say that the man in question is a man of extremely high calibre and the Minister is lucky to have him as secretary of his Department, but at the same time he is too near the Government to be seen to act independently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that because the present body has a wider membership it is in any way more entitled to free and independent discussion than its predecessor.  I am sure the Deputy did not imply that but nonetheless there was the inference that because it was a more broadly based council than its predecessor that in some sense&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that the terms of reference of its predecessor also entitled it to offer advice, opinions and so forth to the Government.  I want to make the point that because the present body comprises a wider range of representative groups, it is more difficult to reach agreement on the chairman.  If you asked my preference it would be that we would prefer to get somebody who would be clearly seen to be totally independent and at arm's length from the Government, but I have to say that the only person acceptable to all the interest groups from the many names put forward was the name of the person appointed as chairman.</P>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, arising from the discussions at the recent European Council on unemployment in the European Economic Community, if he is satisfied that the Government's unemployment reduction target for 1978, as outlined in its White Paper <i>National Development 1977-80</i> will be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The EEC discussion recognised the need for higher growth in the Community as a precondition for reducing unemployment. This is consistent with the view taken by the Government here from the outset and Government policies have been geared to achieve a 7 per cent GNP growth rate this year which is substantially above the expected average for the EEC as a whole.  The Government aim to reduce the numbers out of work by 20,000 in 1978 and the White Paper on National Development outlined the strategy and conditions for reaching this target.  I am satisfied that we are on course for achieving the proposed reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether he accepts the estimated rate of growth as forecast by the Central Bank as being 5½ per cent as compared with 7 per cent in the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is by inference related to the reference of a 7 per cent target mentioned in my reply. On the basic indicators growth in output, whether it is for industry, building and construction, agriculture, exports, imports and so on, on the whole there is a very high degree of similarity between the forecasts of the Central Bank and that prepared by the Government.  The main points of difference are that the Central Bank forecast a faster rate of growth in imports than the Government forecast and they also forecast a slower rate of growth in agricultural stocks.  While these differences affect the forecast for the measure of growth in GNP, they have no significant effect on the forecasts for employment which are the primary purpose of the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister still expect that the unemployment figure shown by the live register as now compiled will be reduced to approximately 85,000 by the end of the current year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that.  I thought we had that discussion at the time of the publication of the White Paper several months ago when I made clear that there was not a direct simple one-to-one relationship between increases in the numbers of people at work and reductions in the numbers of people registered as unemployed on the live register.  If we needed a crude working relationship, the available evidence appears to suggest that every increase in employment of say 100 was accompanied by a fall of between 50 to 65 in the numbers on the live register. Therefore, meeting the targets set by the Government of a 20,000 increase in numbers at work, that is a reduction in the numbers out of work, does not imply a fall of 20,000 in the numbers on the live register.  I have said that on several previous occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what he anticipates the live register will be at the end of the year using the same criteria he used when compiling the figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Depending on which of the figures one takes, the ratio of 50 per 100 or 65 per 100, we <Col N="1000" /> would be talking of figures for the live register by the end of the year of somewhere in the region of about 92,000 to 100,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Using the figures the Minister has given, or accepted as being approximately accurate, the total increase in employment has been approximately 14,000 according to the answer given by the Minister last week, the numbers coming onto the work force are approximately 14,000 to 15,000 and the numbers emigrating, which the Minister has also accepted as being approximately accurate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is trying to quote a reply which I gave to the House last Thursday when I said that for the last 12 months the best estimate we had was that there had been an increase of 14,000 in the numbers at work.  I stand over that estimate as the best available one, but that tells us nothing about whether we are or are not on course for our target, neither does it relate to the level of employment for last July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>) asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that a firm (details supplied) in County Cavan, a wholly Irish undertaking which took over another failed company and saved many jobs, is having serious difficulty regarding the payment of sub-stantial interest on VAT in respect of accounts which are still outstanding due to normal trade credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been so informed by the Revenue Commissioners.  The firm's difficulty does not arise from VAT but apparently from trade credit terms afforded to customers.  A solution could not therefore be appropriately sought in the VAT area. While the Revenue Commissioners have approached the present case sympathetically, no trader could realistically expect that he be allowed to solve what are essentially trading <Col N="1003" /> problems at Exchequer expense by a practice of undue delays in payments of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I assume that the Minister is aware that this firm's predecessor went out of business with a loss of 120 jobs, that a number of local people took over the undertaking and saved 105 jobs, and that they are giving normal credit terms, but because they are forced to pay VAT before they receive payment for their goods in the ordinary course of credit, they are charged a substantial amount of interest on the VAT.  Would the Minister be prepared to take steps to waive the interest?  That is what is involved in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more than that involved.  The Revenue Commissioners cannot undertake to waive permanently interest on VAT because if they were prepared to do it in this case they would have to be prepared to do it in all other cases.  They have tried to assist this firm within the constraints that apply to the Revenue Commissioners and have made helpful suggestions. The basic problem for this firm is that they give long terms of trade credit, and it may be that, having regard to the fact that their customers are entitled, on receiving an invoice, to claim the amount of VAT due off their liability, the firm could insist on a shorter period of credit at least in relation to the VAT they are charging on the invoices.  This would get over their difficulties to some extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Is the Minister aware that in order to stay in business this firm have to give attractive credit terms?  They have to fight the importation and virtual dumping of foreign baths here, and they also have to compete with the placing of contracts by Government Departments for housing schemes, with foreign firms, and that all these things make it very difficult for this firm to carry on.  If the Minister would either give them the interest-free VAT, prevent dumping, or insist that public contracts are placed with Irish firms this firm would <Col N="1004" /> not have some of the problems they have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, the question of dumping or the placing of public contracts, presumably by local authorities and/or agencies under the Department of the Environment, is not a matter for me and I cannot, therefore, comment on the Deputy's statement.  My lack of comment is not to be taken as an acceptance of the statement made by the Deputy.  I am concerned with the VAT liability.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates that we cannot tailor the VAT system to suit the circumstances of individual firms and as I have pointed out, the difficulties that arise for this firm do not benefit the Exchequer but rather they benefit their customers.  I have suggested one method that might be of some assistance and the Revenue Commissioners have made suggestions which could be of assistance, but the Deputy must appreciate that the solution to the problems of this firm cannot be found within the VAT system which has to be a general system applying to all taxpayers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the regulation establishing the regional fund the assistance received from the fund may be used either to supplement national aid given to individual investments or may remain credited to the public authorities as partial repayment of national aid, with the aim of helping the authorities to finance additional investment.  As the Deputies are aware, it is the second of these methods which has been used in Ireland, receipts from the fund being applied to the financing of increases in the public capital programme. I am satisfied that there are, in fact, valid reasons why it would not make good sense to use the moneys received from the fund to &ldquo;top up&rdquo; the amount of national aid already given to the limited number of projects that can be put forward for fund assistance.</P>
      <P>However, my main concern in the statements referred to in the question was that the arrangements for administration of the fund should be such as to demonstrate clearly that moneys received are used to finance additional investment, especially in the areas of greatest need, and are not simply being retained by the Exchequer.  I am still not convinced that the existing arrangements are the best way of achieving this objective and at my request the matter is being re-examined by my Department.  This re-examination cannot be completed until the review of the fund regulation which is currently taking place at Community level has been finalised.</P>

      <P>Medical cards are issued to persons with full eligibility for health services, that is, persons who are unable to afford general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.  An adult person who, because he or any of his dependants suffers from cystic fibrosis, is unable to provide general practitioner services for himself or his dependants is eligible for a medical card.  Further, a person who does not satisfy the standard criteria of eligibility for a medical card may still be eligible for free treatment for a specific condition in himself or in any of his dependants if the chief executive officer of the health board considers that the <Col N="1011" /> cost of such treatment would represent undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Cystic fibrosis is one of the long-term diseases for which children may get free hospital services.  In addition, all persons suffering from that disease may obtain free of charge the drugs and medicines necessary for its treatment.</P>
      <P>I consider in the circumstances that there is adequate provision to ensure that persons suffering from cystic fibrosis are enabled to secure the treatment they require without financial hardship.</P>

      <P>Under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1948, health boards are obliged to make available a diagnostic and treatment service for all persons suffering from the scheduled infectious diseases, including brucellosis. The diagnostic service does not include general practitioner services but all other necessary diagnostic and treatment facilities are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations provide that no charge may be made by health boards for such services provided by them except where the service in question is an institutional service provided in a <Col N="1012" /> private or semi-private ward or is otherwise of a type for which it is customary to make an extra charge.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a similar question on 29 November last, the policy is to continue with the implementation of the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Task Force on Child Care Services.</P>
      <P>The following is the present position with regard to the implementation of the recommendations:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  I indicated in reply to a parliamentary question on 13 October 1977 that I am in favour of the establishment of a national registration council <Col N="1014" /> for social workers.  This body would also have functions in relation to child care workers.  In the interim, arrangements have been made to ensure that appropriate professional recognition continues to be given to the relevant courses.  I outlined in a reply to a question on 11 April 1978 the present position with regard to the arrangements for the training of child care workers.</P>
    <P>2.  Neighbourhood youth projects have been established in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  The staffing arrangements have been completed and the projects will be fully under way by the end of June.</P>
    <P>3.  Five new residential units for the care of very young children have been completed at Madonna House, Blackrock.</P>
    <P>4.  Planning of improved facilities at St. Joseph's Special School, Clonmel, is at an advanced stage.  It is hoped that the necessary work will commence within a few months.</P>
    <P>5.  Additional accommodation for homeless boys in the Dublin area has been acquired by the Los Angeles Society, with the aid of grants from the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>6.  The question of the overall residential provision to be made for severely disturbed boys and girls is still under consideration.  Preliminary planning of an assessment and residential unit for girls, to be located in Cork, has, however, commenced.</P>
    <P>7.  A new unit to provide intensive care for acutely emotionally deprived boys and girls is under construction at Warrenstown House and is expected to be completed before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>8.  Planning of a special school to cater for boys who cannot be coped with in existing institutions is almost completed.  It is hoped to invite tenders for the building of the school by the end of June.</P>
    <P>9.  The project team which has been responsible for the planning of the special school for boys will now carry out the planning of residential accommodation and an assessment unit for girls in a similar category.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> 10.  Trudder House, Newtownmountkennedy, which is an open residential centre for homeless travelling children, has been purchased and is now being extended to enable it to cater for up to 20 children.  In addition, a special day centre, with educational facilities, to cater for children of travelling families with special problems has been opened in Dublin.  It is hoped to extend the centre so that it can cater for a greater number of children and provide supportive services for the parents.</P>

It seems as if he is rather frightened of the problems and does not intend to take any serious steps about them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to bear in mind the fundamental purpose, within the budget strategy of the Government, of the Finance Bill itself, namely to provide the State with sufficient tax revenue to meet current Government expenditure.  It is basically on that criterion that we must assess the effectiveness or otherwise of the Finance Bill this year.  On the basis of the 1978 budget the total amount for central Government tax revenue this year is estimated at £1,650 million.  The total Government expenditure on current services this year will amount to £2,368 million. This data was made available to us at the time of the budget, and midway through the year it does not seem as though there has been any major divergence as yet from the forecasts of the budget, although it does look as though expenditure on the public national programme will be somewhat less, as it takes longer to get through the bureaucracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the Minister for Health and Social Welfare here today. it was quite evident that the Government next year will certainly face a crisis on public expenditure.  When one bears in mind that expenditure on the health service, the social service and education represents about 45 per cent of total Government expenditure, the magnitude of the problems facing the Government in the next budget and certainly in the 1980 budget becomes quite apparent.  Therefore, I regard <Col N="1063" /> the budget, notwithstanding the electoral promises made by the Fianna Fáil Party to win the general election, as being one of serious irresponsibility, of squandering a major opportunity of getting the central finances of the State on to a more rational basis.</P>
    <P>The Government have missed an opportunity of taking radical steps in the reform of Government expenditure. Unfortunately, falling into the besetting sin of politicians, we tend to take short-term expedients, and the Fianna Fáil Party took a very short-term expedient in the budget of this year, and they are faced with a fundamental problem in the middle of 1978 now that the initial preparation is going on in the Government Departments who are now forecasting their expenditure for 1979.  They are now slowly sending up to the Department of Finance their estimates of expenditure for next year, and there is no way that next year's Finance Bill can face that problem without massive unpopular and most difficult alternatives.  We have the kind of nonsense which is tossed out here by, for example, the Minister for Health and Social Welfare in relation to his proposal that he will bring in next year, 1979, a pay-related system of social insurance and health contributions. Everybody in the Department of Finance and on the Revenue Commissioners' side are aware that they will be damn lucky if they are able to bring it in within another 12 months or even two years after April 1979.  I cannot see that dateline being met even in the legislative sense, and the Government's legislative programme at the moment is non-existent, by the middle of next year it certainly will not be very much better. There are alternatives.  There is the alternative which the Government will have to face next year of serious increases in the ordinary excise duty, increases in, say, the price of petrol, beer and cigarettes and increases in income tax on a selective basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will sum up that aspect of my contribution by saying to the Government that this Finance Bill must be viewed in the context of the overall budgetary strategy of the Government and that that strategy as enunciated in this year's Finance Bill is obviously a very short-term expedient.  I foresee major changes in the years ahead, particularly in relation to VAT and in increases in relation to income tax, as being the only prospect of getting out of the financial mess that they are slowly drifting into in terms of public expenditure.</P>
      <P>Dealing with some other aspects of the Bill, I suggest that the Finance Bill does not deal with a number of other very real issues.  The real issue facing this Dáil concerns the employment question and not the relatively minor palliatives which the Bill contains. The Finance Bill should have been geared towards employment creation and should not have been preoccupied with, for example, the question of the abolition of wealth tax.  Inherent in the Bill should have been some aspects of assisting productive investment instead of, for instance, the abolition of tax in respect of farming co-operatives.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Very little more bearing in mind the needs of the nation.  The real political issues are not dealt with.  Having been indulging for the past eleven months in what might be called Opposition-watching of the front bench, I doubt the capacity of many members of the Government to come to grips with those problems. There is no serious attempt in the Finance Bill to deal with the serious problem of taxation generally. That is an aspect that I wish to deal with in particular and it is strictly within the rules of the debate of a Finance Bill since there is involved the question of income tax and of taxation generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is self-evident that we need a more just taxation system.  The present system has failed to bring about any <Col N="1065" /> real equity between the better off and the poorer sections.  After ten years experience of this House it is my view that there has been only very little systematic study commissioned by successive Governments for the purpose of determining the real impact of taxation on the different income groups. There has not been laid before the House in any contribution to any Finance Bill an indication of the real benefits accruing to different income groups from social and public expenditure and from taxation provisions.  The impact of total taxation on relatively lower-paid workers remains very much regressive.  The abolition of rates and of road tax will not diminish that regression in any way.  In 1977-78 the net receipts in respect of PAYE totalled £460 million and the estimated receipts last year of income tax payable in respect of farming profits were a mere £14 million.  There is massive scope for reform of the general income taxation system.  The more I listen to the Minister for Finance, to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development or to any other spokesman on the Fianna Fáil benches the more sceptical I become of their having the courage that is required to deal with the serious issue of income tax.  I have no evidence that would lead me to believe that during the lifetime of this Dáil this Government will have the kind of political courage that is necessary to deal with this question. The incidence of taxation&mdash;the way in which we gather revenue for public expenditure&mdash;is the essence of economic and social planning and no amount of public relations on the part of the Government can obscure the real issue.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect that must be borne in mind and that is that many recipients of relatively low incomes, including some social welfare recipients, are liable to income tax.  We tend to ignore that situation.  Contrary to popular misconceptions and to the blatant prejudices that exist in our community with regard to people in receipt of social welfare payments, many people who are not very much above the poverty line have a liability to income tax.  This is an outrageous situation as also is the element of <Col N="1066" /> prejudice that exists on the part of some of those who work towards people who are not working.  Often there is the attitude that people out of work lack incentive and, consequently, are not deserving of much sympathy. Such prejudice exists among politicians too.  However, what is needed is a major and political effort to raise the basic levels of liability for income taxation to levels a good deal in excess of current thresholds so that those in relatively lower income groups will not be unduly penalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One finds on looking at the overall situation that there was no marked improvement this year. Broadly speaking we are back to the situation as it was about 1970, having regard to inflation and the adjustments that have been made.  Between 1969 and 1972 there was only one major adjustment in income tax threshold levels.</P>

      <P>Certainly, there are income tax provisions in the Bill and in that regard there has been no adjustment in respect of children's allowances since about 1972.  Inequality remains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must take another area which leaves a gap in the Finance Bill.  I had hoped that some consideration would have been given to the escalating prices of building land and that in the Bill there would have been a counterbalancing influence which would have <Col N="1067" /> eased the current critical situation. It is obvious that the nation faces a serious housing crisis.  Notwithstanding the efforts both of past Governments and of the present Government, there remains an urgent need for more and better houses, especially in the rapidlyexpanding urban areas.</P>
    <P>We have a higher marriage rate and younger and larger population.  In that situation it is quite staggering that there is no attempt within the framework of the Finance Bill to deal with the huge increase in the cost of building land in recent years.  House prices are now going up by something in the region of 2 per cent month and there has been an increase of 20 per cent during the past 12 months.  Some building firms are making a lot of money through speculating at the general expense of the community, while their contribution in income tax is relatively low.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting into the area of housing and this is a matter for another Minister.  He is entitled to suggest that there should be some provision in the Finance Bill to control land prices but he may not go outside that.  We are dealing only with taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the Finance Bill there should be a provision to deal with this matter, something better than simply handing out £1,000 tax free without any effort being made to curb speculation within the house construction sector.  This is a matter of serious concern, particularly since inflation generally has come down to around 8 per cent.  We wish to stress this point to the House and it must be repeatedly pinpointed by the Opposition during this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The normal expectation is that the Finance Bill would ensure a fairer general distribution of income.  I suggest that this Bill does not live up in any way to that prospect.  I have recently been reading a study of the distribution of income in Ireland carried out by Brian Nolan, the Central Bank economist.  In relation to disposable income, it is very disturbing to see that more than 75 per cent of total household <Col N="1068" /> gross income went to 50 per cent of the households in the Republic in 1973, thus leaving less than 25 per cent to be distributed among the other 50 per cent.  There are many other startling aspects of that study.  It is pointed out that more than 25 per cent of total gross income was taken up by the top 10 per cent of households, while the bottom 10 per cent of households got less than 2 per cent; to be precise, they got 1.5 per cent.  That is the kind of analysis which any political party must find most disturbing, certainly in relation to income tax concessions and the other concessions contained in the Finance Bill, particularly the wealth tax.  I regret that no effort is being made within the Finance Bill to deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>The other major issue in the Finance Bill concerns the wealth tax.  I do not think I would be going outside the brief in dealing with it at this stage. Fianna Fáil certainly fulfilled their promise before the general election to abolish the tax, although they have yet to bring in the Bill.  I cannot see it passing through this House before the end of this session and probably we will not have the opportunity until before Christmas to formally debate the wealth tax.  I regard this provision as being one of the most unfortunate and reactionary provisions ever contained in a Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I recall very well that in the year or two before the Coalition Government came into office there was a tremendous demand for the abolition of estate duty and this demand was founded on very genuine grievances. During the years between 1969 and 1972 a number of people in my constituency who had small or mediumsized businesses or some property, came to me.  They were being crippled because of the requirement to pay estate duty.  There was a great deal of evidence in the late sixties and early seventies that there were a few large wealthy holders of money who were availing of general avoidance systems. We in the Labour Party listened with sympathy, as did Fine Gael, to these grievances.  If we had done absolutely nothing and just kept the existing <Col N="1069" /> system of estate duty we would now be drawing in about £25 million a year. We set out on an effort of reform and it was sabotaged right down the line by three or four Front Bench members of Fianna Fáil.  When we assumed office we even pointed out to Fianna Fáil that estate duty was levied at rates from 1 per cent on £7,500 to 55 per cent on over £200,000.  As an alternative, we went on to introduce a very mild, rather moderate and rather expensively administered wealth tax, which yielded a moderate amount of tax.</P>
    <P>All we got for our pains&mdash;I suppose all is fair in politics&mdash;was a general vituperation from the then Minister for Finance.  As I said when I spoke in this debate on the previous occasion, unfortunately Deputy Ryan, then Minister for Finance, was much maligned in his efforts.  I recall very well the contribution made by Deputy Fitzpatrick, <i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>, who supported him very strongly.  Deputy Fitzpatrick, in a tremendous performance in defence of the Government, said the following at column 2279, Volume 281 of the Official Report of 10 June 1975:</P>
    <P>In the light of that let us have a look at the type of tax that is going to ruin this country and chase capital out of it and prevent industrialists from coming in.  The threshold of this tax is £70,000 for a single man, £90,000 for a widow and £100,000 for a married couple. The residence and the contents are exempt.  Speaking of the kind of people we are talking about, we could put the value of the house and the contents in most cases somewhere between £30,000 and £50,000, certainly in Dublin city.  On top of that there is an allowance for each child under the age of 21 of £2,500. Four children.  £10,000.  That amounts to about £150,000 free gratis and for nothing.  Then one pays at the rate of 1 per cent over and above that.</P>
    <P>I agreed very much with the contribution of Deputy Fitzpatrick Regrettably the other Deputy Fitzpatrick, then in Opposition, was part of the Fianna Fáil opposition circus and it <Col N="1070" /> certainly was a circus at the time. Deputy Fitzpatrick, <i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>, went on to say:</P>
    <P>The difference between that and the death duties we are abolishing was that once one was in for anything one was in for all.</P>
    <P>He also stated that the National Coalition would replace the system of exemption up to £7,500 existing when Fianna Fáil left office and once and for all would get to grips with estates and death duties.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for profound regret that for extremely short-term political expediency Fianna Fáil dived onto a bandwagon of a few hundred people who decided that since they never paid income tax they would not pay wealth tax either.  That was a major mistake by Fianna Fáil.  Even though it got them a lot of money for their election funds and a lot of support from certain quarters that they would not have got otherwise.  It has destroyed for the next three or four years&mdash; may be even for all time&mdash;any prospect of introducing a rational system of capital taxation.  If we had done nothing about the existing system in 1973-74, today we would have an income of £25-£30 million per year without any reform.  Instead we set out to reform the system and we finished up literally dismantling it and produced a rational capital taxation structure.  At that time many arguments were put forward against reform.  the most important being that capital would fly out of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will come to that point.  This is where there is a certain rational ideological dispute between the Government and the Opposition.  It appears that at the time in question Fianna Fáil were very happy with the situation where people left this country for the Isle of Man or elsewhere with liquid cash or transferred their cash abroad.  They appreciated, understood and even sympathised with those people who acted in that way.  I have often wondered <Col N="1071" /> what kind of patriotism Fianna Fáil were espousing at that time. People were virtually encouraged to transfer their liquid assets out of the country helter-skelter.  Apparently these assets were being used so productively on behalf of the Irish nation and were so tied up in hotels, factories, machinery and other facets of production that the people concerned were able to export the money overnight.  That strikes me as extraordinary. A few well-publicised individuals said that if the wealth tax were abolished they would come back and reinvest their money here.  One individual engaged in the motor trade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The person concerned has been sunning himself in Marbella in Spain for the past few years and he will continue doing that.  He could not care less about Fianna Fáil and his contribution in terms of productive capital formation is nil.</P>
      <P>There have been quite a few of those extraordinary Irish exiles who fled the country.  I have many articles here about such people&mdash;the Marquis of this and the Earl of that.

Members of Fianna Fáil spoke on the matter at great length and it is quite proper and fair that we analyse this massive concern of Fianna Fáil and try to find out where the money has come from.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil also alleged that the wealth tax would act as a major disincentive to foreign investment.  Looking back on the returns for 1976-77 we know that in that period we had the greatest single growth of foreign investment in the history of the State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not happened in Britain because there has been a minority Labour Government in office for the past few years.  No minority Government, depending on a few esoteric Liberal votes, are likely to introduce a wealth tax.  If the British Labour Party had a substantial majority in government they would certainly have brought in a wealth tax.  I do not believe they will get the opportunity of introducing it because they will be in severe difficulty even in the next government.  One must criticise the specious assumptions of the Fianna Fáil Party that if we abolish this tax the wealthiest sections of the community in the country will generate tremendous growth and new employment and become enmeshed in the employment generation process in the country.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence at the moment that such is the outcome from the decision of the Fianna Fáil Party to abolish wealth tax.  The evidence is to the contrary.  The private sector are now saying that it is not their responsibility to generate employment.  They will do their best to make money but they are not responsible for this particular prospect which the Government hold out.  There is no evidence to suggest that the wealth tax is a disincentive to industry or to the creation of employment.  I hold the contrary view, that the very introduction of this tax shifted resources from less productive areas of the economy to those of more productive potential.  On the grounds of social equity there was no justification whatsoever for the decision of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems utterly strange to me that the Fianna Fáil Party are now welcoming back those poverty stricken tax exiles from Hong Kong and other places.  They must be deeply upset that some of the lords and marquises have decided not to return.  The country will get on without them and their peculiar brand of patriotism in running out of the country when they should have stayed here and made their contribution of perhaps £1,000 a year if they <Col N="1074" /> had £500,000.  If such a person had any tax liability he would probably finish up paying much less than that.  Such was the Fianna Fáil pandering for power, that they must get back at any cost, that they dived in at this prospect and they sold their republicanism short or whatever sense of neo-republicanism they had left.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about other aspects of income tax and to refer to the lack of any reference in the Finance Bill to banking profits.  In relation to the provisions made by the Minister in the Bill I feel that we will have a situation of increasing demand by many sectors of the community and many women will not go out to work and will not have the opportunity, because of the high unemployment rate, of engaging in remunerative employment.  We must face the situation of mothers who work in their homes and who do not receive any remuneration other than the children's allowance.  We must consider radical reforms in this area.  At the last Labour Party conference I suggested one particular reform which did not arouse much interest.  I favoured the amalgamation of the children's allowance and the PAYE income tax child's allowance into a direct payment to the mother who works in the home.</P>
    <P>This would mean that we would have a mother's allowance, a direct cash payment to the mother.  Every married man who fills in an income tax form claims for his wife, gives his wife's name and the names of his children.  I believe that that PAYE tax allowance for children should be paid directly to the mother who works in the home.  One of the peculiarities of our social structure, which I became aware of in meeting my constituents every Saturday morning and Sunday, is that when the wage earner receives his wages every week he hands over a certain amount of money to his wife.  She has to do with that cash payment if she is not engaged in outside employment and just works at home.  In addition, she gets the children's allowance every month, which is very meagre.  I believe that the income tax allowance <Col N="1075" /> given to the wife who remains at home.  I have four children and I get an allowance of £960 a year PAYE from my Houses of the Oireachtas salary.  My wife works at home.  I would not have any great objection to that allowance I get built into my salary cheque each month being paid direct to my wife in the form of a State allowance.  It would be more egalitarian, fair and, above all, would meet a situation in society whereby in a substantial number of instances the allowances which the husband receives for his children through the PAYE system&mdash;quite a few husbands do not pass it on in terms of ensuring that their families have a sufficient income on which to live&mdash;do not go to them.</P>
    <P>That is a reform which would not cost money because, presumably, we will have no more reforms of income tax in the next budget.  I think we have had the last of any increases in tax allowances in the last budget. Next year we will just be marking time because the Government will not have any money to hand out.  Therefore we must devise methods of making the existing system just.  I would suggest that as a particular method for consideration by the Minister.  I have thought about the matter only in principle. Of course the day-to-day practicalities of the change-over are something which might prove to be an entirely different matter.  Nevertheless it is of some considerable importance that at least we think along those lines.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Finance Bill with which I am concerned is that within its confines no effort has been made whatsoever to come to grips with the situation in relation to the commercial banks.  As citizens, particularly those of us with overdrafts, we are acutely aware of the fact that notwithstanding high unemployment, the recession, banking profits did extraordinarily well.  I am well aware that under successive Finance Bills a substantial proportion of these profits go back to the Exchequer, for example, in relation to the recent profits announced by Allied Irish Banks when 37 per cent of their profits went back <Col N="1076" /> which the husband receives should be in tax; fair enough.  Nevertheless there must be some concern about a total cartel situation and uniformity of interest rates in which banking profits have rocketed by 26 per cent in the case of the Bank of Ireland group, up to £43 million in the past accounting year and, in the case of the Allied Irish group by 45 per cent to £35 million.</P>
    <P>I believe that, within the Finance Bill, greater control and influence should be exerted, through the Central Bank, on the role of the commercial banks in economic development.  We are dealing with a situation in which, whether it be mortgage rates, interest rates&mdash;and admittedly we are caught by the constraints of parity with sterling&mdash;there is a tremendous reluctance on the part of the Government to ensure that the Central Bank avails of its statutory powers to play a more interventionist role in controlling the behaviour of the commercial banks. I have strong views in that regard. One is faced with a situation in which it is difficult to envisage the commercial banks being controlled and influenced because, as we know, there are commercial directors on the board of the Central Bank, so it is interlocked in a very definite way.  But I hold that the statutory role of the Central Bank under the Finance and Central Bank Acts should be the welfare of our people.  It has at its disposal a wide range of very powerful monetary instruments particularly in relation to the control of interest rates. Yet I do not believe that the Central Bank has performed to the degree that it could.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is certainly getting away from the Bill now.  We can discuss banking and taxation but not the whole setup of banking in the country; that is for another time and another measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is where I come to a deficiency inherent in the Finance Bill.  The very day on which we are discussing the Finance Bill here, we practically have a mini-budget in relation to interest rates.  Since the commercial banks are in a most <Col N="1077" /> sensitive position to influence the economy and indeed the management role of the Government, and since their actions can be very much to the detriment of the ordinary worker and consumer I would call for greater State influence over them.  I hold strong views on this matter because I do not believe in what I might call elitism in the management of the economy.  I do not believe in the empire which is being built up.  I have strong views looking back over the years&mdash;for example, if one takes the period from 1972 to 1977 our commercial banks were busy building office blocks instead of putting their money into more productive capital formation in this country and the Central Bank did not do anything about it.  At the time the Central Bank did have power.  I am concerned that we should not have a rash of similar developments here and that, if you like, before the horse escapes once again we should raise the matter in this House even in this very limited way on the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>I might make one or two final points in relation to the Finance Bill itself. The Minister for Finance, in his introductory comments on the Bill, spoke about its role in generating a climate of confidence particularly in private enterprise here.  Again I hold the view that his contribution was extremely limited.  Indeed the contribution of his party in this area is now so circumscribed that its long-term influence will be extraordinarily small.</P>
      <P>We have a situation in which, on the one hand, some members of the Government believe exclusively in a private enterprise economy.  Other members of the Government just do not believe that and others still support a view that one should have a mixed economy here.  I will give two very brief examples in that regard.  We had the statement&mdash;which is virtually the whole economic strategy of the Government&mdash;last month of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to the Cork Chamber of Commerce when he said that the whole strategy for development hinges to a great extent on the private sector as there will have to be a progressive reduction in State borrowing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to engage in any recriminations on this but I want to point out that the Minister for Finance in his opening speech on this Bill dealt quite definitely with this aspect.  If the Minister for Finance was in order, in my view the other Members of this House are equally in order.  I do not want to delay the House unduly on it.  That strategy has been flogged to death by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>Then we had the Minister for Health and Social Welfare coming into the House in an entirely different contribution, on 14 February last, when he said that the central argument should be whether, in the modern context, private enterprise can deliver.  He had the gravest of doubts about the prospects of private enterprise delivering to that extent under Government strategy.  That is the purpose of the Finance Bill&mdash;to give this great confidence. We in the Labour Party would favour, by and large, a mixed economy approach.  But one cannot see any prospect of full employment unless we have what I describe as a tripod development, a structure in which the public enterprise sector will grow, in which private enterprise will have its place and in which agriculture will simultaneously develop so that with development on three or four different levels more employment will be created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much taken aback at the continued reliance by the Fianna Fáil Party on the private sector almost exclusively to generate employment. To put it bluntly, the job creation capacity of the private sector is extraordinarily limited.  The Minister in his budget asserted that by providing incentives to the private sector more jobs would be created.  This is an erroneous assumption.  Unlike a number <Col N="1079" /> of my colleagues in the Labour Movement who constantly harp on the failure of the private sector to provide full employment I do not make any such fashionable condemnation of that sector because it does not provide jobs. I do not believe its dominant function is to provide full employment.  It has never postulated that as its function. I have yet to meet any major figure in the private enterprise sector who says his function is to create jobs. Those engaged in the private sector only adopt that role if it is devolved on them by some Government Ministers and by some in Opposition also. There are some who would devolve such a function exclusively on the private sector.  By doing so certain responsibility is escaped and this device has, of course, been massively resorted to by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Most businessmen I have met give a rather low priority to job creation. They maintain that they are engaged in producing goods and services and their main object is to make as much money as they can for themselves and their shareholders.  If in that process they create jobs they are delighted to do so.  Many of them have a social conscience and give good employment at decent trade union rates of pay, but they do not regard themselves, despite the Fianna Fáil manifesto, as having any responsibity for creating jobs.  Most employers in the private sector regard it as their job to employ as few workers as possible with the most efficient possible system of production so that they can export and in that way run their businesses successfully.</P>
    <P>This may all seem very simplistic but it is time we faced the reality. It is time we acknowledged the situation, because most businessmen readily acknowledge that if in the process of production they provide more employment that is fine, but it is not their sole motivation in getting involved in the productive process in the first instance. There is perhaps a little double thinking because most businessmen take the view that the State should provide substantial subsidies and tax concessions so that they can maintain <Col N="1080" /> employment.  I do not particularly dispute that view but we have to be very careful not to set up the proposition that it is the function of private enterprise to manufacture this massive three-stage rocket of the Minister for Finance.  I think we are now in the second stage and I suppose we will enter the third stage in next year's budget.  If we set up that proposition and it fails we will then have depression. We must use our sense of perspective.</P>
    <P>Where exactly does the responsibility lie?  In my opinion it lies in a mixed economy.  It lies very clearly in the first instance primarily with the Government.  It is in the proper day-to-day management of the economy and the Government's capital programme, plus the incentives provided to private enterprise that success lies. It is bound up in a whole range of economic strategy and fiscal policy which provide a proper sense of direction so that private enterprise knows where it is going, the public sector makes its contribution, agriculture makes its contribution and public servants make their contribution.  It is in that sense we will have proper political leadership.</P>
    <P>A mixed economy is the best suited to this country.  I do not believe in the O'Donoghue-Colley private enterprise economy.  It is too narrow a prospect for proper economic and social growth.  I do not believe&mdash;I will be blunt about it&mdash;in an exclusively State enterprise orientated economy.  There are some who subscribe to this doctrine who would nationalise their mothers-in-law to provide jobs.  That is not a sound basis for economic and social progress.  It is too narrow.  Neither do I believe in an exclusively private enterprise economy, being relied on so massively now by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  I suggest there is an alternative.  It is the alternative of a dynamic mixed economy, admittedly an export oriented economy. I see nothing wrong with a vigorous private enterprise economy. I see nothing wrong in State enterprise, commercial and non-commercial, directly encouraged to expand, get <Col N="1081" /> out into the world and prosper.  I certainly favour a prosperous and very efficient agricultural sector.  That is why I welcome the outcome of the Brussels negotiations.  I favour a responsible and healthy building sector and I admit there were incentives in the budget for the construction industry.</P>
    <P>These are to me the legs of development and I am gravely concerned because I do not see in a Government 11 months in office any sensitivity towards what I call the development and growth of the State enterprise sector.  I have always advocated that there should not be so many commercial constraints on the State enterprise sector.  I have never favoured the kind of commercial constraints imposed on the ESB, for instance, by successive Ministers for Finance and Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>I should like to see that company expanding on a much more effective basis.  There are many other areas of enterprise which other State companies could develop.  For example, we now have a vacuum situation in relation to Bord na Móna in the midland peat bog development.  They should be encouraged to take off in that area on a substantial development plan.</P>
    <P>My advocacy of growth in public sector enterprises is not based on any uncritical acceptance of abstract political views but on the basis that at the moment there is an accepted preoccupation on the part of the Government with the development of private enterprise, and I do not believe that will meet the future needs of the country.  If out of conservatism or as a result of pressure from vested interests, Fianna Fáil adhere exclusively to that kind of approach, full employment will not be realised as a target. It will fade like other such pipe dreams and our young people can pack their bags and fade into the night and on to the emigrant ships, and that is not a process I wish to see developing.</P>
    <P>I am not under any illusions that in a number of public sector areas there is a sluggish concept of enterprise. Very often there is not a great lot of entrepreneur ability among them: they just drag on from day to <Col N="1082" /> day in guaranteed employment.  They do their jobs.  Therefore I should like to see a new vigour being displayed in that area and being encouraged by the Government.</P>
    <P>I have massive reservations about the relevance of this Finance Bill from the point of view of these matters.  There have been many major economic developments since the Bill was circulated.  There is an important section in the Bill relating to farmer taxation.  Since the circulation of the Bill, farm price discussions in Brussels have been concluded and the taxation of certain farm incomes by this Bill must be viewed in that context.  I, and I am sure most Deputies, welcome the successful outcome of the protracted Brussels negotiations but I would make a follow-through point, namely, that the benefits of such agricultural supports should not accrue exclusively to any one section of the community, not even the agricultural section.  The consumer has the right to benefit.  I do not in any way support, nor do the vast majority of my colleagues, any concept of a cheap food policy.  I believe our farmers should get the highest possible prices abroad for their produce, but I equally hold the view that having got that money from abroad they should pay their fair share of taxes through the Finance Bill and that some of that taxation should go towards an effective food subsidy system.  Whether we subsidise milk, butter or other farm produce from that taxation is a matter of Government strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude my comments on that aspect.  There is no provision in the Bill relating to the duty on our oil imports.  It seems that the fall-out from the 1974-75 explosion of oil prices no longer has any relevance to the economic strategy of the Government, and this is a matter of serious concern.  It is ironic that following the circulation of this Bill the Taoiseach, at the IMI conference in Killarney, drew attention <Col N="1083" /> to the fact that the cost of imported energy more than doubled from the point of view of a percentage of GNP between 1973 and 1977, to the extent of £390 million last year.  We must contrast that new concern on the part of the Taoiseach &mdash;a rather odd concern, to say the least&mdash;with the deliberate removal of the tax from motor cars of less than 16 h.p.  That decision more than any other since 1973 has helped the consumption of more imported oil here. It has also taken the brakes off the CKD car imports to the continuing detriment of our balance of payments. In that context the Taoiseach's Killarney statement had a hollow ring. It is my belief that in 1979 and 1980 the nation will be picking up the tab for such electoral recklessness.  I am acutely aware of that because I come from a constituency that has more cars in it than any other in the country.  That was a soft option.  It will mean more cars on the road, more petrol being burned, more traffic jams, more Japanese cars&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been talking about a measure of taxation which is of grave concern.  The car tax situation was flaunted by the Opposition in the general election campaign and it was grabbed by an electorate which will always go for short-term expedients, particularly when there is no appeal to anyone's sense of sacrifice or patriotism. Side by side with that strategy, the Government sanctioned a 20 per cent increase in CIE fares.  There are more private cars on the road, less reliance on public transport, more private oil consumption, greater balance of payment deficits.  Just imagine CIE getting the £20 million a year which we have frittered away through the abolition of car tax.  If CIE got that money one can imagine the impact it would have on our public transport system.  My constituency colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, wrote eloquently about public transport policy in <i>The Irish Times</i> before <Col N="1084" /> he was a Deputy.  When he went into Government he handed out a piece of Fianna Fáil reality of, what one might call, political opportunism in that regard.</P>
      <P>Section 17 reintroduces the general exemptions from tax of agricultural co-operatives.  It may sound odd coming from the Labour benches but in my view we took the right decision when we were in power.  Electorally, it was a bit mad.  It was like the wealth tax: you handed Fianna Fáil a stick with which to whip you round the constituencies, but there is no doubt in my mind that the decision to introduce a tax on agricultural co-operatives was a reasonable and fair decision.  That has gone now and the Revenue Commissioners must be having a good laugh at the political parties because they do not know whether they are coming or going with the wealth tax and the agricultural co-operative tax.  They have my sympathy.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that most of our agricultural co-operatives are co-operatives in name only.  For practical purposes the majority are owned and controlled by the commercial banks. One has only to look at the experience of the Lough Egish Co-operative, to take one example, to see who runs the show.  We have the magnificent political fiction&mdash;like credit unions, everybody wants to have co-operatives and everybody favours them&mdash;that a group of unfortunate, impoverished local shareholders sit around a table and take democratic decisions.  As we know the reality is that the commercial banks and many multinational companies exert virtually a controlling interest.</P>
      <P>I have always found it strange that the IFA, having been so sensitive to that area of development, never advocated the setting up of an agricultural co-operative bank as a counterbalance to the influence and role of the commercial banks.  It was a pity when they had the opportunity, because of the prospects of prosperity for agriculture, that they did not avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument against removing the exemption in the first place was that most of the members of these co-operatives were non-taxable and <Col N="1085" /> usually the co-operatives overcame the charge to tax by paying their members an additional dividend on purchases made.  In this way quite a few co-operatives ended up with no taxable income and the farmer reinvested the additional dividend in the co-operative. To reintroduce the exemption at this stage, in a situation where the Government are trying on the one hand to bring as many farmers as possible into the tax net and on the other hand are trying to exclude as many as possible under the tax exemptions to co-operatives, is, to say the least, rather contradictory.</P>
    <P>An incentive should be given to Irish entrepreneurs.  In recent weeks a good deal of reference has been made by many Ministers to the need to secure a switch from imports to Irish products.  Time and again the Government have said we needed the equivalent of a shift of 3 per cent total consumer spending with a corresponding shift in industrial spending.  The incentives offered are laudable but I have some doubts about their long-term impact.</P>
    <P>We are spending about £600,000 on a revamped Buy Irish Campaign.  That is a fair slice of taxpayers' money.  This campaign is directed at manufacturers, retailers and consumers.  As I said, I have some doubt about the effectiveness of that campaign.  In my view a more direct incentive of a tax nature must be given to wholesalers and retailers to get them to sell guaranteed Irish products.  I do not know to what extent the Government have reviewed the situation whereby they might be offered tax credit.  It has been suggested that, if there was an audited verification of increased sales of domestic manufactured goods, as a result one might offer some form of tax credit system over, say a base year.  One would need something like that instead of pious exhortations.  Having Johnny Giles running across the RTE television screen and putting up guaranteed Irish labels will not have a very big impact on a wholesaler or retailer.  The big retailer wants to know what is in it for him if he plugs the selling of Irish products.</P>
    <P>The Minister making speeches will <Col N="1086" /> not make a very big impact on the wholesaler or retailer in terms of selling Irish goods.  To what extent are half-hearted appeals to patriotism, slogans and costly advertising campaigns having any impact in particular on Irish producers?  If they have no impact on the retailer or wholesaler under the Finance Bill they are not likely to have very much impact on consumers.  I feel there should be a tax incentive of some nature, which of course will have to be in accordance with EEC regulations, whereby a producer, wholesaler or retailer would get a special concession if he was prepared to promote a higher ratio of Irish made products in future.  I think that would be successful.  It might have a greater impact than the current situation.  There should also be more insistence by the Government that the purchasing policy of the State agencies and the State-sponsored bodies be more effectively geared towards domestic products.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that such is the nature of our employment situation that the measures advocated by Fianna Fáil at this stage are not likely to bring about the growth in the economy and in employment which we all earnestly seek.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development said that we have to achieve the kind of growth rates as, for instance, West Germany, Japan, Cuba or the Soviet Union did and that we could do as well as those countries but that we would have to realise that we could go along the road of West Germany or Japan, on the one hand, or the road of the Soviet Union and Cuba, on the other, that there were really only two options available to us and that there was little doubt about what the people would opt for.  There are more than two options.  We could have a balanced mixed economy.  If that is not appreciated with the present youth unemployment and the prospect of the many thousands of young people coming on the labour market after the summer holidays, the nation could become gravely demoralised.  The Government in this Finance Bill and in the forthcoming draft economic plan which presumably will be out next month <Col N="1087" /> will have to set out a system for the massive exploitation of our mineral, and our oil and gas resources.</P>

Very little has been said by the Government lately, with regard to the tourist industry which can be exploited.  We could also exploit the capacity of the young people to be employed in and to make contributions to the nations of the third world.  We could exploit the export of £150 million of live animals every year. There is great potential to exploit growth in agriculture and in the related food-processing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>In assessing the Bill before us it is useful to look back at the second half of 1977.  In the second half of last year the Irish economy grew more than the economy in any other EEC country.  According to the OECD report the 3½ per cent growth rate increased to 5 per cent; consumer demand picked up and made a significant contribution to the growth of certain areas of the economy; inflation fell sharply although it is still high and employment increased, by slightly over 6,000 which is above target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> This Bill represents the Government's determination to implement the commitments outlined in the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  The Bill includes a number of incentives which have been maligned by the Opposition spokesmen, such as the £1,000 grant, the abolition of car tax for vehicles under 16 horse power and the abolition of rates on private dwellings.  These incentives were introduced primarily because that method of collecting revenue for the Exchequer or for local authorities has gone out of date.  The amount of money collected from car tax and rates on private dwellings was small and the cost of administration and of collecting the money was prohibitive.  The provision of money from the Department of Finance to the Department of the Environment to finance the £1,000 grant scheme has been an unqualified success.  The idea had the right mixture of incentive for the private sector of the building industry and in the overall taxation and financial area it is a worthwhile incentive.</P>
    <P>The Government have produced a White Paper on national development which sets out in broad terms how the Government see the problems facing the country and the measures necessary to solve them.  The budget introduced in February was a further step in the Government's strategy to tackle the serious problems.  It was the first opportunity the Government had to create the type of climate necessary to reduce unemployment and to create the confidence which was so badly needed.  To a large extent a lot of the problems were inherited from the disastrous mismanagement of the Coalition Government.  The major problems are to control prices and inflation and above all to create employment. The Government in this Finance Bill are determined to tackle these problems.</P>
    <P>The budget on which this Bill is based provides a sound framework to deal with these problems.  As implemented in the budget and dealt with in the Finance Bill, the income tax allowances must surely be recognised, particularly by the Labour Party who are continuously calling for more State involvement.  This measure puts money <Col N="1089" /> into the pocket of the ordinary worker, and in what better and more positive way can the State assist an individual than by the type of tax concessions being implemented in the Finance Bill?</P>
    <P>The signing of the national wage agreement was an indication of the unions' positive recognition of what the Government were doing.  It was a tremendous boost for the general view of the country abroad.  It showed that there was a positive, constructive and rational view taken of employees' involvement in their place of employment whether private enterprise, semi-State or Government.  Right across the broad spectrum of labour a decision had to be made and, while close, it was on the correct side.  In accepting the national agreement proposals our labour force helped themselves and in no small way helped the financial situation within the country by providing stability and potential for progress.  The tax concessions given, which are well known now, are dealt with in detail in the Finance Bill and will no doubt go on the Statute Book as the positive contribution this budget is making to creating employment and stability.</P>
    <P>The fact that the agreement has been widely welcomed in the meantime is an additional indication, if such were needed, of the wisdom and the masterful strategy the Government brought to bear on the negotiations prior to signing.  It was a real indication of the Government's involvement and of the seriousness of the decision that had to be made.  As a result of the wage agreement there is now a distinct possibility of order and certainty in industrial affairs.  Apart from the confidence created in business circles it will also generate increased interest in investors coming to this country, in taking due recognition of increases in wages and the other incentives the Finance Bill introduces in that area of investment.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides imaginative incentives to encourage expansion in the private sector.  The Minister's opening statement gave the details, but I should like to say that the package as a whole is obviously the type the country needs at present to get the <Col N="1090" /> economy moving, to provide the climate for expansion and create the jobs so badly needed to ensure that the recovery which the Government have promised and are actively working for, will be achieved in the lifetime of this Dáil, as is obviously necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill is very commendable and I have no doubt that it will result in a tremendous upsurge in business enterprise and in investment. Section 4 is a further concrete example of the Minister honouring a commitment made prior to assuming office.  This section will alleviate the hardship caused by the Coalition's inept measure for assessing employees' motoring benefits in kind.  That was a petty and short-sighted measure introduced without thought of the hardships it caused.  The realistic provisions of section 4 will ensure that full account is taken of each employee's circumstances and it will positively remove legitimate grievances.  During the election campaign I recall a number of people making representations on this issue, pointing out the anomalies created by the previous Minister's abolition of the benefit in kind concession to the individual who was normally paid by salary and had a motor vehicle supplied as part of the equipment necessary to do his job. In the main the individual had to travel the length and breadth of the country.  Ninety per cent of those concerned, I could probably say without contradiction, would not be on an hourly rate but on salary and would work additional hours beyond the standard 38-40 per week. Obviously, their situation was anomalous when compared with that of those on hourly rates when they were being taxed on being provided with an item essential to carry out their work.  This anomaly was swiftly recognised and positively remedied by the Minister in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>In the farming area one has only to consider comment from those most concerned to find acceptance of the Minister's intention of collecting tax in this area.  Prior to our joining the EEC our farmers were in the vulnerable position of being confined to only <Col N="1091" /> one main outlet, the UK market, and the obvious problems that this entailed from time to time.  However, income in the farming community is well recorded and recognised as a result of benefits derived from accession to the EEC plus the vast market now available, probably exceeding 250 million people in Britain and on the European mainland.  The Minister's financial measures to collect farming taxation represent a fair and constructive approach, reducing rateable valuation. It is a recognition that the farming community, which is now expanding and prospering, will pay its contribution to central funds for the muchneeded redistribution of funds for the many necessary social commitments the Government have.</P>
    <P>It is opportune that at the time of the debate on the Finance Bill the Central Bank Report for 1977 should become available.  I should like to deal with a number of items referred to in that report although it is possible that they are not that helpful in relation to our financial planning.  The Central Bank properly decided to invest £100 million in Government stock. I have read a number of comments about this investment and the reference to the fact that the Central Bank were endeavouring to bolster the Government's finances by purchasing this stock.  However, having looked at the external reserves of the Central Bank it is my view that the investment of £100 million in Government stock was a worth-while and positive involvement in financing some of the Government programmes which were dealt with in the White Paper and which are an integral part of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with the Central Bank purchasing Government Stock in order to provide money for the Department of Finance?  The Central Bank buy other Government stock. There is no reason why the Central Bank should not invest in Government stock particularly when one considers that external reserves rose from £1,072 million at the end of January to £1,133 million at the end of February. When one considers those reserves and the Government's financial <Col N="1092" /> policies one must come to the conclusion that the affairs of the country are properly geared.  In the area of capital inflows and official external reserves there is an item in the report which is not helpful in generating the maximum funds available to the Irish banks for investment here.  In connection with this the Central Bank have reintroduced the special 50 per cent deposit requirement on net capital inflows through licensed banks. There may be some justification for a percentage but the re-imposing of the 50 per cent is too much.</P>
    <P>In connection with this matter the Central Bank report states:</P>
    <P>...the Bank reimposed the special 50 per cent deposit requirement on net capital inflows through licensed banks with reference to the May 1977 bank return date.  While there were substantial exempted inflows during the remainder of the year in respect of previously arranged acceptance credits and inflows for large-scale industrial projects, there was no other net inflow through the banks during this period.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the Central Bank are concerned about major movements of finance in and out of the country.  That is understandable because if one accepts those incomes without some sort of restriction one might be left short of funds rather rapidly.  I suggest that 50 per cent is too high and the Minister for Finance should review that percentage with the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The job creation possibilities arising out of the provisions in the Finance Bill can be achieved.  In the course of his budget speech the Minister told us that the job creation programme involved the public sector, the building and construction industry and youth employment.  The Government are providing funds for AnCO, the IDA, semi-State bodies and other organisations to get on with the task of creating jobs.  It is also the Government's intention to create more posts in the Garda Síochána and in the Defence Forces.  There has been far too much comment to the effect that the Minister was depending too much on the private sector.  It is my view that the budget contains the right financial mix.  While there is a great deal of <Col N="1093" /> emphasis on the private sector there is also a great deal of involvement and investment in semi-State and Government agencies.  The Government are not depending entirely on the private sector to implement their job creation programme which is demanding and ambitious but which must be achieved. I was pleased to see that the Minister had discussions within the public service to ensure that there was the maximum movement in the creation of jobs.  The money provided for semi-State organisations for the paying of chief executives and other employees should be looked at in the light of the overall performance of those concerns. It is wrong that the questioning of salaries should be isolated to individual areas.  Many of our semi-State concerns are doing a worth-while job and, naturally, their chief executives and other management staff should be paid accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 2 the Minister proposes to take constructive action on the movement towards equality in relation to female taxation. This subject has been debated fully and we have all heard comments from various quarters but in the Bill we have the first positive indication of a change in the structure of taxing females.  It is now proposed to permit married women to opt for a combined assessment of taxation with their husbands. That is a new freedom and it is my view that all married women will welcome it.</P>
      <P>The provisions in section 7 give us another indication of the Minister's anxiety to get individuals involved in the firms where they are employed. In this section the figure of £2,000 has been detailed as acceptable for the acquiring of shares and this measure gives employees working in a public company an opportunity for real participation in that organisation.  It is acceptable and desirable within companies that the individuals creating the wealth should now be encouraged by section 7 to be actively involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a company producing good results the figure of £2,000 would give <Col N="1094" /> a welcome income to an individual who has contributed over the years to that organisation.  Because it is a public company the figures are available, and the individual knows that his or her investment will be soundly based on practical results over the years.  It is to be welcomed that the Minister has recognised the reasoning that individuals should have the opportunity of investing in the company to which they have devoted their energies and been dedicated over the years. The figure of £2,000 is realistic in today's monetary terms.  Section 7 will find great favour with a number of people.</P>
    <P>In section 9, positive action is taken in an area to which a good deal of lip service has been paid in the past. The cross-Border worker taxation arrangements, as outlined in section 9, for the first time create a real incentive and give real encouragement to cross-Border development.  There is no doubt that there is a good deal of interchanging of labour along the Border and section 9 recognises this and gives it due attention.  It rectifies what has been a positive problem in getting tax assessments from the Revenue Commissioners on both sides of the Border. There were adverse effects on people's finances because of the lack of this provision.  Section 9 will find wide favour in that part of the country. There will be a greater utilisation of the committed EEC finance available for cross-Border development.  It will smooth that path and is a very welcome measure.</P>
    <P>Section 19 which deals with manufacturing companies develops a formula for easy progress in the area of company expansion, with the proviso of an increase in employment.  The 3 per cent growth, interlinked with the 25 per cent corporation tax relief and the 19 per cent increase in sales in 1976, is a very neat financial package and gives the small manufacturing organisations some worthwhile relief so that they are not tied up in red tape and Revenue Commission bureaucracy.  It is a positive, clear-cut method of assessing growth and increased employment.</P>
    <P>In section 19 the onus is fairly and squarely on the companies' auditors. <Col N="1095" /> This minimises the necessary paper work and also recognises the reasons why companies should expand and increase employment.  That is in direct contradiction to Deputy Desmond's philosophy that there is no real incentive for the private sector to create new jobs.  I disagree with Deputy Desmond.  I do not know how any private company or semi-State company could prosper financially without creating employment.  While we may be in an era of automation and technical advance&mdash;and possibly the level of knowledge of the employee may have to be higher&mdash;if companies are to earn more finance they must increase output particularly in the manufacturing sector.  Naturally that requires additional jobs.</P>
    <P>It is totally incorrect to state that the private sector can profit greatly and yet not create new employment.  The Revenue Commissioners have a great insight into public and private companies. With the information gained by assessing companies' accounts over the years expertise is developed, and the Minister can readily know how companies are performing and whether they are making excessive profits.  Any Minister charged with the responsibility of looking after our financial affairs will give detailed and due recognition to performance in the area of profit making.</P>
    <P>Our company taxation provides a fair balance, around 50 per cent.  In the Bill there is also potential for relief on the reinvestment of profits which is another indication of the Government's strategy planned, if you like, on the private sector.  There is a benefit to the community at large in the job creation area by giving this type of reinvestment relief on company profits.  When one tries to identify State investment and State involvement in the private sector, one walks a very tight rope.  It needs to be carefully balanced.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Bill and in the budget the Minister has balanced the country's finances very intelligently. The private sector has been given the necessary encouragement to invest and expand and create the necessary <Col N="1096" /> jobs.  The Minister can still collect a satisfactory level of company tax.  It is wrong to suggest that the private sector will profit too much from this budget. It will not, and that suggestion should be denied positively in this House.</P>
    <P>On 1 February the Minister introduced the budget and dealt in great detail with overall financial policy. Since then, this aspect has been highlighted and it is neither helpful nor factual to over-emphasise the advantages in the budget for the private sector.  The job creation programme is outlined in the documents accompanying the Minister's speech detailing 10,000 new jobs in the public sector.  If my reading is correct, there will be 3,170 jobs in the building and construction industry of which 1,670 will be direct labour.  Here we have a mixture of some 50 per cent new job creation by central or semi-State agencies.</P>
    <P>Surely this mix is an acceptable arrangement between State investment and private enterprise.  The figure of 50 per cent is satisfactory.  There will be major investment in many areas&mdash; roads, hospitals, IDA factories and so on.  The Minister is to be complimented on recognising the need for rapid development in the building sector, a sector which had slowed down to a snail's pace in the concluding years of the Coalition's term of office.</P>
    <P>I am having difficulty in assessing the true unemployment situation in my constituency.  The overall unemployment figure is available, yet there has been a great increase in the number of advertisements in the situations vacant column in the daily newspapers.  There is a need to study this area in order to determine the balance between the number unemployed and the many organisations seeking staff.  While there have been many representations made to me in regard to unemployment in my constituency, it is certainly not the biggest problem.  The Minister and some of his colleagues in the Cabinet should discuss ways and means of placing more unemployed people in the newly-created situations.</P>
    <P>The youth employment scheme is already under way.  In my constituency <Col N="1097" /> a number of schemes were proposed for youth employment and some of these schemes are being implemented.  The recruitment of 150 first-year construction apprentices by local authorities is desirable.  I hope that the finance made available for that scheme will be fully utilised.</P>
    <P>The proposed incentives mean that manufacturing industries will have the facility for further investment.  The free depreciation which will be available to industrialists for expenditure on new buildings with effect from 2 February is very desirable.  This clear-cut financial policy will allow companies to build new premises which will, in turn, create more employment. The financial arrangements for those two schemes and the free depreciation being allowed for new plant and machinery are incentives to industrialists to expand.</P>
    <P>Another great aspect of this Bill is that small companies will have their corporation tax thresholds raised from £10,000 to £20,000 and from £15,000 to £35,000, depending on their category. Much has been said of the need to assist small companies.  In increasing the tax thresholds for those companies the Minister has given them reason to expand and reinvest.</P>
    <P>The assumption of the exchange risk liability by the Exchequer for the Industrial Credit Company with the European Investment Bank is also very desirable.  In the past five years nonsterling currencies changed their values rapidly and created burdens for people who were not international financial experts.  It had a detrimental effect on companies investing in equipment outside the sterling area as the fluctuations were excessive and threw the investment programmes of small companies into chaos.  The recognition of this anomaly by the Minister is a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The new duty-free facility should assist the sale of Irish products.  There is no doubt that the commuters between our two countries will benefit and the output of Irish companies should increase as a result of this positive move.</P>
    <P>Much has been said of the abolition of the wealth tax.  It has been said that <Col N="1098" /> it was unworkable, inefficient and did not justify the reason for introducing it.  We recognised the problems in this area and the Minister has taken positive action.  The lack of comment from the people who are supposed to be most upset about it may be frustrating for the Opposition.  The abolition of this tax has not created complications and we are better off without it.</P>
    <P>The taxation of farm incomes has already been dealt with.  The amount of finance to be derived from this source &mdash;£24 million&mdash;is a reasonable contribution, particularly when one considers the need for reinvestment in farming.  There must be a balance between the taxation policy and the need for investment in farming.  It is hard to assess Deputy Desmond's criticisms of the abolition of tax on co-operatives.</P>
    <P>Here is the ideal control arrangement for worker participation in an organisation.  The co-operative is the ideal way for everybody involved, the farmer members and the employees, in getting the maximum return for investment. Normally over the past ten years the need for equipment investment in the rapidly expanding co-operatives has utilised the finance produced in the way of profits.  If any co-operative was profiteering excessively, naturally those members and the individuals employed were going to get the benefit.  If there was a great need for further investment in capital expenditure, naturally the co-operative would invest in that area, and this would create employment.  The employment thus created would normally be in the country and away from the highly populated areas.  How any Government could justify the taxing of co-operatives is beyond the understanding of this side of the House and the Minister at the first available opportunity has abolished such taxation.  This will make a real possibility for these organisations to expand, to create employment and to invest continually in the food processing industry, and this we all agree is highly desirable.  Over the years we have had many reports and heard many comments on the need for added value and for further processing. When one wants that sort of <Col N="1099" /> expansion, to tax the organisations endeavouring to achieve the maximising of Irish food exportation does not make a lot of sense.  In abolishing the tax on co-operatives the Minister for Finance has taken the right decision. A qualification on the abolition of that tax which, is very desirable, although it may not meet with favour from a lot of the processors, is the fact that sales to intervention will not be exempt. This is a positive step towards urging on our co-operatives&mdash;and also private enterprise in the food processing area particularly&mdash;that they cannot abuse the EEC floor prices guarantee situation by putting their products into intervention. It is up to the co-operatives and the private operators, as the Minister for Agriculture has urged recently, to sell their products other than to intervention.  The fact that the Minister has recognised this and has exempted sales to intervention agents is a welcome and progressive step.</P>
    <P>Regarding value-added tax, I welcome the provision for the restoration of the 1 per cent recoupment allowed to VAT-registered customers of unregistered farmers in the income tax year 1978-79.  The provision for the option of different methods of assessing tax is also welcome.  I would like to think that many farmers will opt for the accounts system which will enable them to organise their affairs efficiently and they will see a real return on capital invested and so will get the maximum advantages of the tax system.  They will realise that borrowing and reinvestment done constructively with the assistance of their accountants will bring investment and progress into farming.</P>
    <P>The Bill should bring about the right financial mix for the private sector, the semi-State organisations and the co-operatives.  There is some financial relief for employment-creating agencies.  The Minister in balancing the situation has created the environment for job creation which is so much part of the integral plan of our Government.</P>
    <P>We are now at the halfway stage of 1978, and the budget and the Finance Bill giving effect to it have <Col N="1100" /> already proved that this was the right financial strategy.  The private sector have the opportunity of expanding and of contributing their fair share of tax. For the individual there is a purpose in striving to progress and to improve his income because the taxation burden is far lighter than it was under the previous Government.  We heard time and time again, particularly in the last two years of the Coalition's term of office, that it was no longer profitable to work.  The high taxes were a great disincentive.  The number of manufacturing organisations could not get staff to work overtime in food processing which could have increased our exports.</P>
    <P>The financial strategy may be criticised from the far side of the House, but the record stands and contradicts the argument now being put forward by members of the Opposition on this Finance Bill.  I welcome the measures in it and I believe it will achieve its aims.</P>

      <P>That was due to the budgetary proposals which Deputy Ryan brought in last year, but it was good to hear him get credit from that side of the House.  Possibly the Deputy did not intend that.  It will be interesting to see this time next year whether the Deputy will be saying the same thing about the present finance proposals and the budget we have had.  We certainly will not be <Col N="1101" /> saying it.  We will not be talking about the growth rate of 5 per cent.  We will not be talking about general improvement in standards, because what we have before us is not a recipe for success.  From listening to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development it is clear that Fianna Fáil are endeavouring now to extricate themselves from the rich promises they made at the time of the last general election.  To that extent they are blaming everybody else for the failure to reach their job target. The industrialists are being blamed, as are the trade unions and management. However, I am glad that industry have made it clear that they will not be the whipping boys in the event of the job target not being reached.  They are making it clear that they were not the ones who made the projections and the comments.  It appears now that the job target set is not attainable.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the creation of 10,000 jobs in the public sector and to 3,100 jobs in the construction industry but it is interesting to note that more than 11,500 of those jobs would be basically in the public sector.  This is not providing the type of employment we need.  Nevertheless it is to be welcomed.  There is need for a much greater generation of jobs in the private sector.  Public sector jobs must be paid for by the taxpayer whereas extra jobs in the private sector mean the generation of industry, of sales and of exports in order to create the capital to pay for those jobs.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Government have decided to abolish wealth tax.  During the long and protracted debate on that legislation, mass hysteria was generated by people who in the main would never have to pay wealth tax but at the time it was fashionable to object to the legislation, to pretend that perhaps one might be caught in the net.  It had a sort of snob value. That kind of propaganda was abetted by Fianna Fáil, that party who like to be known as the party of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the people who are really represented by Fianna Fáil are those who took their money from the <Col N="1102" /> country in their attaché cases and invested it elsewhere.  Those who could liquidate their assets overnight and move out could not have had any stake in the country in the first place and no doubt our economy will prosper without them.  While the wealth tax did not result in a great amount of revenue it was important that there was provision for it.  It was a radical taxation which might have been introduced a little before time but once it was on the Statute Book the thresholds could have been regulated at any stage in order to make it attractive one way or another.  Its removal is another indication that the wealthy and the articulate, though they may be small in number, still have much influence in certain Government circles.  Having regard to the future development of our natural resources we are likely to become a wealthy economy and in that situation it would be important to have a wealth tax so as to ensure that in so far as possible the wealth will not fall into the hands of a relatively small number of people but will be distributed as widely and as fairly as possible.  That is why it is regrettable that wealth tax is being removed.  It was the mechanism by which wealth could be clawed back and distributed equitably.</P>
    <P>It was a courageous step on the part of the Government of the day to have introduced wealth tax.  Such a move required a commitment but it is sad to find that commitment being discarded now.  Is it being discarded because of a promise made during the election campaign and, if so, to whom was that promise made?  Was it made to people who financed the campaign of the then Opposition and who are now to be paid back in this way? There has not been any great indignation generally regarding the removal of wealth tax but the reason for this may be that people are not aware of what is involved and have adopted the attitude that since the legislation would not have been likely to affect them anyway, there is no need to protest its removal.  That is not the right attitude.  However, it is the duty of the Government to govern and not to continue running before the wheels of the better off.  That is why I must be <Col N="1103" /> harsh with the Government in this regard.  No doubt they will herald this move on their part with a fanfare of trumpets and will regard it as being the fulfilment of one of their promises.  I would not accept the Government's argument that this tax was the cause of a flow of capital from the country.  I contend that only a small amount of capital was taken out of the economy.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Desmond said, in the year in which the legislation was introduced there was massive investment from abroad into industry here.  If there had not been the type of hysteria that was generated by Fianna Fáil I doubt whether any capital would have been taken out of the country.  So much, then, for the patriotism of that party.  In order to create a sense of panic they endeavoured to give the impression to the people that all would be affected by the tax.  They tried the same tactic with the farmers at the time of the last election in respect of taxation.  The removal of the wealth tax is a serious and a retrograde step. They should reconsider their position on this.  It does not have to be a harsh measure but it should be left on the Statute Book to claw back money which belongs to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Finance Bill to married women who are working, but there is no reference whatsoever to the housewife who decides to remain at home and rear her family. Such women are the bedrock of our society and they get very little credit. I was glad that Deputy Desmond made the point that the tax allowance for children should be paid directly to the wife, together with the children's allowances.  I should like to see the Government showing their commitment by giving an allowance on top of that.  This would encourage many married women to remain at home. If a married woman wants to work, she is entitled to do so, but many of them have to go to work for economic reasons and, as a result, their families are neglected.  It then becomes a matter of the latch key children.  Such children are at risk and it is important to recognise this.  If we had taken such steps in the past we might not now <Col N="1104" /> have to concern ourselves with places like Loughan House and we might have a more developed society.  The fact that there is no increase at all in the amount of the children's allowances highlights the lack of commitment to the home by the Government. They are more concerned about their well-heeled supporters than the ordinary people.  It is regrettable that a party who had at one time a reasonably good social commitment have now drifted away from that and tend to judge things purely on expediency. They have conned the people, but the saying is: &ldquo;If you can fool me once, it is shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me&rdquo;.  That is the way it will be. The people will not be conned again.</P>
    <P>We are now having to raise taxation and to borrow&mdash;literally pledge the nation&mdash;to pay for election promises. When the Taoiseach was talking last week he made the point that all available resources, all monetary funds, must be directed towards job creation. It is a pity he did not think of that a year ago when he was prepared to promise this, that and the other in order to gain power.  Now Fianna Fáil have power and the chickens are coming home to roost more quickly than I thought they would.  The money is not there and they are now looking for scapegoats.  Who can they blame? Perhaps they will say people are responsible because they did not respond. Perhaps they will lecture the trade unions and tell them that they should control their members.  Perhaps the private sector are not providing enough jobs.  That will not wash.  The Government were elected to govern and to fulfil the promises which they made.</P>
    <P>They promised to remove the rates and they did so.  I was in favour of removing rates up to a valuation of £25 or £30, but now people with large houses with a very high valuation are laughing up their sleeves.  This is a nice bonanza for them and they are the people who could well afford to pay rates.  People living in local authority dwellings whose valuation is not very high got a very small reduction, but the following fortnight their rents were raised.  There was no bonanza for them. People who live in large houses could <Col N="1105" /> well afford to pay £500 or £600 in rates every year and some of them could cushion it against taxation in some way.  They are quite happy because they are getting the benefit of this measure.</P>
    <P>Was there any clamour to have car tax removed?  I do not think so; it was irresponsible.  The Taoiseach is now telling us that we must devote all our resources to job creation and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development talks vaguely about cut-backs and critical reviews of expenditure on health and social welfare services and local authority housing. At whose expense will this critical review be?  It will be at the expense of the less well-off in our society, people who have medical cards, people who need educational grants and others who are basically dependent on the State. Social welfare will be reviewed and inner-city housing will be critically reviewed.  The well has run dry and these areas must be attacked.  Having given money back to those who have, we are now looking around to see how this money can be recouped.  It will be recouped from the poorer sections of our society who may not kick up as much noise as the people who were affected by the wealth tax.  That is the dishonesty of the package which we have had to tolerate since this Government came into office.</P>
    <P>First-time buyers of new houses are now being given the great bonanza of £1,000.  Previously they were given money by way of grants as their houses were being built but now, in order to get their £1,000, they must be living in their houses.  House prices will increase by 20 per cent; a £10,000 house will cost £12,500 and the grant of £1,000 will be of little help. Within a few months its value has been eroded.  The glitter and the glamour has gone from that exercise.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about the construction industry.  The National Coalition were not long in power before they started criticising us although we built more houses than any Government. The industry has little to say these days.  The building societies are tightening up the money supply and it is almost impossible to get finance <Col N="1106" /> from them.  A fire brigade action is required here.  The Finance Bill has done nothing to help in this area.  In my view the banks should be required to lend some of the vast profits they are making in order that people may be able to buy their houses.  They do not want to lend money for this purpose because the time factor is too long&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know of a person who has an account in a bank here.  He has a good job and he sought a loan of £7,000.  He was more or less promised the loan but in the end he was refused.  So much for the banks lending money.  They can shove up the interest rate by 2 per cent and with one stroke of the pen that means additional millions of pounds for them. Yet they are not prepared to lend money for long periods to people who want to buy their houses and thus have a stake in the future of the country.  The Government should direct the banks to help and if they do not help they should impose taxation on them in order to claw back the money.  In turn this could be used by way of a revised SDA loan system to help those in need.  If money is not available for house purchase the building industry will grind to a halt.  The situation is serious and I am surprised there was no reference to it in the Finance Bill.  I think the Government thought the situation would right itself.  The only thing that will happen is that interest rates will increase substantially and, consequently, the repayments will be higher.  This will increase the cost of living and will fuel inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government indicated in the White Paper that they will not develop centre city housing to a great degree. Neither have they given any incentive to the private sector to carry out such work.  I am rather surprised about that.  There is a real and viable proposition here.  There are many vacant sites in the inner city areas. They were bought originally for office <Col N="1107" /> development but because of the market situation there is a reluctance to build and invest.  These sites could be developed for housing and I think the tax mechanism could be used to give an incentive to the developers. In that way we would develop our city in a way that would help people. This matter should be dealt with urgently but the Government have not made any move.  I know the building industry would be interested in such a project.  The advantage would be twofold; in addition to local authority housing we would have private housing and this would give a good social mix. Also, it would provide much needed employment and enhance our city, thus making it a better place in which to live.  However, that would require some kind of social commitment that is lacking in the Government.  I suppose my suggestion will fall on deaf ears.  I am rather surprised that Fianna Fáil's friends in the building industry have not prompted them to take this course.  Perhaps they have but it may be that the Government have not the will to do it.</P>
    <P>Since the budget there have been a few mini-budgets.  Some people were promised a reduction in the price of the stamp and they got this but a few weeks later there was a Bill before this House to increase the cost of the stamp.  So much for the promises made by Fianna Fáil; so much for their concern for the lower income group. Quite recently we had another Bill dealing with an increase in health contributions.  That was more money that had to be paid.  There was a lot of talk about tax concessions but when all the increases are considered there is very little left.  The sum does not work out too well for those for whom we should be most concerned.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about incentives for private industry.  Some months ago a youth employment action team was heralded with a great fanfare of trumpets.  Many parents concerned about their sons and daughters who have left school had great hopes of this.  This employment action team sent in a report last November but we have heard nothing about it since. <Col N="1108" /> I am not blaming them.  What teeth had they?  What role had they?  When they talked about apprenticeship AnCO politely told them that was their area.  When they talked about industrial development the IDA told told them it was their area.  Where is this action team going?  Was it just set up as a window dressing exercise to fool the people?  One does not play politics with such a serious thing as youth employment but it appears that is what has happened.  It is important that we examine the role of the youth employment team before it drifts into oblivion because it has no support.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about the incentives for industry but we do not hear any talk about the creation of good industrial relations.  The Minister for Labour recently indicated that worker participation and profit sharing are a worker's right.  That is empty talk because one knows what one is told when one seeks one's rights.  We must create a climate in this area. The obvious one is incentive.  The industrialist must get incentives and the worker must get incentives.  Profit sharing and a greater stake within the company the person is working in are good incentives.  Incentives for workers should have been provided in the Finance Bill.  We must give workers their rights and we must give them the supports to attain their rights.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to something the Minister for Economic Planning and Development said about us having to go the road of the Japanese, the Germans, the Cubans and the Russians and that it was quite easy to see what road the Irish people would choose.  We should consider why the Germans and the Japanese succeeded in industry.  I believe they gave incentives and they made it possible with greater worker participation. It is important to give industry incentives. The fact that this is missing from the Finance Bill clearly indicates a lack of commitment from the Government to improving industrial relations.</P>
    <P>One cannot legislate for industrial relations and worker participation. One must create the climate for this. It is easy to create the climate once the proper incentives are given to industry, <Col N="1109" /> both management and worker side.  Management and workers will eventually be seen as one unit with one concern, to achieve greater productivity, greater markets and employment. Talk will not make those things happen.  The Government will have to have a blueprint for creating jobs.</P>
    <P>I believe that by generating the right type of industrial climate we can ensure that our productivity will rise and as a result we can pay better wages. When one talks to people nowadays about the high cost of meat or butter one is told that we have to pay the EEC prices because that is the going rate.  We do not hear anything about EEC wages.  We will only get that type of income by increasing productivity, by getting the worker and management together in harmony, the worker having a stake in the profits.  I believe that we will then solve a lot of our problems. Irish workers will respond to such a development.  They do not like to be treated as units to be used from a particular hour in the morning to a particular hour in the afternoon or evening. They want to be made part of something.  They want a sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>We all talk a lot about taxation.  I am always aggravated by the plight of social welfare recipients.  Take the example of an old age pensioner who, because he was prudent during his working life has a pension.  The cumulative effect of that, plus his social welfare benefit takes him into the tax net.  This should have been reviewed long ago.  Pensions should not be caught for taxation whatsoever and should be outside the net.  Even given the amount a prudent person might have saved during his working life his pension should not be taxed.  Most pensioners with whom one speaks today, when they receive a bill for income tax, genuinely feel that it is their old age pension that is being taxed. While in theory it is the other side of the coin, as far as they are concerned their old age pension is being taxed.  It is time something was done about that.  That consideration is long overdue in any type of tax reform that might be introduced.  There are arguments for and against, but it is <Col N="1110" /> sad that the State, should, like the proverbial Scrooge, penalise old age pensioners at the end of their days, people who through prudence and foresight saved for the rainy day.  It is wrong and should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The overall taxation question should be reviewed.  We have drifted along with our present income tax code for too long.  Evidently it is felt that because it yields the requisite revenue it is not necessary to alter it.  It is time we had a radical re-think on the PAYE tax system to see what can be done because it acts as a disincentive in lots of ways to people at work. The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach mentioned that it was a disincentive to people working overtime but that, because of the new tax concessions, now it would not be.  That is ridiculous because, by and large, people will continue to pay tax on their basic wage and they will also be taxed on any overtime earnings. I am not advocating that overtime should not be taxed because that would encourage overtime with which I would not altogether go along.  I believe that people should not be taxed out of existence.  We should examine the whole PAYE tax system to see what can be done to streamline it, making it more equitable and raising substantially the thresholds to take a lot of people in it out because they would be literally on the bread line and yet be paying income tax which, in my opinion was never intended.</P>
    <P>On the question of the removal of tax on co-operatives, it rather surprised me that the Government did this because they are always advocating free enterprise.  Indeed co-operatives are in competition with free enterprise.  The only difference is that if free enterprise makes a profit they pay tax on it whereas co-operatives do not.  I have an open mind on the subject.  Certainly, coming from a party always advocating free enterprise. I found it rather surprising. With regard to free enterprise or State enterprise, it would appear they really do not know what horse to ride: it apparently depends on the mood and on the day they make a statement.</P>
    <P>There is no real impetus in the <Col N="1111" /> package before us.  The budget of 1977 did have some impetus, which was proved by the performance throughout that year.  It will be interesting to see whether this package will have the same effect.  I do not think it will. Rather I think what we will be talking about in ensuing months will be the removal of food subsidies, cuts in health, housing and education, increased taxation.  Have no doubt about that.  All of these things will be to pay for the election gimmickry of last June.  It will be a high price to pay but they will not get away with it because we are now dealing with a more sophisticated electorate, with a greater number of non-committed voters who are watching.  They will see their standards being eroded, as I believe they will have to be as a result of the noises being made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  There is no question but that they are softening up the ground, preparing people well in advance for what will happen and that they will bring in these measures hoping that they have prepared the ground sufficiently well.  I believe they will not have prepared the ground, that our people will not accept it and will await their opportunity to deal them the blow they deserve for conning people into voting for them last time.</P>
    <P>Certainly the chickens have come home to roost much sooner than had been expected.  That is a clear indication of how in the year ahead and in the succeeding year they will juggle the books to make ends meet.  The only way they can make them meet is to borrow massively again, which I do not believe they will do or will be allowed to do.  Rather the World Bank will step in and tell them: &ldquo;This far and no further.  You will not get any more credit from us.  Get your own house in order.&rdquo;  The only thing they can do then is to cut back on the services about which they are now talking, those that affect the less welloff. This Finance Bill augurs very badly for the future.  The deception of last June is now manifesting itself and before very long we will see its real fruits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to speeches from both sides of the House for the last couple of hours I am becoming more and more convinced that one must change one's opinions once one crosses the floor of the House.  I have listened to all of what Deputy F. O'Brien had to say.  I agree with practically everything he said, but I should like to see everything he suggested implemented.  I have listened to the condemnation of private enterprise, not exactly condemnation but a suggestion that private enterprise will be unable to do the job and that most of the money which, quite rightly, is going to private enterprise should be allocated to doing more in the public sector.  I would agree with that.</P>
      <P>However, I should like to point out that as far as I can recollect, the vast majority of semi-State bodies were started by Fianna Fáil.  The National Coalition Government, to which the two previous speakers, Deputy Desmond and Deputy Fergus O'Brien belonged, were there for four years and I certainly saw no evidence of the Government stepping in during those four years to help the private sector.  I did not see any subsidies offered as incentives to industrialists in order to create more jobs.  There was nothing about worker participation.</P>
      <P>I am very keen on the co-operative movement.  Criticism has been voiced of the Minister removing the tax on co-operatives.  When we started the co-operative movement we did not do it in order to make money and I compliment the Minister on removing this iniquitous tax.  Any profits made are ploughed back to provide better services for the members.  I have a social conscience.  I believe the co-operative movement is the only movement imbued with a social conscience. When we were organising I know the nights I spent travelling around at my own expense.  In those days the members of the committee had no travelling expenses.  The members of the committee today have travelling expenses.  They are not, of course, paid.  If one had to travel to Dublin one did so at one's own expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The co-operative movement has done more than anything else to help <Col N="1113" /> the downtrodden.  The movement would not survive if it were taxed. The benefits for the members are many.  They subscribe a certain amount of share capital.  They have a vote. They elect the committee.  If all the members do not take an interest that is their own affair.  The movement is for the benefit of the ordinary plain people who cannot do things for themselves as individuals because they have not got the capital but can do things for themselves by coming together with other people in similar circumstances. One of the worst mistakes the National Coalition Government made was imposing a tax on co-operatives.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about the private sector.  That sector will reap many benefits under this Bill.  Money is also being spent in the public sector. Jobs are being created in education and health and money is being spent on youth employment schemes.  The Minister is not concentrating completely on the private sector.  He is also considering the public sector.  Like Deputy Barry Desmond, I approve of a mixed economy and that is what the budget and this Finance Bill are aiming at.</P>
    <P>I agree with practically everything Deputy Fergus O'Brien said but it takes money to implement policies and, during the four years Deputy Fergus O'Brien was on this side of the House, his Government did not do very much to implement all the things he would now like to see implmented. The important questions is: Does the trade union movement want worker participation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very good question and it is one to which I would like to get a definite answer.  I would like to see workers sharing in profits and having some say in policy but when I asked if that was what they wished I was told they would much prefer to be on the other side of the table and management could mind their own business.  That was the answer I got.  Like Deputy O'Brien, I believe <Col N="1114" /> workers participation would make for better labour relations.  Workers should know what profits are made.  They should have access to balance sheets. They should know how much is paid in salaries, how much is put aside and how much can be given by way of bonus.  I could not find agreement on that in the co-operative movement.  It did not work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond said the removal of the car tax was no benefit to workers. I can tell him it is of considerable benefit to workers in the west of Ireland, workers who have to travel 30 miles to the industrial estate in Galway.  For them cars are a necessity, not a luxury.  It is not like Dublin where you have a bus service outside your door.  The removal of the car tax was of tremendous benefit to workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, noting the serious and growing anomaly in the income eligibility limits of non-manual workers for health services and maternity care under the Health Acts relative to manual workers, and in particular noting that with rising income levels many thousands of non-manual workers are now excluded from free hospital care, calls on the Government to abolish all income limits forthwith.</P>
      <P>We tabled this motion because of growing dissatisfaction and concern among ordinary people because they are being increasingly denied their rights to free hospitalisation.  There have been many anomalies created by the definition of manual and non-manual workers and consequently a series of problems have been created. I have not been able to get clarification on this from the Minister, who has said it rightly rests with the health boards.  Because of this lack of clarification we find ourselves in serious trouble.  For instance, a bus driver is a manual worker but a bus conductor is not; a butcher is a manual worker but a shop assistant is not; an engine driver is a manual worker but a ticket collector may not be so described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This kind of thing was all right in the early fifties when social welfare legislation to deal with it was being drafted, but it has no relevance to today's conditions.  In those days, manual workers were very lowly paid and there was no income limit for them.  Nowadays we find a manual worker having eligibility although he is earning £250 a week but a non-manual worker with £4,000 a year is not eligible because of this distinction. It is because of the variety and number of the anomalies that we on these benches did not agree with the Fine Gael motion.  We suggest there is only one answer, and that is total abolition <Col N="1116" /> of the present system and implementation of a free hospital scheme for all.</P>
    <P>If our priorities were right and we had a choice of a free family doctor service or free hospitalisation, we would opt for the former for the entire community.  We do not have that option and therefore there are thousands of people who find themselves in serious difficulties and will continue to be in such difficulties untill the matter has been clarified by the Minister. Without such clarification, 85,000 people will find themselves in difficulties this year in regard to eligibility for free hospital services.  It appears to be the Minister's intention to ensure that those who had an income of £3,000 in 1976 will continue to be eligible for free hospitalisation up to 1979.  I will quote a statement by the Minister on this matter from column 313 of Volume 305 of the Official Report.  In reply to a question on 11 April last the Minister said in the Dáil:</P>
    <P>All insured workers who were eligible because their earnings came within the £3,000 limit when it was first introduced in July 1976 are still eligible, and will retain this eligibility at least until the beginning of 1979, even though their incomes may since have exceeded this limit.</P>
    <P>I should like the officers of health boards to pay attention to that declaration by the Minister, which was made without equivocation.  Even though their incomes since may have exceeded £3,000 per annum they will remain eligible, according to the Minister, until 1979.  That statement by the Minister eliminates doubts on this matter.</P>
    <P>Indeed the Minister will create more problems for himself if he begins to try to remedy the existing anomalies. That is not the way to do it.  His predecessor announced in October 1973 that he would be having discussions with the medical profession on this. These discussions took place over a period of many months and I had regular reports on them.  The report given to the medical profession was that shadow boxing was going on and <Col N="1117" /> that there were no actual negotiations going on in the Department.  Perhaps that is a one-sided view but that is the information given to me.</P>
    <P>I sounded out the medical profession on the issue and I have no doubt that they would be prepared and more than happy to operate a completely free hospitalisation scheme. They did remark that the Minister said the cost would be £1.8 million and that perhaps the decimal point was in the wrong place and it should be £18 million.  Be that as it may, they were prepared to operate this scheme but they would not operate it under the present method of payment to consultants which was introduced by the Health Act, 1953 and which paid consultants under a pool payments scheme.</P>
    <P>It was an iniquitous system and operated as follows: a consultant was paid for every day the patient was in hospital.  First, this was wrong in principle because it encouraged consultants to keep patients in hospital. Secondly, they were paid a miserable fee.  For instance, a surgeon might perform a major heart operation lasting six or eight hours and in return he would get as much as £6.  This is a very complicated and complex system. As I said, this was an iniquitous scheme in every respect because it encouraged consultants to keep patients in hospital.</P>
    <P>For years, consultants have been trying to rid themselves of this terrible system.  They were prepared to operate the scheme at the beginning because they said they had a high proportion of private patients who were outside the insurance scheme who would be charged more.  If the Minister were to bring in a total, free hospitalisation scheme they felt they could not and would not operate it under the pool payments scheme.  They said the Minister had miscalculated his estimate of what it would cost and that is why they said the decimal point was in the wrong place.</P>
    <P>A while ago the Minister said that a free hospitalisation scheme would cost £17 million.  I would like to show him that it will not; I would like to talk about what it will cost.  When we <Col N="1118" /> talk about a free hospitalisation scheme we are talking about 15 per cent of the population because 85 per cent of the public have entitlement to free hospitalisation.  Of that 15 per cent we may safely say there will be 5 to 7 per cent who will not avail of the free hospitalisation scheme because they will opt for private care, as happened in Britain.  We can talk now in terms of the 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>If we pay the consultants the same rates paid by the VHI for in-patient services for private patients in 1976, this would work out at £9.25 million for ordinary hospitalisation care.  If we talk about an average of six days maternity&mdash;the maximum&mdash;we are talking in terms of £550,000.  If we take £70 per doctor for delivery of babies, we are talking in terms of another £470,000.  At 1976 prices this would work out at £10.27 million.  If we bring that up to today's figures the cost of a free hospitalisation scheme would be £12.6 million.  I do not think I have been trimming or cutting the figures because I have given the returns of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board for the people who are ineligible under the present system for free hospitalisation.  At today's figures, allowing for 12 per cent and 8.5 per cent, I calculate it would cost £12.6 million.  That is a far cry from the Minister's figure of £17 million.</P>
    <P>How will we get £12.5 million? Let us look at what we get from car tax.  We should talk about what the car tax and the wealth tax cost the State.  The cost <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other benefits issued would not be enormous and in one fell swoop the Minister could solve the whole problem.  Admittedly he has to negotiate with the profession and, like any trade union, they want to negotiate with him.  I think there would be no problem there. All he has to do is talk to them.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister's reply is not being torn up.  I thought I had converted him and that there was no need to speak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the cost would not be phenomenal.  He could negotiate a settlement of fee per item of service or schedule of fees, a sessional fee and perhaps a salary plus off duty hours for surgeons and others working in health board areas. The question of negotiating with the profession would not be a major problem.  The Minister will agree, and I do not think I am flattering him too much when I say that as he has the confidence of the profession a problem would not arise.</P>
      <P>How is he going to get the money? We could talk in terms of what he is aiming to introduce.  Will it be pay-related social welfare and health contributions? I firmly believe that if all workers, farmers, self-employed, directors and others, were to pay social welfare contributions under a pay-related scheme, 1 per cent or even 2 per cent would bring in the necessary money.  We could do this and eliminate the many anomalies which exist and so solve the problem.</P>
      <P>An argument is being put forward that this would put a tremendous burden on our hospitals and that they would be unable to cope.  There is no reason why the subvention to the private hospitals could not be increased to enable them to operate within the system.  The Minister knows that if he were to increase the subvention he would get the full cooperation of the private hospitals who could provide the extra beds that would be required were such a tremendous demand to be made on the national hospitalisation scheme. We need not fear that the dangers that have been suggested would arise were a free hospitalisation scheme to be introduced.  The arguments in relation to beds, the profession and the problems that would arise can be discounted to a large extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would be a problem in collecting money from the farming community.  On checking up today I <Col N="1120" /> discovered that the farming community owe the Department about £500,000 in health contributions.  That is not fair to the PAYE workers who must pay weekly contributions compulsorily while the farmers get away with it because it is so difficult to collect the £24 a year.  To owe the State £500,000 is serious and significant and some effort should be made to recover the money.  If it were compulsory for everyone to have an insurance stamp this would solve the problem of the self-employed, the directors, the farmers and so on.  This is the case in Britain and there is no reason why it could not be introduced here.</P>
    <P>We are one of the few countries in the EEC that do not provide free hospitalisation. Twelve million pounds would provide free hospitalisation.  It cost the State £28 million to abolish car tax and six times what I have suggested it would cost to abolish the eligibility limit, to remove the rates, and £8 million to abolish the wealth tax.  We must put things into proper perspective when we wish to benefit the population.  I am inundated with complaints by people who are just barely outside the eligibility limit who have to pay the full hospitalisation charges.  The Minister may say that there is voluntary health insurance for those who are ineligible but the voluntary health insurance does not provide free maternity service.  The full cost of maternity services must be borne by people who are just outside the eligibility limit.  It costs up to £300 for delivery and £20 odd a day for a bed in the Coombe Hospital and from £70 to £150 for the services of an obstetrician.  The answer to the problem is not for people who are outside the limit to join the VHI: the only answer is a proper free hospitalisation scheme.</P>
    <P>I found a lot of faults in the motion which Fine Gael had put down.  If we were to increase the eligibility on the basis of income we would again create further anomalies.  In relation to the £60 valuation, on checking with the Department I found that that was equivalent to £5,400 a year for a PAYE worker.  That is a terrible discrepancy and disparity.  The farmer can have £5,400 a year but the manual <Col N="1121" /> worker can only have £3,000.  This will continue to be wrong as long as we have this basis for deciding eligibility for free hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he will definitely not bring in free hospitalisation and that he has the report of the working party established to investigate how pay-related contributions work.  The motion as proposed by the Fine Gael Party would have been debated in a vacuum unless the Minister came forward with the report. I hope that in this debate the Minister will provide us with a rough outline of the report.  Is it the Minister's intention to introduce another ceiling of, say, £5,000 or £6,000 instead of the £3,000?  Will there be a separate health and social welfare contribution and if so will the Minister keep the contribution to 6 per cent of total expenditure, or is it the intention to increase this dramatically?  How can the Minister bring in another ceiling of, say, £5,000 without at the same time creating tremendous difficulties for those who would be just outside the limit?  Will the Minister make a ceiling for manual workers and for non-manual workers?  If the Minister makes a ceiling of £5,000 or £6,000 for non-manual workers he will create a serious problem because in effect he will be denying the right of manual workers to free hospitalisation irrespective of their income.  In creating a ceiling for one and all the Minister would create perhaps the most serious problem he could encounter as Minister for Health.  There would be a revolt among the manual workers who would be denied their rights under the Social Welfare Act.  My arguments illustrate that the answer is not to bring in a new ceiling, not to extend the limit of eligibility, but once and for all to say: &ldquo;It is free hospitalisation; I am in favour of it and I am going to have a pay-related contribution scheme&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Department get its own money so that it has full control over this scheme and not have the finance coming from the Department of Finance.  I believe that the State, operating a proper pay-related scheme, can provide the necessary <Col N="1122" /> finance to provide a free hospitalisation scheme.  I have costed it, based on VHI figures; it is not impossible. I suggest the Minister would have no difficulty in bringing about a speedy solution to negotiations with the Department of Health were he to operate the VHI system of payment to the doctors.  Once and for all, he would have the whole problem solved.  It is £12.6 million at today's prices, not an enormous amount and, having regard to the fact that the pay-related contributions would cover it, he could get agreement with the profession and would not be bringing on his head the wrath of the manual workers who will be deprived of eligibility as a number of them will be under a new ceiling scheme.  The only answer is a free hospitalisation scheme.  Also, he would not face the problem that has been mentioned, that the hospitals would not be able to cope with admissions, if he were to bring in the private hospitals and increase subventions to them.</P>
    <P>The solution is not extending the limit of eligibility; it is not the text of the Minister's amendment which notes:</P>
    <P>...that it is the Government's intention to review the income limits and criteria of eligibility for the purposes of limited eligibility for health services in conjunction with the introduction of a pay-related health and social insurance contribution scheme in April 1979.</P>
    <P>From that, it would seem that the Minister proposes a new ceiling denying perhaps thousands of manual workers their rights established over many years.  I base my idea of the Minister's intention on his amendment to our motion and I would say that he is creating serious problems for his Department and the Government.  I ask him to consider the matter seriously and perhaps even say that he is prepared to discuss and consider the problem of ending once and for all this terrible inequity.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister&mdash;and it is important for him to do it now&mdash;and his Department to issue a directive to the health boards who are not aware of the Minister's statement in the <Col N="1123" /> House, that all those whose income came within the limit of £3,000 in 1976 are eligible for free hospitalisation up to at least 1979.  I know the Minister feels that way inclined and has stated this but I want him to say it to the health board officials who are not carrying out the Minister's wishes in this regard.  If he did this I feel sure that in the meantime, while he is considering my proposals for free hospitalisation, he might relieve the anxiety of so many people who find themselves at present ineligible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes that it is the Government's intention to review the income limits and criteria of eligibility for the purposes of limited eligibility for health services in conjunction with the introduction of a pay-related health and social insurance contribution scheme in April 1979&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the outset&mdash;and I am sure the Chair will agree with me on this&mdash; may I say that I would like to congratulate Deputy O'Connell on proposing this motion on this complicated matter at such short notice and on making such a knowledgeable contribution. That is not to say that I agree with everything he says but I think everybody in the House would understand that it shows that he has a very thorough and competent knowledge of our health services when he is able at such short notice to speak with such authority on a complex matter of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is general agreement on the need to review the figure of £3,000 which governs eligibility for hospital and maternity services at present. I do not agree, however, that the figure needs to be changed immediately, particularly when the whole question of eligibility for these services will have to be looked at afresh in the context of the introduction of the new pay-related contributions scheme <Col N="1124" /> next April.  I hope to satisfy the House that it is wiser to wait on that review rather than to complicate an already very intricate system of eligibility by changing the figure of £3,000 at this stage.  I am reinforced in my view by the fact to which Deputy O'Connell has adverted namely, that there is no insured worker who was eligible because his earnings came within the limit in July 1976, when the change was made, who will go out of benefit of eligibility before the beginning of 1979 at the earliest.  I think Deputy O'Connell understands how that works but perhaps for the benefit of other Deputies I shall run over it.</P>
    <P>When the limit was raised to £3,000 in July 1976 the following situation obtained: any worker who went over the figure of £3,000 subsequently retained eligibility until the end of the contribution year and two full years after that.  The statement which I have made and to which Deputy O'Connell adverted and which he has asked me to confirm and which I now confirm is true, namely, that nobody will go out of eligibility for limited eligibility who was eligible because he was within the limit in July 1976 until the end of 1979 at the earliest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 1978, the beginning of 1979 or the end of 1978 at the earliest.  That gives us time to go into this situation and to take fairly important crucial decisions which will affect the future of our health services for a considerable time to come.  And it is as well that we should have that time.  I am prepared to discuss the situation with Deputy O'Connell or with Deputy Boland, the Fine Gael spokesman on Health, at any time between now and the end of this year, if they wish to put any particular points of view before me. I am quite certain that I shall be receiving many submissions, and contributions and much advice from interested bodies between now and then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me first refer to the past history of this income limit for the record. It was first fixed at £600 in 1953, was <Col N="1125" /> adjusted to £800 in 1958, to £1,200 in 1966 and to £1,600 in 1971.  These limits applied both to insured workers and self-employed persons and for both categories the £1,600 limit remained in effect until April 1974. Then, the limit for insured workers was raised to £2,250 and remained at that level until July 1976.  The limit for self-employed persons remained, however, at £1,600 from 1971 until July 1976.  The present limit of £3,000 a year was then fixed for both the insured workers and the self-employed.</P>
    <P>I am not giving that history of this income limit figure because I think that the way things were decided in the past should necessarily determine how we are going to decide them in the future.  I mention that to bring out the point that it has always been accepted that there were sound practical reasons for not making changes in the limit too frequently.  Indeed, during the years up to 1976 when inflation was at a much greater rate than at present there was probably a greater case for more frequent changes in the income limits than there is at present.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms levelled at the present system of limited eligibility for health services is that it is too complex and not easily understood. That is a criticism we must all recognise.  The reason for it is that changes had to be made in the system from time to time to meet the needs of changing circumstances.  The result is that there is a widespread misunderstanding about how the system works and what cover it provides.  In fact, there was a question on the Order Paper recently, put down by a Deputy with some experience, and the nature of it indicated that he did not understand fully how the system worked. It might be helpful if I availed of this opportunity to describe in some detail how limited eligibility operates and, in doing so, to refer in particular to the aspects of it which have been criticised.</P>
    <P>The services which are made available to persons with limited eligibility are in three main categories.  Firstly, there is free hospital service for both in-patients and out-patients.  This includes <Col N="1126" /> the major diagnostic procedures such as X-rays and laboratory tests. Secondly, there is free maternity and infant welfare services.  This covers general practitioner services as well as hospital and specialist services.  It is important to note that the free maternity and infant welfare services which are included cover general practitioner services.  The third is that there is a refund of part of the cost of prescribed medicines.  In effect, this limits the monthly outlay on medicines to £6.50.  Persons who have limited eligibility may also be put in three broad categories; (1) insured workers, subject to a remuneration limit of £3,000 per annum in the case of non-manual workers; (2) self-employed and others subject to an income limit of £3,000 per annum and (3) farmers with a valuation of £60 or less, as mentioned by Deputy O'Connell.</P>
    <P>The great majority of persons with limited eligibility are in the first category, insured workers and their families.  In this category the income limit applies to non-manual workers but not to manual workers.  This is emerging as the major anomaly in the system and one which is subject to the severest criticism.  The preferential treatment given to manual workers <i>vis-à-vis</i> non-manual colleagues is not of recent origin.  It dates back to the time when the status of the manual worker was such that special provision had to be made for him in the social welfare code.  With the improvements which have taken place in the working conditions and status of manual workers the need to make this distinction has largely disappeared. In fact, the distinction between manual and non-manual workers has been eliminated for purposes of social insurance.</P>
    <P>The operation of the income limit for non-manual workers is not always fully understood.  The present limit is £3,000 per annum.  Any person whose remuneration is within this limit is eligible but if his remuneration goes over the limit he does not immediately lose eligibility. In fact, he retains eligibility for the balance of the social welfare contribution year in which the remuneration limit is exceeded and for two further <Col N="1127" /> such years.  This provision can therefore result in prolonging entitlement for as much as three years after the limit has been exceeded.  A worker who was within the £3,000 limit on or after 1 July 1976, when it first came into operation, is still eligible no matter what income he has now.  At worst his eligibility will expire at the beginning of 1979.  It is not therefore correct to infer that rising income levels are excluding thousands of non-manual workers from eligibility.  There are many workers whose pay was within the £3,000 limit when it was first introduced in July 1976 but which has since exceeded that limit.  In some cases the amount by which the limit has been exceeded is quite considerable. These workers have not lost eligibility, nor is there any question of their losing it this year.  If there is any problem in this regard in any individual case Deputies should notify me immediately.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I appreciate that a limit of £3,000, as such, is now out of date.  An advantage of the provisions which I have just described however is that in times of rapid movements in earnings it is not immediately necessary to make compensatory changes in eligibility limits. Even though the limit may have fallen behind the movements in earnings, this does not have any immediate effect on eligibility.  The operation of the carryover entitlement provisions gives a period of grace in which a review of the eligibility criteria can be carried out and the limit can be revised.  As I said, earlier, that is what we hope to do now.</P>
    <P>I know that there can be individual cases which can be excluded harshly from eligibility pending a periodical review of the limit, but there is a &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; provision which enables eligibility for specific services to be extended to otherwise ineligible persons including those who have exhausted the standard requirements. This provision safeguards the position of persons who, though they are ineligible by reference to the standard criteria, may yet be unable to meet the cost of a necessary service.  It has <Col N="1128" /> an essential complementary role to the normal rules of eligibility.  It adds flexibility to the system by providing that persons whose income may be just outside the limit are not necessarily debarred from availing of a service which they require.  Deputies know about this but it is important that we should not think that just because we know about it that everybody knows.  There is that important provision overriding everything else, that anybody who needs a particular service and who can clearly show that he cannot avail of that service without hardship can be granted the service free of charge or on a special condition by the CEO.</P>
    <P>The question of charging the £60 valuation limit for farmers was referred to in the Fine Gael motion which has fallen by the wayside, but I should like to deal with it now that we are discussing this whole situation. One advantage of this criterion of eligibility is that the selected valuation figure is not disturbed by inflation.  A change in money values or an increase in farm incomes does not affect farm valuation.  It does not therefore affect the eligibility of farmers.  The reasons why the £3,000 limit is going out of date and needs to be reviewed do not apply to valuation and there is not the same case for changing this criterion. Indeed, if one applies a realistic multiplier to valuation to assess its equivalent in present-day farmers' incomes I am sure that £60 would equate to much more than £3,000 per year. That is a point made by Deputy O'Connell.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell proposes that all income limits be abolished, and that has certain attractions.  In effect, that would involve the extension of free hospital services to the entire community. To do this would inevitably add further to the cost of the health services.  If, however, there is an overwhelming need for this extension of services then I think we would have to face up to the difficulty which it would create.  We must question, however, whether such a need does in fact exist.  Our present objective is to ensure that everybody who needs hospital services is able to obtain such <Col N="1129" /> services without incurring financial hardship.  If this objective is being achieved equitably and uniformly throughout the country then the case for diverting our resources for a free-for-all hospital service rather than towards other priority areas in the health services is open to question.</P>
    <P>I suspect that Deputy O'Connell has mixed feelings about this matter. He is on record as saying that he would prefer to see moneys devoted to the general medical service rather than to a free hospitalisation scheme if that was the necessary priority.  To some extent he agrees with that again this evening.  That is a very rational view to take, particularly in view of the fact that I know that Deputy O'Connell, and most Deputies, subscribe to the policy objectives which I have and former Ministers have had of trying to keep people out of hospitals rather than in them and to get away from this hospital-obsessed concept of Irish medicine.  We want to try to devote increasing resources to community facilities and community medicine, to health centres and clinics in the community.  We want more medicine and health services brought out to the people in the community, more people kept in their community. That opens up a large field which I do not intend to debate now.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to hospital charges.  It may be helpful if I describe in some detail the context in which these charges are made.  There is no charge for hospital services provided in public ward accommodation for persons with full eligibility or with limited eligibility for health services. Charges are payable only by persons who are not eligible for health services and by eligible persons who decide to make private arrangements with a consultant of their own choice for treatment in private or semi-private accommodation.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice to adjust these charges from time to time in the light of increases in hospital costs and the disparity between the charges levied and the actual cost of the services provided.  It is estimated that the cost of general hospital services will <Col N="1130" /> rise to £180 million for 1978 from a figure of about £152 million for 1977. This represents an increase of just over 18 per cent.  The charges payable have always been very substantially less than the actual cost of services, and although the charges have been increased by 20 per cent, which is marginally greater than the estimated increase in the cost of services, the revised charges will in the case of the major hospitals represent, on average, only about 50 per cent of the actual cost of services for ineligible persons.  For example, the revised charge for private accommodation in a voluntary teaching hospital is about £20 a day.  The actual cost will be as high as £40 a day.  In the case of eligible persons the charge for private accommodation will represent, on average, only about 20 per cent of the actual cost in the larger hospitals.  I think, therefore, it will be generally accepted that the increases in the rates of charge are not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Most persons who are liable for hospital charges are insured with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  I should mention in this regard that the board are currently arranging to allow members who may be underinsured on the basis of the revised charges to increase their cover with effect from 1 May and in advance of ordinary renewal dates.  About 640,000 persons are at present covered under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme&mdash; and I think Deputies will agree that is a very impressive figure; it reflects the great success of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme&mdash;of whom about 190,000 have statutory entitlement to services but take out the insurance cover needed to meet the charges payable in respect of private or semi-private accommodation.  That is another very interesting figure.  Of that 640,000, 190,000 who would have eligibility nevertheless take out cover for private or semi-private accommodation.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that if a person is not eligible for free hospital services, or if, being eligible, he or she would choose private or semi-private care in the event of needing to go to hospital, it would be prudent for him or her to take out insurance with the <Col N="1131" /> Voluntary Health Insurance Board and to be guided by the board on the extent of the cover needed.  It is apparent from the numbers covered by the scheme that it is a very attractive proposition.  The cost of insurance is not likely to cause hardship. For example, in the case of a married man with two children who decides to take out cover for semi-private accommodation based on the latest minimum number of maintenance units recommended by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, the gross annual cost of insurance against hospital maintenance charges will now be about £104 a year.  Of course, these insurance premiums are eligible for income tax relief.</P>
    <P>This means that in the case of a person whose maximum rate of income tax is 35p in the £ the income tax relief on a premium of £104 a year will be just over £36 a year.  Thus the net cost of insurance in this case will be of the order of £68 a year.  The important point in this context, however, is that for such a man the cost of &ldquo;topping-up&rdquo; voluntary health insurance cover to meet the increase in charges this year will be only £10.20 gross.  For a single person, the cost would be only £3.48.  In each case, the increased amount would, of course, be tax-deductible.  I recognise in saying all that, that the big gap is cover for maternity, I suppose, the theory being that the family man is expected to anticipate maternity.</P>

      <P>He is expected, I suppose, to make provision for this not unexpected event.  If for any reason an ineligible person fails to insure against illness with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and is faced with a bill for hospital costs which he finds difficulty in meeting he can apply for assistance to the health board.  It is important again that I should emphasise this.  As I have already explained, the health board has power to provide a service <Col N="1132" /> for an ineligible person who is considered by the chief executive officer of the board to be unable, without undue hardship, to provide the service from his own resources.  Even if there is no eligibility, no voluntary health insurance, the resources of the system are still not exhausted and the CEO can step in and provide the benefit in cases of hardship.</P>
      <P>It is, I think, important to emphasise, because of the misunderstanding that persists about the operation of limited eligibility, that the criteria of eligibility will be reviewed and changed, as necessary, before any large-scale loss of eligibility arises.</P>
      <P>As I said, the existing system gives us this carry over, this time, in which to come to decisions between now and the end of the year.  I accept that the rules of eligibility are not satisfactory. Deputy O'Connell asked about the difference between manual and non-manual workers.  There is a guide which CEOs use for their own purposes under which they endeavour to distinguish between professions or vocations which are manual and non-manual. Having said that, I admit it is very anomalous to find when two men are working in a pub, one is a foreman and he is ineligible, and the other is a barman and he is eligible and so on.  I could give many other examples of the same sort.  I am aware that there are a number of anomalies and that an income limit of £3,000 has been affected by inflation.  The rules are such however that the eligibility of workers whose income came within the limit when it was first introduced is not now at risk.  Their eligibility is guaranteed at least until the beginning of 1979.  In the meantime the income limit and criteria of eligibility will be the subject of very careful examination and review.  As I have already indicated I have the report of the working party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In doing this review, the objective of ensuring that nobody will be denied necessary hospital treatment and other health services because of inability to pay must be the principal aim.  The need to have the system applied equitable and uniformly to all sections of the community is also a high <Col N="1133" /> priority.  In addition, within the constraints imposed by these requirements it is important that the criteria of eligibility are such that they are easily understood and that nobody is left in any doubt about what services he is entitled to.  These are all worth-while objectives and, while it is clear that they will not easily be achieved, I do not think many people will dispute the desirability of doing so and the desirability of concentrating our efforts on making this major change in 1979, so as to remove all anomalies from the system and provide a better basis for the future planning of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first of all thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the manner in which you allowed the Labour Party motion to be taken at such short notice.  I want to apologise for the inability of the Fine Gael spokesman on health, who is indisposed, to deal with the Fine Gael motion.  I also want to thank the Minister for accepting this motion at short notice.  I appreciate the Minister's co-operation in this matter.</P>
      <P>I will confine my remarks to the question of the £3,000 per annum limited eligibility for the services from the various health boards in respect of non-manual workers and the £60 valuation in respect of farmers.  Besically on this motion I am interested in non-manual workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite what the Minister had to say in relation to the position since July 1976, that those who were eligible as at July 1976 would remain eligible up to the beginning of 1979, I suggest that his sweeping statement, while seemingly correct, contains certain anomalies which I should like to point out to him.  For instance, what about people who take up non-manual employment and earn in excess of £3,000? They immediately become ineligible for services under the various health boards.  That is one of the anomalies that arises from the Minister's tardiness in changing the income limit.  As I understand it, the statement of July 1976 is only valid under national wage agreements.  In other words, those who were eligible under the £3,000 threshold <Col N="1134" /> will continue to be eligible only under national pay agreement increases.  They will not be eligible if their salary increases are by way of increments, overtime payments, productivity payments or payments for anomaly claims under wage agreements.</P>
    <P>While the Minister's statement seems to be all-embracing, it must be obvious that that is not so, particularly in respect of those who take up non-manual employment where the income of £3,000 is not high.  It is not high now because of the savage rate of inflation which we experienced in the past three years.  An income of £3,000 is not high and is one which is frequently paid to non-manual workers with any kind of ability.  There is need for an immediate raising of the threshold.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not seen fit to raise the threshold though he freely admits that the £3,000 limit is unsatisfactory.  I appreciate that he is introducing a pay-related health contribution scheme in April next year. We can only look forward to that scheme to a certain extent.  I wonder what the workers' contribution will be to that new scheme.  When one considers the increases in the insurance scheme in this year's budget one would be hesitant to welcome the new scheme until one sees the fine print.  A better way would have been immediately to change the £3,000 limit on non-manual workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the position of workers above eligibility limits, whether full or limited eligibility limits, who contract a chronic disease or one which requires expensive medicine on a continuous basis.  It is my experience that the health board officers are sympathetic and helpful in these cases.  I would ask the Minister to make more public the complete list of diseases which qualify for special financial assistance. Many people are not aware of their rights under the Health Act in respect of a number of serious illnesses.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the directors of community care, the superintendent assistance officers and assistance officers, who do excellent work in dealing with what can only be described as delicate matters.  In some places the assistance officers come in <Col N="1135" /> for a fair bit of criticism from those who have been disappointed.  The assistance officers perform a valuable service for the community and they disburse the money that is available to them very fairly.  They also have responsibility for issuing medical cards.</P>
    <P>In relation to the VHI scheme, the mover of the motion, Deputy O'Connell, said that it would cost £12.6 million to transfer it to central funds. This is a difficult policy area.  There is not a great demand for a full free health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a feeling abroad that one should provide for one's illnesses.  At the same time, I want to make it clear that a priority in my party's health programme is that the hospital care provided for those who benefit under the Health Act should be at least equal to the care that is available to private patients.  It is also important that our public schools be of the same standard as our private schools.  That comparison must always be there.  Without it there would be a loss of confidence in our democratic institutions.  It is important that our public hospital services be of a high standard.  There should be a choice in relation to the type of service a patient wishes to use and the precautions he wishes to take for his own health and the health of his family.  The society in which we live appreciates the availability of alternatives and we should not be too dogmatic about this aspect of health policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to his statement, the Minister is burying his head in the sand.  His proposals in respect of next April are not going to solve this anomaly.  He has given no indication whatsoever of the contents of his proposed scheme, and because of that I have become suspicious of his intentions in this matter.  I am sorry that he spoke before me because I would like him to answer my case in relation to those within the working sphere <Col N="1136" /> who earn over £3,000 and who will now not be eligible for hospital and health care.  It is an area which he and his predecessor in government should have tackled and so it is not necessarily a political argument because the present Minister can always point the finger at that.  Nevertheless, I am convinced that an anomaly exists in this area, and the Minister should have seen fit to take the bull by the horns and amend the threshold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's amendment.  An important point, which has been stressed on a previous occasion by the Minister and which Deputy O'Connell mentioned, is that anybody who was eligible for the limited eligibility service in July 1976 will maintain that eligibility up to the end of December of this year.  Those who are getting an increase in their income during the year and find themselves going above the £3,000 are mainly the people who are concerned about their ability to pay for the hospital service and the other services under limited eligibility.  It is important to point out for people entitled to limited eligibility what services they are entitled to.  They are entitled to free hospital service in a public ward. It is important to stress that this is in a public ward, because one of the problems we meet as members of health boards is that occasionally when a person goes into private accommodation he may feel when he comes out of hospital that he is unable to meet the cost and then he will try to get the health board to meet it.  The health boards generally are not in a position to do this because the applicant has opted for private accommodation.  Other services on limited eligibility are the free maternity service, the free general practitioner service and the free infant care service for the first six weeks after the baby is born.  There is also a subsidy on drugs for those who spend more than £6.50 a month on their drug bill.  Patients suffering from what are known as long-term illnesses have access to free drugs in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell made an interesting point when he was talking about the costing of a free comprehensive <Col N="1137" /> hospital service.  He mentioned the cost of the removal of the car tax, and I wondered if he was suggesting that the car tax might be maintained in order to give the 15 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>They are certainly better off than the people who have the car tax relief.  The hospital out-patients departments in my area have done an excellent job but they are taxed to the limit to cater for those who are already eligible for their services.  If there was any sudden change at present they would not be able to cope with the increased numbers who would be eligible for the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to health contributions, a Bill was going through to increase the health contribution this year. I mention again the question that Dr. O'Connell brought up of farmers not paying their contributions.  In some of the health board areas at the moment there are threats of legal action against those who will not pay their contributions.  There is a certain difficulty in the method by which health contributions are collected because there are three different avenues through which this is done.  For those who pay an insurance stamp the contribution is collected automatically and this is probably a very simple way.  Farmers with a valuation of less than £60 whose main income is derived from farming pay their health contribution direct to the health board. Those who are self-employed and earning less than £3,000 pay their contribution to the Revenue Commissioners. <Col N="1138" /> Sometimes there is a delay for the last group in that they have to get an auditor's return to send to the Revenue Commissioners and then there can be a delay in getting into benefit.  Another problem in relation to the health contribution is that the health contribution year starts on 1 October and the increase in cost in the health contribution generally dates from 1 April.  This in effect means that if you pay your health contribution on 1 October you are due a further instalment on 1 April in any year that there is an increase.</P>
    <P>In relation to the hardship clause, anywhere there is a means test there will always be the occasional case of hardship.  In my health board area the CEO has on occasion used his discretion where there have been genuine cases of hardship.  I have never seen it as a problem that anybody was denied the medical service either at hospital level or at general medical service level because he or she was outside the guidelines laid down or outside the £3,000 limit in the case of hospitals. In relation to the means test for hospital service one has to have regard only to the situation where a single person with an income of £3,000 is entitled to benefit while perhaps a married man with a large family and earning just more than £3,000 is excluded. The CEO has discretionary powers in hardship cases.  Certainly, the CEO in my area uses this discretion. Those who are not entitled to benefit in respect of hospital services are usually covered by voluntary health insurance so it is unusual to find someone who has no cover whatever.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that of the 640,000 persons covered by voluntary health insurance, 190,000 qualify for limited eligibility.  That is a significant proportion.  Another point made was that the emphasis should be on community care rather than on hospitalisation and that the priority should be on extending the general medical service rather than extending the eligibility limit in respect of the cost of hospitalisation. That should be the fundamental aim of any health service because, first, patients are not anxious <Col N="1139" /> to go into hospital if there is a possibility that they can be treated at home.  Before the general medical practitioner service came into being patients often opted to go to hospital even for minor complaints because the cost involved in being treated there would be less than the cost involved in being treated at home, having regard to doctors' fees, cost of drugs and so on in cases where there were no medical cards.  That situation must have been responsible for much unnecessary cost to the health services. In those days the cost of hospitalisation to those earning less than a certain amount was only 50p per day.  The present situation is that 70 per cent of the health service cost is in respect of hospitals as against 24 per cent for community care.  This is a situation that one would like to see reversed. There is need for much greater development of the community services.</P>
    <P>I support fully the Minister's amendment. Having regard to the Minister's statement concerning those whose incomes are more than £3,000, I do not see any need for an immediate change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with some of the points made emphatically by the Minister but I may have to quarrel with him on some of his more global assertions in relation particularly to the £3,000 income limit. Suffice it to say that if, for example, one were a garda&mdash;take a member of the representative body&mdash;and exceeded the limit simply by reason of the incremental scale, one finds that one is out of eligibility but by reason of the existing interpretation, that is, on the basis <Col N="1140" /> of a transference into the £3,000 limit under the national pay agreement, one would remain in and would get the benefit of an extension of two years. There are some classic examples in this regard and the situation is by no means as comforting as the Minister has suggested in his interpretation of the regulations.</P>
      <P>There are many thousands of workers who have ceased to be eligible and who each month because of incremental salary scales, because of overtime payments and having average earnings assessed, leaving aside the technicality whereby the Minister maintains they can continue to be eligible, are going out of eligibility.  That is the nub of the problem and no amount of delicate footwork on the part of the Minister can change that.  It is the regulation that matters, not what the Minister says.  I can assure him that I have had correspondence with the ICTU, with the Garda Representative Body and with the POWU from which I can give many examples of the point I am making.</P>

      <P>The pension of the person <Col N="1032" /> concerned was one in which a supplement being paid under EEC regulations has been found not to be payable. In addition, due to an oversight, he had been paid at a higher rate than that to which he was entitled between November 1977 and April 1978.  The necessary adjustments in payments were made in conjunction with the general increases in rates from April 1978, as a result of the budget, and he is now receiving the full amount to which he is entitled.  While this is less than the amount which he had been receiving from November 1977 to April 1978, it in fact represents a slight increase in the amount to which he had actually been entitled in that period.</P>

      <P>(a)  Staff</P>
      <P>The Overseas Development Assistance Section was established in 1974. Previously the work of the section was dealt with by the Economic Division.</P>
      <P>The number of executive staff (Higher Executive Officer grade and higher) sanctioned and employed in the section from 1974 to 1976 was</P>
      <P>2 Counsellors</P>
      <P>2 First Secretaries</P>
      <P>1 Third Secretary</P>
      <P>2 Higher Executive Officers</P>
      <P>The staffing of the Section was strengthened in 1977 by the creation of new posts of</P>
      <P>1 First Secretary and</P>
      <P>1 Higher Executive Officer</P>
      <P>In 1978, a subsection of the Economic Division dealing with Community trade relations with developing countries was transferred to the section.  This sub-section consists of the following staff</P>
      <P>1 First Secretary</P>
      <P>2 Third Secretaries</P>
      <P>The section is under the responsibility of an Assistant Secretary who also has other sections under his control.</P>
      <P>(b)  Main Areas of Responsibility</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  In the multilateral area, the main responsibility of the Section is Irish participation in the elaboration of the European Community's development co-operation policies.  These policies are pursued either (i) by direct agreements between the Community and developing countries e.g. Convention of Lomé or (ii) in wider international fora such as the UN, UNCTAD, and so forth in the context of the &ldquo;North-South <Col N="1047" /> Dialogue&rdquo; between industrialised and developing countries.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Management of the Department's Bilateral Aid Programme, participation in the technical management of the aid programmes of the European Community, administration of the funds voted annually for disaster relief, the publicising of Irish development aid policy, and the mobilisation of Irish resources in response to, and in order to derive national benefit from, the aid programmes of international organisations.  This latter responsibility includes the recruitment of Irish personnel for, and the training in this country of persons on behalf of, these organisations</P>
    <P>(c)  Expansion of Work</P>
    <P>As regards the multilateral area the European Community's own programmes of development co-operation have expanded considerably since 1974.  Negotiations on the Lomé Convention were concluded in early 1975 and it entered into force in April 1976.  The convention which is now due for renegotiation is the most comprehensive agreement concluded in the field of development co-operation between industrialised and developing countries.  Also in 1976 the Co-operation Agreements with certain Mediterranean countries were concluded and new programmes of aid for nonassociated developing countries and for co-operation with non-governmental organisations were established. The Community's food aid programmes have been increased and the process of harmonising member states' development policies has been intensified. Over the same period there has been a series of major international conferences dealing with economic co-operation and development in which the European Community has taken an increasingly active part, for example, Special Sessions of the United Nations General Assembly (April 1974 and September 1975), the Fourth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development&mdash;UNCTAD (May 1976) and the Conference on International Economic Co-operation (Paris.  October 1975&mdash;June 1977).  A <Col N="1048" /> further Special Session of the UN General Assembly to deal specifically with development matters will be held in 1980 and in preparation for this the UN Overview Committee has been established to monitor the entire range of negotiations which are under way in various fora.  Community co-ordination in preparation for these multilateral negotiating sessions and meetings is becoming more and more intensive.</P>
    <P>The work in the bilateral area has also increased very considerably.  This is due in large part to the substantial anual growth of the Bilateral Aid Programme. This programme is planned, administered and executed by the Department and since 1974, when it was established, the amount available to the programme has been increased sixfold.  Since 1975 the section has been responsible for participation in the technical management of the aid programmes of the Community which were established under the Lomé Convention. These programmes include the European Development Fund (EDF) Committee, which manages financial and technical assistance grants, and the Article 22 committee which manages loans, granted with interest rate subsidy, by the European Investment Bank (EIB).  Likewise, when other Community agreements become operational in the technical assistance area, the section assumes responsibility for participation in their technical management.  This is beginning to happen at the moment, for instance, in the case of the agreements between the Community and the Maghreb and Machrek countries.</P>

      <P>I understand that a scheme of 14 houses completed in 1975 in Ballyhea was planned and carried out by Cork County Council as a devolved scheme.  I am informed that the original sewerage system, provided at a cost of approximately £1,000, consisted of a communal septic tank which proved inefficient due mainly to the sloping nature of the site and the poor soakage characteristics of the soil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> The county council decided to provide a new sewerage disposal system to serve the houses in question and work on its completion will commence shortly.  The estimated cost of the new scheme, which will incorporate the existing septic tank, is £25,000.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the circumstances of the case.  I do not consider that the holding of an inquiry as suggested by the Deputy would serve any useful purpose.</P>

On 26th October 1977 the applicant sought the £1,000 new house <Col N="1052" /> grant in respect of the same house but, as work had commenced before 27 May 1977 a grant under the new scheme could not be allowed.</P>

    <P>Capital grants towards the cost of the building and equipment were paid in the case of two of these schools. It is not in accordance with normal practice to disclose the amounts of grants paid to an individual school. A capital grant of £6,919.25 for a minor building project was paid to one secondary school which subsequently closed down.  The intention was that this accommodation would be used for primary school purposes.  Should this not materialise, a refund of the unexpired portion of the State grant would be made.</P>
    <P>In the case of one other school which closed down, a capital grant of £1,968.86 was allocated for mobile pre-fabricated classrooms.  A refund of the unexpired portion of the State grant is being made.</P>
