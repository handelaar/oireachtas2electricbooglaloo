      <P>: Tairgim leasú a 1:</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" />  Ar leathanach 2, líne 24, i ndiaidh &ldquo;mar theanga bheo&rdquo; go gcuirfear isteach &ldquo;agus mar ghnáthmheán cumarsáide&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Sé atá i gceist sa leasú seo ná go neartóidh sé an Bille féin, agus go mbeidh sprioc níos daingne á leagadh síos don bhord&mdash;go mbeidh an Ghaeilge á cur chun cinn mar theanga bheo agus in a gnáthmheán cumarsáide. Sin é an fáth a bhfuilimid á moladh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Más neartú é seo ba mhaith liom lagú a fheiceáil uair éigin.</P>
      <P>Is ar éigean bhí mé in ann é a chreidiúint nuair a chonaic mé an leasú seo dhá sheachtain ó shin.  Ní raibh ach leasú amháin ar an bpáipéar a tháinig sa phost chugam agus ba é an leasú seo é.  Is minic a rith an smaoineamh seo liom, go bhfuil cineál cluiche rúnda ar siúl sa státseirbhís agus dá mbeadh Myles na gCopaleen beo fós eisean ba thúisce a bheadh istigh leis an cluiche seo a imirt.  Sé cuspóir an chluiche seo, ná féachaint cá fhaid is féidir leis an státseirbhíseach atá i gceist an ludaramán seo d'Aire a bhrú ar bhealach na díchéille agus na seafóide.  Ní leis an Rialtas seo amháin a bhaineann sé seo ach leis an Rialtas atá imithe.  Is minic a thug mé é seo faoi deara agus muidne in oifig. Is minic a chonaic mé scrioptanna á dtabhairt amach, scrioptanna a bhí cumtha ag státseirbhísigh agus an cineál seafóide a bhí iontu ba é sin an smaoineamh a rith liom.  Ba mhaith liom gan mí-chompórd a chur ar an Aire ná gan a bheith mí fhéarálta leis. Ba mhaith liom a fhiafraí dhe an míneodh sé don Teach cén difríocht ar domhan atá le feiceáil idir &ldquo;teanga bheo&rdquo; agus &ldquo;gnáth mheán cumarsáide&rdquo;. An bhfuil difríocht ar bith idir an dá rud, seachas gur leagan lag, tuatach an tarna frása ar smaoineamh a tháinig as saol an Bhéarla: &ldquo;medium of communication&rdquo;.  Má tá difríocht idir an dá rud, ba mhaith liom dá mhíneodh an tAire dúinn é.</P>

      <P>: Níl mé.  Orainn féin chomh maith.  Dúirt mé go raibh an aidhm seo ag an státseirbhís sar a raibh an tAire seo in oifig chor ar bith. Ní ar an Aire féin atá mé ag tabhairt an téarma gránna seo chor ar bith.</P>

      <P>: Ní shílim go bhfuil sé féarálta é a thabhairt ar Aire ar bith.  Is cuma an duine atá ina Aire anois nó duine a bhí mar Aire, ní ceart go n-úsáidfí é sa Teach seo agus go mór mhór ag duine mar an Teachta Kelly.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an leasú atá molta anseo, is iad Bord na Gaeilge iad féin a d'iarr orainn an leasú seo a chur isteach. Tháinig an moladh uathu.  Is le cuidiú leo agus iad a shásamh atá an leasú seo á dhéanamh, mar go síleann siad go bhfuil sé níos fearr é a chur isteach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Aontaím leis an leasú atá ag an Aire ach an rud atá sa cheann agamsa ná nuair a bhíonn argóint nó díospóireacht ar siúl ag Bord na Gaeilge, nuair a bhíonn gnáth rudaí ar siúl ag an mbord, an bhfuil sé ceapaithe go ndéanfar gach rud tré Ghaeilge.  Bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Aire nach mbeidh éinne ar an mbord ach daoine atá ábalta an Ghaeilge a labhairt?  B'fhéidir go bhféadfaí focail mar &ldquo;chomh fada agus is féidir&rdquo; a chur isteach.  Tá daoine go bhfuil deathoil acu don Ghaeilge ach níl sí chomh líofa acu, agus b'fhéidir go mbeadh orthu dul isteach i mBéarla anois is arís.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>: Nuair a bhí an Dara Céim dá rith sa Teach tharla sé go raibh díospóireacht an-mhaith ann agus cuid de na daoine is fearr a labhair rinne siad an chuid is mó dá cuid cainte i mBéarla.  B'fhéidir go dtuigeann siadsan na deacrachtaí níos fearr ná daoine a tógadh le Gaeilge. Níl fhios agam go fóill an mbeadh daoine a bhfuil Béarla amháin acu ar an mbord.  Ní maith liom cur isteach ar an mbord fhéin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Táimse ag caint ar leasú a 2, agus sé an cuspóir a bhí againn agus muid ag cur an leasú seo síos ná seo.  Má tá an bord seo dá fheidhmiú <Col N="155" /> faoi Aire ar bith, is ionann sin agus a rá go mbeidh tús áite ag an Aire sin agus nach mbeidh neamhspleáchas ar bith ag an mbord chun polasaí nó smaoineamh ar bith a cur i gcrích. Ní gá ach féachaint ar an leagan Bhéarla den Bhille, agus séard a deireann sé sin ná:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of performing its functions the Board may do anything it considers appropriate in accord with the general policy, authorised by the Minister after consultation with any other Minister of the Government concerned, relating to those functions.</P>
      <P>Má's é sin atá i gceist ag an Aire san leagan Ghaeilge, ní bheidh aon neamhspleáchas ag an mbord muna n-aontaíonn an tAire ag an am i dtaobh polasaí an bhoird a chur i gcrích.  Ní maith liom go mbeidh an bord comh spleách sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>: Le freagra a thabhairt ar an Teachta Kelly, silim go bhfuil cumhachtaí leathan go leor ag an mbord faoi fo-alt (2).  Deireann sé go mbeidh an bord in ann &ldquo;aon ní is iomchuí leis a dhéanamh ag teacht leis an mbeartas ginearálta a bheidh údaraithe ag an Aire...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Faoi réir aon Aire Rialtais.  Cuir i gcás go mbeadh easaontas idir an mbord ar thaobh amháin agus an Aire Oideachais ar an dtaobh eile mar gheall ar polasaí teagaisc na teanga ins na scoileanna, ní bheidh aon chumhacht ná smacht ag an mbord beag nó mór faoin fo-alt seo&mdash;ní oibríonn an bord ach faoi réir an Aire. Nach féidir leis an Aire an méid sin a admháil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is é an smaoineamh taobh thiar den leasú seo ná nach bhfuil cumhacht ag an mbord in aon ní.  Beidh Bord an Gaeilge agus an tAire Oideachais ag troid agus ní bheidh aon chumhacht <Col N="156" /> ag Bord na Gaeilge aon rún a dhéanamh.  Níl orm dul isteach i gcásanna áirithe anois mar ní bheadh sé ceart é a dhéanamh.  Mar tá fhios ag cách, go mór mhór ag daoine atá ag obair sa Ghaeltacht, níl an Ghaeilge go líofa ag na múinteoirí scoile anois nó mar bhí deich mblian ó shin.  Bheadh sé an-shuimiúil a fháil amach cé mhéid múinteoirí as na Gaeltachtaí atá sna coláistí ullmhúcháin anois.  Tá sé ag méadú gach bliain.  Cúpla seachtain ó shin bhí alt san <i>Irish Times</i> ag Breandán Ó hÉithir agus scríobh sé gur tháinig méadú ar líon na ndaltaí ón Ghaeltacht sna cholaistí ullmhúcháin idir 1962 agus 1968 ó 4 faoin gcéad go 6 faoin gcéad.  Muna bhfuil an Ghaeilge go líofa ag na múinteoirí scoile ag teacht amach anois&mdash;agus tá sé seo i bhfad níos tábhachtaí anois mar tá i bhfad níos mó páistí sa tír anois ná ariamh, buíochas le Dia&mdash;tá sé riachtanach go mbeidh cumhacht ar leith ag an mbord nua seo.  Beidh dualgas ar an Roinn Oideachais dul i gcaint le Bord na Gaeilge, agus is ansin a bheidh an trioblóid.  Tá aithne agam ar bhuachaill amháin a bhí i gcoláiste ullmhúcháin.  Chuaigh sé isteach i gcóir an oral test agus d'iarr sé ar an scrúdaitheoir &ldquo;Abair é sin liom as Béarla&rdquo;, agus bhí sé in ann an cheist a fhreagairt ansin.  Tá an buachaill sin ina mhúinteoir anois.  Níl sé sin ceart. Iarraim ar an Aire glacadh leis na leasaithe atá síos ag an Teachta Kelly agus mé fhéin.  Níl aon smaointe polaitíochta iontu in aon chor.  Táimid ag iarraidh i bhfad níos mó cumhachta, fuinnimh agus fiacla a thabhairt don Aire agus don bhord chun a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Dá mbeadh easaontas idir an Bord agus an Roinn Oideachais nach bhféadfadh, san riocht ina bhfuil an Bille faoi láthair, an tAire Oideachais drom a láimhe a thabhairt don bhord?  D'fhéadfadh sé a rá: &ldquo;Ceart go leor, nílimid ar aon intinn maidir leis an gceist seo nó an gceist siúd, ach pé cumhacht atá agaibhse, is faoi mo réirse a oibreoidh sibh an chumhacht sin, agus tig libh bhur lámha a thógáil amach as an scéal sin arís.&rdquo;  Faoi mar a dúirt mé ar an Dara Céim, tá á chruthú againn inniu sa Dáil leis an mBille seo bord nach <Col N="157" /> mbeidh cumhacht ná smacht ar bith aige ar an ábhar atá i dteideal bheith faoina chúram.  Sin bun-smaoineamh an leasaithe seo&mdash;faoi mar a dúirt an Teachta Begley, níl baint ar bith leis an bpolaitaíocht san méid a dúramar&mdash;sé an t-aon chuspóir amháin atá leis an leasú seo ná beagán smachta agus cumhachta a thabhairt don bhord seo, agus gan a ligean don Aire Oideachais &mdash;eisean is mó atá i gceist againn&mdash;nó Aire ar bith eile drom a láimhe a thabhairt leis an mbord má éiríonn easontas eatarthu maidir le polasaí Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>: Ní féidir leis an Ghaeilge dul ar aghaidh mura mbíonn comh-oibriú idir gach rannóg, idir an bord féin, an Roinn Oideachais agus na rannóga Stáit ar fad, agus bheinn ag súil go mbeadh an comhoibriú sin ann.</P>
      <P>Mar gheall ar an rud a dúirt an Teachta Begley faoi cheist na Gaeilge sna coláistí oiliúna, is dócha go bhfuil cuid mhór de fíor.  Ó cuireadh deireadh leis na coláistí ullmhúcháin níl an Ghaeilge chomh láidir sna coláistí oiliúna.  Ach tharla sé sin de bharr cuid mhaith rudaí.  Ní raibh daoine sásta go mbeadh na múinteoirí ar fad ag teacht as coláistí ullmhúcháin, agus b'fhéidir go raibh an ceart acu, b'fhéidir go raibh sé mídhleathach, nach raibh sé ag tabhairt cothrom na féinne do dhaoine eile ag cur isteach ar phoist mar mhúinteoirí.  Sa Bhille féin deirtear:</P>
      <P>Beidh d'fheidhmeanna ginearálta ag an mBord, faoi réir aon Aire Rialtais a bheíth freagrach i ngné áirithe bheartais i ndáil leis an nGaeilge, bearta agus nósanna imeachta a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge a fhorbairt, a chomhordú agus a mheas agus cúnamh a thabhairt ina leith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beidh an bord in ann moltaí a thabhairt don Aire Oideachais maidir le ceist na Gaeilge agus, b'fhéidir, cuidiú le polasaí i gcomhair na Gaeilge a mholadh agus a leagan síos agus a chur ar aghaidh.  Sílim go bhfuil an Bille féin sách láidir ar an gcaoi sin agus dá bhrí sin ní shílim go bhfuil gá leis na leasaithe seo atá <Col N="158" /> molta ag an Teachta Kelly agus an Teachta Begley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Ní maith liom fanacht ag coimhlint leis an Aire, ach ní dóigh liom go bhfuil mórán nirt san mBille sa riocht ina bhfuil sé.  Cuir i gcás go mbeadh an Bille seo rite inniu agus go mbeadh ceist pholasaí teanga dá réiteach maidin amárach sa Roinn Oideachais, cuir i gcás go rabhadar ag leagan síos na ndánta, na n-amhrán, na scéalta agus mar sin, do na daoine a bheadh ag dul fé scrúdú na hArdteistiméireachta; agus cuir i gcás go dtiocfadh teachtaireacht ó Bhord na Gaeilge ag déanamh léarmheas ar an gcóras sin agus a rá &ldquo;ní dóigh linn go mba chóir an dán sin nó an dán siúd a leagadh síos mar ábhar do pháistí nach bhfuil ach deich mbliain slánaithe acu; tá sé a bhfad ró-chrua do pháistí nach bhfuil in ann abairt Ghaeilge a labhairt, agus tá sé ró-luath chun `crua-Ghaeilge' a mhúineadh dóibh&rdquo;, ní dhéanfadh an bord pioc difríochta don Aire faoi mar atá an Bille anois.  D'fhéadfadh an tAire drom a láimhe a thabhairt dóibh.  Is eisean a bhfuil cúram agus teagasc na teanga faoi.  Is faoi a réirse atá obair na Roinne ar siúl; agus níl smacht ag an mbord seo ar an Aire nó ar an stáitsheirbhísigh sa Roinn.  Níor mhaith liom moill a chur ar an Dáil, ach ní maith liom ach oiread cuidiú le bord lag a bhunú.  Tá go leor bord agus údarás sa tír cheana nach bhfuil in ann a ndualgais a chomhlíonadh.  Níor mhaith liom cur lena líon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>: San mBille tá pious platitudes.  Sin é mo thuairim ar na rudaí atá inti go léir.  Má ghlactar leis an leasú, beidh sort dífríochta idir an Aire agus an Roinn Oideachais nó an Aire Oideachais.  Tá ainm gach státsheirbhíseach sa Roinn Oideachais i nGaeilge sna Estimates for Public Services ach stopann sé ansin.  Iarraim ar an Aire, go macánta, ionas go mbeidh fiacla ag an mbord, ionas go mbeidh an tAire ábalta féachaint isteach sa Roinn Oideachais agus an chumhacht a bheith aige féachaint isteach, glacadh leis an leasú.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta Kelly, níl aon pholataíocht ag baint leis seo.  Níl fhios ag éinne cé bheidh i mbun na Roinne <Col N="159" /> i gceann deich mbliana.

Mar a dúirt mé, maidir leis an mbord féin, is dócha go mbeidh ar a laghad, múinteoir amháin agus mar atá sé faoi láthair tá ionadaí on Roinn Oideachais ar an mbord.  Sa tslí sin beidh dlúthcheangal idir an bhord agus an Roinn Oideachais. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil sé le feiceáil go dti seo go bhfuil tionchar ag an rud sin ar cheist na Gaeilge sa Roinn Oideachais féin, ach b'fhéidir go mbeidh siad in ann polasaí deimhnitheach a leagan síos agus go mbeidh comhoibriú idir, go mór mhór, an Roinn Oideachais agus an bord maidir le céard is fearr leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>

      <P>: Níor mhaith liomsa mar Aire a bheith ag cur isteach ar an mbord; tá an Freasúra ag caint ar neamhspleáchas a thabhairt don bhord.  Sin an argóint a bhí acu anseo ar maidin.  Ach taobh amuigh de bhualadh le baill an bhoird agus leis an gCathaoirleach cúpla uair ó tháinig mé isteach mar Aire níor chuir <Col N="160" /> mé isteach ar obair ar bith a bhí ar siúl acu.  Ceapadh na daoine seo le job a dhéanamh agus níor mhaith liom go sílfeadh siad go mbeinn ag cur brú ar bith orthu.  Na daoine a cheapadh don bhord, ceapadh iad i ngeall ar go raibh baint acu le gluaiseacht na Gaeilge agus le hobair na Gaeilge le blianta anuas agus i ngeall ar sin glacaim leis gur mó an t-eolas atá acusan ar céard is fearr le ceist na Gaeilge a scrúdú ná mar atá agamsa, agus dá bhrí sin níor chuir mé isteach orthu agus níor chuir mé ceisteanna orthu.  Ach má tá aon eolas ag an Teachta i ngeall ar chonspóid nó troid nó raic a bheith idir iad féin agus an Roinn Oideachais agus gur mhaith leis a fháil amach céard a thárla, beidh mé sásta an cheist a chur agus a fháil amach má tá a leithéid ann.</P>

      <P>Ar leathanach 3, línte 1 go 4, fo-alt (5) a scriosadh agus an fo-alt seo a leanas a chur ina áit:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) (a)  Beidh sé de dhualgas ar aon Aire nó aon Roinn Stáit nó comhlucht reachtúil nó comhlucht eile, a chomhlíonann aon fheidhm i ndáil leis an nGaeilge, dhul i gcomhairle agus fanacht i gcomhairle leis an mBord maidir leis an gcaoi ina gcomhlíonann an tAire nó an Roinn nó an comhlucht sin an fheidhm sin.</P>
      <P>(b)  Gan dochar do éifeacht ghinearálta abairt (a) den fho-alt do, beidh sé de dhualgas ar na hAiri seo leanas dul i gcomhairle agus fanacht i gcomhairle leis an mBord maidir leis na feidhmeanna a luaitear thíos:</P>
      <P>(i)  An tAire Oideachais, maidir le córas teagaisc na Gaeilge ins na scoileanna;</P>
      <P>(ii)  Aire na Gaeltachta, maidir le caomhnú na teanga Gaeilge ins an nGaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Nuair a bhí an leasú deireanach dá phlé againn mhínigh mé an chiall a bhí leis agus sé an chiall chéanna a bhaineann leis an leasú atá roimh an Teach anois.  Ba mhaith liom é a dhéanamh mar dhualgas ar an mbord dul i gcomhairle agus fanacht i gcomhairle le pé Aire Rialtais atá gné áirithe don Ghaeilge mar cúram aige.  Ní fheicimse aon fáth nach mbeadh an tAire toilteanach ghlacadh leis an leasú seo.  Gan dochar do ghinearáltacht, mar a déarfa, an leasaithe sco nó don Bhille seo, ba mhaith liom go mbeadh dualgas chomh mhaith ar an mbord teacht i gcomhairle leis an Aire Oideachais agus le Aire na Gaeltachta maidir leis na cúrsaí ins na scoileanna agus mar sin de.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a thathaint ar an Aire leis, glacadh leis an leasú neamhurchóideach seo ionas go mbeadh beagán smachta agus rud beag bídeach de thionchur ag an mbord seo ins na háiteanna atá tabhachtach.  Is cuma liom, chuir i gcás, Bord na Gaeilge a bheith i gcomhairle le CIE nó le Aer Lingus, an dtuigeann tú, mar gheall ar na comharthaí beaga a bhíonns curtha in eitleán nó i mbusanna nó i traenacha, ainneoin gur cháin mé an droch-Ghaeilge atá ins na comharthaí sin an lá faoi dheireadh.  Is cuma liom aon chomhairle seasmhach a bheith ann idir an bhord agus Aer Lingus nó Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, nó mar sin.  Níl ach dhá Aireacht atá tábhachtach ar an leibhéal seo&mdash;an Aireacht ina bhfuil Aire na Gaeltachta ina Aire faoi láthair agus an Roinn Oideachais. Mura mbionn eolas ag Bord na Gaeilge ar gach a mbíonn ar siúl ag na Ranna sin, nó a mbíonn gan a bheith ar siúl, ni fiú tada an bord san, dár liom fhéin.  Is cuma cé mhéid ráiteasaí nó tuarascála a chuireann an bord amach, ní mhothaimíd aon dífríocht ar bith toisc an bord a bheith ann seachas an bord a bheith as, muna mbíonn beagánín smacht agus tionchar agus cumhachtaí ag an mbord ar na cúrsaí a luaigh mé.</P>

Mar a dúirt mé agus mé ag caint ar an Dara Chéim don Bhille, tá obair mhór le déanamh ag an mbord i dtaobh aithbheochain na Gaeilge, ach muna bhfuil sé de dhualgas ar an Roinn Oideachais dul i gcomhairle agus fanacht i gcomhairle leis an mbord, tá seans mór nach mbeidh a gcuid oibre éifeachtach ar chor ar bith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the House will be aware that one of the problems in relation to development in the restoration <Col N="167" /> of Irish over the years has been a sense of independence in the Department of Education in relation to language policy which at times has veered into isolationism.  While on this side of the House we are naturally in favour of the independence in general of Government Departments and the Ministers to whom they are responsible, there is a particular case here, as the Minister has just said, in relation to Irish in that it is not the specific responsibility of any Government Department.</P>
    <P>The reason for this amendment, with which I agree, is that it is an attempt to break through the isolationism of the Department of Education in regard to their role and the effectiveness of that role in the revival of the language.  I might draw the Minister's attention to <i>Athbheochan na Gaeilge, The Restoration of the Irish Language</i> laid by the Government before each House of the Oireachtas in January 1965 and to two recommendations specifically. Recommendation 140 is that the language should be taught to all primary school children.  Recommendation 141 is that the main aim of primary schools in the teaching of Irish should be to give the child a functional command of the spoken language.</P>
    <P>The Government's comment on these two reports in paragraph 171 on page 102 was:</P>
    <P>This is the position in all National Schools and will continue to be so.</P>
    <P>That was in 1965.  In January 1978, 13 years later, according to a survey published in <i>The Irish Journal of Education</i>, 66 per cent of Irish primary school teachers opposed the current policy of requiring school pupils to learn Irish.  The reference is an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 January which reads:</P>
    <P>Of those teachers who thought that Irish should not be obligatory for all pupils, 83% felt that those pupils who had low achievement in language skills generally should be excluded.  Only 7% mentioned parent objection as a <Col N="168" /> ground for exclusion.  Fifty per cent of teachers surveyed reported that children had a sound symbol difficulty with the first language as a result of learning a second one, a further 31% perceived language conflicts of spelling, 40% with language structure, but 60% of the teachers felt learning Irish increased the pupil's awareness of Irish culture.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a need for Bord na Gaeilge to give this sort of situation rather more teeth than it is being given in the Bill in its present incarnation.  The House may not be aware of <i>A Black Paper on the Decline of Irish as a School Subject in the Republic of Ireland between</i> 1967-1977 by Mr. Liam S. Andrews in which he observed at page 45, paragraph 5.33:</P>
    <P>The response of the Department to the situation involving low levels of competence in Irish amongst post-primary school pupils has been to avoid taking urgent action at primary level where the source of the problem seems to be, and to concentrate efforts on the junior years of post-primary education.  The remedy is to introduce an Irish course of a lower standard than the existing post-primary audio-visual courses, designed to cover a period of three years.  A drop in standard is therefore officially recognised and incorporated in the proposed new course.  This must have far reaching effects on other priority areas in the Irish language teaching system.</P>
    <P>We would be glad to hear what the new Bord na Gaeilge would have to say about that kind of analysis.  They will not be in a position to find out whether that analysis and that charge are correct and accurate unless they are given the kind of powers proposed in this amendment.</P>
    <P>Nor is the situation very much better at post-primary level.  The Minister may be aware of a publication called <i>Teangeolas</i> published by Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann and an article in it by the Director of the Institute which contains the following rather devastating paragraph:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" />  Is léir gur tháinig laghdú mór ar úsáid na Gaeilge sa chóras oideachais ó thús na seachtóidí.  Is léir freisin gur laghdú leanúnach atá ann.  Tá sé leanúnach, nó carnach, ar chaoi eile freisin: na mic léinn a fhoghlaimíonn tríd an nGaeilge ar scoil is iad sin na daoine fásta is fearr a mbíonn an Ghaeilge acu ar ball; ba iad freisin ba mhó a sholáthraíodh múinteoirí náisiúnta agus múinteoirí Gaeilge le haghaidh scoileanna iarbhunoideachais go dtí seo, go mór mór ó dúnadh na coláistí ullmhúcháin.  Ní féidir ach ísliú caighdeáin a theacht ar chaighdeán na Gaeilge a mhúintear sna scoileanna dá thoradh sin.</P>
    <P>This is a serious state of affairs and it is amply evidenced, if further evidence was needed, by the Statistical Report of the Department of Education for 1974-75 and 1975-76.  If we look at the table in that report for results of the leaving certificate examination we see that among boys, for example, 11.3 per cent of the boys who took Irish failed, got grade E or lower. When we look at all the other percentages it is astonishing how much lower the failure rate is in Irish than in many other subjects.  It is closer to English which stands at 9 per cent and is less than half of French at 23 per cent, German at 25 per cent, and some of the others are even more significant. For instance physics and chemistry was 54 per cent, biology 42 per cent, agricultural economics&mdash; God help us&mdash;was 72 per cent.  We are asked to believe that the rate of success in Irish in the leaving certificate examination in the ordinary paper is up to three times better than the rate of success in the more orthodox subjects in the curriculum.</P>
    <P>Another reading of the figures is that there is a conscious light marking of the Irish papers in the leaving certificate examination and that this is contributing inexorably to the decline in standards that was talked about in <i>Teangeolas</i>.  I should like to refer the House and the Minister to the Report of the Committee on Irish Language Attitudes Research.  In that report the authors, basing their conclusions on the most scientific survey yet done to <Col N="170" /> attitudes to Irish, comment:</P>
    <P>There is at the same time widespread disillusionment with Irish as experienced in school and with the low levels of communicative&mdash;competence acquired in the language in schools&mdash;even for secondary school students who go as far as the Leaving Certificate.  Our surveys on the general conversational ability levels achieved in schools have shown that there is a considerable basis of truth for these beliefs and further that, for students who complete their education at primary level or even at Group or Intermediate Certificate level, competence levels achieved in the language are very low, and for Group Certificate students, especially, high examination failure rates in the past appear to have been a very real basis for resentment against the language.</P>
    <P>That report also states:</P>
    <P>In the past, Irish language policies were based on a misunderstanding of the potentialities of the existing educational system.  Although that system was not designed to produce communicative competence in second languages, it was taken for granted that the task of producing Irish speakers could be left mainly to the schools.  The disappointing results are interpreted by many people as a proof that the task was impossible.</P>
    <P>The task may or may not be impossible, but until we have some positive input into the Department of Education from the outside we will never find out whether they are going about it in the right way.  This amendment seeks to give the board the possibility of making that kind of input and that is why I support it.</P>

      <P>: Nuair a bhi an tAire ag caint ar ball duirt se rud eigin faoi an bord a bheith neamhspleach uaidh. Tá mé cinnte nach bhfuil sé fein ag dul ag cur isteach go hiomarcach ar obair an bhoird ach ni neamhspleachas ó Aire na Gaeltachta atá i gceist agam ach cumhacht neamhspleách a bheith ag an mbord ó thaobh na n-Aireachtaí eile atá sa Stát seo.  Thug an Teachta Begley&mdash;má thuig mé i gceart é&mdash;leath huair a chloig ó shin&mdash;dea shampla <Col N="171" /> den neamhfiúntacht atá ag baint leis an mbord go nuige seo, nuair a dúirt sé go raibh gearán de chineál éigin ag cailín a bhí i gcoláiste oiliúna faoin chaoi a raibh an Ghaeilge á teagasc agus go ndeachaigh sise chuig an mbord leis an ngearán sin agus go ndeachaigh an bhord chuig an Aire; ach ná thug an tAire aire ar bith dóibh mar gheall ar an ngearán sin mar ní raibh iachall ná éigean ar bith air aire a thabhairt don bhord. Anois tá sé sin chomh cinnte sin nach fiú é a bheith dá phlé againn a thuilleadh.  Tá sé thar a bheith cinnte, faoi mar a dúirt an Teachta Horgan cúpla nóimeád ó shin, go bhfuil rud éigin cearr sa Roinn Oideachais ó thaobh teagasc na Gaeilge, agus b'fhéidir ó thaobh a lán eile, ach ar a laghad ó thaobh teagasc na teanga Gaeilge.  Tá rud eicínt lochtach sa Roinn sin, agus tá sé lochtach le 50 bliain, agus is maith go bhfuil fhios ag an tAire seo gur fíor an méid sin, agus thar a bheith maith atá fhios aige siúd, mar is múinteoir é fhéin; agus tá sean-taithí ag an Aire seo ar obair na Roinn Oideachais.  Táimid cinnte agus thar a bheith cinnte go bhfuil rud éigin cearr agus rud éigin lochtach i córas teagasc na Gaeilge atá dá stiúradh ag an Roinn Oideachais.  Tá seans againn inniu rud eicínt fiúntach a dhéanamh le nach mbeadh an Roinn Oideachais neamhspléach faoi mar adúirt an Teachta Horgan a thuilleadh ó thaobh an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>

    <P>Rinneadh dhá bhotún sa tír seo mar gheall ar athbheochain na Gaeilge.  Is éasca a bheith ag díriú ar bhotúin agus níl sé chomh héasca sin bheith ag moladh a réiteach&mdash;tá sé sin cinnte agus admhaím é&mdash;ach rinneadh dhá bhotún.  An chéad bhotún, ba é gur tharla go raibh an teanga fite fuaite leis an bpolaitíocht.  Nuair a bhí Conradh na Gaeilge ann ar dtús, bhí Aondachtóirí istigh ann, daoine nach raibh náisiúntach beag ná mór, ach go raibh suim de chineál culhírtha acu sa teanga.  D'imigh siad go léir nuair a d'éirigh an chéad cheangal idir athbheochain na Gaeilge agus polaitíocht Sinn Féin; agus nuair a tháinig an scoilt ar Sinn Féin agus nuair a thaobhaigh cuid acu leis an gConradh le Sasana, 1922, agus nuair <Col N="172" /> a thaobhaigh an chuid eile leis an dtaobh eile, do thit an lug ar an lag ar fad mar gheall ar ghluaiseacht na Gaeilge, mar do ghoill sin ar a lán daoine.  An tarna rud a rinneadh cearr, agus ba é an chéad Rialtas a bhí sa Stát sé a rinneadh iad&mdash;caithfidh mé an méid sin a admháil&mdash;ba é ná cúram na Gaeilge a thabhairt sa chéad áit don Roinn Oideachais agus níor fhéach siad isteach a thuilleadh ins an méid a bhí ar siúl ag an Roinn Oideachais go dtí an lá atá inniu ann, seachas tuarascáil nár léigh éinne ar bith é ón lá a fhoilsíodh é.  Tá seans againn inniu an ceangal agus greim na marbh atá ag an Roinn Oideachais a bhriseadh rud beag.  B'fhéidir nach mbrisfimid ar fad é, ach rud beag dhe a bhriseadh.  Tá an seans sin againn, agus táimid ag dul an seans sin a chailliúint, b'fhéidir go deo, mura nglacadh an tAire leis an leasú seo.  Nó, mura bhfuil sé sásta le foirm an leasaithe, tá mé fhéin sásta é a tharraingt ar ais, agus tig leis an Aire, ar an gcéad céim eile, leasú dá chuid fhéin a thabhairt isteach, agus fáilteoimid roimhe má thugann sé rud beag smachta don bhord ar an méid a bhíonn ar siúl don Roinn Oideachais, ach mura dtoilíonn an tAire glacadh leis an leasú sin agus mura dtoilíonn sé leasú dá chuid féin a thabhairt isteach d'fhéadfar a rá amach anseo feasta gurb iad Fine Gael a thaobhaígh le bord fiúntach a chur ar siúl, bord fiúntach a chothú le cúis na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn más féidir rud ar bith í a chur cinn sa lá atá inniu ann, agus gurb é an taobh eile, Fianna Fáil, an Rialtas atá inniu ann, a threascar an seans sin agus a dhein cinnte de nach mbéadh againn ach bord seafóideach gan brí, gan fiúntas.</P>

      <P>: Is dóigh liom gurb é freagracht an Aire atá i gceist anseo, go mór mhór.  De réir mar thuigim an scéal.  Tá sé freagrach go direach agus go h-indíreach, ach tá dualgais ar an mbord ar fad agus ar gach ball den bhord.  Ní hé an tAire féin a bheidh ag gabháil do cheist na Gaeilge; beidh barúil freisin ag 12 daoine a mbeidh tuiscint acu agus a bhfuil obair déanta acu cheana féin ar son na teanga.  Dá mbeadh an tAire ag cur isteach ar <Col N="173" /> na daoine sin, is dóigh liom gur rud aisteach ar fad a bheadh ar siúl aige, agus is dóigh liom go bhfúil an rud ceart ar siúl aige san bhfo-alt seo.  Is furasta an scéal a leigheas muna bhfuil a gcuid oibre á dhéanamh ag an mbord.  Tá an Bille láidir go leor chun cuspóir an bhoird a bhaint amach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Cuireann sé ionadh orm óráid mar sin a chloisint ón Teachta Ahern.  Is é atá i gceist agam agus ag na Teachtai Kelly agus Horgan ná go mbeidh cumhacht ag an mbord agus dualgas ar an Roinn Oideachais dul i gcomhairle le hAire na Gaeltachta.  Bíonn beagnach 20,000 páisti gach bliain ag dul go dtí na coláistí samhraidh agus nuair a thagann siad ar ais bíonn Gaeilge ar fheabhas acu.  Ach muna bhfuil na múinteoirí scoile ábalta ina dhiaidh sin iad a ghríosadh agus fuinneamh a chur san Ghaeilge sna scoileanna, beidh an tairbhe sin caite ar leathtaobh ag na páistí sin.</P>
      <P>San leasu atá os comhair an Ti, sé tá ar intinn againn ná dualgas bheith ar an Aire Oideachais.  Mar a dúirt mé cheana, níl an béim ar an Ghaeilge anois sna coláistí ullmhúcháin agus a bhí iontu, abair, bliain ó shin nó deich mbliain ó shin.  Níl an méid céanna buachaillí nó cailíní ón Ghaeltacht sna coláistí sin chun an Ghaeilge a labhairt eatarthu féin nó le na scoláirí úr Ghaeilge ag a mbéadh tairbhe le fáil acu ó labhairt na teanga.</P>
      <P>Arís eile, iarraim ar an Aire glacadh leis an leasú seo.  Tá sé soiléir nach bhfuil aon tsuim ag an Roinn Oideachais sa Ghaeilge.  Nuair a bhí an chéad leasú os ár gcomhair, thug mé cás don Teach faoi mhúinteoir scoile anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Ní raibh sí in ann aon aird a fháil ón Roinn Oideachais agus chuaigh sí go dtí Bord na Gaeilge chun cabhair a fháil, ach ní raibh an bord in ann tada a dhéanamh toise go raibh an Roinn chomh neamhspleách sin nár thugadar suim dá laghad sna pointí a bhí ag an múinteoir sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar sin, deirim leis an Aire dualgas a chur ar an Aire Oideachais. B'fhéidir go mbeidh an tAire ábalta a <Col N="174" /> rá linn go bhfuil sé chun Rúnaí an Roinn Oideachais a chur ar an mbord nó rud éigin den tsort sin a dhéanfadh ceangail fhiúntach idir Aire na Gaeltachta, Bord na Gaeilge agus an Aire Oideachais.</P>
    <P>Níl na Teachtaí sa taobh seo ag iarraidh cur isteach ar neamhspleáchas an bhoird&mdash;sin é an rud deiridh atá in ár n-intinn.  Is páistí nó daoine óga iad 50 faoin gcéad dár daonra agus mura bhfuilimid ábalta béim a chur ar an nGaeilge, go mór-mhór tré na múinteoirí scoile, níl aon tseans ag na páistí sin an Ghaeilge bheith ar fheabhas acu.  Níl aon tsuim sa Ghaeilge ag cuid de na múinteoirí ag teacht amach ó na coláistí oiliúna. Thug mé don Teach scéal faoin mbuachaill a chuaigh faoi oral test. Ní raibh sé ábalta freagra a thabhairt tré Ghaeilge, agus dúirt sé leis an scrúdaitheoir, &ldquo;Tabhair an cheist dom tré Bhéarla&rdquo;.  Tá an fear sin ag múineadh páistí anois.  Mar sin, iarraim ar an Aire go macánta glacadh leis an leasú seo.  Chuirfeadh sé feabhas mhór ar an mBille.</P>

      <P>: Ba mhaith liom a rá gur dhein an Roinn Oideachais agus an tAire Oideachais a ndícheall córas oideachais a chur ar fáil ina mbeadh páirt mhór ag an nGaeilge, ach níor bhac muintir na hÉireann leis.  Is iad gnáth-phobal na hÉireann nár ghlac leis an nGaeilge.  De réir cosúlachta, ní ar na múinteoirí ná ar an Roinn Oideachais a bhí an locht an t-am ar fad.  B'fhéidir go raibh easpa taighde ann ó thaobh na modhanna múinte ab fhearr, ach sílim go raibh na múinteoirí ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus go raibh a n-intinn ceart i taobh ceist na Gaeilge.  Ní fhéadfaí glacadh le leasú faoin a mbeadh sé de dhualgas ar Aire, is cuma cé hé, seo nó sin a dhéanamh.  Tá sé ráite i fo-alt (4):</P>
      <P>Féadfaidh an Bord comhairle a thabhairt d'Aire Rialtais maidir le hábhar a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge agus comhairle, cúnamh agus comhoibriú a thabhairt do Roinn Stáit nó do chomhlacht reachtúil nó do chomhlacht eile maidir le hábhar den sórt sin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The first point I wish to make relates to section 10 (1) which reads in the English translation:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Board shall appoint such and so many persons to be the staff of the Board as the Board from time to time thinks proper.</P>
      <P>I welcome this part of the Bill because it gives to the board the kind of independence that we on this side of the House have been looking for.  There may be problems in relation to the remuneration conditions further down the line.  Section 10 (3) lays down, again in the English translation, that:</P>
      <P>A member of the staff of the Board shall be paid such remuneration and allowances as the Board, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, may from time to time determine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are aware of the precedents for this kind of section in a Bill of this <Col N="179" /> sort, but we are not always guaranteed to have a Minister for the Public Service who will have the welfare of the Irish language at heart.  It is possible that by fixing the salary levels of members of the staff of the board at absolutely ludicrous levels, the board, for all their power to appoint people under subsection (1), would have no real authority to do so because they will not be able to pay the going rate for the job.  There has already been controversy about the salaries of the chairman of semi-State bodies, and it is worth while pointing out that the old Devlin scheme and its recommendations do not relate only to chairmen but to people at lower levels as well.</P>
    <P>The difficulty being faced by the new board in this area can be seen when you look at the kind of people that the board will want to recruit.  They may want to recruit, for instance, the principal of a school to carry out a major attitude or research survey into the Irish language on some basis or other.  These people are now paid comparatively well; none of them would agree that they are paid well enough, but they are not paid badly, and I suspect that they are paid above the rate that a parsimonious Minister for the Public Service might be prepared to accept.</P>
    <P>Therefore I suggest that the Minister consider between this and Report Stage whether, in relation to this board and to a topic of such importance which will not involve a great deal of public money, instead of writing in &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; he might consider writing in &ldquo;after consultation with the Minister&rdquo;.  We know that consultations of this sort are more than mere formality.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on this.</P>

      <P>: On the last occasion I had explained to the House the purpose of this amendment.  I am not very keen on it from the drafting point <Col N="182" /> of view, but if the Minister is susceptable to the idea behind it I am sure his advisers will think of a better way of framing it.  The object of the amendment is to provide some statutory basis for the informal consultations which I understood the Department advisers told some deputation could be expected in practice to replace in most cases the formal procedures laid down in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is proposed to have informal consultations, to try to give guidance and a general indication of the likely attitude that would be taken, but if these informal expressions of view were to become binding in some way on the Minister, obviously he and his officials would be loathe to have these informal discussions. In such circumstances they would be no longer informal, and for this reason and in order to further what the Deputy and I both desire it would be better not to write in such a provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 2, to delete &ldquo;, subject to subsection (2),&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is for the purpose merely of removing a couple of words which would be consequential on amendment No. 21 being accepted. The proposal in No. 21 is to delete <Col N="183" /> the existing subsection (2) in section 6 and to substitute a somewhat different subsection.  The existing subsection provides for extension of the relevant period for examination of a proposal of periods up to a total of three months.  This was considered desirable to cater for the small number of difficult cases where investigation by the Examiner and inquiries by the commission would be called for. However, as it is proposed now to remove the commission from involvement in the merger and take-over aspects of the Bill, the power to extend the relevant period does not appear to be necessary.  The net effect of the amendment is that the Minister will now have three months plus a remote possibility in certain limited circumstances of an extension of a further month where further information is sought to examine a proposal. The proposal to shorten the period very substantially is contained in the proposal to delete section 9, and to a great extent amendment No. 21 is in turn consequential on that and amendment No. 20 is consequential on No. 21.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where a person involved in a proposed merger or take-over which is being investigated by the Examiner under section 8 applies, by virtue of that section, to the High Court for a declaration under section 15 of the Act of 1972, the period beginning on the date of the application and ending on the date of the decision of the High Court, or (where that decision is appealed) the date of the decision of the Supreme Court, on the application shall, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, not be reckoned in calculating the relevant period for the purposes of this section.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This provision was included in the Bill as published to cater for a situation in which although the Minister might be satisfied with a proposal regarding a number of criteria he might wish to have further information in relation to a few criteria.  However, as the Minister's decision is to be taken now following consideration of the examiner's report alone rather than a report both of the examiner and of the commission, it is necessary that the Minister should have available information on how the proposal will operate in relation to all of the criteria involved. This amendment would ensure that that information would be available.  It is consequential on the shortening of the period by excluding the Restrictive Practices Commission from the procedures.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2)  A report of the Examiner under subsection (1) shall state his opinion as to whether or not the proposed merger or take-over concerned would operate against the common good in respect of any of the scheduled criteria.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is to delete the second subsection and to substitute the new one proposed here.  The amendment is necessary in order to reflect the new status of the examiner's report, which will now be the only report considered by the Minister before deciding on a proposal referred for investigation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>:  I have already referred to this and explained that the effect is to remove the Restrictive Practices Commission from the machinery for examining proposed mergers and take-overs.  The commission will still be concerned in investigations into apparent monopolies. As regards the mergers control machinery, the position now will be that there will be only one referral to the examiner and consequently the Minister will be required to consider only one report before making a decision in regard to a proposal. Before he would normally have made the decision without referring it if he were going to prohibit a proposed merger or take-over.  The amendment will have a substantial impact on the <Col N="186" /> period which the Minister will have to consider proposals and this is reflected in the earlier amendment to section 6, which, as amended, will now provide for a maximum period of three months.  The amendment should therefore go a long way towards easing one of the major concerns expressed about the Bill as published, that is, that there was a possible maximum period in certain cases of up to seven months and under the 1974 Bill that it would have been even longer&mdash;ten I think. This reduces the maximum period very substantially.  I would like to reiterate that while three months is the maximum period under the Bill I would not envisage, except in the most exceptional circumstances, the consideration taking that long.  That would only happen in very difficult cases.</P>

    <P>The Bill as published unintentionally applied only to an amalgamation of two or more societies and not to a transfer of engagements, the effect of which is as much a merger in the sense of the Bill as is an amalgamation.

      <P>In page 12, lines 44 to 46, to delete paragraph (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I put down these amendments&mdash;I foreshadowed them when speaking on Second Stage&mdash;is because as I said then, these criteria are all very fine but some of them conflict with each other.  I recognise that a similar conflict was apparent in the 1974 Bill.  It is questionable, in my view, that the House should dispatch a schedule of criteria which the Minister or an examiner will have to consider in which no clear priority is even attempted.  I realise it is not easy to decide where to lay the priority but just to fling this schedule of different criteria in front of an examiner will lead to him ignoring the two.  My suggestion, and I do not claim much for it, is a better way of doing it.  Criterion (c) is the one on which the IDA have laid most emphasis in their March 1978 bulletin, in an article about a rationalisation programme for Irish industry.  This rationalisation is essentially one which will very frequently take place by means of mergers and amalgamations. That must be a desirable objective for industrial development.  One reason for an amalgamation or merger, and there is no need to be shy about saying <Col N="191" /> this, is to effect economies.  One sort of economy is, I regret to say, getting the same amount of work done with fewer pairs of hands to pay.  That is a regrettable fact of industrial life. Nonetheless it is one of the things held out as being desirable in this Schedule.  Criterion (c) is:</P>
    <P>The extent to which the proposed merger and take-over would be likely to affect employment and would be compatible with national policy in relation to employment.</P>
    <P>I agree with a national policy to secure full employment but to hand to an examiner a set of criteria two of which go in opposite directions is an untidy way of doing this job.  I may not have solved the problem in the amendment which I have suggested but it is not right for either House to make a kind of perfunctory obeisance in the direction of full employment on the one hand and of business efficiency on the other and leave it for somebody else to sort out without giving an indication here of what the main priority must be.  We will go along with any measure directed towards achieving full employment.  This measure has a principal objective relating to the control of mergers, monopolies and take-overs but at the same time that is embedded in an industrial situation in which the encouragement of mergers and amalgamations is recognised to be important.  Therefore, this is the wrong context in which to be striving to protect employment.  There are other ways of doing that, but to hold up this criterion to an examiner and say &ldquo;Shoot down a proposed merger if you think it will result in the loss of too many jobs&rdquo; is seeking to achieve an objective by the wrong means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: Amendment No. 36 is related to amendment No. 34 and we will discuss the two of them together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: On the face of it, there is a conflict between these two concepts but the decision which would have to be made in a case will be based on a balance of the advantages and disadvantages involved.  Priorities <Col N="192" /> will be difficult to establish and they will depend on the circumstances in each case.  It would not be helpful to the examiner or to the Minister to have these two criteria fused as is proposed in the two amendments.  It does not necessarily follow that every merger must result in a loss of employment. There are mergers which create employment.  It does not follow either that if there is some loss of employment the examiner or the Minister should regard that as the overriding consideration.  Some mergers could result in limited loss of employment which would guarantee for a reasonably long time the existence of the other job in the merged undertaking. When one considers re-equipment grants and things of that kind, one is frequently paying a great deal not to increase employment and sometimes to decrease it when doing so would guarantee the continued and hopefully permanent existence of the great majority of the jobs in the enterprise which otherwise might be in jeopardy if the re-equipment or the merger had not taken place.</P>
      <P>While I see Deputy Kelly's point it would be easier to keep these two criteria separate.  Tacking on the employment consideration simply as an adjunct to (e), the question of Government policy in regard to rationalisation and greater efficiency and so on, would degrade in some way the importance of the employment aspect.  I would like to feel that the examiner and the Minister of the day would have the employment aspect at least equally before their minds as the question of efficiency and rationalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I understand what the Minister is saying, but if he were the examiner and was looking at a proposed merger which had been referred to him and was looking at this schedule of criteria, would he envisage reporting adversely on the proposed merger if it meant the loss of say 20 per cent of the combined employment of the two enterprises?  It seems that an examiner might feel constrained to forbid a merger if it would have this result.  I agree with the Minister that most mergers will <Col N="193" /> lead towards improved efficiency and will guarantee so far as it can be done whatever employment remains.  Obviously the combined firms will be a more powerful economic unit but as these criteria stand they seem to leave it up to the examiner to decide for himself.  If an examiner happens to be a man who thinks that employment should come first and business efficiency second, or that employment for the existing work force should be guaranteed first and let the firm fend for itself in less favourable conditions three or five years from now, it might lead him to recommend adversely against a merger if he found that perhaps 10 per cent, 15 per cent or 20 per cent of the combined workforce would be made redundant.</P>
      <P>On all sides of the House we have the same sentiments in relation to employment but the present form of these criteria, even though I recognise that they have had much the same form since 1974, will leave it open to an examiner to make recommendations on a basis which may surprise whatever Minister is in charge.  I would ask the Minister to look again at these criteria to see if this matter could be remedied by perhaps putting in a further subsection in the part of the Bill dealing with the examiner's function which would instruct him to weigh these criteria, one against the other, in the way the Minister has outlined.  As far as I know there is nothing in the Bill which requires the examiner to consider all the criteria. As it stands the Bill might entitle him to shoot down a merger on the criteria that 20 per cent of the workers will be made redundant if the merger goes through.  I will withdraw this now because I have made my point sufficiently, but I would ask the Minister to look at these criteria again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I know that, but there is nothing in the Schedule or anywhere else in the Bill as far as I know which forbids the examiner to report adversely on the basis of an adverse finding on one criteria alone.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no virtue in this criterion because I do not know what is the national policy on regional development.  Whatever might be said about having criteria that are in conflict, it might be possible to resolve that problem by directing an examiner to weigh one criterion against the other.  However, I see no virtue in making a pious gesture that more or less signals to the nation that we know there are such things as regions and that we think there should be a national policy for them when no such identifiable policy exists.  I realise that some parts of what might broadly be called a national policy are conducted with a regional colouring, that the IDA have a regional mode of operation and that there are special areas in the country that get special treatment for Gaeltacht and other purposes.  Looking at the matter from the point of view of two enterprises that may be considering a merger, what <Col N="195" /> are they to take out of the expression &ldquo;national policy for regional development&rdquo;? What does it mean to them?</P>
    <P>Does it mean that with regard to a merger in the Gaeltacht the people concerned will be in a strong or a weak position to have that merger approved because of a regional policy?  It is impossible to say.  For example, the IDA publish a programme in which is envisaged the creation of a certain number of jobs as a target for certain regions.  If a merger looks like creating or destroying employment in any region in such a way as to put off course the IDA target, does it mean that the merger will have an adverse report? I have no objection to criteria being laid down that have to do with the industrial policy of the IDA, and I have no objection to the Gaeltacht or weak and disadvantaged areas being taken into account, but I think the criteria should make sense to a businessman who is contemplating a merger.  As it stands this criterion makes no sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I agree with the Deputy that to a great extent it could be said that there is no specific stated regional policy at the moment.  As the Deputy is aware, the last statement of policy in this area was that issued in 1972 by the then Government. Regional issues were largely ignored in the period from 1973 to 1977 but the present Government have indicated clearly that they are strongly committed to a comprehensive policy for regional development.  This was evidenced by the clear allocation of responsibility for this policy to the new Department of Economic Planning and Development.  I understand that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, in the exercise of his functions in this regard, will indicate in the House today in reply to parliamentary questions a number of initiatives regarding the formulation of a coherent policy for regional development.  It is desirable that there should be a national policy in this area, and I am satisfied that the Minister will ensure that such a policy will be formulated with the minimum of delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> I consider it most desirable that accord with a policy of regional development should be included as a criterion against which the proposed mergers or take-overs should be considered. In the course of his speech on Second Stage, Deputy Desmond stated clearly the reasons why the Minister should have regard to matters of a regional policy nature when considering proposals for mergers. Accordingly, for these reasons and for the reasons given by Deputy Desmond I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

I wish all the best to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in his hopes for regional development, but they may take a long time to cast even in the form of a White Paper or a Green Paper let alone in legislation that a businessman can understand.  In the meanwhile quite likely this Bill will have become law.  I have not been unreasonable in regard to amendments but I cannot withdraw this amendment.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to inform Deputy Woods and Deputy Michael Cosgrave that the Government consider the construction of a fishery harbour centre at Howth to be a priority task.  In conjunction with the Department of Fisheries, the Commissioners of Public Works have prepared a scheme involving the dredging of the <Col N="198" /> harbour basin and the construction of berthage, servicing and landing quays at a cost of £4 million.  It is envisaged that the scheme will proceed in two stages, the first comprising the main structures, wharfs, breakwaters, dredging and widening of the pier, and the second the construction of facilities ancillary to fish landing.  I can assure Deputy Cosgrave that the first stage of the work will include the proper surfacing of the pier.  All going well, the work should commence later this year. Stage one will take about five years to complete and when works are in full swing upwards of 100 men will be employed.  Naturally the project itself will engender further employment by concentrating fish landing at the harbour, thereby encouraging the establishment of a cluster of fish related industries.</P>
    <P>Government environmental policy has been an important consideration in the choice of a suitable design for the scheme, resulting in the combination in a single engineering undertaking of economic development on the one side with the preservation of the traditional character and amenities of the harbour on the other.  Deputy Michael Cosgrave raised the question of resiting of the proposed syncrolift so that more space would be available for the fish auction hall.  This point has been raised on a number of occasions. The Commissioners consider that the scheme as planned includes an adequate site for the hall, the overall dimensions of which have not yet been finally settled.  The Deputy also expressed doubts about the breakwater at the end of the east pier.  The breakwater as planned has been tested in a hydraulic model and was found satisfactory. In any event I am advised that the siltation has never been a problem at Howth.</P>
    <P>A number of questions were raised about the Phoenix Park and certain facilities here.  Deputy Lemass enquired about a sports facility in the Phoenix Park.  The position is that in the main the responsibility for the enclosed playing pitches in the Phoenix Park rests with the various organisations using those pitches.  The Deputy might like to know, however, that the <Col N="199" /> football and hurling grounds and the soccer pitches, which are maintained by my office, are at present being completely resurfaced.  This is being carried out in stages as otherwise the grounds would have to be closed for two or three years.  I do not think that this would be a very advisable thing to do.  Some of the pitches have been fenced off, ploughed and reseeded, and when the sward is ready these will be put back in use and the resurfacing of other pitches put in hand.  It is not my intention to provide tennis courts in the Phoenix Park proper.  However, I propose that the Phoenix Park extension be used as a general recreation area.  I intend to have a plan prepared showing how best this area can be laid out for that purpose.  The provision of tennis courts will be considered in this context.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy contended that the list of fishery harbours which the Commissioners of Public Works propose to deal with this year should have been included in my statement.  I wish to inform the Deputy concerned that in carrying out harbour works the Commissioners act as agents for other Departments and work to their priorities. Provision for the works is borne in the Votes of the Department concerned, that is, the Department of Fisheries and Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Those Departments will no doubt indicate what their priorities are for this year.  As far as the Commissioners are concerned every effort will be made to expend the full amount provided for harbour works in the current year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the question of the Development of Drogheda harbour. That is a matter for the harbour commissioners and the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  The Office of Public Works are, of course, involved in the arrangements for making funds available to the harbour commissioners from the local loans fund.  I understand that while some of the money sanctioned last August is to cover repayment of debts the greater part of it is for harbour works.</P>
    <P>Deputy Filgate inquired about Clogherhead pier.  I wish to inform him that the function of the Commissioners in regard to this pier is confined <Col N="200" /> to advising the Department of Fisheries on proposals submitted to them by the county council for the carrying out of major improvements.  I will do everything possible to have the engineering report on the proposed works expedited.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to the money provided for coast protection. He said it was too small.  I would also like to see more progress made on this very serious matter, but there are two main problems.  The first is shortage of engineers for assignment to this work. I want to place quite a lot of emphasis on the second one, which is the continuing removal of beach material on a commercial scale from the areas in which coast erosion has become, or is becoming, very serious.  Deputies from all parts of the House, I believe, agree on this very serious matter.  Proposals for the recruitment of additional engineering staff are at present under consideration by the Commissioners. Where beach material is being removed on a large scale it is invariably made good by erosion of some nearby place along the shore.  The Office of Public Works will not, therefore, undertake coast protection in any place as long as the removal of beach material is allowed to continue.  I hope a number of authorities throughout the country will take notice of what I am saying on this very important matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to the proposed fisheries research station at Kinsale.  The Office of Public Works are at present seeking a suitable site for that building.  The Deputy also <Col N="201" /> referred to the need for priority lists in the erection of garda stations.  The priorities for building garda stations are worked out in detail with the Department of Justice.  Quite a large number of the smaller stations have been replaced by new buildings.  This process will continue until all old, unsuitable stations have been replaced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan mentioned a garda station at Tuam, County Galway.  The erection of a new station is proposed at this centre and a suitable site is being sought.  Deputy Filgate referred to Dundalk garda station.  A major scheme of improvements will shortly begin at this station.  The need for new and improved accommodation for prisoners has been taken into account and is being provided in this scheme, which has been planned in close consultation with the gardaí.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned the garda station at Navan.  Agreement was reached to acquire the former school premises but there has been some difficulty about getting satisfactory title.  However, there has been some progress in clearing the title recently and the acquisition of the property should be completed shortly.  The Deputy also referred to the question of a garda station at Laytown/ Bettystown.  It is proposed to erect a new garda station at this centre and a site at Laytown is being investigated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Filgate referred to Carrickarnon Customs Station.  The whole question of facilities for cross border traffic in the Dundalk/Carrickarnon area is under close examination at present in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners.  I expect that satisfactory facilities will be provided in that area before too long.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to a cut back on works to be carried out at Gormanston Camp.  The Office of Public Works are not concerned with any works at that centre.  They will be a matter for the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>Deputy White made a plea for the preservation of our heritage houses.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of An Taisce Report on this subject and, in particular, of that body's considered opinion that the new capital taxes had serious implications for <Col N="202" /> these houses and would endanger elements of the country's heritage already under pressure.  The changes in capital taxation announced in the recent budget will help to relieve this pressure and, as the Minister for Finance announced in his budget statement, he is considering how best to draft legislation aimed at relieving these properties of capital acquisitions tax.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass raised a point in relation to the preservation of buildings. I can assure her that great care is taken by the Office of Public Works in dealing with any buildings that are being refurbished so that no features that merit preservation will be damaged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell asked me to ensure that the Thomas Davis memorial which was damaged in January 1977 be put right as soon as possible. Extensive damage was caused both to the ornamental features of the memorial and to the water supply system.  In the course of carrying out repairs, the opportunity has been taken to strengthen the sculpture as a whole and to overhaul completely the water supply and electrical systems. The necessary repairs are still in hands and every effort will be made to have them completed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There appeared to be some confusion in the minds of Deputies with regard to courthouses.  Deputy Murphy, Deputy Filgate and Deputy White referred to them.  Courthouse accommodation is primarily a matter for the local authority.  The Office of Public Works is brought in only when the local authority fails to discharge its responsibility.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy also commented on the accommodation provided for the National Museum and the National Library.  As I have already mentioned, additional accommodation is being provided for the museum.  The needs of the library have not been overlooked. Additional space is being provided at Nos. 2 and 3 Kildare Street and it is planned to erect a new building for library purposes at the rear of these houses.  Accordingly it is not necessary to consider providing space for the library on the other side of the street.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> Deputy Lemass mentioned the need for providing more telephone exchange buildings in general and also the pressing need for a new post office in Ballyfermot.  These matters are matters primarily for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who also decides on the priorities.  My office is concerned only in the erection of these buildings at the request of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also stressed the need for an employment exchange in Ballyfermot and I am glad to be able to tell her a suitable site for such a building is now being sought.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan and Deputy Begley referred to the protection of wrecks around the coast.  So far as the Commissioners of Public Works have functions in regard to the protection of historic wrecks, it is proposed to make provision for them in new legislation to deal with national monuments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Lawlor referred to the allocation of additional land in the Phoenix Park to the Zoo. While I sympathise with the Zoological Society's difficulties in regard to space, it must be borne in mind that the Commissioners are under constant pressure from other bodies and associations, which enjoy the exclusive use of certain parts of the park, to grant extensions of their present holdings. Having regard to the greatly increased demand on the Phoenix Park by the general public in recent years it has been decided not to allow the enclosure of any further areas of the park.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley referred to a proposal to extend the graveyard at Muckross Abbey which arose during his term of office as Parliamentary Secretary.  The position is that, at Deputy Begley's request, the Commissioners wrote formally to the Department of Finance on 11 March 1976 seeking a direction on the setting aside of two acres in the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park, Killarney, for the extension of the burial ground attached to Muckross Abbey.  On the following day a letter issued from the Parliamentary Secretary to the then Minister for Finance seeking sanction to the <Col N="204" /> granting of the additional ground required. The Minister's sanction, subject to certain conditions, was conveyed to the Commissioners by letter dated 29 March 1976.  Because of conflicting interests the matter has not yet been finalised and continues to be the subject of discussions and correspondence between the Commissioners, Kerry County Council and interested local groups.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Deputy's contention that the Commissioners are showing little interest in Muckross House, I would refer him to my introductory statement on the Estimate where, under subhead E, I said that work is proceeding on the planning of the first stage of the project to improve and expand the interpretative and educational aspects of Muckross House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley raised two questions relating to Derrynane Park&mdash;the extension of the burial ground and the extension of the football pitch.  The existing burial ground is on Abbey Island and can be reached on foot across a sandbar, except at very high tide.  Apart from the fact that the burial ground is at the entrance to the island of some 90 acres intended for use for amenity and recreational purposes and the general objection to disposing of the land in any of the parks, there are serious practical difficulties in the way of extending the burial ground.  Because of the rocky nature of the terrain only small isolated areas, much less than the area required by the county council, would be suitable for burial purposes.  I trust that meets Deputy Begley's question on the matter, a matter on which he put a great deal of emphasis.</P>
    <P>In regard to the extension of the football pitch in the sand dunes area, the Commissioners do not favour the playing of outdoor sports in this area as it conflicts with their overall plans for the management and development of the park.  Apart from this, the local football club consider that this pitch should be extended, but any extension would involve expensive drainage and filling without any guarantee of success.  Because of the pressure on my office in regard to this matter, I took the opportunity of visiting the area to <Col N="205" /> see how best we could facilitate the football club concerned.  In the interests of providing playing facilities for the people in the area the Commissioners some years ago laid out a football pitch in an area to the north of the public road adjoining the car park and provided a good grass sward. It is appreciated that the pitch is below standard size, but its extension would be both difficult and very expensive because of the nature of the ground.  I cannot see any possibility of the Office of Public Works helping in this respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley said he regrets he did not, during the period when he had responsibility for the Office of Public Works, publicly thank Mr. John McShain for his generosity in presenting property in Killarney to the State.  Perhaps it will help to set Deputy Begley's mind at rest if I tell him his predecessor, the late Henry Kenny, was not remiss in this regard. He paid tribute here in the House in 1973 to Mr. McShain for his donation of Inishfallen Island to the State.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to thank both Mr. McShain and Mrs. Grosvenor for the manner in which they have arranged for the sale of some of their property at Killarney.  By giving the Office of Public Works first option, they have helped to ensure the preservation of the outstanding landscape around the Lakes of Killarney for the enjoyment of the Irish people and as a major attraction for foreign tourists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley talked about Dingle Harbour which suffers from siltation and requires periodic dredging to maintain the bed levels.  As the Harbour Commissioners are not equipped to carry out such work, the Office of Public Works are obliged to undertake it on their behalf.  The current estimate of £10,000 referred to by Deputy Begley is based on a detailed engineering assessment of the extent of the dredging required.  The question of providing a deep water pier at Dingle, as suggested by Deputy Begley, would, in the first instance, be a matter for either Roinn na Gaeltachta or the Department of Fisheries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley suggested&mdash;and I <Col N="206" /> agree with him&mdash;that a brochure should be available for tourists giving them information about National Monuments.  The Commissioners publish guidebooks to some of the more important monuments, for example, Cashel, Glendalough, Newgrange, and so on, and it is intended to extend the coverage, but it would be impossible to say now when any particular monument would be the subject of a brochure. I assure the Deputy I have this very much in mind because it is of vital importance that, when people visit monuments, the history of those monuments should be available to them.</P>
    <P>The question of restriction on building in the Burren area was raised by Deputy White.  This is a matter for the local authority from which planning permission has to be obtained.  The Commissioners' role is to conserve a representative area of the Burren in perpetuity by the acquisition and maintenance of it as a national park.  This will also enable research to be carried out and will allow the general public to enjoy the unique qualities of the area, the strange rock formation, the profusion of rare flowers and rock plants, and the numerous items of archaeological interest.  Trinity College and An Taisce have also acquired some land, a total of 140 acres, near the slopes of Mullaghmore for conservation and research purposes.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered all the points raised.  I have noted with interest all the matters raised by Deputies.  I was very impressed by Deputies' contributions because they conveyed to me the awareness of Deputies of the importance of maintaining and developing parks and monuments.  Their problems will have my fullest attention. Anything we can do to beautify the areas coming under our control will be done, and we will not hesitate to make the necessary money available.  I hope I have not omitted to cover any matter raised by Deputies.  If I have, or if further information is required, I shall only be too delighted to meet them and discuss any matters they raise.  If they are not satisfied with anything in my reply, my Office will be available to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> Finally I wish to thank very sincerely all those who congratulated me on my appointment as Minister and who wished me well in the discharge of my duties.  It will be my endeavour to prove a worthy successor to all those who held this office in the past.</P>
    <P>Vote put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The matter of the replacement by a permanent building of the existing temporary premises in which Scoil Éanna is being conducted is at present under investigation by my Department.  The primary schoOl population in the area has declined in recent years and, according to information provided by the chairman of the board of management, this decline is likely to continue to the extent that the permanent accommodation in the two nearby schools&mdash;Kilmore Road National School and St. John of God National School&mdash;will be more than adequate to meet primary school accommodation requirements in the area.  Whether or not there will be continuing need for Scoil Éanna obviously, therefore, comes into question.  However, before a final decision is taken as to the future of Scoil Éanna all relevant considerations will be taken into account.</P>

      <P>: If there were a final decision to make a permanent structure there I would agree that most of the propositions put forward by the Deputy would be correct but my dilemma is that I am informed by people who have local knowledge that the numbers are going down and that the other two schools in the area in a short time will be able to cater for the pupils there.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: As part of their initial training, all primary teachers study the theory and practice of remedial education and are equipped to cater for the needs of children of varying levels of ability.  All of these teachers provide remedial education within the classroom. In addition, approximately 340 ex-quota assistants have been appointed to help with remedial work on a tutorial basis in national schools where the problem of backwardness is particularly acute.</P>
      <P>My intention is to increase the number of such special posts from year to year while at the same time improving the overall pupil-teacher ratio.  A number of additional special posts as remedial teacher will, therefore, be established in the coming school year. Inservice courses to supplement the teachers' basic training are provided annually.  These courses are considered fully adequate to their purpose in scope and content, and no change is proposed.</P>

    <P>In regard to the post-primary level would refer the Deputy to my reply on 17 November 1977, in relation to <Col N="220" /> the matter of the appointment of remedial teachers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: As I indicated in my reply of 30 May, 1978, Question No. 172, an educational psychologist employed by my Department is available to these schools on request and is prepared to carry out individual or group testing of pupils as far as resources allow.  The last occasion on which the psychologist visited the schools in question to carry out individual tests was in April, 1977.  A series of group tests were carried out during the last term of the 1976-77 school year.  No requests for testing have been received during the current school year.</P>

In some of the schools there has been no psychological individual testing for three to four years.  Is the Minister aware that there is a severe immediate problem in the school and that a nun is working here who is qualified for appointment, and would the Minister consider approving her work by granting some subsidy towards her work in the school?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development if he has formulated any plans for implementing a regional development strategy; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Government are strongly committed to a comprehensive regional development strategy which they consider has an important role to play in supporting and completing the economic and social objectives set out in their recent White Paper on National Development 1977-1980.  The last statement of policy in this area was that issued in 1972, by the then Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then regional issues have tended to be ignored, despite the changed economic and social conditions obtaining in the different regions.  In view, therefore, of my statutory responsibilities for regional planning, I shall be presenting to the Government a review of the 1972 <Col N="234" /> statement along with any necessary proposals for future action in this area.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should mention that the Government are convinced that, for regional development to be effective, there must be appropriate regional institutions having the support and involvement of local communities. They have, therefore, and as a complement to the policy review which I have just mentioned, decided to reactivate the study on the organisation of Government functions at sub-national level and have requested the inter-departmental committee conducting the study to submit urgently an interim report on the most appropriate institutional arrangements for regional planning and development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware of the dire need for co-ordination of the activities of the various State and semi-State agencies at regional level? For example, in the mid-west region at the moment there is the IDA, SFADCo, the county development team, the RDOs and so on.  Is the Minister aware of the need for co-ordination and, if so, does he envisage a function being assigned to the RDOs in this respect?</P>

      <P>: I am so aware and that is why I referred in my reply to the re-activation of the study on the organisation of Government functions at sub-national level and why I have requested urgently an interim report to deal specifically with the arrangements for regional programmes. In that context work has already begun in the Department, defining both the policy options and the issues to be resolved.  With reference to the mid-west region, I take it the Deputy is aware that on an experimental basis we have assigned a different role to SFADCo with regard to acting as a development agency for stimulating local business enterprise. We are willing to undertake further pilot experiments in the coming months and years.</P>

      <P>As evidence of the Government's concern in this connection I refer to Irish researchers' participation in the following energy R &amp; D programmes:</P>

We all know how to play the game, we have been listening to it for a few minutes, where no matter what amount of money you are spending you can always spend more.  If that is the definition of inadequacy every programme is always inadequate.  On the other hand, all you can do is seek to assess what is a reasonable effort for a country of our size and resources.  I tried to indicate in my reply the nature of the involvements which we have. Obviously, in our circumstances, the appropriate thing is to participate to the maximum extent in international programming rather than see to it entirely off our own bat.  The other specific thing I would note is that the criticism appeared to centre on the fact that if the ESB were responsible for the programme it would be inadequate. Of course, the ESB do not have a major role in energy research.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the debate we had one constructive contribution from Fine Gael by Deputy Deasy and one contribution from the Labour Party from Deputy Treacy. Limited as the contributions were to one speaker from each party it is obvious now that there is in fact nothing but froth in a great deal of the irresponsible and destructive criticism of fisheries and from the information I have had from fishery officers around the coast and from the fishermen themselves and their organisations that is exactly the opinion to which I have come.  In fact, the prosperity in the sea fishing industry at the moment far outweighs the unreality of most of the frothy criticism that has gone on here from time to time and has also been reported in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prosperity of the fisheries is borne out by the representatives of the various organisations, particularly the organisation on the catching side of the industry.  One does on occasion have the odd scare headline which tends to put a somewhat tainted image on what is in fact a steadily progressive industry. To bear out what I am saying I <Col N="256" /> shall now give the House some facts. The final figures have come to hand for sea fishery landings and exports in 1977 as against 1976.  I am glad to say there were increased landings of sea fish at Irish ports in 1977 compared with 1976.  The increase was substantial when one remembers that very serious conservation measures were in force during 1977, conservation measures which restricted herring landings in particular, conservation measures rendered essential in order to preserve the basic stock resources of this very valuable fish.</P>
    <P>The figures tell their own story.  The value of sea fish landings in 1976 was £12.9 million sterling.  The value rose to £18.7 million last year, an increase of nearly 50 per cent in the value of sea fish landings.  During the same period, 1976 and 1977, the value of sea fish exports increased from £20.6 million in 1976 to £25.4 million in 1977.</P>
    <P>The landings' figure is substantial. The value of landings increased by 50 per cent in 1977 as against 1976, in spite of the fact that the traditional lucrative herring fishery in the Celtic Sea was totally closed, and very partial bands were operating in regard to herring fishing in the north-west and the western coast areas.  Of course, that again represents lucrative fishing.  In spite of the very necessary conservation measures which tended to pull down the overall volume figures of landings and value figures, the volume of the landings figures were up from 80,700 tons in 1976 to 84,200 tons in 1977 and the value of these landings increased from £12.9 million to £18.7 million, representing an increase of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>These figures put this whole situation into perspective.  They show the reality behind the froth is that we have got a steadily prospering sea fishing industry, an industry which needs to be minded, protected and guarded by imposing, on scientific advice at all stages, the necessary conservation measures which may be required to protect and enhance the various stocks as they become endangered.  I cannot place enough emphasis on conservation. There is now a growing awareness nationally and within the <Col N="257" /> Community, and internationally beyond the Community, of the importance of conserving fish stocks.</P>
    <P>If the situation of a few years ago were allowed to continue unimpeded and unhindered, we were facing a drastic diminution of fish stocks which if the pattern continued, would have led to the virtual elimination of fish stocks in the oceans and sea waters of the world.  That is now being arrested not just in Ireland but throughout the Community, where very serious action is being taken in regard to the North Sea herring stocks, and throughout the world.</P>
    <P>With the creation of the 200-mile zone, which I feel will be finally legitimised as the norm for every country under the Law of the Sea Conference when it is finalised&mdash;it has not come to finalisation yet, but so many countries have now adopted the 200-mile zone that I feel it will become the norm&mdash;far more effective policing and monitoring of fishing can take place to ensure the preservation and conservation of stocks and to organise fishing on a far more scientific basis than heretofore, when the oceans of the world were wide open to unlimited, unhindered and unimpeded fishing by countries who specialise in deep sea trawling and deep sea fishing in every and any water to which they could get access.  I mention that point because it is important to put that whole aspect of our fisheries into the proper, responsible and constructive context.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy spoke very rightly about the important aspect which follows on the catching endeavour, that is, the whole aspect of processing fish on shore and to ensure we have got the onshore facilities to process fish.  The employment factor comes in here, which is far more important in the long term, in my opinion, from the social point of view, even than the catching aspect.  Shore employment can yield anything from 5:1 to 10:1 as against employment on boats.  With boats now going more technological in regard to catching gear and employing fewer, the tendency is for a higher proportion, a growing proportion, to be employed in added-value <Col N="258" /> shore fishing industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy spoke rightly of the unnecessarily high level of imports of processed fish.  I agree with him that much more sophisticated forms of processing are essential.  This applies in the food industry generally, but we are dealing here with the fishing industry. In conjunction with the IDA we have embarked on a positive campaign to encourage such added-value processing. We had a very real success in Donegal where an excellent Irish firm have been established and are canning both herring and mackerel in a very sophisticated form under a world wide brand label.  We hope to establish a sprat cannery in the near future.</P>
    <P>Some very interesting proposals are coming forward in regard to Castletownbere where the industrial estate is now being completed.  I have directed that a special drive be undertaken by the Industrial Development Authority and Bord Iascaigh Mhara to secure the required onshore factories for the industrial sites which are now in the final stage of completion in Castletownbere, where the bridge is being completed to Inish Island, where the industrial side is located, where the harbour works are nearly finished, and where we will have room for 16 to 18 factories inside a matter of months.  There are some very interesting proposals providing for full vertical fish processing at every level from freezing right up to canning.  Every conceivable type of processing will be envisaged under these specific proposals on which I hope to be in a position to make specific pronouncements in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that what we want in regard to fish processing is to increase landings and, if necessary, to engage in joint venture operations of that kind involving outside firms linking up with Irish firms, and outside catchers linking up with such onshore processing developments.  I have discussed this matter with the Irish fishing organisations.  They see no objection to such developments, provided the outside catchers coming in here relate their landings directly to <Col N="259" /> onshore processing in Ireland.  The fresh market within the Republic will not be affected in any way by such landings.  I see Castletownbere in particular offering itself as a very likely centre for the type of development I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>Killybegs continues to be the major fishing port in terms of landings.  I am very glad to be able to say that the auction hall, which will be an essential part of the selling and distribution of fish landed in Killybegs, has now been cleared and is going to tender in a matter of weeks.  I hope it will be built and completed before the end of the year.  With regard to other developments in Killybegs a syncro-lift has been sanctioned.  Certain filling work is required there.  This is ready to be started within a matter of weeks. Tender advertisements will be published very shortly and work can proceed. The two outstanding works necessary at the moment to make Killybegs a fully sophisticated port should be completed by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The Howth works will also be going out to tender in a matter of weeks.  That is a much longer development and will take some years.  The first stage of the port development work should also commence before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>It is essential today to have proper landing and processing facilities.  All that area of investment in the fishing industry is going to be even more important in the future than the catching side of it.  We must build side by side with the catching side an important industrial arm.  With that in view I propose to ensure a major development to make Rossaveel the major fishery harbour for the west and to orientate Galway more and more towards its natural development as a commercial harbour.  A substantial pier has already been built at Rossaveel where fishing activity has grown in terms of personnel and boats.  All we need to do now is to build the infra-structure on shore to make Rossaveel a major fishery harbour as far as the west is concerned.  The development of fish stocks has been very heartening in the whole area from Loop Head to <Col N="260" /> Belmullet.  There will be substantially improved fish stocks in that area and a new herring fishery has developed substantially there in the past two years.</P>
    <P>Other fishery harbours are going to be developed as well.  We have development in hands at the moment at 29 other landing places around the country including major works at Greencastle, Burtonport, Cahirciveen, Skerries and Clogher Head.  Castletownbere, Rossaveel and Killybegs are the major important works in hand at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy rightly raised the point, in the course of his contribution, that the operations of Spanish fishermen need to be looked at closely. I share his view and I have taken some action on that point.  I concur completely that there were a large number of Spanish fishermen fishing without a licence in our waters and that the fines were not acting as a deterrent; in other words we had a disorganised situation.  I have taken that up as a matter of urgency with the Commission.  As far as Spanish vessels are concerned the Commission have agreed, following my representation, that the number of Spanish vessels to be licenced under the current Spanish Autonomous Agreement be considerably reduced.  That means cutting by approximately half the number of Spanish boats functioning within 20 miles of our coasts. The discussions are still going on.  Gill netting by Spanish vessels which was causing harm to our fish stocks is banned.  Hopefully, that is the regime that we will impose for Spanish vessels, who have been the main offenders in the current year as far as third countries are concerned.  We have taken up the matter actively with the EEC.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy has raised the question of the serious position obtaining in regard to sea fishing arising out of the recent High Court decision which held that the District Court was not the appropriate court to impose forfeitures involving substantial loss to the offending parties and that this type of offence carrying a forfeiture required to be met in a higher court. That is as briefly as I can put it, the <Col N="261" /> gist of the High Court decision. Deputy Deasy has brought in his own measure on that account.  With all respect to him, I will have a more comprehensive measure, because I have the facilities of the draughtsman's office available to me, and my measure will involve the principles set out in Deputy Deasy's Bill.  I hope to have it in hand inside two weeks, and perhaps we could usefully discuss, through the Whips with the Ceann Comhairle's office the need to merge the two debates.  I do not see the point in pursuing two different legislative measures at the same time when we are trying to achieve the same thing. Our Bill is the more comprehensive. It was delayed because of the constitutional and legal points that had to be got over, and they were gone into in considerable detail by the Attorney General personally to ensure that we are not faced with another legal <i>contretemps</i> in six months' time when the Bill becomes law.  This was the reason for the care in the preparation of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy is entitled to his point, but we would have had the measure anyway.  The Bill will get rid of the situation where, since the High Court decision, forfeitures could not be imposed in either the District Court or any court, because there is only District Court procedure under the 1959 Act.  We have the ridiculous position at present where, despite the excellent efforts of our protection services, our courts are limited through the District Court to imposing a fine of £100.  I propose to remedy that by having a two-pronged system of offences, one in the District Court and one by way of indictment in either the Circuit Court or the Central Criminal Court.  One system will involve a £500 fine plus certain forfeitures&mdash;which we feel escaped from the High Court's decision&mdash;of illegal gear or nets or fish illegally caught, on conviction by the District <Col N="262" /> Court.  The other prong is by way of indictment before a jury with penalties up to £100,000 for the first offence, and on the second offence confiscation of the boat with the blanket forfeiture provision.  There will be provision also for consequential measures such as detention of boat and crew for 48 hours after being brought into port to enable full investigation and examination of the boat and crew members to take place in order to secure proof to copperfasten the matter.  I propose also to provide penalties for consequential offences relating to the need to have proper registration displayed on the boat and so on.  We are going to move into greater scrutiny and examination of fishing boats, and we must establish a regime of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the 200-mile zone we will have to share fishing in one way or another with our other Common Market partners, with a decided advantage obtaining to Ireland by reason of the special preferential position that has been acknowledged for us by our EEC partners.  This situation arises from the fact that our fisheries are under-developed and that there are very important social and regional problems involved for the fishing communities around our coasts, located as they are in remote and underdeveloped areas. Quotas have been allocated to us acknowledging this situation.  During the past three years these quotas have meant increases varying from species to species of between 60 to 80 per cent in the allocations in respect of the various stocks of fish.  That situation does not apply fully to herrings because there has been a diminution regarding the total amount for that species, but in percentage terms our allocation is increased although the volume is decreased by reason of the partial conservation plans that have been introduced around our coast.  We agreed to these quotas as an interim measure and we trust that the situation will be finalised at a very important fisheries conference, because, coming towards the second half of the year, which is the main fishing period, it is evident that the situation will have to be finalised soon.  A conference is to be held <Col N="263" /> in Brussels from 19 to 21 June and we will be fighting hard there to maintain and retain the quotas that have been allocated to us by the Commission and which give us a substantial preferential advantage.</P>
    <P>There are times when I am baffled to hear some of the spokesmen for the fishermen allude to the British Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries as being in some way championing our case.  These quotas will be fought very strongly, particularly in relation to the Irish Sea, by the British.  They will be fought strongly by the British also in relation to the north west coast or as it is known The West of Scotland fisheries.  Therefore, so far as the EEC are concerned they and our mainland European partners are agreeable to the quotas that we have been allocated and to which I have agreed as an interim measure for this year.  The people opposing those quotas are the British.  Some spokesmen for our fishermen seem to think that the British are helping our fishermen in some way merely because they are making noises about an exclusive 50-mile limit, a concession they know they will not attain. Incidentally, they have watered down that limit with a preferential position for them of between 12 and 50 miles. Week after week the British prove they they are not on our side with regard to the acceptance by the Community of our special preferential position, a position that arises from the Hague agreement of three years ago and whereby there is allocated to us each year a percentage increase in quotas which by next year will be double the allocation of 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: It was done by the Manx Government but it was a matter of convenience between them and us. We have a very good quota there <Col N="264" /> particularly for herring, for which we have a quota of 2,200 tons, which is more than double what we had last year.  We hope to retain that quota despite British opposition, but I take the Deputy's point that we would need the control ourselves in regard to the boats going in there and in regard to the general monitoring of the situation. Last year our quota for herring in that area was 800 tons so there is a very substantial increase this year.</P>
      <P>By reason of better protection methods as well as a better scheme of penalties and a better system of monitering we would hope to be able within the 200 miles to organise properly the fishing in that area.  Our information at present is that the third countries who are not entitled to fish there except by way of special concession are, broadly speaking, with the exception of Spain, observing the 200-mile zone.  I refer in particular to the eastern European countries.  The Commission and ourselves have succeeded in putting Spain into a rational regime in regard to the exercise of her rights. It has been pointed out to Spain that unless she complies in this respect problems may arise regarding her membership of the Community.</P>

We can do this only if there is a proper licensing system, if there are adequate penalties for breaking the law within that area and if there is a proper protection system to ensure that the law is enforced.  In that connection it is important that the Community through the Commission have agreed in principle to allocate £30 million to the Irish Government for expenditure both this year and during the next four years on the purchase of craft and planes for the purpose of having a fully-equipped protection service in respect of our coasts, both for the outer 200-mile area and for the inner area where the fishing plans operate.  This is to ensure that the third countries are excluded outside the 200 miles and that our Community partners within that limit obey the law, do not exceed their quotas and do not go into areas from which they are banned for reasons of conservation.  This matter is being delayed because of lack of British agreement, but it is an important concession and one that was not in existence when we took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. Murphy Mr. P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>: But Irish fishermen must stay away from those areas also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: This concession means that those of our boatyards that can meet the demand involved, and obviously Verolme is one of them, are assured of a proper boat-construction programme for the years ahead.  This will ensure that the protection vessels are provided.  The protection vessels, numbering five or six, will be built in Ireland.  The economy of Cork and Cobh and the surrounding areas should benefit from that investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of fisheries which is very important is inland fisheries.  I want to emphasise that a Bill relating to the establishment of the Central Inland Fisheries Board and seven regional boards should be ready for publication within the matter of a month.  We are not likely to get a full Second Stage reading before the recess but it will be given priority after the <Col N="266" /> recess.  It will be available for publication during the recess and I will be glad to hear suggestions from Members and interested organisations.  I would like to see that interest displayed during the recess by having as much consultation as possible with the interests concerned. This Bill will require consultation because it is setting up a new structure for our inland and salmon fisheries.  As I said, this structure will involve a Central Inland Fisheries Board and seven regional boards located around the coast&mdash;north-west, west, south-west, the Shannon area, Waterford, east Cork and Leinster area, and will involve an amalgamation of a number of existing boards of conservators and the intergration of the present Inland Fisheries Trust.</P>
    <P>I have allotted an extra £500,000 this year to the new structure to recruit the necessary personnel in advance of the establishment of the administration.  That is very important. There is no point waiting until this Bill is passed and then recruiting staff. We have already started recruiting and have started discussions with the trade unions and the officials of the two bodies to set up a proper staff structure in the new administration.  I envisage the cheif executive to be a responsible official who will have working under him a full-time properly trained staff with full rights of establishment and superannuation.  What is needed badly in regard to inland fisheries is protection and development. Heretofore this was done through the boards of conservators on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  There were too many casualties and too many temporary people taken on.  There was inadequate financing and control.  These boards are doing excellent work but in very straitened circumstances.  They will require money, of course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister was reported in the media three months ago as having made a statement to the Inshore Fishermen's Association that if he did not wipe out or seriously curtail illegal drift netting at sea this season he would resign.  My information is that the poaching is continuing on an unabated scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="267" />
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Will the Deputy give me time?  I have not finished my speech.  I am talking about the structures we hope to establish in the new legislation.  Hopefully this will mean there will be better staff and a better finance system of fishery boards that would handle on a joint basis salmon, trout, and coarse fish problems.</P>
      <P>I am very glad Deputy Deasy raised that point.  Within the next few days the Naval Service will be in active operation&mdash;I am not going to say where&mdash;in various areas to deal precisely with the problem I said would be tackled.  This is the first time that the Naval Service have been organised by any Government to do such a job. I want to pay tribute to the naval protection service.  They performed an excellent job when dealing with foreign boats fishing illegally in our waters. An equal menace&mdash;and this does not apply to foreigners&mdash;is represented by some illegal Irish fishermen in larger boats off the coast who have been depriving the legitimate small traditional drift net fishermen of their livelihood in various areas in the past two or three years.  This menace only arose during the last Government's time.  It was not there to anything like the same degree but was let go on unabated over the past three or four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Drift netting at sea is a recent phenomenon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is the point I am making.  This menace continued in recent years due to the negligence of the previous Government.  Forgive the pun, but policy was allowed to drift in this area and larger Irish trawlers who had no right to impinge in our traditional salmon waters moved in and caused a serious deterioration in salmon stocks over the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the precise figures available which show how the drift occurred. It started about 1973 continuing through 1974, 1975 and in 1976 it started to dip.  They had so depleted our salmon stocks in those years that in 1976 and 1977 the graph started to go down.  That is a serious situation and I will do what I can to make sure it stops.  The only practical step open <Col N="268" /> to me to deal with this menace was to use the naval protection service.  The boat facilities available to boards of conservators and their protection staff were not sufficient to deal with the problem.  A serious incident occurred where guns were used by a large trawler off Loop Head last summer and the boat belonging to the Limerick board of conservators had to go into retreat.  This time the Navy will be on the job.</P>
    <P>The Navy will be on the job from now until the end of the salmon fishing season.  We decided to do this from early June on because this is the time when large-scale illegal netting takes place.  A system is worked that involves large trawlers with drift nets of from four to eight miles in width being carried between them across the salmon runs running from the south-west to the north-west.  This system was used off the Shannon last year, off the coast of Donegal and off part of the south-west coast with very serious consequences. We may not succeed in our efforts to curb illegal netting but at least for the first time the forces of the State are being used in this regard. I was amazed at some editorial comment in one of the daily papers that questioned the wisdom of changing the Navy's role in this respect.  The Navy is there as is the Army to aid the civil power in enforcing the law if the law is being flouted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: We wish the Government every success in what they intend doing but if they are not successful we will ask the Government to fulfil their promise to the inshore fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Although it is late in the day something is being done about a matter which was deteriorating to an alarming extent.  It is not just in regard to the catching side that we have a problem.  Extra staff are being taken on by the various boards this year to concentrate on the task of the inspection of salmon dealers, registers in hotels and restaurants with a view to making the disposal of illegally caught fish much more difficult.  The Garda are co-operating in this effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not just a question of dealing with the fishermen, we will also deal <Col N="269" /> very stringently with the onshore people who are causing trouble.  Because salmon has increased in value a big commercial profit is involved and people will break the law to get money. In the process of doing that they damage the legitimate livelihoods of small traditional drift net fishermen, they do serious damage to our tourist industry which advertises the availability of salmon for angling purposes and they kill off a natural resource that has been synonymous with Ireland for centuries.  It would be an outrageous commentary on us as a nation if at the end of the day our salmon stocks disappeared not because of the actions of marauding foreigners but because of the actions of some of our people who flout the law to make money for themselves without thought for others in legitimate business. It would be sad if we did not make an effort to ease the problem.</P>
    <P>In relation to forestry, I decided some months ago to make a substantial increase in the grant available for private planting.  The position was that for years private afforestation did not get the required attention so I decided to raise the grant for private planting in areas of up to 40 acres from £35 to £90 an acre and for private planting in larger areas £50 per acre.  I have also ensured that where existing grants are due on an instalment basis they will be increased by a similar percentage. We have practically trebled the rate of the grant for private planting. The effect is that a number of cooperatives have shown interest in developing private planting on a co-operative basis with the backing of insurance company funds by way of legitimate investments by insurance companies in timber or land growing timber.  The north Connacht farmers are preparing a pilot proposal within their area which covers Mayo, Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo, involving the purchase of large areas by way of agreement, with the farmers remaining on, acting as stewards, making use of the State grants and being financed on a loan basis by certain insurance companies with whom they have been negotiating.</P>
    <P>I regard that as an important aspect to encourage tree farming and to encourage <Col N="270" /> people to think in terms of timber as a crop that can with the development of sitka spruce as a very fast growing species of timber, yield an income from thinnings now in 12 to 15 years.  It is significant that some of the best land for this purpose is in areas where land has proved to be inadequate for normal farming, areas such as County Leitrim where because of the drainage system the land is not good for traditional agricultural methods but is ideal for forestry and for sitka spruce.  We must recognise that this tree farming involves the retention of the population in an area managing their own farms.  State afforestation ran into some opposition because it involved the acquisition of land and sometimes involved people leaving a certain area.  Private tree farming on a co-operative basis involves the farmers remaining and participating in the development of the crop.  This idea is only at an experimental stage as yet but I am sure we will hear more about it.</P>
    <P>In relation to State forests, the target of 10,000 hectares or 25,000 acres is still being maintained and there are now substantial quantities of timber coming on stream.  For this reason the Industrial Development Authority in conjunction with my Department have embarked on a study on how we should utilise the tremendous volume of timber that will come on stream inside of the next two years and thereafter. There will be a consistent, continuing recycling process, at the level we have now reached.</P>
    <P>Heretofore our added value aspect in regard to timber has been just about adequate for the sort of timber resources we had up to now.  In the future we will have a considerable amount of timber available but what we have at the moment is not adequate and does not have a high enough added-value content.  I refer to the existing factories, excellent as they are, at Athy, Waterford and at Scarrif where there is the wallboard development as the primary added-value product.  That is good in itself but there are more advanced ways in which there can be a higher degree of employment.  I am <Col N="271" /> referring now to the paper, woodpulp and newsprint industries.  It is significant that all our newsprint requirements are imported to the value of about £15 million.  We have no newsprint industry or technology.</P>
    <P>This is now being considered by a committee of my Department and by the IDA, and I hope in the coming months to be able to announce something concrete with a view to encouraging private enterprise by way of assistance or by way of direct State action.  The other factory, Clondalkin Paper Mills, is engaged also in added-value processing of timber.  Discussions have taken place with them, with the other factories and with the timber industry generally as well as with the IDA to see how we may further this development.  It is essential to plan now.  We have sufficient factories to absorb what is coming offstream now but they will not be sufficient in two years' time.  It is important that we start planning for the future so that when there is an upsurge in raw timber we will have the processing facilities ready.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen and Deputy Deasy referred to the wildlife service.  This has now reached finality since the last Estimates debate.  The Wildlife Advisory Council under the chairmanship of Mr. William Finlay, Governor of the Bank of Ireland, and with various wildlife interests have been established. This council is the advisory council to me on the various complex matters and interests that are associated with the preservation, conservation and the legitimate utilisation of wildlife. It is essential to have a council of this kind on which all the various interests are represented as well as my nominees in order to reach a consensus on what should be done.  Hopefully the council will work.  The legislative machinery exists.  More staff are needed but recruitment has started. The council are now functioning and they have established sub-committees under the various headings with a view to offering a continuing advisory service to me from the people on the ground.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank those Deputies who contributed to the debate.  Earlier I <Col N="272" /> made some remarks about inadequacy with regard to numbers, but I am most thankful to Deputy Deasy and to Deputy Treacy for their contributions. In particular I wish to thank Deputy Deasy; I thought Deputy Treacy dealt with many extraneous details and in the main the politically overheated aspect in relation to fisheries.  It is time that we forgot who said what in relation to this matter. It is time we got down to making constructive and responsible contributions and realised that what we do must be done in a Community context.  That is the reality of the situation, and we cannot go it alone in the matter of sea fisheries.  That has been the situation since 1 January 1973 and, if it needed to be emphasised, it was emphasised by the European Court in their decision last year on the Coalition's measure.  Of course our special interests have to be fought for but that must be done in the knowledge that it will be around the negotiating table. Only in that way can we solve this vexed question, only in that way can we work out a Community fisheries regime.  I hope that will be done as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary that we have an agreement tomorrow, but during the next 12 months I hope it will be worked out because the uncertainty that has been generated in the past few years has not helped the balanced growth of the sea fishing industry. Much hard work will have to be put into the negotiations in the next 12 months.  At the moment all that is happening is that the Community are being brought into disrepute over their seeming incapacity or inability with the nine countries to reach an accommodation in this area.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the House for a constructive debate, and in particular I wish to thank Deputy Deasy.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Foreign Affairs).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his excellent staff on this very comprehensive Estimate which includes both foreign affairs and international co-operation.  The work of this Department involves much continuous and painstaking work of goodwill on behalf of the people of Ireland.  Therefore, it requires consummate skill in international diplomacy, in negotiation and communication with many of the 160 countries throughout the world.</P>
      <P>The work of this Department has been seen most openly in recent times with the visit to Ireland of the Queen of Denmark.  On that occasion we witnessed the quiet and very efficient organisation of the Department, and that was enjoyed very much by the people during the visit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that there is a great deal of behind the scenes work in a Department like Foreign Affairs.  Many meetings must be held and many visitors must be looked after.  I would like to add my congratulations to the Minister's gracious wife for her contribution as a hostess for our country.  It is most ungracious of us not to recognise the painstaking and detailed work of a hostess on our behalf.  This work is <Col N="274" /> being done extremely well for us.</P>
    <P>In my contacts with the Department of Foreign Affairs I have always found the staff extremely helpful and internationally very well regarded.  I found this particularly in the Department's permanent representation in Brussels. I was privileged to visit Brussels and Luxembourg recently with the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation, when we were given a very detailed breakdown of the current position in the Commission and the work in Brussels by the permanent representation. It is quite clear, from meeting those people, how extremely capable and efficient they are and how deeply involved in their work and committed to it they are.</P>
    <P>I intend to comment briefly on a number of areas, which include the North of Ireland, our relations with the EEC, our relations with Third World countries, our relations with other economic groups and international co-operation and development aid with particular reference to the semi-State bodies and their functions in this regard.  I welcome the Taoiseach's and the Minister's unequivocal commitment to a peaceful solution to the problems in Northern Ireland and to the positive pursuit, by diplomatic initiatives, of new political structures, which will have wide support among the people of Ireland, north and south.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he will give priority to the development and expansion of economic co-operation between north and south and that this matter is being currently reviewed by the British and Irish Governments. I look forward to the findings of this review body at an early date.  The question of United States aid for Northern Ireland raises many hares.  I welcome the recent initiatives aimed at channelling those moneys into constructive projects.  Well-meaning Irish Americans should be encouraged to invest in north and south projects and social, cultural, recreational and educational exchange and interchange between the north and south of Ireland. Such funds could be used to promote justice, peace, harmony and reconciliation between north and south.  I believe it is now timely to establish an Irish-American <Col N="275" /> foundation to develop this programme and administer such funds.</P>
    <P>In regard to our relations with the EEC we became full members on 1 January 1978.  In the context of the Department of Foreign Affairs it is very important to bear in mind that the transitional period is over and that there should be an obvious and quite appreciable change in our attitudes to the EEC.  We should have in all our negotiations and in all our work with the EEC a new sense of confidence and belonging to the EEC and involvement in it.  We need a new outgoing and non-apologetic approach at this stage.  We are now the EEC and the EEC is us.  We are inclined to talk about it as if it was across the water some place when at this stage we are totally involved.  The young people will grow up to recognise themselves as being Europeans within the EEC while we still have to make our personal transitional adjustments even though the economic ones are over at this stage.</P>
    <P>One of the major events in our relations with the EEC is the European elections which will be held on 7 June next year.  These will have their effect on the bureaucrats in Brussels and Luxembourg.  Many of those people might like to think that very little will change but I believe that the new representatives, who will be elected by the people on 7 June 1979, will speak with the authority of the people when they go to the European Parliament.  I believe they will begin to have, at that stage, an increasing effect on the bureaucracy of the European Community.</P>
    <P>There is a great challenge to all of us in the direct elections to convey the real significance of those elections to the electorate.  Many people have expressed concern about the likely turnout in such elections.  I am reasonably optimistic because the Irish people have taken a very sensible interest in the European Community.  We may have to alter the procedures in the Dail to ensure that European parliamentary representatives are heard on a formal basis here.  We may need some new structures to make this certain especially because, in due course, it is not <Col N="276" /> intended to operate a dual mandate. At this stage we should give some thought to the changes in our structures which are desirable to meet the requirements of directly elected parliamentarians in Europe.</P>
    <P>We should try to be full Europeans in every sense and not reluctant participants, working, as suggested, on cutdown salaries.  I do not like to think that the people we send to Europe will be less thought of than the people sent from other countries.  The effects of EEC membership are seen in our community here.  The main benefits have been in agriculture.  The Agricultural Research Institute have shown that farm incomes have doubled between 1970 and 1977.  This is based on family income per family worker.</P>
    <P>The system of intervention has dramatically changed the marketing of the major agricultural products.  We now have fewer fluctuations and greater security for the farmer, which was one of the original objectives. There is hope for enormous increase in output, to which we are working. When we look at the FEOGA grants system we find under the guarantees, which include the intervention system, that we have done particularly well and that the level of grant assistance rose from £37 million in 1973 to £244.6 million in 1977.  This was more or less in line with expectations.  When we look at the guidance section of FEOGA, which includes the farm structures, we find that the £2.8 million received from the EEC in 1973 has only become £7.5 million in 1977. This indicates that the guidance section has not had a major impact on farm development and the development of farm structures as yet.  There is considerable scope for new development here.</P>
    <P>In fact a question asked here recently by Deputy Joe Walsh brought forth the data and the figures, and these figures showed that under Directive 159 the Exchequer contributed £24.3 million&mdash;that is, under the farm modernisation scheme&mdash;and the EEC contributed £2.25 million. That was quite surprising.  I suppose in the early stages there was the question of the removal of schemes already in existence here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> When we come to Directive 160 we find that the amount received from EEC funds is only of the order of £11,300 and under Directive 161 the amount is £71,529 in both sectors, sectors which include training and education.  We have not to date taken full advantage of the retirement schemes available.  Whatever the design of the schemes they are just not working in the way in which it was initially intended they should work.  Consequently, we need a greater investment in the form of structural improvements with emphasis on marketing and producer groups and increasing emphasis on training in agriculture.  This would be in the interests of both the producer and the consumer.</P>
    <P>When we look at the Social Fund, we find it has increased from £4.1 million in 1973 to £19.7 million in 1977.  Here there is a very interesting aspect in that AnCO, which deals with industrial training, received in 1976 £6.6 million on current account and £.64 million on capital account giving a total of £7.2 million during 1976.  If we contrast that with the £11,300 we find that in the industrial sector the impact of the EEC on us as a whole has been very considerable. There is, of course, very great credit due to AnCO for their work in availing of these funds.  I understand some of the other countries in the EEC are quite anxious to see how it is they have done so well.  I believe myself it is simply a matter of getting down to the terms of the fund and putting forward proposals which come within those terms.  Certainly this is an area which has had a major impact on our whole training programme within the industrial sector.  Such an impact has yet to be made in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Regional Fund, during 1978, 1979 and 1980 a sum of £75 million has been allocated to Ireland as against £35 million in the preceding three years.  It is treble the amount.  We are at times inclined, I think, to become over-concerned about the moneys allocated on a regional basis and not sufficiently conscious of the moneys which can become available from other funds to <Col N="278" /> people in regional areas.  This is something we should keep in mind in future negotiations in order to reap the greatest advantage.  This would not apply to AnCO since they have done so well under the Social Fund.</P>
    <P>There are new challenges coming in the near future.  One is the question of the enlargement of the Community with the entry of Greece first and then later with the entry of Spain and Portugal.  This enlargement will call for new adjustments.  New concepts will arise from the point of view of the Regional Fund.  There will be new levels of intervention for Mediterranean produce.  That could have certain advantages for us.  The original members had to make adjustments when we entered the community and now we, in our turn, will have to make adjustments.</P>
    <P>Unemployment and energy are two other major challenges.  Here there are opportunities for joint action.  The EEC is introducing recruitment and employment premiums.  It is giving funds towards energy research and energy conservation.</P>
    <P>Turning now to our relations with Third Countries, I know the Minister has paid particular attention to the Lome Convention and I fully support the statements he made.  He pointed out that the Lome Convention has introduced a number of new elements into Community-Third World relations &mdash;for example, the financial and technical co-operation, the scheme for the stabilisation of the export earnings of ACP countries and the grant of duty free access to the community for ACP purpose.  The Lome Convention has set an example for regional agreements between industrialised and developing countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that one of the major objectives over the next two years will be the re-negotiation of the Lomé Convention.  The present convention is due to expire in March 1980 and negotiations between the Community and the ACP countries in terms of Lome 2 are formally to open on 24 July next.  I think this convention has been a very worth-while development and I am glad the Minister gave it so much prominence in his opening speech.  I trust the negotiations will <Col N="279" /> be successfully concluded before the present convention expires.  It is important that no gap should be allowed to develop between Lomé 1 and Lomé 2.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, an obligation to look out for opportunities and to learn whatever lessons we can from other countries, be they Japan, the Arab States or the USA.  We have the expertise now to enter these markets and to encourage people from these countries to come here to work and invest their money and we have trained and experienced personnel to go out and avail of the opportunities within these other countries.</P>
    <P>In this respect our embassies play and will continue to play a very important part for us especially in States like the Arab States where one's credibility is very much in question, for commercial operators in particular, and where the Department of Foreign Affairs can readily establish the credibility of individuals and make it possible for them to begin working with these countries.</P>
    <P>I understand that in some of our embassies we have only one staff member. I am not certain of this.  If it is true, we should look at the possibility of providing at least two to enable them to function properly, to go out and visit people elsewhere, and to come back to Ireland at various times.  I am sure this is not extensive but I understand it exists in some cases.</P>
    <P>Turning now to international co-operation and development aid, in his speech the Minister singled out Ireland's development aid programme as an area of continuing concern in our foreign policy.  I note in his Estimate he provided for a 70 per cent increase in the allocation to this area over the amount used in 1977.  This country now gets many benefits from trade and economic contacts within the developing countries.  It is a very good thing that we have developed such relations with them.  Of course it is not acceptable to see potential export and profit returns as the main or sole justification for our involvement in development aid and co-operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> During the 1950s and the 1960s aid was officially deemed to include private investment.  This was unacceptable, and both the OECD and the UN definitions of aid specifically include private investment.  With Ireland's influence in this area developing at a rapid pace, it is appropriate to reexamine our overall strategy on co-operation and aid to developing countries. In this connection I welcome the Minister's proposal to establish an advisory council on development co-operation. This is probably the most appropriate time at which to set up an advisory council.  While this council on development co-operation will obviously oversee State and State-aided contributions to development aid, they should not ignore the operations of the private investment sectors in the developing world.</P>
    <P>In the past, as we know, there was widespread exploitation by other nations of under-developed regions. There was excessive profit taking, with no social contribution to the local community or to local development. To my knowledge we have not been guilty of this as yet, but it is one of the dangers against which we must protect ourselves.  We must be very clear on our determination to avoid this happening in our private sector. As a nation we will be held responsible for the overall operations of these companies. Therefore, it is important that we can be assured the standards in these companies are at an acceptable level.</P>
    <P>The semi-State bodies are already playing a major part in the Third World.  They have witnessed the dramatic and very welcome growth in their involvement in the Third World.  In itself, this growth brings with it its own problems.  There is now a real danger that the commercial and profit-making objectives of these bodies will be confused with and take precedence over non profit-making aid.</P>
    <P>DEVCO, a State agency for development and organisation, was set up in 1975 and includes some 28 bodies and institutes.  The intention in establishing DEVCO was to promote and <Col N="281" /> co-ordinate the response by the Irish semi-State sector to the needs of developing countries and to identify and promote projects in those countries. How has it worked to date?  The total turnover of the State agencies in DEVCO was £12 million in 1977 in respect of projects in developing countries.</P>
    <P>Apparently the ESB accounted for approximately £8 million of this and, according to Press reports, made a profit of over £2 million on their involvement. This indicates a very efficient operation and may be very satisfactory in commercial terms, but it raises the question of the objectives of the involvement of semi-State bodies.  In contrast, Guinness operate as a company in Nigeria for development and for profit.  Their objectives are clear cut.  We have little difficulty in knowing exactly where they will perform and what they are there for. In the case of a company like that, we would expect that their local contribution would also be good and generous.  That has been our experience here of that company to my knowledge.</P>
    <P>The profit made by the ESB may go to subsidise the Irish consumer.  In itself this is a very good thing and increases our overall efficiency.  There is nothing wrong with that, but it raises the question of whether the involvement is primarily one of development aid.  In this respect there is a need for a rethink.  We need to separate and distinguish the development contribution to ensure it is not swamped by commercial objectives. We need guidelines for the participation of State agencies in development aid as distinct from involvement in commercial ventures.  I want to be quite clear about this.  I see the involvement of State agencies in commercial ventures as very good, very wholesome, and very worth while, and as part of our going out into the world in a confident way.  It is important to distinguish the two roles and to be clear that, in effect, we are also making a distinct contribution to development aid.</P>
    <P>I suggest we should set up a working party to identify the opportunities <Col N="282" /> for State and semi-State involvement in Third Countries, and particularly the developing countries, on a commercial basis with backing from CTT. They would make profits in the normal way and then we would consider whether a fixed percentage of these profits should go back to DEVCO for use on projects of a nonprofit making nature.  This might be something of the order of 15 or 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>This may be an appropriate time to determine some formula for a contribution from commercially viable and profitable ventures.  It is the intention of the people as a whole, and it was the intention originally of those who became involved, to give help where it is most needed.  On the other hand, if we find there are also very profitable ventures, it would be worth-while to plough back some of the profit into these developing countries. Secondly, such a working party might specify clearly the function of the State agencies in non-profit-making development projects.  This would involve the worst off countries and the areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>It is of very real and immediate concern that the indiscriminate mixing of commercial and non-commercial projects will harm development co-operation in a way that might be quite difficult to undo by confusing Irish commerce and Irish development co-operation to the point where there seems to be little difference between the two.  When this happens our motives for development co-operation will inevitably and rightly be questioned, and doubts may be raised about the validity and integrity of our overall efforts at development co-operation at official and other levels. If the validity and distinctiveness of Irish development co-operation activities are accepted as desirable and as a proper object of national policy&mdash; which they are&mdash;they must be kept uncompromised and free from unnecessary and damaging pressures and the intrusion of commercial imperatives.</P>
    <P>Summarising on this aspect, this requires a clarification of the basis of semi-State involvement in developing <Col N="283" /> countries.  That they should be involved for commercial reasons is not questioned.  What seems to require clarification and assertion is the principle that precisely because they are semi-State bodies they should contribute appropriately to this country's official development co-operation programme. This would require a Government policy decision that the semi-State sector should contribute to our official national development co-operation efforts.  This need not conflict with involvement for commercial reasons in the Third World but should certainly be carefully distinguished from it, being justified as a logical consequence of the overall emphasis on development co-operation as a major aspect of national foreign policy, as the Minister has stated in his Estimate speech.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it would require procedures for evaluating present and future semi-State agency projects in developing countries to ensure that, whether financed or not from the Department's bi-lateral aid fund, they are consistent with and contribute to our official development co-operation objectives.  Thirdly, by restricting projects carried out under the auspices of DEVCO to ones which comply with agreed development criteria, we could include a clear-cut concessional element in these projects and criteria. This would be in line with the spirit of those who first mooted the concept of the State agencies development body, seeing it as a part of Ireland's overall development co-operation efforts.  Such a restriction would still leave the semi-State bodies free to engage in commercial operations and activities in the Third World but not under the auspices of development co-operation in the sense of development aid.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, we should look at the possibility of setting aside an agreed percentage of the profits from commercial projects to subsidise non-profit-making development projects in the Third World.  The Minister has proposed an advisory council, and the working party on the operation of DEVCO which I have suggested could give the Government clear guidelines <Col N="284" /> and advice in the future of our development aid and co-operation programmes.  I welcome the Minister's statement about the setting up of such an advisory council and the fact that he expects to make an announcement about it in the near future.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to the section dealing with development education, and I congratulate the Minister on introducing an estimate of £30,000 in this area.  To my knowledge this is the first time that there is an allocation for development education. This is a very worth-while inclusion in the Estimate.  I presume that it will lead to a programme of education which will be devised to involve the voluntary agencies as well, and that will mean a greater spread of factual information and general education about the situation in the Third World, and consequently will make the Irish people more aware of the facts and implications of that situation.  This budget is to be spent in Ireland, and I presume that it will include education in social justice and an examination of national and EEC policies in relation to development co-operation and aid.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I congratulate the Minister and his Department on a very comprehensive and interesting Estimate speech and I recommend this measure to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Foreign Affairs Estimate and to wish the present Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, the best of fortune in his post.  Needless to say, he has a most difficult task to follow in the footsteps of Deputy FitzGerald, who gave this Ministry a new dimension and brought it from the position of being a sort of pleasantry to being a real feather in our cap in the eyes of the world.  His influence and opinion were highly valued and he did our image at international level a world of good, especially at a time when we needed a boost after our sorry experience of troubles in Northern Ireland over the last eight or nine years.  I wish the present Minister the best of luck, and I feel that he has done a reasonably <Col N="285" /> good job so far.  He has performed admirably in his position.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Estimate with which we are presented, the first thing I ask myself after reading it is, &ldquo;Do we really have a foreign policy or do we just trail along on the coat-tails of others?&rdquo;.  We are members of two major organisations in the world context, one being the UN and the other the EEC.  I often feel that whereas we should have a major voice in these bodies we are not expected to have an opinion.  Sometimes we are even afraid to express an opinion.  In his speech introducing his Estimate the Minister said, and I quote from the Official Report of 4 May 1978, Volume 306, column 363:</P>
      <P>I turn now to world political problems as the third area where issues of concern arise for us in our foreign relations....</P>
      <P>First, it may be asked why we are concerned at all about world political issues, even such distant issues as the Middle East and Southern Africa. We are small and relatively weak; and we have our own problems in Ireland.</P>
      <P>That is a defeatist attitude, and we should be much more vociferous.  We are in an unique position.  As the Minister mentioned, there are some 160 countries in the world, but very few are in the enviable position in which we find ourselves.  We are free; we are not tied to pacts or governed by dictatorships.  Economically and militarily we are not unstable.  We are in the wonderful position where we can get up and express our views, and there is nobody better than the Irish to do so because we are quite articulate at times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the reputation of being adventurers, of having been leaders of world opinion down through the centuries even if this quality did not always manifest itself here at home. Those who went away made a very good impression not only in Europe but as far afield as Australia, New Zealand, South America and in particular the USA, Canada and Great Britain.  We have the ability to assert ourselves and we seem to form an ideal <Col N="286" /> link between the Third World or under-developed countries and the western or capitalist society.  We are part of the western world but we have had the experience of several centuries of colonisation.  Consequently, we know both sides of the story but we are recognised as being a country that was downtrodden for many years.  Therefore, our opinion is all the more respected in countries that are in that position today or were in that position up to recently.</P>
    <P>Our people in the main, whether lay or religious, had a major influence in the countries to which they emigrated but there were, too, the black sheep who may have been involved in sheep stealing in Australia, in claim-jumping in the Klondyke or in bank robbing in America.  However, we should have a greater voice and should express a definite opinion.  We are in a position to do that while too many countries are inhibited in that regard by reason of their military allegiance, their pacts or their economic dependence on major states or on groups of states.  In modern times the United Nations have become largely sterile.  We should be prepared to voice that view loud and clear.  As conflict has developed in various parts of the world the UN as a force that are supposed to mediate and attempt to settle differences have become increasingly less effective.  Where there have been major conflicts and where genocide has occurred on a major scale the UN have been seen to be totally ineffective.  This ineffectiveness has been illustrated in many instances in recent times.  We need only recall the Korean War of the early fifties through to the crisis in SouthEast Asia and the horrible war in Vietnam.  Today there are reports of genocide in Cambodia.  What action is taken by the UN to stop such dreadful activity?  Hundreds of thousands of lives are being lost.  There is genocide too, apparently, in New Guinea.  Five or six years ago the Government in Chile were overthrown but the UN seem to be totally ineffective in relation to such situations and seem only to become involved when conflict has ended.  It might be correct to say that they do too little, too late.  Unfortunately <Col N="287" /> their role has been seen to diminish and to have become diluted. It is time that the members of the UN had another look at their organisation and tried to make it much more effective so that it could become, as was intended originally, an organisation that could deal with problems as they arise.</P>
    <P>Because of the lack of commitment and of effectiveness of the UN, countries are beginning again to take on themselves the onus of colonisation or of tyranny.  This trend has been raising its ugly head in recent times in Africa more than in any other place.  We have had reports of the Russians and Cubans moving in to boost organisations, justifiably or otherwise.  This is not a good situation and should be condemned.  It is time that the UN censored severely countries that engage in such activity.</P>
    <P>The involvement of the Cubans and the Russians in Angola and more recently in Ethiopia and Somaliland does not augur well for the future.  The French, at least, have brought a certain amount of stability to areas where the UN have been seen to be ineffective. The actions of the French seem to counterbalance the effects of the Soviet and Cuban intervention.  That sort of activity on the part of any one country is not to be recommended, but I am not here to criticise the French. They have done a reasonably good job but we must be conscious always of the dangers of power, of the possibility of a country involved in such activity now operating to excess in future years.  It is unfortunate to have to raise this matter, but the problem is worsening.</P>
    <P>More recently the Russians and the Cubans have been involved in the Horn of Africa as a result of which there are now 10,000 French troops situated in various garrisons in countries around Africa.  That is not a good situation.  At present these garrisons are in Gabon, in the Ivory Coast, in Senegal and in Djibouti which was the last French colony in Africa, Although it was vacated by the French within the past six months, a considerable <Col N="288" /> garrison remains there.  There is active French participation internally in countries such as Western Sahara which has been divided between the Moroccans and the Mauritians.  Both groups have been assisted actively by the French.  There is French activity, too, in Chad and in recent weeks the French have been involved in Zaire. That involvement has been to the benefit of the people and the Government of that country.  If it had not been for the intervention of the French there is no knowing what would have happened to the whole of the province involved which was being annexed by the invading forces from Angola.</P>
    <P>The necessity on the part of the French to intervene in these areas illustrates how ineffective the UN have become.  There was the same type of intervention in Katanga in the early sixties.  We know the mess that was and low long it took to clear it up but the intervention was so swift and so effective that the conflict did not have a chance to grow although it had been ugly and had cost a considerable number of lives.</P>
    <P>The UN are too slow to act when conflict begins.  Would it not be better to have set up a permanent UN force which would be on standby and whose deployment could be decided within a matter of hours or of days at most by the permanent members of the Security Council? That would be the only way to ensure effective UN intervention and supervision of conflicts. It would be a much better system than a system whereby individual countries take the law into their own hands.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the French have no desire to become involved deeply in Africa because of the size of the situation there, but perhaps they see a peripheral advantage in so far as they will benefit by way of trading concessions, mineral rights and various other advantages by reason of their assisting the various countries.  However, their marginal economic benefit would not counterbalance the need for their involvement.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to comment on the suggestion of a permanent UN force being available at different <Col N="289" /> points around the world on a standby basis rather than to be depending on countries such as ours to send out a contingent weeks after a conflict has occurred and perhaps when it has ended.  The Lebanon situation is typical of what I have in mind.  The Israelis were on the point of withdrawing before the troops went in. There is not a lot of good in that.  The whole thing could have been stopped in the initial stages.  In Cyprus the Turks had actually got what they wanted by the time the United Nations intervened.  The United Nations did not stop the Turkish intent. It is almost superfluous for a United Nations force to be in Cyprus at present because they do not appear to serve any purpose there.  The conflict is finished.</P>
    <P>I move now to one of the areas where there is a problem and where the United Nations are involved, that is, the Middle East, in particular the Lebanon-Israeli question.  We should have an opinion on this and we should not be afraid to express it because there are definite rights and wrongs in this case.  I am glad to see some world leaders have not been afraid to express an opinion.  Up to the last year world opinion, and especially here, felt there was a lot of justification in the Israeli case, that they were fighting for their lives, that they were the under-dogs who were heavily outnumbered and it was right that there should be a lot of sympathy for them.</P>
    <P>The initiative taken by the President of Egypt, Mr. Sadat, was a magnanimous gesture.  He was extremely unpopular with his fellow Arabs, particularly the militant sections.  This magnificent gesture did not get the type of response it deserved.  In my opinion President Carter would be right to chide the Israelis, in particular their Prime Minister Mr. Begin, for not showing a more positive response to the initiative taken by President Sadat.</P>
    <P>As we all know that area has been a flash point for trouble for many years and will be a flash point for many years to come.  The Israelis may survive and win a number of wars&mdash;they are an extremely able race&mdash;but the time will <Col N="290" /> come when they will be defeated.  The weight of numbers alone will tell you that&mdash;it may be ten years or one hundred years.  Members of the United Nations who have voices should let them be heard.  The Israelis should have climbed down on their demands.  They should have surrendered some of the territory gained in the last conflict.  For instance, their intention to have a permanent settlement on the West Bank is a dangerous fallacy and should not be entertained and we should not be seen to support it.  We should oppose it and voice our opinion.  The whole Israeli&mdash;Middle East problem is extremely complex and difficult but we must be seen to be just.  If some people display excesses&mdash;and the Israelis were inclined to be excessive in their demands in recent times&mdash;then we must say so.  We must have a just solution. While the Israelis have the right to defend themselves so have the Arabs the right to call on the Palestinians whose homeland lies on the West Bank. They too have a right to property and to be the designers of their own destiny but at the moment they are not getting the opportunity.  I hope we will be seen to be impartial in these matters and that we are not carried away by the propaganda which I feel has been heavily one-sided for far too long.  We are not getting a clear picture of what is going on.  We should be much more objective.</P>
    <P>The Middle East wars have cost us and the rest of the world, in particular western Europe, dearly.  The Middle East is the source of our oil supplies. We have had to pay through the nose because the Suez Canal was closed and because of the natural avarice of the Arabs who feel they do not owe us anything.  They have upped the prices considerably.  I am not saying we should turn on the Israelis because of that but we should be seen to be impartial and clear minded on these issues.  Up to now our sympathies have been seen to lie too heavily on the Israeli side.  We should be seen to back up a just case.</P>
    <P>By necessity the report does not go into great detail, but there is mention of the enlargement of the EEC.  I believe Greece, Spain and Portugal are <Col N="291" /> negotiating to join and that their applications are being given favourable consideration.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs made a very valid point in his speech.  He said at column 359 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I have welcomed consistently the applications for membership of Greece, Portugal and Spain but I have also said that a political commitment which is not matched by action in the economic and institutional spheres is not a valid commitment. The existing Community must be strengthened to make it capable of bearing the additional burden of enlargement.</P>
    <P>He appeared to be saying that there will be too many lame ducks in the Community and that there will have to be a greater financial commitment by the stronger members to help the other applicants who are not well endowed financially.  These three applicant countries have very poor regions. Our portion of the regional fund will be diminished shortly if these poorer areas get the same treatment as Ireland. Those three countries are not known for their wealth; rather they are known for their poverty.  There will be the same amount in the kitty and if it has to be spread around a greater area we will get considerably less.  The only way this will not happen is if the stronger countries give more than they are doing at present.  That will be difficult, because, as we have seen in recent times, they are inclined to put in less and they are trying to lessen their commitment to such things as the regional fund.  We should be very careful that our position in the EEC is not weakened and that our benefits are not reduced because of the proposed membership of these three countries.</P>
    <P>I specifically want to refer to fisheries.  Before we joined the Common Market in 1972 the original Six drew up a common fisheries policy which suited themselves entirely&mdash;a very selfish, ugly policy.  They got away with it and they are still getting away with it, and from recent events it appears that they will be getting away with it for all time.  I do not <Col N="292" /> want to be unkind to the Minister for Fisheries in his absence so I will say nothing further on this matter.</P>
    <P>We are not going to get very much from the Six.  They are not going to go back on the original common fisheries policy.  Might it not be a good idea if the Nine drew up a new common fisheries policy which would be heavily biased in our favour?  People might say that that is not playing the game, but we have to look after ourselves in these trade pacts, economic groupings, or whatever you call them.  The Six got away with it and the Nine should do likewise.</P>
    <P>Others should not be allowed to scoop benefits for which we will get no return.  I do not see what the Greeks, the Portuguese or the Spanish can offer us in return for our fisheries. I have seen it authoritatively reported that the Spanish fishing fleet has as much tonnage as the whole of the EEC fishing fleet put together.  Their fleet is of enormous dimensions when one considers the sizes of the French, the Dutch fleet, the West German fleet, the British fleet and the Danish fleet which is very large.  We need not worry too much about the Greeks who we hope will confine themselves to the Mediterranean, the Adriatic and the Aegean Seas.  When we consider the absolute enormity of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets we have a very strong case for negotiating a fisheries policy which will benefit the Nine alone without giving concessions to the three new applicants.  Will the Minister refer to this in his reply?  Does the Minister feel this could be done, and if not why not?  If the Six could do it to us why can we not do it to them?  If the Spanish get major fishing concessions off our coasts the effect on our stocks will be substantial.  At the moment they are fishing illegally on an incredibly large scale and because of our inadequate fishing penalty laws they are geting away with it.</P>

      <P>: I can see enormous problems if the Spanish fleet obtains access to our shores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem has arisen in the fisheries field and it was unfortunate that the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not involve himself in fishery negotiations which were being held over the last nine or ten months.  The Minister's predecessor got involved with considerable results.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs should do likewise. It appears that the Danes will get considerable concessions for Greenland, which at present comprises 60 per cent of the land mass of the EEC. I know that Greenland is mostly ice and snow and is completely barren, but it has very important mineral resources such as zinc, lead, silver, iron, and uranium which is of considerable value in the world at the moment.  It seems that the population of Greenland are not too happy about their future membership of the EEC. I understand that in May of next year they will get their independence from Denmark, and that there is a strong possibility that shortly after the declaration of independence they may hold a referendum to see whether or not they will stay in the EEC.  When one considers that in the referendum which was held prior to the entry of Denmark 71 per cent of the population of Greenland voted against membership one can see that they may opt out.  The other members are not happy about this prospect because of their vast mineral resources.  It is important that they remain in the EEC but in return for their continuing membership they will make very heavy demands.  It seems that their major demand will be to be allowed to retain an extremely large exclusive fishery limit.  They may not be granted the whole 200 miles which they might start arguing for but they will get probably in the region of 100 miles.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs might see to <Col N="294" /> it that he could use this as a lever in our attempt to get a more extensive limit than we are getting at present. Greenland will play the fishery limit demand off against the natural advantages they have, so the Minister might bear in mind that any final agreement on fishery policy should include the terms of the agreement with Greenland.  They got no special concessions at the Hague agreement in 1976, and we did, and we should use it as a good bargaining position.  It is in the interests of all members of the EEC that they remain in the EEC. While we may not benefit directly from their mineral resources just as we do not benefit directly from the North Sea oil and gas, or the German steel and iron, it would do the economy of the Common Market good in the overall context of the years ahead.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Gundelach came to Donegal he made a big issue of that type of bargaining power, and just as a famous Donegal politician in a famous by-election some years ago told the people of Donegal that they could not have their bread buttered on both sides so Mr. Gundelach told us in Letterkenny that we could not have it every way, that if we wanted good prices for our agricultural produce and other benefits from the Regional Fund we would have to give way on the fisheries issue.  Maybe we will have to give way a little, but certainly not as much as seems to be intended.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to be funny, but if we claim jurisdiction over 32 counties, it seems strange for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to refer to Northern Ireland in the context of foreign affairs. It is an internal affair.  Should it be part of the Minister's portfolio?  It does not seem to be consistent that we should call Northern Ireland a foreign affair.</P>
    <P>I was tickled pink by an answer to a parliamentary question given by the Minister two months ago.  It was a very good answer, a statistic which sort of contradicted clearly a lot of the views expressed by the British media about southern Ireland being used as a base for attacks into Northern Ireland. The statistic the Minister gave was 1.06 per cent.  It shows quite clearly that our <Col N="295" /> involvement is very limited and that the troubles emanate from within the Six Counties.  I suggest that the Minister might circulate an answer like that which has such relevance at the moment to each daily newspaper in Britain and also to the television and radio networks with the request that they might publish the statistic given by the Minister when next they claim that the violence is emanating from the South.  The statistics will tell their tale.  No country is better at twisting facts than Britain.  Their capacity for propaganda and for using their Department of Foreign Affairs in order to twist facts is quite considerable and they are totally unscrupulous about doing it.  We should be a little tougher in our reaction on that front.  There is nothing like the truth.  We should stick their lies down their throats.</P>
    <P>A solution to the Northern Ireland problem is coming along naturally enough.  Violence has died down considerably in the past three or four years.  Successive Governments can take credit for the fact that they have been very tough here on security and by their vigilance they have helped to achieve this scaling down of violence. Of course the primary reason has been the reaction from the population in Northern Ireland.  They have rebelled and they have informed left, right and centre.  This is very clear from the number of crimes that have been solved in the past five or six years.  In most cases the perpetrators of these dastardly crimes have been convicted and sentenced.  This reaction is due to the public revulsion at the atrocities committed, whether they are from one side or the other.  The people have got fed up and have informed on the paramilitaries. This lessening in the incilence of violence is to be lauded and to be greeted with acclamation.</P>
    <P>We should have been able to capitalise on the scaling down of violence, but the major drawback has been the lack of stability on the part of the British Government at West-minister. For the last two or three years we have seen the Labour Government trying to appease the various minority groupings on which they are dependent. <Col N="296" /> They do not want to undertake any major initiative in Northern Ireland in case it might incense one group or the other.  They have decided to lie low in case they might upset some of the groupings.  That is unfortunate but it is a fact of life.  Perhaps after the next general election which seems but a few months away there will be a strong Government in Britain, whether Conservative or Labour. I hope that happens; otherwise political initiative will not be taken in Northern Ireland.  Our major wish in the forthcoming British election should be that a strong Government will be elected. The present soft-soaping and foot-dragging is due to the government's lack of a numerical majority in the House of Commons.  The sooner that day is gone the better.  We look forward to an initiative being taken on Northern Ireland on the return to power of one or other of the major parties with a reasonably large majority.</P>
    <P>I hope my comments have been of some use.  An obvious matter that involves the Department of Foreign Affairs is the Law of the Sea Conference that has not yet been completed. It seems to have been going on for years.  It is obvious that the final determinations of the conference will have a major impact on the economic life of this country in the centuries to come.  As surely as night follows day, the seabed around our coast will be just as important for mineral development as the land under our feet.  It is vital that we get the maximum benefit. The public are not very clear about what is involved and what we are entitled to.  Many think that the limits extend for only 200 miles but I understand they can be extended considerably further.  I hope the Minister can enlighten us on this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to know our position with regard to Rockall.  Can we hope to claim a considerable area around Rockall?  It appears that our case for possession in this instance is greater than any of the other contenders, Britain being the main contender.  I should like the Minister to tell us what is happening with regard to this matter and what he hopes to achieve.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> I was glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I wish the Minister every success in his Department in the years to come.</P>

      <P>: I should like to thank the Deputies who spoke for the wide-ranging contributions they made. They were critical in the positive sense of the word.  While I am gratified at the nature and level of the contributions, I cannot say I am very enthusiastic about the fact that so few Deputies spoke in the debate.  As far as I know, during the course of my opening address those benches over there were entirely denuded of any representative and it seems that for the course of my reply&mdash;as was the case for the two last contributions&mdash; the position is to remain the same.  I do not wish to be critical of any party, but each party has a representative spokesman for foreign policy and, while I appreciate that many obligations rest on Deputies, it seems strange that a party who have asked questions in this House and who have said a number of things did not have a representative present during the course of this debate.  It may be said that Deputies can read the Official Report but I think it appropriate that at least the spokesman, or representative of the spokesman, should be present.  I was spokesman for my party when we were in Opposition and I know that Deputies have many obligations but if one of the effects is to be that the fundamental obligation of a spokesman is to be overlooked it is time that that party should reassess their priorities.  Here is the place and this is the debate when the issues can be discussed generally, when the Minister is called on to reply and to justify what he has done.  I wish to have that point noted, not in any sense of superior criticism of another party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am speaking of the Labour Party and the fact that for most of this debate there has not been a representative of that party present in the House.  There was one contribution, but that is hardly representative of their concern for foreign policy.</P>

      <P>: I would like to put it on record that the Foreign Affairs spokesman for the Labour Party is today at the Transport and General Workers' Union Conference in Sligo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: The representative of the Labour Party on the first occasion was not at the Transport and General Workers' Union Conference. There are a number of important things to be said on this matter.  I would have thought that this was an occasion for the Labour Party representative to say them.  I want to thank the Deputies for their commendation of my Department. I would like to acknowledge on behalf of the House that the level of expertise and commitment which has developed within this Department&mdash;I am not saying it was absent any time in the past&mdash; in recent years, consequent on our membership of the EEC, has been of great strength to me as Minister and I am quite sure to my predecessor.  I am satisfied that their contact with the major issues touching the Department of Foreign Affairs and our foreign policy generally, their level of awareness and the level of their advice to the Minister is now, and has been in the past, a very significant security for the Minister.  I am glad the House has acknowledged this.  I would like to say that it is one of the firm foundations on which the Minister for Foreign Affairs can approach his responsibility in a consistent and positive way.  I would like on their behalf to thank all the Deputies who spoke for the kind words of commendation they had to say of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to some of the general criticisms which were raised in the course of some of the contributions the comments of the two Deputies present in the House are reasonably representative <Col N="299" /> of what seem to be the general criticisms.  Both Deputies suggested that I was perhaps too defensive in my opening address in relation to foreign policy, a bit thin on values generally and inclined at this stage to justify to the nation that we have a foreign policy when, as Deputy Ryan put it, we do not have to apologise to anyone for having it.</P>
    <P>I want to put the position clearly and clarify any misunderstandings there may be in this connection.  In Volume 306, column 363 on 4 May 1978 I said:</P>
    <P>First, it may be asked why are we concerned at all about world political issues, even such distant issues as the Middle East and Southern Africa.  We are small and relatively weak and we have our own problems in Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is the question that might be asked.  I gave the answer as follows:</P>
    <P>One answer is obvious.  Small as we are we are part of an international community and we can be deeply affected by distant events.</P>
    <P>I go on then to develop the theme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not suggesting that the Deputy was trying to misrepresent the position.  Sometimes when one puts a question in that rhetorical form, to enable one to develop the outlines of one's foreign policy, it possibly leaves one at risk that it might be misrepresented as representing one's own position.  It does not. I considered it appropriate in my first Estimate speech as Minister for Foreign Affairs to analyse the outlines of our foreign policy and to the extent that they would need to be justified, to justify the directions of that policy and to explain to the House the broad guidelines of our foreign policy during my period as Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not being defensive or trying to justify to the Irish people, much less people outside the country, why we, above all small or weak countries, <Col N="300" /> should have a foreign policy.  It is self evident that we have a foreign policy.  I trust that my speech explained the outlines of that policy, and to the extent that it may be helpful to add a few elements now I will do that.  I want to acknowledge that Deputy Ryan was perhaps as balanced in his commendations as he was in his criticisms in the negative sense.  I will not try to ignore one and extract the other and pin it on my lapel.  That would not be quite appropriate because I believe his contribution was a balanced one generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I appreciate the Minister's diplomacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is not perhaps a matter for that although it is the Estimate for Foreign Affairs.  I believe the record will show that Deputy Ryan was surprisingly generous in some of the things he had to say.  As I was the recipient of his generosity I should at least acknowledge that.  Soon after he made the point that we were unduly defensive he said that but for our involvement in the European Community we would be a mere pipsqueak in an international forum.  I do not accept that if we were not involved in the European Economic Community we should be a mere pipsqueak in an international forum.  I do not accept that during all the years before we joined the European Economic Community that we were only a pip-squeak.  I do not want to extract that and use it against Deputy Ryan. I want to say, having regard to our position now, which is particularly related to membership of the European Economic Community and the opportunities we have through that membership, we obviously now have even a more significant role as a small country than we had before we joined the European Economic Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said on a couple of occasions outside the House and it is well to reiterate it here, where I am primarily responsible, that for all of us foreign policy is not something that touches distant places or distant events and that we feel, for one reason or another, obliged to comment on to show our concern and to defend ourselves against the charge that we have no <Col N="301" /> view on this, that or the other.  Our foreign policy must be clear to all those who know what our policy in every national area is.  If people can clearly see and recognise the direction of Government policy at home then at least they have a basis on which they can begin to expect a consistency in our foreign policy.  One cannot exist in isolation from the other.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs does not of his own volition, because of his own spontaneous opinions, develop by the aid of themes that he will pursue in an international forum which are in no way related to priorities that have been determined in his national Government.</P>
    <P>The most powerful nations at every stage of history, who perhaps had the most comprehensive foreign policies, always justified their foreign policies and always felt more secure in the promotion of them because they were relative to the directions of their Governments.  It applied to the now defunct British Empire.  It applies to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union.  These are not areas where, in fact, the implementation of foreign policy operates in total isolation from national priorities.  These priorities may be right or they may be wrong.  That is another matter and I am not justifying what has been done by all or any of these countries from time to time.  But one can at least see in what way they are significant.  This does not apply merely to large countries. It also applies to small countries which may be small in terms of resources, in terms of international contact and connection, but big&mdash;let me not underestimate it&mdash;in terms of consistency, persuasion and determination to work through all the international organisations of which we are members for a greater world stability and peace.  That is the test by which Irish foreign policy has been and will be judged and the fact that there are now new opportunities open to us makes it all the more essential that we will in each new area pursue that consistent line.</P>
    <P>This does not mean that there has to be a clash between our moral judgments and our own self-interest.  One <Col N="302" /> does not, in fact, just make comfortable moral judgments in relation to foreign policy.  They are a great stability and security to back up the effective capacity you have to present your opinions and to have those opinions respected.  But moral judgments simply delivered in an abstract sense, without having the cogent influence and persuasion of at least recognition by your partners, if not your opponents, are not of any very significant value in international relations.  They may satisfy us in that we have on occasions discharged our responsibilities to ourselves by having views on troubled spots throughout the world.  But unless we can present these in a consistent way and win, to the extent that a small country can with a big reputation, a respect for that view and have that view promoted and supported at international level, then I would suggest that the moral judgment in itself is not in fact implementation of foreign policy.  I have made these introductory remarks to give a background to some of the areas which have been touched upon, obviously wide-ranging in geographical extent and in the nature of the comments made during the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn said he thought we could not have a serious foreign policy until the Government put forward in this House some system of values which we propose to operate.  I would have thought I had done that in terms of a system of values in may opening statement.  Unfortunately Deputy Quinn was not here to hear most, if any, of my opening statement.  In so far as he did not have the benefit of the record, he may have had a copy of my speech and a hasty reading of it may have helped him to overlook what was in it, because I quite clearly said at column 364 of Volume 306 of the Official Report what our aims in these four areas of activity are in foreign relations.  We want to do everything open to us to promote a future of peace, justice and stability for all of the people of this island.  We want to help to advance the prosperity and wellbeing of our people through our commitment to European integration, through our trade and other economic relations and through all of the other <Col N="303" /> economic arrangements entered into as part of the international community. We want to do what we can as a small country to advance the aims of peace and justice and order in the world. Finally, we want to increase the resources we devote to our aids programme until we reach the targets we have voluntarily accepted.  I should have thought that those four heads gave at least a fairly clear indication of the outlines and the values set forth as the criteria of foreign policy.</P>
    <P>In relation to the economic wellbeing of our own people, as a small open economy we, perhaps more than most, are affected to a very considerable extent by the economic conditions prevailing outside the country.  We are particularly affected by the economic environment within the EEC which, in turn, is affected by the economic environment with its main trading partners, Japan, the United States of America and its other partners through the Lome Convention.  That said, obviously our fundamental responsibility must be in the first instance to present our own plan and programme in a clear, consistent and visible way to our own people and also to our partners, be they within the European Community or otherwise, so that they, looking at us, can recognise this is the direction that the Irish economy and the Irish Government are setting themselves, this is the manner in which their people are responding, these are the targets they are setting, this is the security we could have if we are going to do business with that country and if we are going to base ourselves in industrial development in that country. That is the kind of administration and that is the kind of plan we are dealing with.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell on this, because it is not my immediate responsibility, but I think I can say that that kind of picture is being very clearly framed and not just for ourselves but for our partners within the European Community and our trading partners throughout the rest of the world.  It can be a matter of argument in the House as to who is most successful in our economic programmes but very soon, <Col N="304" /> within a matter of weeks and certainly before the House rises, I expect the House will have the opportunity of seeing the Government's Green Paper on economic development, and not just this House but the people with whom I am directly concerned, namely, those Governments outside this House who will also see it and, I believe, will recognise and identify that that is where the Irish Government are going.  That is vitally important for us in our economic relations with member states and with other countries.</P>
    <P>Now, in the presence of the former Minister for Finance, I do not want to make any niggling points about the contrast between now and previous times.  I recognise there was a difficult period over the last number of years in the international environment, a very difficult period, but I think it was made more difficult in the absence of a clear plan by the Government showing where we were trying to steer the ship during those stormy times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: We do not need to go back to the election difficulties. Perhaps it was those very issues that decided that.  It is evident now that our Community partners recognise this degree of consistency and this determination.  Having set our plan we now can say to our Community partners, and this is the very opposite of what the experience was over the last number of years: &ldquo;We have our plan.  Please let us know what yours is.  What is the framework within which we as a small country within the Community can make sure that we implement that plan?&rdquo; It is, I think, fair to say that the tables have turned because, in my recollection, the experience of the last three years was the Community saying they had their plan and asking Ireland where was ours and even getting to the point where they were setting guidelines for Ireland and directions and, some would say, interfering in what we <Col N="305" /> should or should not do.  That is not the position now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister knows there was no EEC plan since 1972. It was abandoned as a practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not talking in terms of an EEC plan in the sense of a national and economic plan such as we have.  If there is no EEC plan in the broadest sense, perhaps our predecessors were a little too kind to the Community in allowing that undesirable state to continue.  Since we took office&mdash;and it is not appropriate that just we should always say it&mdash; we have said the EEC must be consistent with their own stated aims. Some of those involve regional policy and some involve economic and monetary union&mdash;and we were not the first to say this&mdash;and some of them involve development of all the capacities existing within the European Communities.  It is happening slowly but it is happening, that the European Communities are at least committing themselves to guidelines.  We are not satisfied with what is happening or the pace at which it is happening.  We are now in a stronger position in relation to our own performance, our own growth, control of inflation and reduction of unemployment, although not as much as we would wish it to be.</P>
      <P>We can now say to the European Communities on the question of the application of social policy, the application of the social fund to unemployment that, while they stood back remote over the past number of years, they cannot do that now.  Are we allowed to say we played no small part in bringing this awareness about? We welcome particularly that the social fund is now being applied towards the chronic problem of unemployment, not only in Ireland but in the European Communities, in a way in which it was not previously applied.  That is what I mean by consistency. That is the first element in what I referred to on the last occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have an opportunity again to debate the 12th Report, I think, on progress in the European Economic Community.  Because of the time constraints on me at the moment, I trust <Col N="306" /> the Deputy opposite&mdash;and he is the only one to whom I can address my remarks at the moment&mdash;will agree that, unless I have time at the end I will leave over a detailed discussion on the EEC until we debate that Report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is quite acceptable to me and to my party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not know who is to speak for our absent friends but let us take them as agreeing by their silence.  I may make one or two points in passing in reply to matters raised by Deputies, but I do not suggest they will be a comprehensive statement on the EEC.  I think I have said enough to point out the relevance of our national policy in the context of our relationship with the EEC.</P>
      <P>I want to mention the relevance of my own Department in terms of our foreign relationships. In recent years, different types of democracies have been emerging in various parts of the world, not all of them, perhaps, fully in accord with our principles of democracy, with our developed sense of democracy. Many of them for one reason or another have got perceptions of democracy or otherwise which derive from their historical experience.  The newly emerging African States will obviously have a different perception of democracy which will derive from the historical tribal patterns of their own country.  Sometimes we are unreasonable in trying to impose standards we have inherited from our experience on people who inherited different standards from their experience. We must recognise these countries politically. We must give them that degree of respect and political status to which they are perfectly entitled.  We can then do business with them on a State to State and Government to Government level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That applies to the newly emerging countries and it also applies in a different sense&mdash;I am not now talking about democracy&mdash;to the State trading countries who do their business on a very planned if not to say rigid basis, and who do not allow access to their markets except by way of balance. Thirdly, it has been fairly evident in recent times that many people&mdash;I will <Col N="307" /> not say philanderers or merchant princes&mdash;since the energy crisis seem to have discovered new contacts, as they call them, in the Gulf States, in countries like Lybia, and so on.  A number of people are parading themselves, perhaps in our own country, as having all these contacts.  Perhaps some of them have.  If there are people in Ireland who have that level of contact with the Gulf States, and who can get into the harems almost, they represent a miniscule proportion of those in other countries in the western world, America, and elsewhere, who claim to have the inside track in these States.  I am quite sure the Arab States, the oil States, have been courted by all sorts of people over the past number of years.  I would say their experience has not always been that they can consistently trust the business people who presented themselves as emissaries from the western world.</P>
    <P>That said, it is obviously vitally important to us that we should support at official level in each of these three areas the newly emerging democracies&mdash; the State trading countries (I picked these as an example; there are others as well) and what we might call the newly-rich oil States, the Arab States. The role and function of my Department in our relations with these countries, and in our further developing relations with them as we develop further new relations with other countries with whom we have not got relations at present, is to create that political introduction without which none of these three elements is really interested in having an association with us in any positive sense.  It is the role and function of my Department to give that political recognition to the countries with whom we do business and, having created the political bridgehead, which is of great importance, to allow our semi-State sector and our private sector to come in and exploit in a positive sense the opportunities available to them under the appropriate terms of reference.  I recognise that the terms of reference would be very different in Africa from what they would be in the State trading countries or in the Gulf States.</P>
    <P>I have seen it as a priority obligation <Col N="308" /> as Minister to report to my colleagues in the Cabinet on this.  I have given them formally a memorandum to let them know our priorities of which it is important that my Government colleagues should be fully cognisant.  I also wanted to give them an outline of what our direction will be in our new associations so that they and this House, at the appropriate time, will be able to see clearly a consistent pattern in what we are doing.  I will not announce now where our next moves will be.  I hope from what I have said already that the pattern will be clearly indentified and people can say: &ldquo;He did not disclose in advance where exactly he was going, but it is fairly clear now he knows why he is going there and what the role and function of the Department of Foreign Affairs should be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Could I say briefly in relation to my own comings and goings and the visits I have undertaken that they do not happen accidentally?  They are not simply spontaneous reactions to positions which present themselves.  They are very deliberat decisions on my part as Minister for Foreign Affairs pursuing, I hope, a deliberate and consistent pattern.  I do not want to say I am setting myself up as the judge of whether a particular invitation is appropriate to me.  I do not want to create the impression that I would be the only one to decide whether I should or should not respond to a generous invitation from another country.  That would be totally and utterly inappropriate.  In the nature of things most of these visits are the consequence of bilateral contacts over a period.</P>
    <P>It is not evident so far, but it will be after a reasonable period, that there is a consistency in what I have being doing in this direction.  I have undertaken two official visits so far. One was an obligation that I was very glad to inherit from my predecessor, namely, the official visit to Greece. The decision there was taken for me and I merely followed it up, but it was an opportunity to see the conditions of a country which was proposing to join the EEC.  The other opportunity was one presented to me as a consequence of the visit of the President of Yugoslavia to this <Col N="309" /> country, short though the visit was, and I accepted that because the possibility of that visit had been under discussion for some time.  I have not time to go into the details of why we went to which country and what we discussed, but I want to make it clear to people from the press and otherwise who genuinely and honestly have said, &ldquo;Why here and not there?&rdquo;  that they had better wait and see where I will be going.  When they do see they will begin to recognise that there is a pattern in these visits which are part and parcel of an overall Government programme to establish better understanding of countries and to fulfil my responsibility as one agent in the overall Government policy.  It will not be too long before this pattern will emerge and will indicate further the consistency in this direction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that Deputy Ryan accepts that I need not go into details on the EEC and the question of regional policy and matters of that sort, which I can leave over until we have a debate on the EEC.  One of the achievements&mdash;it might not have been noticed very much&mdash;of my Department or myself, or the Government or whoever organises the business of this House is that we now are up to date, first of all, in the publication of the reports of the EEC; secondly, we are up to date in the debates on these reports &mdash;and that was a very regrettable omission during the period of my <Col N="310" /> predecessor.  There was a period of two-and-a-half years during which we had no debate here on progress within the EEC.  When I first came into office I had to lump six reports together in one debate.  That is not good enough, because the purpose of the European legislation was that there would be a twice-yearly report to this House.  A twice-yearly report to this House makes no sense unless there is going to be to the maximum extent possible a twice-yearly debate in this House.  That did not happen during the last number of years and it is a matter that passed without any great degree of criticism.</P>

      <P>: The Opposition made a criticism but not one that was picked up in public.  However that is past and we are now dealing with the present and the future.  I want to give a commitment that what we have managed to do so far we will continue to do and this House will have an opportunity not only of debating those reports but of debating them reasonably soon after their publication. In passing, I hope that my response to the activities of the Secondary Legislation Committee has made their work all the more relevant as a Committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and will bring into this Chamber, in the course of the debates I hope we will have on their reports, an awareness of the significance of the work they are doing.  That is another practical step that has been taken which I hope will be effective over the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to relations with other Departments and State agencies, I was gratified at the annual general meeting of DEVCO that they again acknowledged the great assistance they had from my Department and from the officers of the Government generally in the support and promotion of their activities in the various countries in which they operate.  This for us is a new area for a lot of reasons.  Leaving aside our bilateral aid programme, our semi-State bodies operate in a variety of countries, many <Col N="311" /> of which are classed as developing countries but are as different from one another in many ways as developing countries are from developed countries.  We recognise the role which these semi-State bodies have played in our own development. I am gratified and encouraged that our partners in development policy&mdash; because that it what they are; they are not merely beneficiaries of our munificence&mdash;also recognise the role of our semi-State bodies in this operation. They have readily and willingly called upon our semi-State bodies to apply their experience and resources to help them to develop their economy to the point that they are entitled to have it developed and to make their relations with countries such as ours and the developed world generally all the more positive.  To many of the developed agencies, such as DEVCO, ABSO or CONGOOD&mdash; I am not naming these just for the sake of doing so and it is convenient not to have to explain what each of them do&mdash;the level of our personal commitment is a major matter and a major element in our foreign policy, particularly in our development policy.  The activities of our semi-State bodies are also major elements and agents of our development policy.  Obviously, because this is a relatively new experience for us, there are matters to be clarified, and I will be the first to acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>I see Deputy Quinn here, and I welcome him back.  My strictures on the Labour Party would be all the more severe were it not for Deputy Quinn who is not, after all, the spokesman of the Labour Party on Foreign Affairs.  But it is nice to have somebody from the Labour Party and I do not want to blame the man who has come for the absence or lack of interest of all his colleagues in this debate.</P>

      <P>: If two of the Deputy's party were to be in the European Parliament, Heaven knows we <Col N="312" /> would see nobody here at all.  In any event we could send them the record of what we said.</P>
      <P>The Development Advisory Council, which I have discussed very recently with the CONGOOD, the umbrella organisation for all the voluntary organisations, will be established very soon.  Others may say that they have heard that kind of thing before, but it will be recognised that before such an advisory council can be established we will have to consult with all the Departments of State to ensure that when it is established its terms of reference and its activities will be fully understood and supported by all at official level, which in the first instance means the Departments of State.  Also those who would seem to be affected&mdash;one might say in the negative sense&mdash;by some of the recommendations which this advisory council might make should also be made aware at least of the direction, so that rather than having them reacting on the outside and creating reactions where there was no need for them, they would be taken into one's confidence and be assured that there would be no conflict between their activities and what the development council would be doing.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Woods suggested, the activities of the semi-State organisations may be motivated by profit in many cases.  That is fine.  No one could blame them for that.  But we must be clear that where they are engaged in activity in pursuance of what would be co-operation policy, the fundamental and primary purpose must be the benefit to our development partners in the course of these projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods raised some interesting questions.  This was true also of other Deputies, but Deputy Woods asked for a working party to consider a number of elements in order to ensure that the development contribution would not be swamped by commercial objectives.  I would expect simply that the advisory council when they get under way&mdash;and they will be representative of the semi-State and the other sectors&mdash;will focus on this area.  It is a relatively new area and it <Col N="313" /> would be less than honest of me to suggest that I have all the answers immediately.  At the same time I am satisfied about the role the private sector, the semi-State sector and the voluntary sector can play in our developing development policy.  I am satisfied, too, that the scope is great for this policy, which is only developing, and that our Community partners recognise this and are aware of the opportunities we have in this regard. Also, I am satisfied that the Commission are particularly conscious of our scope in this area.</P>
    <P>It is good that we would be critical and apply strict criteria regarding the operation so far in this field of the semi-State bodies.  Our experience so far has been that those countries in which our semi-State bodies have been active are not only aware of their success but are very appreciative of the approach of our semi-State sector in helping these countries to help themselves. Perhaps that is understandable because our economic experience has been a relatively recent phenomenon, going back for not longer than about 20 years.  Obviously, then, we have a keener awareness of the problems of these countries and our semi-State sector will have an even keener awareness of how to overcome such problems. From further developments in our development policy it will be evident that I have given special recognition this year to the semi-State sector and the voluntary sector, by increasing the grant by a considerable amount as well as concentrating on the whole question of development education which for the first time has been included in our whole programme, and that this will be the basis for our policy in future years.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to dwell on that subject any more except to make one point in relation to our bilateral aid programme, which is directly within the ambit of my Department and which is managed generally in close consultation with the voluntary organisations.  The one awareness I have had is that while we have targeted our aid to the countries of greatest and acute hardship&mdash;the smaller countries where we can make <Col N="314" /> a meaningful contribution such as Lesotho, Swaziland, Tanzania and Zambia where the problems are not so acute&mdash;we suffer from the disadvantage of not having diplomatic representation in these countries.  Consequently, we are not in a position generally to supervise the operations of our aid programmes and our development-aid policies or to see how effective they are.  This situation stymies co-operation with those at whom the aid is directed.  However, I intend very soon to correct that position and I can tell the House now that within the very near future we will have a development officer operating in Lesotho which is a priority target area.  This person will be on the spot and will be able to evaluate the impact of what is being done and to report back to us on the problems that might arise.  This will enable us more effectively to pursue in that country and in other countries from the experience gained in this way our bi-lateral aid programme.  The person who will be charged with this task will not be a diplomatic officer but he will enjoy many of the immunities of a diplomatic officer.  In addition it will be a priority for me in the development of further diplomatic relations along the east coast of Africa to ensure that it will be tailored to our development policy and also to our co-operation policies with the countries concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy will appreciate that when it is intended to have diplomatic relations with a country and when agreement is entered into on that basis, it would be a very severe rebuff to make the argument that the decision had been taken by a Minister in a previous Government and that it would be left at that.  There are regional problems in Africa.  But, while they flare up with a degree of intensity, they do not last for as long perhaps as some of the problems that exist in other parts of the world.  One can only hope that the relationship between the states concerned&mdash;and in this context Deputy Quinn's point was well made&mdash;will not prevent us from extending our accreditions to other countries.</P>
      <P>I trust that the House will be gratified to know that we intend to supervise by an identifiable personal presence our aid programmes to the maximum extent possible and also that we will regard this as being a very essential element in the extension of our diplomatic relations.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: We suffer from the historical disadvantage of not having diplomatic relations with many of these countries.  Obviously some of our partners in the Community who were former colonial powers have such relations with them.  In many cases this gives them a certain advantage through the operation of the Lomé Convention and through the consultancy contracts which Deputy Quinn referred to because the countries in respect of which these contracts are being developed <Col N="316" /> tend very often to think in terms of former colonial overlords, while those who have not had diplomatic relations with them are left at a disadvantage. I trust that we will be able to corrct that situation soon.</P>
      <P>In the few minutes remaining to me I shall have to concentrate on the questions to which most attention was given by the Deputies and I wish to talk in particular about the CSCE and the Belgrade Conference.  This brings us to another aspect of international relations.  First, I must point out that the Leader of Fine Gael said in this House recently that he hoped I would endeavour to ensure that the outcome from Madrid would be more satisfactory than the outcome from Belgrade.  If it were in my power to ensure what the outcome of the resumed conference in Madrid would be, I can assure the Deputy that I would do so. As a former Foreign Minister he must know that it is impossible to do this when the 35 countries who signed the Helsinki Final Act differ so considerably in their social and political systems.  I have acknowledged that the weak document which emerged as a conclusion to the Belgrade session of the Helsinki Conference was totally unsatisfactory from our point of view. I also said that the process still continues. We go to Madrid in the knowledge that there is already a verbal commitment, and hopefully it will be matched by a real commitment, to the whole purpose of that conference&mdash;to detente, human rights and dignity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into great detail here but we regarded our approach to that conference at all times as covering a consistent range of relations between states&mdash;security, economic co-operation and human rights, all part and parcel of a consistent package which is to emerge.  We regard ourselves and each State which signed that document as being bound by international commitment to convention to implement it.  We were dissatisfied that states were not in a position to register conclusions at Belgrade which would enable us effectively to ensure the protections of these aims.  We have referred to the Orlov trial in the Soviet Union where steps were taken which <Col N="317" /> were clearly against the spirit and the letter of the Helsinki Conference and we regret it.</P>
    <P>Let us recognise that we are talking about states of different social and political order and their fundamental obligation must be to ensure that those rights in every sense will be protected. We should try, slowly but positively, to bring about that period of detente which is indivisible and does not apply only to certain regions but to all the activities of the various governments who signed that document.</P>
    <P>In discussions with the Nine and Yugoslavia we made it very clear that the detente to which we all give our support will not be just a matter of public statement and solemn declaration but it will be the real thing.  I hope and expect that the preparations for Madrid which are going on in preparatory committees will ensure that the consequence will be more satisfactory than the outcome of the Belgrade Conference.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up a point raised by Deputy Deasy.  In relation to the critical problem in the Middle East he thought we should be more forthcoming in our criticism, that we should be clear in our opinions and be seen to express these opinions more consistently.  I hope it will be understood from what I have said that we must have a position and use our influence to arrive at a solution.  In this way our development policy, the Lomé Convention and the role played by the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, can be justified as having a persuasive influence on those who are belligerent with each other.  If Deputy Deasy looks at it from that point of view he will see that for me as Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a statement here or elsewhere criticising one of the parties about what has been a very serious and lasting problem in the Middle East would not necessarily be helpful; it might have the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Deputy that as a member of the European Community, and particularly as part of the process through which we consult with our Community partners in the Nine, our views have been made <Col N="318" /> known and the guidelines in relation to the appropriate solution of these problems have been clearly stated.  I have had the opportunity of conveying my views and those of the Irish people to a senior member of the Israeli Government who visited us.  I also made comments on the Sadat-Begin talks.  The Deputy would be advising me wrongly if he told me to publicly set myself up as a judge on the rights or wrongs of the situation. Every nation has views on the Middle East situation.  The one thing we should not do is attribute blame to one party or the other.  Rather we should encourage them, which I have done in contact with parties more directly concerned, such as the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Cyrus Vance.  President Tito and the President of Romania.</P>

The Deputy raised some interesting points about the United Nations. Ideally I would like to see a UN presence where conflicts arise in Africa. I would also like to see these conflicts settled without intervention by other powers.  It must be recognised that the UN reflect the attitudes of the member states and the Security Council can be very effectively blocked by a veto by any of the permanent representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: This motion must be looked at in the broader context of our desire to see basic human rights respected throughout the world.  In virtually every democratic nation basic human rights are constitutionally guaranteed.  In our Constitution fundamental personal rights are guaranteed under Article 40.  The Constitution guarantees that all citizens shall as human beings be held equal before the law, that no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with the law, that the dwelling of every citizen is inviolable, and that dwellings shall not be forcibly entered except in accordance with the law and there are additional guarantees in regard to the right to express freely convictions and opinions, in regard to the right to assemble peaceably and without arms, and in regard to the right to form associations, unions and so on.  Similar guarantees can be found in the constitutions of virtually every democratic country.  Article 1 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany provides that</P>
      <P>1.  The dignity of man shall be inviolable.  To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all State authority.</P>
      <P>2.  The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our condemnation must be for the <Col N="323" /> denial of human rights no matter what the political view or ideological outlook of the regime involved.  On that basis I condemn the denial of such rights in leftist regimes such as the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc.  I similarly condemn the denial of human rights in rightist regimes such as Chile, the Argentine or the Philippines, and plainly despotic regimes such as that of Amin in Uganda. Within that context, with special condemnation I turn to the abominable system known as apartheid in South Africa.  This is a system of institutionalised racism which permits the minority of approximately 5 million people to deprive the majority of 20 million of all basic human rights and forces them to live in poverty merely for the benefit of their white masters. This is a system akin to mass slavery. Slavery was abolished in the last century but apartheid continues.  Condemnation of this abomination must continue until it is totally dismantled.</P>
    <P>The utter poverty in which the black majority have to live and the denial of human rights is not based on the fact that the country is poor because South Africa could be classified as a wealthy country.  The problems arise because the wealth is based on the exploitation of man by his fellow man.  The ruling white regime treats the black worker as labour to be allowed in the white areas, which cover 87 per cent of the country, on sufferance and only for as long as they can be economically useful. They have no say in the running of their lives.  They are in the position of a colonised people tyrannised over by masters who because they live in the same country can develop a sophisticated and far-reaching system of domination.  In many ways the system there recalls the penal laws that existed here at one time, which deprived Irish people of property, education, franchise and control of land.  These penal laws were described by Edmund Burke as:</P>
    <P>a machine of wise and elaborate contrivance and as well fitted for the oppression, impoverishment and degradation of a people, and the debasement in them of human nature itself, as ever proceeded from the perverted ingenuity of man.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> Under apartheid the ingenuity has stretched itself even further and the system encompasses every aspect of life. It can be said that apartheid is unique. No other system totally deprives a people of every right and keeps them in poverty and deprivation because of the colour of their skin.  In that context it can be said that the oppression and massacres in South Africa are not merely manifestations of a despotic regime, but that they echo the inbuilt philosophy of a system which rejects on grounds of colour the black population of the country.</P>
    <P>In discussing this motion last night examples of the extent of the denial of human rights under this system were given.  In a country which has a population of under 5 million white people and 20 million Africans, 87 per cent of the land is reserved for the whites and 13 per cent for the Africans.  A 75 per cent share in the national income is reserved for the five million white people.  There is a ratio of average earnings of 14 to 1.  In that population there is one doctor for every 400 white people and one for each 44,000 of the native Africans.  There is an infant mortality rate of 27 per thousand amongst the whites compared with a mortality rate of 200 per thousand for the Africans in the urban areas and 400 per thousand in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>In every aspect of life in that country there is discrimination.  There are examples of legal discrimination in relation to the home, the family and residence.  An African born in a town who has lived there continuously for 40 years and has left to reside elsewhere for any period, even a couple of weeks, is not entitled to return to the town and to remain there for more than 72 hours unless he obtains a permit.  No African, even if he has been lawfully residing in a town by virtue of a permit issued to him, is entitled to have his wife and children reside with him.  An African may not leave South Africa to take up a scholarship at a university abroad unless he is in possession of a passport or a permit required by law.  With regard to work, a labour officer at any time may cancel the employment of an African who works in a town no matter how long he has been employed <Col N="325" /> and even though his employer opposes the cancellation.</P>
    <P>The situation is carried through into the area of education in that no school for African children may be conducted anywhere in South Africa unless it is registered with the Government, who have an unfettered discretion to refuse to register it.  An African living in a town who conducts a class in reading and writing without remuneration in his own home for a few of his African friends is guilty of a criminal offence.  Even a white man may not spend a few hours each week in his own home voluntarily teaching his African servants to read. If he does so he is guilty of a criminal offence.  With regard to religion, an African religious minister who conducts regular classes for his congregation in which he teaches them to read the Bible is guilty of a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>With regard to assembly and association, an African who has lived continuously for 50 years in the town in which he was born is not entitled as of right to have an African friend visit and remain with him for more than 72 hours.  It is unlawful for a white person and a black person to drink a cup of tea together in a cafe anywhere in South Africa unless they have obtained a special permit to do so.  Without a special permit an African professor may not deliver a lecture at a white persons' club even though he may have received an invitation to do so.  Marriages between whites and coloured persons, Asians or Africans, are prohibited.</P>
    <P>The list is endless and it affects all aspects of life, taxation, religion and the expression of opinion.  If a white man tells a group of Africans that the apartheid laws are unjust and should be destroyed he is guilty of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment. If the position were not so devastatingly serious and unjust, the definitions with regard to who is white, black or coloured could be considered amusing. The attempts to classify and to segregate the population and the definitions as to who obviously is white and who has the appearance of white characteristics lead one to believe that the <Col N="326" /> whole business is totally unrealistic and unrelated to the world of today.  For instance, the white group includes &ldquo;any person who in appearance obviously is, or who is generally accepted as a white person as long as neither of his natural parents has been classified as a coloured person or an African.  If the person's natural father was classified as a member of another ethnic group of so-called coloured persons, that person acquires the racial classification of his father.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is just a short outline of the situation in South Africa today.  Because of the propaganda issued by South Africa House and by other organs of the South African Government the people of the world may not be fully aware of the abominable aspects of the apartheid system.  It cries out to God; it flies in the face of all known standards of humanity.</P>
    <P>The motion has been accepted by the Government and it is fully supported by them.  It asks the House to express its condemnation of apartheid and its solidarity with all those engaged in promoting International Anti-Apartheid Year, 1978.  The question arises, how far can we go in our condemnation? What can we do to add strength and conviction to our voice?  I have no illusions about the strength and authority of the Irish voice abroad.  We are a very small nation, but despite that, or possibly because of it, we have a certain moral authority in the world and our voice is not lost in the wilderness when we raise it in righteous indignation on such a subject as this.</P>
    <P>In order to lend strength and conviction to our voice we must ensure that in all aspects of life there is complete respect for human rights in our own country.  There is the old saying that people in glasshouses should not throw stones.  It is important that in our dealings with our own people or in our dealings with non-nationals we ensure that there is no discrimination and that human rights at all levels are respected.  Having done that, we should raise the consciousness of the people of this country to the utter injustice of the system in South Africa.  We must lend more than lip-service to the United Nations resolutions to which we have <Col N="327" /> subscribed.  Having spoken strongly in support of those resolutions, there is a duty on us to ensure that there is total support for them among our people and that there is total conviction on the part of the Government and those involved in politics to ensure that the resolutions are respected.</P>
    <P>The United Nations have declared the year from 21 March 1978 as International Anti-Apartheid Year. This was done because that organisation recognised the need to step up the international campaign against apartheid under the auspices of the United Nations.  Its purpose was to make world opinion fully aware of the inhumanity of apartheid and its wider dangers to international peace. Certain programmes were laid down by the General Assembly and certain actions were to be taken by the Secretary General of the United Nations.  Suggestions were made as to what action could be taken by governments. They were requested to proclaim the International Anti-Apartheid Year and to encourage cities and non-governmental organisations to proclaim the year.  I understand this has been done by the EEC on a general basis.  We should look into our hearts to see if we have put sufficient emphasis on it in this country.  There was a suggestion that parliaments might be encouraged to hold special sessions devoted to the International Anti-Apartheid Year.</P>
    <P>We are discussing this issue tonight in a spirit of unanimity.  There was a suggestion to establish national committees for the national anti-apartheid year, to ensure maximum publicity for its objectives or, alternatively, to designate the anti-apartheid movement or similar organisations, where they exist, as the national committees for the year.  I am not sure what has been done in this regard.  I understand that there is an anti-apartheid committee here but I do not know if they have been designated by the Government in accordance with the UN recommendation. If not, I suggest that the Government should give serious consideration to that particular suggestion.</P>
    <P>There are various other suggestions <Col N="328" /> in the line of publicity to be given through the media and in connection with the widest dissemination of information in educational institutions. I believe this is something which needs to be concentrated on.  I recall at quite a young age seeing literature and propaganda being disseminated by South Africa House, which, as far as I recollect, was based in London, solely for the purpose of proving to the world the justice of the system and the excellent work that was being done on behalf of the Africans in Africa. In such propaganda there was no reference whatever to the total denial of basic human rights to such Africans.</P>
    <P>There were other suggestions in the UN declaration involving the increase of moral, material and political assistance to the people there.  This involves us making financial sacrifices, providing funds at governmental level to the UN and other institutions, to help those people who are the victims of this particular system.  There are many other suggestions contained in the UN declaration to which we have fully subscribed.  I do not point the finger particularly at the Government although I hope they will give a strong lead in this matter.  I believe it is the duty of all political parties, trade unions and all organisations in the country who have any interest in human rights to make sure that the full injustice of this system is known and understood and to render whatever support is possible to the people oppressed by this system.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to which the Minister might give some further thought.  I understand that there was a UN convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination. Consideration must be given to the ratification of this convention.  I believe that the convention in question was signed in 1973 and that it awaits formal ratification.  There may be some problems in this regard involving legislative changes to ensure that all forms of discrimination are removed here.  If so, we should face those problems and ensure that we are not merely paying lip service to those ideals but that we sincerely believe in <Col N="329" /> them and that we are taking steps to ensure that they are put into effect, that we are showing by our example that when we speak on apartheid we can speak with the moral authority of a country which has done its very best not alone in relation to human rights in its own country but in fully implementing the UN declarations to which we have subscribed.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that we are pushing an open door so far as the Government are concerned in this matter.  We are seeking in this motion an expression from the Dáil of its condemnation of this system and also the solidarity of the Dáil and our people with all those engaged in promoting International Anti-apartheid Year 1978.  I believe it is very necessary that there should be a further major effort to ensure that our people know fully what is involved in the system of apartheid.  It is perhaps natural for them to react by saying that this is a country thousands of miles away from us and what really has it got to do with us.  I believe, even if this reaction is a natural one, that it is the duty of those people who believe in human rights for all, rights which transcend all natural boundaries and extend to the farthest corners of the world, affecting every individual in it, to ensure that this message is clearly understood and where such denials take place that our people are aware of it and are prepared to join in the condemnation of it.</P>
    <P>I believe it is accepted by everybody that there are basic and fundamental human rights which are based on the natural law antecedent to all positive law, and that those human rights are not just a matter of concern for observance in our country alone.  We see, looking at any part of the world, denial of those rights and we condemn them. We are talking particularly tonight of South Africa, but we see a system which goes beyond the ordinary denial of human rights, a system of total and institutionalised racism, which denies every basic human right to the 20 million Africans in that country.  There is all the more reason for us totally to condemn the system of apartheid which permits this and for us to join in solidarity with all those engaged in <Col N="330" /> promoting International Anti-apartheid Year 1978.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is my pleasure to speak in support of this motion which states:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann expresses its condemnation of apartheid and its solidarity with all engaged in promoting International Anti-Apartheid Year 1978.</P>
      <P>I am sure this was a very easy motion to put down.  It is very easy to support it and I have no doubt it will be supported by all sections of the House. Fine Gael are to be congratulated on promoting such a motion.  It must be heartening to the supporters of that important party and, indeed, it must be heartening to this little country to find such a party moving away at last from its own history of racialism and narrow-minded nationalism.</P>
      <P>This motion is unusual from yet another point of view.  It is seldom that this type of motion is debated and this attitude supported within a Parliament, a motion which condemns and exhorts another country to alter its abhorrent internal policy in regard to its citizens and in regard to other people who go and work in that country.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;apartheid&rdquo; is peculiarly South African.  It derives from Afrikaans, a language which evolved within the Cape Province of the continent of South Africa.  The Afrikaans language, like many of the institutions of the Cape colonists, is peculiar to South Africa.  It means &ldquo;separateness&rdquo;.  It is an emotive word which has, in many parts of the world, come to be associated with much more than just separateness. It is a word which, because of its application and derivation, has come to mean repression and torture and, as has been said, the denial of human rights, and not alone in South Africa.  It has become internationally accepted in many different countries to mean just that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apartheid is an evocative word in that it reflects the thinking of the people who created the state of South Africa and brought that state to its present position of power.  However, certain relevant facts should be recognised and put into context when supporting this motion.  White men were, <Col N="331" /> in fact, the first humans in any numbers to populate the Cape Province. The Cape Province came into existence initially as a relatively unimportant trading post and port of call on the way to the Far East by European traders.  It evolved and expanded from a small trading post when white men started pushing northwards.  They did not meet any black men for almost 1,000 miles of that vast, empty territory. The lands were obviously ripe for colonisation and utilisation.  The black men initially did not inhabit the area and therefore did not make use of the resources of the land we now call South Africa.</P>
    <P>North of the line of penetration by the white men the blacks were moving southwards.  They gave the world names that still live&mdash;Bulawaya and Matabele&mdash;and leaders like Chaka and Dingiswayo, two men that many Europeans possibly never heard of.  The evolution was different and the word &ldquo;apartheid&rdquo; has a long factual history in South Africa.</P>
    <P>Chaka and Dingiswayo created two black nations&mdash;the Matabele and the Zulu nations.  They created them out of distinct tribes with their own type of culture.  Unfortunately this culture could not be recorded because the black man did not evolve a written history.  More unfortunately still, he has not yet within his own context or his own ethnic evolution been able to create a written language.  This is in sad contrast to the evolution of civilisations in many other parts of the world.  But black men did evolve a society which was relatively orderly. Order was kept and control exercised by, to us, barbaric methods.  The means by which the status of the black men was created were also barbaric. Up to very recently, and in some parts of black Africa even today, it was quite common to have an executioner or a whole body of executioners acting on the whim of the ruling party or personage.  That was as true of Matabeleland and Zululand as it is of Amin's Uganda.  They indulged in what I euphemistically call &ldquo;very nice practices&rdquo; in regard to those of whom they were not fond.  Even thinking about them turns one's stomach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> But the fact remains they had an ordered society which enabled vast numbers of them to live with their tribal gods and tribal systems.  They produced&mdash;this is very true in the case of Chaka particularly&mdash;a nation of warriors in Matabele, warriors whom very few countries could equal.  In one case they defeated with spear and assegai the combined forces of rifle and field gun in the battle of Isandhlwana.  It is from instances like these that one becomes conscious of the ability of the black man.  He was not literate but he had the ability to fight and the ability to run a savage society.  There is no doubt but that the black man as a fighting animal was superior in courage and generalship to many of the invaders from industrialised Europe with their superior back-up who did not always win the day.  But it can truthfully be said that the rifle and the field gun won South Africa for the white man as the steam engine won the industrial revolution for the élite of England.  Unfortunately these savage societies did not evolve in a way that commended itself.</P>
    <P>The white man pushing northwards from the Cape was in the position that he had no laws and no government. He went through many transitional periods under rule from different sources and sometimes from no source at all.  The Wild West of North America was a kindergarten compared with some of the activities of the wilder white elements in this evolving society in South Africa.  But a society did evolve with a government and that was the evolution that has created the society now known as South Africa.  It had the dubious distinction of creating the first concentration camp complex.  It also had the distinction of providing a totally new type of government in a new country. If one looks at these two facts objectively one can see that apartheid has existed in South Africa since the advent of the white man there.</P>
    <P>Now the evolving of this small trading post in the Cape produced farms of a size we find it difficult to comprehend.  It was usual for the Dutch Africans&mdash;and initially it was the Dutch who were instrumental in <Col N="333" /> creating the vast farms in that country&mdash;to feel overcrowded if their nearest neighbour was 50 miles away. This created a very independent type of man who considered himself, and still considers himself, to be the creator of that country.</P>
    <P>The next step was the discovery of fantastic riches in the form of gold, diamonds and coal.  The objective fact is that those riches exist naturally over a large part of the Continent of Africa, but their first discovery and utilisation always seemed to take place in areas controlled or exploited, if you like, by white men.  Unfortunately it has not been the case that black Africa has had the ability to either discover or utilise riches which were not immediately obvious.  It is objectively true that very many of the slaves who came out of that Continent were initially captured and sold by black men.</P>
    <P>I agree the white gold of Africa was the other big money spinner.  That also was exploited ruthlessly by the black man and unfortunately still is today.  The white population, with their training and their longer history of industrial technology, had the ability to see the opportunities there in the form of the various raw materials and to use them.  Unfortunately, this necessitated the use of unskilled labour on a vast scale as the cheapest method by which these natural resources could be exploited. This meant this evolving state had no option but to bring in from neighbouring countries vast numbers of unskilled, illiterate and cheap labour.  Such today is still the case. A very significant proportion of 20,000,000 people referred to as being native born South Africans are not South African born at all.  After their contract period expires a very significant proportion of them go back to other countries.</P>
    <P>It is very easy from our point of view to condemn the conditions in which these unfortunates are living, but the objective fact is that very often they are considerably better off than they would be in their own tribal lands, or in their own country.  This is a tragedy.  There is no doubt that they <Col N="334" /> are exploited.  There is no doubt it is wrong that they should be exploited in this way.  There is no doubt that apartheid is totally and utterly wrong because of what these unfortunates are subjected to.  It is also true they are being paid and are earning more than some of the black states are capable of paying their own citizens.  That should be recognised also.</P>
    <P>The modern South African State, with all its social problems and depending as it does to a very large extent on a black population four or five times the number of whites resident there, is still a stable country.  Whether we like it or not, it is still a bastion in that corner of the globe against the ruthless exploitation of imperial Russia.  Communist Russia is not by any means a stranger to apartheid.  As I said, the word has connotations far outside the shores of South Africa.  It can very properly be used in relation to the Communist Party within Russia.</P>
    <P>It is true that less than 10 per cent of the population of Russia are members of the Communist Party.  Is not this a form of apartheid on a horrible scale being perpetrated on its own people by a country which purports to be the friend of the downtrodden?  One of the greatest nations in the world today is ruthlessly and cynically using the very methods it condemns elsewhere to suppress its own minorities. In the context of this motion the word &ldquo;apartheid&rdquo; is not confined to South Africa.  Therefore, apartheid should be looked at not only in relation to South Africa but in many other contexts in which that word is accepted to mean not only separateness but repression and the infliction of indignity by a government on people within their borders.</P>
    <P>This is happening not only in Russia but tragically throughout black Africa as well.  In many areas in black Africa, the tribal system has not been able to expand to include and give expression to tribes who may not be members of ruling party tribes.  In many cases very small minorities are controlling vast wealth and denying objective human rights to many of their citizens.  White minorities are in very serious trouble <Col N="335" /> in some of the small black African countries.</P>
    <P>Apartheid is not just the prerogative of South Africa.  It is used as a weapon in many other countries.  World communism, exploited at home ruthlessly, and exported for the profit of the small ruling clique in Russia, is a typical example.  Very often the citizens of countries who condemn apartheid in South Africa have less freedom and even less material possessions than some of the black people they purport to support.  In this context, I would suggest the black African is fortunate, indeed, that he has such a firm body of world opinion mobilised in his support. It is quite right that this should be so.  It is quite right that world opinion should endeavour in every way possible to ensure that the black African does indeed come out from under the shadow of apartheid.</P>
    <P>The side effect of apartheid in South Africa which probably has not been recognised, and probably is not recognised within South Africa itself, is that, apart from denying the black African his place in the sun, it also denies to that country the talents of very many talented people.  As a still evolving and expanding country that must mean that not alone the wealth within its borders but the ability of all its citizens are not developed for the good of all its citizens.</P>
    <P>The denial of educational facilities, the denial of residential facilities, and the denial of freedom of movement to the black African either within his native State, or his adopted State, or his would-be adopted State, prevent him from contributing to the development of that country and would seem to me in certain cases to defeat their objectives.  If these people are denied educational facilities and the right to work, this makes their country a poorer country.</P>
    <P>Some progress has been made in that some of these people have been able to get out of South Africa and receive education abroad.  It might be more helpful if we could do something on an international scale which would give educational facilities to these unfortunate people.  We are a small country but over many years the Irish colleges <Col N="336" /> abroad catered for the demands and needs that were long available here. We had great advantages in a written language, a written history and a culture that was accepted and of an international standard.  The unfortunate black African has not had the advantage of any of these things, and some of the educational ideas that we might have in Europe might be at total variance with the cultural history, such as it is, of many of the evolving tribes and peoples in black South Africa. Nevertheless, even though that might not be quite what he wants, a function of the Governments supporting this motion could be to ensure that such educational facilities are made available to the black South Africans. Social justice is totally and utterly denied to huge numbers of working black Africans in South Africa.  Even though they may be fairly well situated in the townships with their tin roofs and communal toilet facilities, the people there are still entitled to elevate themselves from that position, but tragically these laws effectively debar them from ever doing this.  Hand in hand with helping these people to improve themselves within their borders, if we can do something from outside to help them this motion will be effective.</P>
    <P>I question one word in this motion, the word &ldquo;all&rdquo;.  The motion reads:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann expresses its condemnation of apartheid and its solidarity with all engaged in promoting International Anti-Apartheid Year 1978.</P>
    <P>Many people and many governments are just as guilty as the South African government of denying opportunities for improvement to sections of their own citizens.  To ally ourselves with such governments in condemning a government who are obviously doing wrong is allying ourselves with the pot calling the kettle black.  In condemnation of apartheid we must make sure to condemn it in all its forms wherever it exists.  To say that we ally ourselves in blanket fashion with all governments who are so engaged is questionable.</P>
    <P>When we consider the various peoples who promote International Anti-Apartheid Year 1978 we can say <Col N="337" /> in certain cases, &ldquo;Look here, it is all very fine you supporting International Anti-Apartheid Year 1978, but what is happening in South Africa is also happening in your country&rdquo;.  Human rights is not the prerogative of merely the black South African; it is the prerogative of every human being on this planet.  There are people in many situations who cannot have any communications with the outside world and are condemned to even worse apartheid than those who have to live in separate townships, to do certain jobs and kow-tow to a government they do not subscribe to.  There are many areas in this world where unfortunate stateless citizens have no government of any description either to condemn or to depend on.  There are areas in the world where people have to move across borders from one area to another and apartheid of a greater horror than that which exists in South Africa is being inflicted on them.  These things should be borne in mind when we are condemning apartheid.</P>
    <P>The tendency of human beings to be lazy unless something is brought to their attention on the one hand, or to be utterly careless on the other, must be controlled.  The situation where people are deprived of food through drought and an uncaring government practicing a type of apartheid which says &ldquo;we will get some other country to come in and support you&rdquo; underlines the fact that all must be engaged in the promotion of international anti-apartheid.  Universality in condemning one country is totally wrong when there is so much suffering and misery in other places in the name of good government.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, with the reservations I have made and with the observations that I think legitimate on the evolvement of the Union of South Africa, it gives me pleasure to support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is rare that a motion comes before this House which unites all sides and all Deputies.  I am glad that this motion does&mdash;or did <Col N="338" /> until Deputy Fox spoke.  It is not that his speech was not very well prepared. He obviously put a lot of thought into it, but I would have thought that no Member of this House would enter any reservations into condemnation of apartheid.  Certainly there are deprivations of human rights in many countries of the world, but I do not think that there is any parallel to the absolute and total evil that is apartheid.  It is not fair in the cause of the abolition of apartheid to drag in the problems of the rest of the world.  No other country in the world subjects part of its people to the deprivation and inhumanity that the black majority in South Africa are subjected to.  I was disappointed to hear Deputy Fox making points to the effect that coloured people in South Africa are paid more than in other black countries.  There are historical explanations for that and it is irrelevant to the question of apartheid.  It is this type of reservation which is killing the world movement against apartheid. I was very disappointed to hear the Deputy describe South Africa as a bastion in that part of the world in the defence against Imperialist Russia.</P>
      <P>That is irrelevant to the question of apartheid.  That is the sort of contribution that the apartheid cause could well do without.  This House and also the parliaments of all the other democratic countries should not only condemn without reservation the evil of apartheid but should act to have removed this horrible scar on the history of mankind.  Too many countries are dragging their feet on the issue for too many reasons.  I suppose some think that South Africa is a bastion against communism in that part of the world, while there are other countries who are doing too well from their trading activities with South Africa to act effectively against her.  There may be people in other countries who, while condemning apartheid verbally, do not match their words with actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In various parts of the world there exist regimes that are totally unacceptable to those of us who treasure the democratic idea.  Undoubtedly there is monstrous oppression in all parts of the world, but nowhere can <Col N="339" /> such oppression match the sort of oppression that is practised in South Africa.  Nowhere do a minority, so small proportionately in terms of the population, oppress the majority to such an extent as happens in South Africa.  It follows that if such a small minority can for so long perpetrate such an outrage against humanity there must be dragging of feet in various other places.  There have been unanimous UN declarations down through the years but these have not made an iota of difference to the situation. For instance, these declarations have not made any difference to the situation in Namibia which is the subject of a UN mandate but which South Africa continues to hold illegally.  The reason for this ineffectiveness is that all over the world too many are prepared to enter reservations on the caveat, reservations of the type that Deputy Fox has made.  In other words, the people who act in this way are only purporting to support the move against apartheid.  That is very regrettable and is the primary cause of the continuation of the monstrous regime in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The deprivation of human rights in places such as Chile, Uganda, Eastern Europe, Pakistan and elsewhere is a matter of grave concern.  Indeed, there was deprivation of human rights for a long time in part of our country, but none of these situations of deprivation could match the scale of deprivation perpetrated by the South African regime and institutionalised by them since 1948.  The Lagos declaration for action against apartheid which was made at the world conference held there in August last and which I understand was attended by the Minister of State was supported by 112 governments, 12 inter-governmental organisations, five liberation movements and 51 non-governmental organisations.  It had the support of several previous UN declarations, but despite all that apartheid continues as strong as if not stronger than ever before and the economy of South Africa is perhaps stronger than ever before.  In addition the South African armed forces are perhaps stronger than ever before.  One must ask where they <Col N="340" /> get their goods and their military hardware from.  Is it not likely that they get them from some of those 112 countries that were represented in Lagos last year?  South Africa trades with many of those countries and gets expertise from them.  She gets some expertise from this country, for instance. Many Irish people are prepared to go to South Africa.  Many of them are there already.  I do not expect that it is possible for the Government to prevent people from going there, but at least everything possible should be done to discourage them from going.  The point I am trying to make is that there is much hypocrisy and cant in relation to this whole subject while there is little or no action.</P>
    <P>I am deeply concerned that there should be such a perpetration of injustice in South Africa and in these circumstances would ask the question as to whether the solution to the problem ought to be violence, although there is also the question of whether violence is ever justified.  However, having regard to the hypocrisy and the inaction of the rest of the world, if I were a black South African I am sure I would find it very difficult not to think in terms of violence being the answer.  In saying this I am not in any way encouraging violence but I am trying to emphasise the need for the western world and for the rest of the world, too, to wake up to the fact that if something effective is not done to bring apartheid to an end, before long there could be a very bad situation in South Africa, a situation that might not be confined to that part of the world.  If this present situation is allowed to continue it will undoubtedly erupt eventually into a scale of violence not known since the last world war. That type of situation would not serve the interest of anybody in the long term but would bring most hurt and harm to those very people whom we in this House are trying to help and whom other parliaments around the world are trying to help also.</P>
    <P>That is why I am appealing to the Government to use constantly and actively whatever influence they have with the other countries who are interested <Col N="341" /> in the ending of apartheid, to bring to an end the great sin against humanity that is apartheid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not wish to start this debate on a note of acrimony, but I believe the laws of debate relating to Question Time and Private Notice Questions should be revised.  This question should be dealt with more appropriately at Question Time.  I know the Chair cannot do anything about this but I want to take this opportunity to say that this is not a question for the Adjournment but one where the Minister should be given an opportunity to put the facts before the people and the House.  However, that is not covered in Standing Orders and we have to deal with it on the adjournment.</P>
      <P>I find myself in a difficult position because I do not know the facts of the case, and this is the difficulty.  The Minister in charge of security in the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, should make the facts known without a Deputy having to come here and raise the matter on the adjournment.  There has been a great deal of public disquiet as to why two high security risk prisoners should be in Dundrum without adequate security precautions being taken to make sure they could not escape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most adults realise that one of the most dominant thought in a prisoner's mind is to escape.  That is natural. Every person sentenced, whether it is for six months or 30 years, wants to plan his escape.  It is on the cards that people can bluff their way by saying they are sick and be referred to the Central Mental Hospital from where I am told a blind man could escape.  I realise that there is a health aspect involved here, and I fully accept that in a mental hospital such as Dundrum there must be facilities which will help to rehabilitate patients.  It is going a bit far to accept that as an argument as to why two prisoners, particularly one who is known to be highly skilled in the use of explosives, should <Col N="342" /> be allowed to walk the grounds, wander away from the main party and jump over the wall, conveniently having it pre-arranged for a rope ladder to be there.  It is asking too much to accept the new found thinking of the medical profession to ignore the fact that people who are now serving long terms of imprisonment can plan to be put into hospital which is the easiest route of escape.</P>
    <P>If this happens again would any prisoner in our high security prisons who generally needs psychiatric treatment, or who has a nervous breakdown or who becomes so depressed locked up in jail that he need specialist attention, be questioned?  If he is taken to Dundrum will the facilities which were lacking in this case be lacking then too?  This poses a further question.  If these two people are apprehended, and I hope they will be recaptured soon, will they be sent back to Dundrum or will they return to the prisons from which they came, one to the Curragh and the other to Portlaoise?  I fully accept that both prisoners were sent there on medical evidence, but will the Minister for Health or the Minister for Justice ignore the medical report which was strong enough to send them there in the first place, and put them back into proper custody?</P>
    <P>Is Dundrum a suitable place to keep high risk prisoners who may need these medical services in future?  I am told by people who live close to the prison that it must be the simplest place from which to escape in Ireland and maybe even in Europe.  I am told it is quite easy to plan an escape.  All a person has to do is to take possession of a house or find a vacant house, use it and get in contact with the people inside.</P>
    <P>We know the history of prisoners using explosives inside prisons.  We have had a very sad history of this.  I do Not want to go into detail on this occasion because primarily my reason for raising this question on the Adjournment was to get information from the Minister about the lack of security.  I am not going to speak at great length, but in view of what happened is the Minister satisfied that the original transfer to Dundrum was <Col N="343" /> made on valid medical grounds or can this House and the general public assume that the transfer was simply the first phase in an elaborate escape plan? Is it part of an on-going process?  I would welcome information on the circumstances in which the transfer was made and I would like an assurance about the future, particularly in view of the record of one of the prisoners.</P>
    <P>I would also like an assurance from the Minister and from his colleague, the Minister for Justice, that if there is an escape from prison, either from Dundrum Central Medical Hospital or from any State prison, immediately the general public will be told how and when it happened and will be given the full facts.  It is wrong in the extreme that the information should leak out.</P>
    <P>I understand&mdash;and I stand willing to be corrected on this&mdash;that but for a mistake by someone, I do not want to give the officers name, who gave the information on the telephone believing that he was speaking to somebody else, we might not have known about this yet.  This is wrong, and the Minister should tell the House exactly what happened and if security is needed in future.  We do not want to be a laughing stock for the rest of Europe.  If any of us found ourselves on the wrong side of the law and in prison, the first thing we would do would be to plan our escape. That is normal and has been the practice since the beginning of time and will continue to be the practice.</P>
    <P>Our job, as custodians of law and order, is to see that people sentenced to prison for crimes against society serve their time.  The responsibility is on us to make sure that there are no easy escape routes, which is what happened on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The facts of the incident which Deputy Harte raised on the adjournment are quite simple.  Two inmates of the Central Mental Hospital escaped aided and abetted by two outside persons who brought along a ladder, and put it inside the wall, enabling the two inmates to clamber <Col N="344" /> up and over the wall and escape in a van.  The issues raised by Deputy Harte are of more importance and significance than the details of the escape.  Prisoners are transferred from prison to the Central Mental Hospital only when they have been certified medically as being mentally ill and in need of treatment.  I assert for the benefit of the House and Deputy Harte that that was the case in this instance.  The psychiatrists in charge of the hospital confirmed that the two patients who escaped yesterday were mentally ill and that their admission to the hospital was necessary.  I would ask Deputy Harte to accept that there was no question about the medical validity of their illness.</P>
      <P>The security arrangements at the hospital are appropriate to a secure hospital setting and not to a high security prison which must take more elaborate precautions and where personnel other than hospital personnel may be employed.  The staff of the Central Mental Hospital consists of doctors, nurses and attendants.  To provide the type of security available in Portlaoise, for instance, it would be necessary to supplement the staff by additional arrangements involving prison guards, armed patrols, searching of visitors and the erection of grids between patients and visitors. That would create a prison atmosphere rather than a hospital atmosphere and would be at variance with the type of setting psychiatrists consider necessary for the effective treatment of mentally ill patients.  There is a dilemma there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The dilemma is between the security which a prison offers and the conditions which should prevail in a hospital.  These are mentally ill people and therefore rightly or wrongly it is considered that they should be in a hospital setting and that they should be given psychiatric treatment in an attempt to cure them and restore them to normal life.  No member of the staff of the Central Mental Hospital can be blamed for <Col N="345" /> this escape.  I accept that it is necessary to reconsider the arrangements which should be made for the treatment of high security prisoners.  My Department are discussing the possible alternatives with the Department of Justice, which has the primary responsibility for the security of prisoners.  It is important to emphasise that the number of high security patients admitted to Dundrum hospital from Portlaoise in recent years has been very small, seven or eight in the last four years.  In considering special arrangements the size of the problem must be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harte raised the question of psychiatric services for prisoners generally.  The position is that a service is given by consultant psychiatrists in the health service for prisoners who have minor mental illnesses.  In the case of a prisoner in a prison who has a mental illness which is not regarded as being of a serious nature, the prisoner is treated under the health services by a consultant psychiatrist visiting the prison.  Only very disturbed persons are transferred to Dundum for treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other fact I can give is that one of these prisoners, as was suggested by Deputy Harte, was transferred from Portlaoise and the other was transferred from the Curragh.  The matter will <Col N="346" /> certainly have to be looked into and considered but we will always face this central question.  Do we go overboard on the side of security with all that that means or do we try to preserve a hospital atmosphere for the treatment and cure of these prisoners?  The Deputy can accept the medical evidence in this case.</P>

Such estimates at this stage are subject to a wide margin of variation.  For example receipts under the FEOGA Guarantee Section, which account for the vast bulk of the estimated receipts, are liable to be affected by variations in trade and by changes in MCA levels as a result of currency fluctuations, while receipts under the Regional and Social Funds will be influenced by EEC grant approvals in 1978 and by the pace of implementation of approved projects.

      <P>: The proposed office block at the Glen, Waterford City is intended to provide improved accommodation in a centralised location for staffs of the Revenue Commissioners, Departments of Agriculture, Labour and the Environment and possibly for some other services about which decisions have not yet been taken; (2) Some increase in employment though not appreciable is envisaged as a result of the occupation of the office block; (3) Pending the placing of a contract it would be inappropriate for us to discuss the estimate of cost; (4) It is expected that the building will be completed and occupied in 1981; (5) The extent of the parking accommodation has not been finalised; this will be determined at a later stage; (6) The consultants engaged on planning this building are: Architects: Mr. G. McNicholl. B.Arch, FRIAI, Structural Engineers: Messrs. Ove Arup &amp; Partners.</P>
      <P>The consultants were engaged in accordance with the normal practice in the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 144 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the food hygiene regulations the keeping of dogs on food premises except with the consent of the medical officer of health is prohibited and owners of such premises are required to take reasonable precautions to exclude from the premises dogs which are not leashed.  The regulations also require that cats shall not be allowed into a food room unless suitable precautions are taken to prevent their access to food.  I am advised that otherwise <Col N="246" /> dogs and cats do not represent a significant risk to the public health and simple hygiene precautions such as washing hands after handling pets will protect against the transmission of disease.</P>
    <P>Local sanitary authorities are responsible for the cleanlines of footpaths and public parks and have the power in the interest of the good rule and government of their districts to make byelaws for this purpose.  I understand that no such bye-laws have been made.  Sanitary authorities fall within the control of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
