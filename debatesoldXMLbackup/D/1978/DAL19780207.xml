    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has expressed to the Law Reform Commission the Government's priority in respect of laws to be investigated by them; and, if so, if he will indicate these priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission are an independent statutory authority under section 4 of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975 and it is the function of the commission to prepare their programme for submission to the Government.</P>
      <P>The first such programme has been laid before the House and it refers to the fact that the Attorney General has requested the Law Reform Commission to undertake an examination of the law in certain areas including aspects of the marriage laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The report is concerned with issues which, though important in themselves, are relatively unimportant. Is the Taoiseach suggesting that since the Minister has indicated a specific question&mdash;divorce and so on&mdash; it is likely that the commission will now take up this issue and consider it and, if so, is that why the Taoiseach has answered in this way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it is not certain that the interpretation of the section would entitle the Government or <Col N="638" /> the Taoiseach to lay down orders of priority.  The Government may modify a programme submitted to it by the Law Reform Commission but the interpretation is that that does not give a right to establish priorities.  The next section, section 5, entitles the Attorney General to require the commission to examine a particular aspect of the law. It is clear that under that section they are bound to examine a particular aspect of the law if it is so required by the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Has a precedent been established here?  Is this the first time for this Government to indicate a particular subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, not by my Government though, but by the Attorney General who has a statutory function and whose predecessor on at least three or four occasions required the commission also to examine a particular aspect of law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that the rather limited staffing arrangements of the commission do not permit of any great output?  Are there any proposals to extend the staff?</P>

    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he proposes to make salmon licences available to fishermen with small boats in Connemara, County Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Connemara Board of Conservators are empowered to issue a maximum of 30 drift net licences.  The criteria of eligibility for licences are set out in the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order 1977.  The size of vessel proposed to be operated by the applicants is not a factor in the consideration of applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that it is possible under existing legislation for small farmers in Connemara who engage in fishing for part of their livelihood to get a fair crack of the whip in the issuing of these licences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, within the conservation limits, but the overall limitation in this and in every other area must be the necessity to conserve the <Col N="640" /> stocks of salmon in the area.  That is the important criterion because there is not much point in talking academically about fishing effort if there are no salmon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the serious implications for small farmers in the Gaeltacht, would it not be possible for the Minister to review the position while keeping in mind the question of conservation, which of course is of prime importance, but having regard also to the importance of farmers and others with small boats in this area getting their fair share?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should hope that when the new regional boards are established on foot of legislation that will come before the House within this year, the question of small-farmer fishermen would be uppermost in the allocation of licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that no additional salmon licences will be granted either in Galway or in any other part of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust the Minister will refrain from issuing additional salmon licences despite the great political pressure that will be brought to bear on him.  The genuine drift-net fishermen are under much pressure now from people in the national press.  The future of these fishermen must not be jeopardised.</P>

    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Mannion Mr. Mannion  Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Mannion</b> asked the Minister for Fisheries if it is his intention to introduce legislation requiring anglers in the West of Ireland to pay a £2 rod licence for the <Col N="642" /> local lakes; if so, if he is aware of the grave discontent in the area over the proposed legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed that in the legislation at present in preparation for the restructuring of inland fisheries administration, provision will be made for the imposition of a licence duty in respect of angling for brown trout and coarse fish.  The amount of the licence duty has yet to be determined.</P>
      <P>While certain opposition has been raised to the payment of the proposed new licence duty, my information is that the general body of anglers accept the reasonableness of their being asked to contribute towards the cost of the development and improvement of our inland fisheries.  They also realise that payment of a licence duty gives them the right to have a say in the election of regional boards and in the general policy making of the new structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I hear the Minister say it was generally accepted by anglers that the imposition of a licence would be a good thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>All the official angling bodies, the Trout Anglers Federation, the Sea Anglers Federation and the Coarse Anglers Federation, have officially represented to me, as the Inland Fisheries Commission recommended, that such a duty should be introduced on the basis of utilising the funds thus obtained for the development of inland fisheries.  There are objections and I recognise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the western area. The people involved in the tourism and catering industry have advertised in their brochures that this is a free fishing area, possibly the only one in the world.  If a licence is introduced this year it will cause a great deal of embarrassment.  Is the Minister aware of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but the Inland Fisheries Commission recommended it and they are representative of all the interests concerned. The bodies I have mentioned also <Col N="643" /> recommended it.  A fee of £2 a year in the context of today's values does not represent an unduly heavy contribution on the part of certain anglers towards the development of fisheries in which they are interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMMannion" hpid="Mr. Mannion Mr. Mannion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mannion</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that the angling association would have a right in the proposed regional boards.  Would they have the same right as salmon licence holders?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that this has happened in certain areas.  I believe that the logic of the situation as put to me by their own national association will gradually be borne in on them.  I believe that £2 a year to secure a voice in the administration of inland fisheries by having a vote in regard to regional boards, plus their involvement in the development of fisheries, towards which the contribution or duty will go, is a very logical stance.  This is an issue which has been clouded by much emotive reasoning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mannion</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it desirable to do away with the last free fishing resort in Europe?  Lough Corrib and Lough Mask are renowned for their free fishing. Does the Minister think it is desirable to change that, bearing in mind the tourist point of view?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are putting substantial moneys into this area and we have spent a substantial amount of money in purchasing the commercial salmon fishery in Galway.  This has been welcomed in the Lough Corrib and Lough Mask area.  The sort of money the State proposes to plough into this industry is such that we should ask the anglers who will benefit to contribute to some minimal extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a predecessor of his who is now Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Haughey, tried to introduce a similar measure for some type of licence and he backed down in the face of fierce objections from casual fishermen in that area?  I think that the Minister did not consult the right people and they will not accept this.</P>

      <P>The procedures in force at Dublin Airport are designed to reduce to a minimum the disturbance caused by aircraft noise without endangering safety.  Construction of the first of the planned east-west runways and the gradual introduction of quieter aircraft will result in further reductions in the level of aircraft noise in the north city suburbs, including Ballymun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the practice in many international airports to lay down particular pollution levels in relation to noise and see that they are not exceeded?  Is not this what is happening in New York in regard to the aircraft about which there is so much dispute?  One can stipulate the precise amount of noise pollution there will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I might say that we have had only two complaints during the past six months in relation to this. There are noise abatement procedures and generally speaking the runway system is designed to take traffic away from the more densely populated areas like Ballymun.  There are also other procedures whereby pilots of departing aircraft are requested to follow a predetermined course until they reach a certain height.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the procedures to which he referred are honoured as often in the breach as in the observance?  Does the Minister agree that the noise pollution is contributed to very substantially by the height at which the aircraft fly? What monitoring procedures are in existence and what action is taken when aircraft fly below the specified height, as they do quite regularly?</P>

      <P>There is no monitoring system here and there are no plans to introduce it.  It would appear that unless it were possible to impose follow-up penalties it would be ineffective. There are a number of regulations which contribute towards the abatement of noise and there are plans to construct two new runways at Dublin Airport.  The construction of these runways would mean less traffic over the populated areas.  Of course, it will be some time before the runways are completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he has received a submission from CIE regarding the suburban rail electrification scheme; and, if so, if he is in a position to indicate whether his Department has sanctioned its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>The responsibility of providing urban passenger transport is part of CIE's statutory duty, imposed by the Transport Act 1958, to provide reasonable, efficient and economical transport services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by CIE that they have adopted two approaches to ensuring that public transport services expand in line with the expansion of the major urban centres.  The first approach is the alteration of the <Col N="648" /> existing services as and when changes in travel demand arise.  The continuing expansion of urban centres has demanded that CIE revise their route patterns and frequencies regularly and new routes and timetables are introduced as required.  The board's second approach is related to the longer term requirements for public transport services. These requirements have been the subject of transportation studies in the major urban centres and CIE has been associated with all of them.</P>
    <P>Consultation between my Department and the Department of the Environment about urban transport requirements is arranged from time to time as the need arises.  In addition CIE have frequent discussions with the Department of the Environment and the local authorities in Dublin regarding public transport services within the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>CIE have submitted proposals for the electrification of the Howth/Bray railway line.  The examination of these proposals and the necessary consultation with other Departments is proceeding and the proposals will in due course come before the Government for consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  The Minister took the three questions together and I have a number of supplementary questions to ask.</P>
      <P>With regard to the reply to Question No. 8, the Minister mentioned, if I got the answer correctly, that CIE have an obligation to monitor urban transport services as and when changes are required. Later the Minister suggested that CIE would respond as required.  I am concerned that this response is not adequate and I am wondering could the Minister define precisely what is meant by &ldquo;as and when changes demand&rdquo; and &ldquo;as and when required&rdquo; and would he say if there are financial threshold limitations before any bus route changes and the development of routes take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will accept that in a newly built-up area CIE would need to be making their plans in relation to servicing that <Col N="649" /> area and that would be the point at which they would be aware a change was required.  The Deputy is probably aware that sometimes the difficulty that arises in regard to that particular situation is where the local authority have not taken over the roads.  Very often there is a considerable time lag in such cases which would not be the fault of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister has the information available could he indicate whether CIE are in a position, assuming a road is taken in charge, to provide a service on the day the new estate is opened or must CIE wait until a certain level of population has moved in, a level which will provide an economic threshold to cover the cost of providing the service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that information but I would imagine that as soon as there is a reasonable number of people in the area a service is made available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that, if there is not a reasonable number of people in an area, CIE are not in a position to provide a reasonable service? If Dublin Corporation houses people out beyond Blanchardstown what is the definition of a reasonable number of people &ldquo;as and when changes .... demand&rdquo; before the people are provided with a service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure CIE, in examining such a situation, would be able to assess when it was necessary to bring a service in.  As I said, however, the main problem that I have found in regard to this is the fact that roads are not available to take bus traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking now specifically about local authority schemes so we can get rid of the question of roads in charge.  Is there a cost limit set by the Minister's Department before CIE provide a bus service into a new estate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>There would not be a cost limit set by my Department.  I do not know what CIE may do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On Question No. 10 <Col N="650" /> dealing with the suburban rail electrification scheme, I think I am right in saying these proposals were on the desk of the Minister's predecessor and have been on his desk now for some time.  Will the Government be in a position to make provision this year, if they decide to go ahead with the proposal, to initiate the work and, if so, could the Minister give us any information of the number of jobs that would be created by the implementation of this scheme and the number of jobs that would arise as a result of constructing rolling stock at Inchicore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Just one more question. Adverting to the problem created by the non-taking in charge of roads in new estates and the consequent inability of the State transport monopoly to provide public transport in these estates, would the Minister agree that this is a classic example of a problem which a Department of the Environment, worth its name, ought to be able to iron out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if the Government regard the provision of public transport as a social service or as a commercial operation; and, if a social service, the Government's attitude towards the balance between fare revenue and Exchequer subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 of the Transport Act 1958 imposes on CIE, which is the main provider of public transport in the country, the general duty to provide reasonable, efficient and economical transport services with <Col N="652" /> due regard to safety of operation, the encouragement of national economic development and the maintenance of reasonable conditions of employment for their employees.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Transport Act 1964, as amended by section 3 of the Transport (No. 2) Act 1974, imposes on CIE the duty to conduct their under-taking so that, after taking into account payments made to the board out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, their expenditure shall not be greater, taking one year with another, than their revenue.</P>
      <P>These Acts do not make any reference to the provision of services which might be termed &ldquo;social&rdquo;.  However, the subvention provided by the Government is designed to cover the deficit arising in respect of those services which cannot be provided on an economic basis but which are regarded as necessary in the public interest.</P>
      <P>In 1975 and 1976 the Exchequer subvention was equivalent to approximately 40 per cent of total revenue. The size of the subvention is not however fixed on the basis of any predetermined ratio.  It is settled by the Government in the light of CIE forecasts for the year ahead, the prevailing and expected Exchequer position and other relevant considerations, including the interests of users of the services. CIE are expected to pursue all possible means of containing and reducing the deficit in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if, when the Department and the Government are discussing, as they must, each year with CIE the extent of the deficit, there is a differentiation in the level of subsidy which would go for different kinds of services provided by CIE&mdash; for example, urban bus services, rural bus services or suburban rail services&mdash; or is it a straightforward totting up of the moneys required and the gross deficit? In simple words, is there any differentiation made during these discussions between the level of subsidy applied to different forms of service provided by CIE and if so can the Minister indicate what they might be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal regulations governing flight time for flight crew members and other regulations on flight safety are contained in the Air Navigation (Operations) Order, 1964.  A new order to re-enact with modifications the existing order is in course of preparation.  This new order, which will reflect the most recent standards promulgated by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, does not envisage any significant change in the regulations governing flight times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the article does not specify the number of hours which pilots may fly.  The onus is on the operators to maintain records of flight times, flight duties and so on, and to establish with the Minister's approval rules limiting flight times.  Our system is in keeping with international civil aviation standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the complexity of the operation of flying a modern <Col N="656" /> plane and in view of the fact that most airlines insist that their pilots be in peak physical condition, does the Minister not consider it undesirable that it is possible for unscrupulous operators, if such exist, to allow their pilots to fly for 24 hours at a stretch and that there should be some regulation to prevent this happening?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>RTE have been conducting experiments in community radio throughout the country over the past few years.  They have also broadcast the community radio programme &ldquo;Corkabout&rdquo; in the Cork area regularly since March 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that for some time now RTE have been preparing plans for community radio stations in Dublin and in some provincial areas.  Recently, RTE submitted outline proposals to my Department for a community service in the Dublin area.  These proposals have been the subject of discussion between the Department and RTE and RTE are to furnish further detailed information on them.  Consideration <Col N="657" /> of the matter has not yet reached the stage when I can say anything definite in regard to timetable and cost but I intend to reach a decision quickly when the further information sought has been received.</P>

      <P>I would be rather surprised if they were concerned about the long delay unless they did not know when the proposals were submitted to me.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he has received an application for a broad-casting licence from an organisation known as Radio Dublin; if he will be sympathetic to such an application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>An application has been received for such a licence and the applicants have been informed that it cannot be granted.  Approximately 3,200 letters in support of the application have been received in my Department in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>The operators of &ldquo;Radio Dublin&rdquo; are well aware of the legal position. Under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, anyone who has in his possession or uses wireless telegraphy apparatus without a licence from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is committing an offence.  Under the Broad-casting Authority Act, 1960 RTE is the only organisation which may be licensed to provide a broadcasting service. As broadcasting requires the use of scarce radio frequencies which cannot be confined to national boundaries, international agreement on the control of the allocation and use of such frequencies is essential.  This control is exercised in this country by my Department.  Unlicensed radio stations are a potential menace to radio services generally, including life-saving services.  My Department will accordingly continue to take action against all unlicensed broadcasting stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that Radio Dublin gives great pleasure to a lot of young people and for that reason would he not agree that there is a need for a local pop radio station of that sort, even if it is to be run by RTE?  Would the Minister agree to look into this matter urgently <Col N="659" /> with a view to providing such a station?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the simple fact of the matter is that the law is being flagrantly and publicly violated by these pirate radios.  I have no doubt that a well orchestrated campaign is being carried on to try to force the granting of a licence.  In so far as the need for such a station is concerned I should like to state that RTE have a duty to provide for all our citizens, not just for any one group of citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>and <b>Mr. O'Toole</b> asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs why his Department are requiring business radio owners to phase out the employment of 50 KHZ channel spacing equipment; and if he is aware of the very large cost imposed on owners, such as doctors and veterinary surgeons, who are performing a vital service to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): The change is being made in the interests of efficient use of the limited radio frequency spectrum space available for business radio purposes and thus to enable as many business radio users as possible to be accommodated. No new licences for business radio equipment using 50 Kilohertz channel spacing have been issued since 1966.  50 Kilohertz equipment is wasteful of radio frequency spectrum space because it employs a wider channel spacing that is used by modern equipment. It was accordingly decided in 1976 that the equipment would not be licensed after April 1978.  Licensees were given two years' notice of the change.</P>
      <P>The costs involved for licensees should be considered in the light of the length of time the obsolete equipment has been in use, the need to conserve frequency spectrum space and the period of notice given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): I regret that the precise information sought by the Deputy is not readily available but the following is indicative of the length of time it takes to get service in Waterford city.  Everyone who applied for a telephone there prior to August 1977 either has service or will have service within about a month or so.</P>
      <P>The reason for the delay in installing telephones in Waterford city and elsewhere is that the Department's resources of manpower, plant and buildings are not yet adequate to overtake arrears and cope with current demand. The development plan prepared in connection with the Telephone Capital Act, 1977 which provides for investment of a further £350 million in the telephone service should go a long way towards eliminating delays experienced at present.</P>

      <P>Proposals for amendment of the Farm Modernisation Directive have recently been put forward by the EEC Commission.  These are at present being examined in Brussels by officials of the member states and will be considered by the Council of Ministers during the next few months.

With regard to the other part of the Deputy's Question, I am not aware that it has been suggested by anybody that all landowners, regardless of their size, be required to keep accounts.  It is the aim of the Department of Agriculture to secure a situation where the greatest possible number of people will be considered as development farmers.

      <P>Even the most cursory examination of the section in the Minister's budget speech on youth employment or unemployment revealed it to be by far the most dishonest part of this extraordinarily serious proposal we are discussing here today.  We are told that with £5 million the Government will succeed in creating 5,000 jobs.  This would be job creation at the cheapest rate for a decade.  When we examine the proposals in detail we realise that what will be created here and what will be called jobs will not be real jobs of the sort that people can hold and get married and raise a family on, but mere temporary expedients designed to reduce on a shortterm basis the numbers on the live register.  This becomes obvious when we look at the composition of the 5,000 jobs we are now told we will see over the next 12 months.  It is obvious that the majority of these are going to come from short-time AnCO courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can foresee from the Minister's budget speech about 120 real jobs for <Col N="687" /> building apprentices, perhaps 700 for community youth projects and 100 or 150 for the extra instructors required by AnCO to process the increased number of young people taking training courses.  AnCO are doing a splendid job of training and retraining people of all ages, but it is a perversion of their function to assume that just because the people they train or retrain leave the unemployment register, in some cases for periods as short as three weeks, what has thereby been created is a job.  What we will have is a couple of thousand extra young people trained or retrained through AnCO.  It is to be hoped that this will increase the chances they will have of getting a real job, but it does not guarantee this, and nothing that the Government seem prepared to do will guarantee it.  At the end of the 12 months starting from the date of the Minister's budget speech the number of those 5,000 people who will be back on the unemployment register after having been off it for very brief periods of time will be very large indeed.</P>
    <P>I now turn to some of the detailed implications of the decision to remove the wealth tax, and I would like to begin by nailing one of the myths that are part of common political discourse, especially on the Government benches in this House.  That myth is that incentive is something that exists only in private industry, that incentive exists only where there are substantial, not to say gross financial rewards for it.  The history of the entire public service in this country gives the lie to that argument.  The history of the many profitable and efficient State and semi-State organisations gives the lie to the myth that incentive is something which is the exclusive prerogative of the private sector in industry.  Had it not been for the not so benign neglect of some of these public institutions by successive Fianna Fáil Governments we would have a far more vigorous and healthy public sector today, one which might justifiably be used as a basis for considerable and job-creating industrial expansion.  Even in the attenuated form of the public service, <Col N="688" /> the State and semi-State companies have shown that they can produce incentive and maintain it on wage and salary levels which are considerably below the levels of the sort of income that is virtually guaranteed to the people whom this wealth tax proposals is designed to facilitate.  About 5,000 individuals or corporations of one kind or another are paying wealth tax and the most recent available figures indicate that the average payment is about £2,000.  If the Government abolish the wealth tax they will not be just giving these people, these trusts and these funds £2,000 in 1978; they will be giving them at least £2,000 in 1979 and probably considerably more in the years to come.  It is not merely £2,000; it is £2,000 a year added to by inflation, by speculation and by all the sins of the higher echelons of property and income.  I was intrigued by one of the Minister's phrases when he referred to the fact that Fianna Fáil have no place in their philosophy for irresponsible speculation.  That is fine when you read it the first time.</P>
    <P>When you read it the second time you ask what is responsible speculation, because presumably Fianna Fáil are in favour of that.  The wealth tax proposal is one of the most regressive that has been introduced in this budget.  The Minister alleged that it was because this tax was introduced that there was a falling off in confidence and incentive for the wealthier members of our society.  I remember the same being argued at great length in the other House.  This plaint continued for some years until in the last budget put in by the previous Government the marginal tax rates at the upper end of the scale were sharply reduced from 77 per cent to 60 per cent and suddenly all the murmurings about the wealth tax disappeared.  It seemed obvious that it was the marginal tax rate rather than the wealth tax as such which was the major problem in this regard.</P>
    <P>Incentives need thinking about, and careful thinking.  They do not need the kind of crude surgery that is being applied to them in this budget.  I stress that it is being applied in such a way and with such implications as to down-grade <Col N="689" /> and write off the very extra-ordinary and dedicated work done by generations of public servants since the foundation of this State.  I suspect that the single fact that the tax was so small in its yield may have contributed to the Government's belief that they could get away with abolishing it.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the figures.  I agree the tax was small.  A year or so ago it was producing only £6 million.  This year, the year in which it is being abolished, it is producing only £8.5 million.  But which tax has increased its take by almost 50 per cent in a period of 12 or 18 months?  Granted, it was started on a small base, but inflation and increased real wealth obviously were bringing more estates into the wealth tax category, and there was a real possibility that the wealth tax in the very near future, had it been left there by a socially responsible Government, would have begun to bite.</P>
    <P>I believe one of the fundamental reasons for the abolition of the wealth tax is to allow Fianna Fáil to replenish their war chest.  It does not have to have been the subject matter of a prior commitment before the Government were changed.  It formed no part specifically of the Fianna Fáil manifesto, but the beauty of it is that it follows as night follows day that the persons who benefit from the removal of this tax will no doubt seek to reward, in however niggardly a fashion, the persons who are directly responsible for the benefits that will accrue from it.  If there is to be £8.5 million knocking around in the pockets of a number of private individuals this year which was not there last year, how much of that money will find its way into the campaign funds of the Government party?  This points more sharply than ever to the need to have a radical look at the financing of political activity here.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to the social aspects of the budget, and like other speakers from these benches I have found it extraordinary that some of the most disadvantaged sectors of our population have done so extraordinarily badly out of it.  It is an attempt by the administration to create a coalition of the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the <Col N="690" />&ldquo;might-haves&rdquo; against the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo;. I was intrigued to read in one of our daily newspapers an allegation that by securing a 10 per cent increase for certain categories of social welfare recipients, the Minister for Social Welfare had secured a coup.  If I were the Minister for Social Welfare it is a coup I could well do without because it is unlikely at the very least that it will match inflation, and it ignores several substantial categories of social welfare recipients, so much so indeed that we have had the spectacle, unprecedented I think in this country, of the St. Vincent de Paul organisation taking up the cudgels in public print to berate the Government for lack of social responsibility.  In a statement published in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday it is noted that the society are gravely concerned that the Government has not given sufficient attention to the needs of families on low incomes and especially those who have to rely solely on social welfare payments.  The society has calculated that the budget would give least benefit to families of above average size on low incomes.</P>
    <P>The society went on to say:</P>
    <P>Even after the ten per cent increase in social welfare payments, people on low incomes, and especially large families, will have fallen further behind those on higher incomes.  The increases in the tax allowances, the savings through the abolition of rates and of motor tax will not mean more cash in the pockets of the poorest families.</P>
    <P>That is a simple, logical, factual indictment of what the Government have done in this budget.  It is a budget that has seriously affected members of large families and, I need hardly add, women, especially the ultimate in this disenfranchised category, married women who are working.  They have had no increase in tax-free allowances; there is no change in the restrictions on married women and their qualifications in respect of unemployment assistance, and much of the investment in the job area, doubtful though it is, will be in areas in which employment is naturally <Col N="691" /> preponderantly male.  However, it is in relation to poor families that some of the most telling criticisms can be made.  According to Mr. Brian Nolan of the Central Bank, whose paper, Income and Distribution in Ireland, was read to the Social and Statistical Enquiry Society of Ireland and reported in last Friday's <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
    <P>Of every £100 of wealth created in this country £1.50 goes to the poorest ten per cent of Irish households and £26.80 goes to the richest ten per cent of Irish households.</P>
    <P>To put it in even cruder terms, the income of the top ten per cent in the scale is 20 times that of those at the bottom of the scale.  There is no way that one can look at this budget and not say that this differential will be more sharply increased.  That is a logical extension of what the Government have done.</P>
    <P>The late Seán Lemass used to say, to some effect, that a rising tide lifts all boats, and that, no doubt, is part of the now threadbare philosophy of the Government.  I would point out that the important thing, if one is to benefit from this sort of economic activity, is that you have to be in a boat in the first place and there are substantial strata in our society who have not the price of a pair of welling-tons not to talk of the price of a boat, and the rising tide that will float some of the boats will engulf those unfortunate people who are unable to provide themselves with the means of flotation.  It is on the basis of this extraordinary set of financial provisions, which undoubtedly will benefit many people but at considerable cost to the long-term welfare of the economy as a whole, that the organised workforce of the country are asked to base their response to the Government's call for incomes moderation. On their present showing, the organised workforce have so far been extraordinarily responsible in the face of what can only be regarded as amazing provocation, because&mdash;and this is often forgotten&mdash;our organised workforce do not regard themselves solely as spokesmen for their own interests and particularly for the interests <Col N="692" /> of their underprivileged, the socially deprived.</P>
    <P>The Government have set before us shifting sands of economic options and are asking the workforce and the employers to take a firm stand on it. If this budget comes anywhere near to success&mdash;I doubt if it will&mdash;it will only be because about 20 lucky chances simultaneously will have gone right for the Government, most of them out of the control of the Government because their origins and major effects are outside the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have notice of my odds in due course.  We have been told by the Government that they are looking for moderation in incomes as a gesture of reciprocity for what they have delivered or are proposing to deliver by way of income supplements and tax reliefs of one kind or another.  There was no reciprocity demanded from the recipients of the benefits of motor tax or rates abolition except, of course, that which insured the return of the Government to office, and I thoroughly doubt that this budget is an adequate basis for the kind of development we will need.</P>
      <P>I see here an overall strategy, the strategy of a Government returned to office by dint of making in social and economic terms the most expensive promises in the history of the State. They then came along rashly implementing these promises in such a way that will leave the country reeling for the next three years, as they desperately try to claw their way out of the mess they have created.  They will come along in three years' time with another set of lavish promises and say: &ldquo;We honoured our promises the last time. You can trust us to honour them again.&rdquo;  They will be judged on more than promises and on more than the implementation of those promises in January 1978.  The Government will be judged on their handling of the mess that has been created by this budget and it is on the judgment of that performance that they will be put out of office.</P>

      <P>This manifesto was not just thought up on the eve of a general election.  It was carefully prepared during our years in opposition and it was put before the electorate, who endorsed it in no uncertain manner.  As far as we are concerned, it will charter the course of national recovery during the next few years.  It is our guideline to achieve those objectives.  Many of the things included in the manifesto have already been implemented, and this is what really annoys the Opposition speakers.  They cannot understand how the Government are so successful in implementing the manifesto.  The first commitments in the manifesto which were implemented were the abolition of car tax on cars up to and including 16 horse power, the abolition of rates on private dwellings, the increase in SDA loans, the £1,000 grant to first time house purchasers, the increase in reconstruction, and water and sewerage grants and in group water scheme grants which was announced recently, the increase in the higher education grants, and the increase announced recently by the Minister for Agriculture of the price paid for reactor cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hopefully, over the next four years the remaining parts of the manifesto will be implemented.  I will work with my colleagues to ensure that every paragraph of the manifesto is put into effect.  The schemes which have already been put into effect have been of real benefit regardless of the speeches made in the opposite benches, and the people will continue to benefit over the next few years.  The increase in the SDA loans and in the housing grants have been a great boost to young people who are trying to provide themselves <Col N="694" /> with a new house.  It should be the primary aim of any Government to look after the young newly married people and to ensure they have ways and means of providing themselves with a home.  This is the biggest single decision any young married couple have to make, and most of them only make it once in a lifetime.  It is important for any Government with any kind of social conscience to ensure that these people get the maximum assistance.  The measures implemented since this Government came to office have contributed magnificently to helping people provide themselves with a home.  The measures have also contributed to creating more jobs in the building industry.  Here again the Government are carrying out part of their overall plan to increase employment in this sector.  I have no doubt that in the year ahead the incentives offered will further expand this industry.</P>
    <P>The main provisions in the budget have already been highlighted.  They are: income tax reliefs of £63 million, single persons allowances are up by £200 and married couples allowance by £630.  In relation to job creation there are initiatives to enable 22,860 new jobs to be provided by Government action.  Manufacturing companies need increase employment by only 3 per cent to qualify for the special 25 per cent rate of corporation tax. Wealth tax has been abolished.  We have heard a lot of criticism from speakers, including Deputy Horgan, in relation to the wealth tax.  I cannot understand why the Fine Gael and the Labour Parties are so opposed to the abolition of the wealth tax.  Deputy Horgan suggested that this was a regressive step and that last year wealth tax had produced £6 million for the Exchequer.  Has any consideration been given by the Opposition parties to the number of investments that have been lost as a result of the introduction of this tax?  Many millions of pounds have left the country as a result of its introduction.</P>

      <P>Even Deputy Horgan and Deputy Ryan, who was the Minister who introduced this measure, will agree that people who had money here shifted it out of the banks.  Any bank manager in the city will say that a large amount of investment left the country at that time and naturally this was a big loss to the country.  As well as that the wealth tax frightened people who had money to invest from investing it here.  They would not invest it if they were likely to be caught in the wealth tax net.  Has any assessment been made in relation to the number of jobs that have been lost as a result of that measure? It would have been far better to encourage our people to invest money here rather than borrowing from the oil sheiks, or whoever else had money to lend us, in order to keep the wheels of progress turning.  We should have encouraged our own people to invest their money here rather than frightening them away with the introduction of the wealth tax.  For those reasons I am glad that the wealth tax has been abolished.  This will encourage people who have money in England, America and so on to put their money back into the country and by doing so create additional employment.</P>
      <P>Certain profits from farming and fishery co-operatives are exempt from corporation tax from 1 April, so they will benefit from this budget.  Social welfare benefit has increased by 10 per cent.  Unemployment assistance restrictions on single women and widows will be removed from October next. This is a major breakthrough.  It is only right that at this time young women should be included for unemployment assistance.  Capitation grants for handicapped special schools are raised by one-third; interest derived by children from the investment of lump sum awards is to be exempt from income tax&mdash;also a great help to those who really need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget is designed to give an mpetus to economic activity and help he private sector to take over as the engine of economic growth.  That <Col N="696" /> should be the aim of any Government &mdash;to help the private sector as much as possible and, as the Minister said in his budget statement, prime the pump and bring back confidence in the country.  That is the one thing that was lacking in the past few years.</P>
    <P>Since I am responsible for the Department of Agriculture I shall speak mainly on agriculture because I am sure other people will go into greater detail and highlight the budget effects on their particular Departments. It should be clear to everybody that the budget is designed to achieve growth and create employment.  The agricultural industry is already in a position to make its contribution to the attainment of these objectives.  Last year was a particularly good one for agricultural production.  Gross output is estimated to have increased by nearly 9 per cent and there was a substantial increase of the order of 7 per cent in net output. Farm incomes increased by almost one-third as compared with 13 per cent in the previous year.  Allowing for inflation the improvement in family farm income in 1977 meant a significant increase in real terms.  Nearly all sectors of agriculture did well in 1977.  Output of cattle, milk, pigs and tillage crops showed a substantial increase.  Agriculture is on a very sound footing and we can confidently look forward to continuing expansion in the years ahead.  This will enable the industry to fulfil the key role which the Government election manifesto saw for agriculture in putting the economy back on a sound footing.</P>
    <P>I take a special interest in the progress of farming in the western counties and the responsibilities assigned to me include those related to the disadvantaged areas.  Farmers in the west like those in the rest of the country have gained considerably from membership of the European Community.  They have benefited from the very substantial increases in prices for most agricultural products in recent years.  As a result, incomes have risen fairly dramatically in the west as elsewhere and many progressive farmers there can now expect a fair standard of living.  Nevertheless, farming in many parts of the west poses special problems <Col N="697" /> not experienced by farmers in the rest of the country.  Apart from the physical problems of the terrain and different soil conditions, there are the special problems listed in the recent White Paper on National Development and these apply more in western counties than elsewhere.  These problems, which are listed as tending to inhibit growth in agricultural output are, first, size and structure of farms; second, the relatively small proportion of farms run by young farmers; third, inadequate drainage; and fourth, high dependence on grassland production, and very often in the west this means dependence on a less intensive system of farming.</P>
    <P>Some of those problems can be overcome and, as indicated in the White Paper, the Government are tackling them so that western farming can make its full contribution to growth in the economy and so that all who remain in farming in the west will be able to secure the best possible income as reward for their efforts.</P>
    <P>The size and structure of the farms are inhibiting factors in many cases. We cannot create additional land but we can utilise the acres we have more fully and make them more productive. Progress towards increasing the average size of farms through re-arrangement, amalgamation and the other operations carried out by the Land Commission is necessarily very slow. A more immediate way of opening up possibilities of increasing farm output on many farms would be to bring more land into full production through drainage and reclamation.  A considerable acreage has already been improved in the west but much remains to be done.  It has been estimated that we have at least a further 1 million acres west of the Shannon which could be improved by reclamation and drainage. We can no longer afford to waste such a valuable resource.  By getting a substantially increased output from these lands we would do more than merely improve the income of farmers; we would also be producing extra raw material, especially meat and milk, for our processing industries which would enable them to expand employment and consolidate their own viability and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> Because of the importance of drainage and especially because it can have an immediate impact on the viability of farms, the European Commission proposal to provide special financial assistance for drainage in western counties is particularly welcome.  I expect these proposals, which cover both field and arterial drainage, will be adopted by the Council of Ministers before many months have passed. In anticipation of this I have asked the Department of Agriculture to give immediate consideration to ways and means by which we could hope to achieve a marked acceleration of drainage and reclamation activity in the west.  I have made arrangements also to ensure close liaison between the Department and the Board of Works so that in so far as possible their respective activities can be co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>The possibilities for increased drainage and reclamation activities are enormous.  The price of farm produce coupled with the greatly inflated prices for land offer a tremendous incentive to farmers to bring more marginal land into full production.  I have been involved already in discussions with various interests, including the advisory services, an Foras Talúntais and co-operative societies for the purpose of exploring the question of how all can work together in getting things done.  The restoration of the tax exemption in the budget for co-operatives will give an added incentive to the societies to interest themselves in every way possible so far as expansion is concerned.  I am glad to note that already a number of them are interested in becoming involved in drainage and land reclamation work.  For their part the Government intend giving every encouragement towards greater progress.</P>
    <P>One result of the improved prices available to farmers is that they have more money to invest in improving and modernising their holdings.  In 1978 a sum of £28 million is being provided for the farm modernisation scheme compared with £24,500,000 in 1977.  Here again the increase reflects the continuing interest of farmers in investing in necessary improvements and shows also their growing confidence in the future.  While we <Col N="699" /> recognise that the modernisation scheme and the EEC directive on which it is based may not be perfect, it must be said also that even now the scheme provides very generous incentives to all farmers to carry out necessary improvements.  No genuine farmer is excluded from these incentives. All can participate in the scheme, so suggestions to the contrary are without foundation.  The position is that the Exchequer steps in to provide adequate funds for farm modernisation where the EEC have failed to do so, with the result that all farmers can benefit.</P>
    <P>One of the aspects of the modernisation directive that we will be seeking to change is that of the relatively minor degree of financing by the EEC. There is everything to be said, too, in present circumstances for giving the highest possible levels of investment aids to every farmer who intends to remain dependent on farming&mdash;that is, of course, if farming is his main source of income.  It will be our objective to convince our European partners that this is the right philosophy.</P>
    <P>Farming is also a vital area of employment.  In recent years employment in farming has been declining, but the important consideration is whether the decline is faster or slower. The slower the rate of decline the more jobs will be preserved on farms, and these jobs are as valuable&mdash;many would say they are more valuable&mdash; than jobs created elsewhere.  It is possible that the cost of creating those jobs would be much less than the cost of creating jobs in other sectors. Therefore there is every reason for developing farms in order to employ productively on the land as many people as possible.</P>
    <P>Western farmers have no reason to fear EEC policies.  We know from our experience of the past five years that some of the directives are not very helpful so far as farmers in the west are concerned, but we have made suggestions regarding changes in those directives.  Hopefully, the Commission will make some modifications so that we may be able to include more of our farmers in the higher grants available under those directives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> The implementation of the disadvantaged areas directive is designed to keep people in rural areas.  The Government are pledged to continue the headage payments on livestock.  These payments are the means of supplementing farmers in those areas.  The payments amount to £20 million per year and are an extremely valuable input to the areas benefiting from them.  Already a review of the situation is under way and the Government will be considering shortly what adjustments might appropriately be made. There is a prospect also of securing an increased rate of recoupment from the Community in respect of headage payments.  Western farmers have responded well to the scheme of grants to farm groups to assist them in acquiring fodder-producing machinery.  This has been one of the most successful schemes introduced under the directive.  It is a scheme that should prove particularly valuable towards overcoming the chronic problems associated with the provision of adequate supplies of winter fodder for stock, especially in poorer areas.  I mention these matters only to emphasise that the EEC directives are not geared entirely towards putting people off the land.  On the contrary they recognise in a special way the difficulties of the problem regions and seek to deal with these difficulties in various appropriate ways.</P>
    <P>Since I am concentrating on aspects of western farming I must not fail to mention the sheep industry.  The successful conclusion of the agreement with France for the export of carcase lamb to that country must provide a major boost to the sheep industry.  It is to be hoped that Irish lamb will now enhance its reputation on the French market as a quality product.  Exporters here carry the major responsibility of ensuring that the reputation is not endangered in any way.  On the other hand I expect that sheep farmers throughout the west will respond quickly to the new situation and that we can look forward to a rapid reversal of the downward trend in sheep numbers in recent years.  Consequently, that sector of agriculture will be able to make its contribution to the overall expansion of the industry.  The meat <Col N="701" /> processing sector will benefit also.  In turn I trust it will be capable of creating some of the additional new jobs with which we are all concerned.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset, this budget is essentially about growth and job creation.  I have dwelt on aspects of agriculture in the western counties for the reason that there is a belief in some quarters that farming in that region has little to contribute.  I, for one, must scotch that notion.  This Government believe firmly in developing to the full every aspect of the west and farming will have a major role to play in that development.  Growth in agriculture is an objective to be pursued across the board.  We are unique among the European partners in the extent of our experience on agriculture and it behoves us, therefore, to pursue the maximum expansion of the industry with the utmost vigour.</P>
    <P>I believe that the budget has left the climate right for farmers to push ahead. The concessions granted in relation to contractors' fees and for rates paid will be very much welcomed by those farmers who are liable for taxation. There is now no sound reason why taxation should be a barrier to greater farm development.  Agriculture is, therefore, geared to make its full contribution to growth in the economy, to the creation of jobs and especially to our balance of payments position.</P>
    <P>The employment potential in the processing industry could be of significant importance.  By securing the greatest level of expansion in the production of farm produce and by pursuing the manifesto objective of intensifying processing through to the consumer stage, as well as exploring every opening for the utilisation of by-products, the agriculture industry can provide its quota of new jobs. Certainly farming is geared to make its contribution and this budget leaves the climate right for it to do so.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that over the next year or so people will realise the many advantages in this budget.  I am quite satisfied that, given the leadership expected of the Government, the other sectors of our economy will respond and the social partners will play their part in ensuring that this country is <Col N="702" /> capable of standing on its own two feet.  It is important, too, to realise that it is not just the Government that can achieve this; there must be co-operation from workers, employers and everybody else involved in creating jobs. Our main task is to create jobs for our young people.  With the best will in the world no Government could ever hope to see the day when they would have abolished or reduced the unemployment register to such an extent that it would no longer be of any great significance.</P>
    <P>The Government must always be mindful of their responsibility towards young people.  At present and during the past few years a large number of young people have been travelling all over the country trying to find jobs which are not there.  It is very frustrating for them and for their parents. The budget which we are now discussing is making some effort to eliminate the fears and frustrations of those young people.  I have no doubt that if all the partners involved pull their weight and if the Government provide the leadership, as they have done during the past few months, we can see the day when this huge figure of more than 100,000 people on the unemployed register will be drastically reduced.</P>
    <P>The Government's target so far have been correct and I hope that when we sit back in 12 months' time and analyse the effects of this budget on the economy and on the creation of jobs we will all agree that this has been one of the best budgets ever introduced by any Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to upset the Minister of State but I can assure him that he will not be sitting back comfortably this time next year, nor will the people of Ireland.  The necessary role of being a prophet of doom is not a popular one but in the discharge of my duties as Minister for Finance I did not seek popularity but did my duty and I will do my duty now.  What a pity that Deputy Colley, who succeeded me, did not endeavour to emulate me in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I charge the Minister for Finance and his colleagues in Government with <Col N="703" /> dangerous driving of the economy. The Minister has allowed himself to be egged on by a reckless, unthinking load of passengers in the back seat. We know what sensible people think of back-seat drivers.  The Minister for Finance and the Government have major personal responsibility for making the right decisions and they have made the worst possible decisions. The strategy of this budget is wrong; it is as wrong as wrong can be.  I doubt very much if there is any member of the Government with any understanding of economic laws who would not agree with me that it is wrong.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue, is and will be recognised in time as the Minister for Economic Science Fiction. He has spoken of the Government's policy as a gamble.  Governments are not justified in taking gambles.  At a time when Ireland's economy is growing faster than most economies in the world, the Government are irresponsible in introducing an inflationary budget which will fuel the fires of domestic inflation, add considerably to the burden of taxation of the people, undermine this country's creditworthiness at home and abroad and will limit the ability of any Government for the foreseeable future, say, for the next ten years, to use the budget as it ought to be used when the economy is sluggish to generate growth and to compensate for lack of activity in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Twice in this House the following words have been used and they are recorded in the Official Report at columns 1722 and 1723 on the 10th May 1973 and also at column 310 on the 26 January 1977.  I will quote the words and ask the House to guess who uttered them.  Speaking about the necessity for curbing Government expenditure the following was said:</P>
    <P>The key is not to allow expenditure to grow at too fast a rate.  Every Minister for Finance is tempted to allow expenditure to grow more than he knows it should grow and more than the economy can bear at the particular time.  He is tempted because there are some very worth-while <Col N="704" /> things he can do, and he is tempted for purely political advancement. If he lets spending grow without regard to the capacity of the economy to pay, he can have short-term political advantages....</P>
    <P>The utterer of these truths then warns that &ldquo;as sure as night follows day&rdquo; such a policy brings about an extremely difficult economic situation.  Does anyone recall who said these wise words? They were spoken by Deputy George Colley in 1973.  He was so proud of them he repeated them last year.  Then, this year, when we have one of the fastest growth rates in the world, when our inflation rate is descending more rapidly than the inflation rate of any other country in the EEC&mdash;although we are still far from having it at an acceptable level&mdash;when the rate of Government borrowing, which was at an intolerable level but justified in the circumstances of the recession, was going down, Deputy Colley decides to add fuel to the fire he so strongly condemned in the past, although he never offered any alternative policy during the years of recession.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley said the Minister for Finance would be tempted because there were worthwhile things to do. Yes.  He can also be tempted, said Deputy Colley, for purely political advantage.  I, too, was tempted.  I resisted the temptation particularly where political advantage would have been the reward.  But Deputy Colley has not resisted the temptation and the price will now be heavily paid by our people in the years ahead.  Sadly, they are not aware of the fact that they will have to pay.  It had not dawned on them.  I should not say &ldquo;people&rdquo; because some are aware. Remember, this foolish policy now being implemented was adopted by only one out of every 20 people who transferred their support for us in 1973 to Fianna Fáil in 1977.  If they alone were called upon to pay the cruel price that will have to be paid for this folly, it would be fair enough.  They deserve to have to pay for it.  But it is not they who will pay for it.  We know who some of them are.  They are being relieved of wealth tax in this budget. It is the ordinary people who will pay, <Col N="705" /> not merely in additional taxation in the years to come but also in lost job opportunities.  The need for Government to have effective control of our economy will in the future be greater than it has been in the past.  But that ability to manoeuvre is being thwarted by extremely foolish actions taken this year.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach posed the question: &ldquo;Should the Government have gone back on their election promises?&rdquo;  If the promises had been honestly made, if they were a sincere assessment of what was needed in the economic circumstances of the spring and early summer of 1977, and circumstances did not change since then, perhaps the Government ought to have done what they considered sincerely to be the right thing.  But I recall that this time last year, the time when presumably the Fianna Fáil policies were being formulated.  We have been told <i>ad nauseam</i> their policies were not trick-o-the-loop policies produced overnight but rather well thought out and well worked upon.  They were presumably in preparation this time last year when Fianna Fáil were forecasting a derisory rate of growth in 1977, when Fianna Fáil were forecasting an increase in the numbers of unemployed in 1977, when Fianna Fáil were forecasting a rate of price increase which was 4 per cent above what was achieved in 1977.  If their policies were right to deal with that situation as they saw it, even though they were wrong, they are certainly not right now when the situation is so radically different from what they thought it was and is actually in accordance with what we said it would be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley last year called the budget a deflationary one which would not provide the engine of growth necessary to give employment.  But there was not&mdash;and I say this with all solemnity and conviction&mdash;with the exception of a small number of additional teachers, one additional job in the public service in 1977 that was not provided for by us in the budget of 1977.  They have spoken of £50 million extra for additional jobs in the public sector.  They have been asked to identify these and have failed to do so. They have not produced the jobs in <Col N="706" /> the public sector that they said they would produce.  They know they cannot produce the limited jobs in the public sector this year or in any year without enormous cost.</P>
    <P>Once again I invite the Government and the Minister for Finance and the Public Service to identify the jobs.  Cut out the evasion.  Cut out the misleading propaganda.  Jobs in the public sector are clearly identifiable.  The State Directory is published annually.  It gives exactly the number of head of staff and status in every Department of State.  It does not contain the additional 20,000 jobs promised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Additional jobs in the public service are suggested as the cure-all.  The public service, numerically speaking, is already too large. It has to be paid for by the community. Nobody in the civil service or elsewhere can be paid for out of thin air.  Public service jobs have to be paid for through taxation or out of profits from the sale of services.  Few public services make profits.  While it is certainly pleasant for anyone who gets a job, no matter where that job may be, let us realise that the community must pay for it.  For a short time one may borrow abroad to pay for current jobs but when foreign lenders get fed up because the money is being misspent or is not being repaid, that source of borrowing dries up and the money has to be produced by the over-burdened taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to put on the record, because I think they have been overlooked, some very crucial figures in relation to foreign borrowing which may help to convince some optimists that Fianna Fáil have taken an unacceptable risk in deciding to increase the State's borrowing requirement up to 13 per cent.  Between now and 1982, in a period of less than five years, the Government will have to repay on the basis of December 1977 figures foreign <Col N="707" /> debt to the tune of £741 million.  In less than three years the Government will have to repay £375 million.  In respect of State-sponsored bodies guaranteed by the Government £166 million will have to be repaid in less than five years, £27 million in less than three years.</P>
    <P>The State-sponsored bodies will have to repay £166 million in less than five years and £27 million in less than three years.  That is £907 million in under five years.  That is not chicken feed; that is an immense amount of hard cash and the only source for it will be taxation.  The cost of the increase in the size of the public service, the nominal increase in rates of pay in the public service and the repayment of the debt, not to talk about the interest and other outgoings will far exceed any possible growth in revenue, particularly if the growth in the economy is for five years only the 7 per cent which Fianna Fáil say they are striving to attain. I am prepared to stake my reputation by saying that they will not attain it, in each year in a period of five years. It has never been done and it will certainly not be done on borrowed money and improvident expenditures.</P>
    <P>During the recession there were a number of European countries which were the envy not merely of European countries but of others because they were able to maintain their economies in what appeared to be a healthy state and they maintained employment. Offhand, I think of Sweden and Austria.  Now, while other countries have climbed out of the economic mire of the recession, Sweden and Austria are in it.  There are certain inescapable economic laws and economic phantoms, which must be respected. When people fail to respect economic reality it may be pleasant for a while but a frightful price must be paid in the long run.</P>
    <P>We will have to make these substantial repayments in foreign money when our balance of payments deficit will be enormous.  The very policy that the Government have embarked upon on the admission of the Minister for Finance himself, necessitates enormous deficits in the balance of <Col N="708" /> trade.  It is not so long since this country had to take unpalatable economic and financial measures under different Governments to deal with balance of payments problems.  Some people think those days will never return.  That is folly.  Five years ago there was hardly any respected economist who would have anticipated that the world would be plunged into the recession which it experienced over the last few years.  In the view of the optimists the world had for all time been saved by the prophet Keynes.  Keynes' views were right in the thirties and after the war but they were not able to cope with the problems that arose in the last few years.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest mistakes of this century, was to allow many countries to be run by pure economists and too few by political economists.  Political economy was often regarded in recent times as an imperfect, inaccurate, and almost unacceptable science.  The statisticians and the pure economists took over and they ignored man's innate nature and ambition, his disinclination to pursue wise courses or to change his ways.  The combination of political, social and economic factors makes nonsense of mere statistical economics.  I have the greatest fear that the politically cynical people who produced this ill-conceived budget have been offered false comfort by one or two people with a reputation for being economically scientific.</P>
    <P>Even with a growth rate of say 10 per cent this year, we would still be faced with enormous taxation.  God knows people have expressed their opposition to the existing levels of taxation.  Whatever happens they will certainly be faced with higher taxation in the future to pay for this year's bonanza.  There will also be a pre-emption of other necessary Government expenditure.  Government expenditure will have to grow considerably in any case to provide no more than existing standards of education, of health services, social welfare and public services, without any improvement, simply to cater for a larger population.  That is a reality.  With that reality it is irresponsible for the Government to create the view that <Col N="709" /> money can be provided in response to every demand that is made; even worse, to actually throw money at people when they never expected it and never asked for it&mdash;and I refer to the relief in car taxation, a clever political gimmick, a piece of incontro-vertible evidence that Fianna Fáil succumbed to the temptation to be politically popular.  The motor taxation money if invested could provide real jobs, that money could provide plant and erect the buildings to house it.  That money could provide schools, hospitals and roads but that money has been dissipated.  It is certainly not an indication that there is any consistency in the alleged plan of Fianna Fáil. Perhaps it is not surprising that these inconsistencies exist.</P>
    <P>The Government have published a White Paper on economic planning and this will be followed by a Green Paper to explain the White Paper.  This clearly shows that they are standing on their heads.  I have never before known a country where people published a white paper before a green one.  It is always the reverse.  The green is the discussion document and the white is the consolidation of ideas after discussions have taken place on the green paper.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was not listening.  We have the final document first and the preliminary document will come next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the Government are budgeting for a considerable rise in revenue, a rise of about 18 per cent. When we were in Government we had <Col N="710" /> considerable rises in revenue at existing tax rates, leaving aside the question of any adjustment of taxes in the budget. On the pre-budget figure the Government are anticipating a rise of 18 per cent in revenue.  That will not be obtained unless the rate of inflation is higher than the rate the Government are telling the trade unions it is going to be.  The massive rises in revenue in recent years across the world were, in most cases, attributable to inflation.  Countries which had worse recession than ours, where the growth rate fell by as much as 4 per cent, 6 per cent and 9 per cent, still had rises in revenue because of inflation. Prices and value-added tax, which is a proportion of prices, naturally and automatically increased revenue.  The figure that is built into this year's Estimates may not be achieved unless inflation rises further than Fianna Fáil are anticipating.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to some of the specific provisions of the budget. I am not going to reopen at this stage the debate on wealth tax.  The justification for wealth tax to replace death duties has been spelt out in considerable detail by myself and my colleagues in Government and we stand over everything we said.  In opening that debate I forecast that those who attempted to introduce wealth tax would be villified in a most irresponsible manner by some people who were unwilling to pay a fair share of the cost of running the country.  In that respect I have been justified.  Because of persistent allegations that the wealth tax would lead to a movement of money out of the country I arranged for daily and weekly monitoring by the Central Bank of money movements.  As Minister for Finance I received from the Central Bank information that there was no evidence to relate money movements to the introduction of wealth tax here.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in the years after the introduction of the wealth tax there was an unprecedented movement of money inwards to Ireland.  There is no such evidence at present that there is a massive money movement into Ireland or a movement of money into Government stocks.  Last year the average <Col N="711" /> monthly Government borrowing was £38 million.  This year&mdash;we are now at 7 February&mdash;the Government have had to hand back nearly £60 million. The Government are not borrowing at present on the home market.  What can be said now about confidence in Government and Government policies? Fianna Fáil say that there was some evidence of outward movement of money.  I ask now that that evidence be put on the record of the House giving names and amounts.  Perhaps some Fianna Fáil friends, subscribers and supporters shifted their money. We would like to know about it.  Of course, we are aware that at all times there are certain undesirable people who will shift funds abroad to avoid their responsibilities or to conceal that they made the money on which no tax was paid.  Indeed, some of those people are wanted by the police and the bankruptcy courts.  Let us hear who they are.</P>
    <P>We are told now that these people are going to come back.  I want to pose this question: what kind of people are they?  Will this country benefit to any great extent if these would-be welchers decide to return to our shore?  Have they got sufficient altruism and loyalty to their fellow Irish men and women to invest that money here to provide jobs and improve this country?  When, belatedly, Ireland introduced a mild capital tax decades after every progressive country worth its salt had introduced wealth tax we are told some ran like scalded cats to Lichtenstein or some unpronouncable tax havens abroad. One does not build a sound economy on hot money, on shifting sands or tax evasion.  One will not have a contented society if the small person feels that the tax system is grinding him and letting the better off go scot-free.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that the £10 million lost by the abolition of wealth tax is, to use a phrase of the late President Childers, nugatory revenue.  I should like to indicate how important it is that every £1 million this State can collect on a fair tax is collected.  The alternative is that the money must be collected from somebody else.  Deputy Colley has given clear and fair warning <Col N="712" />&mdash;it could be called a threat; that if his wishes on pay are not met in all respects he is going to come back to this House later this year with a supplementary budget.  To get £10 million in revenue from the old reliables as they are called would involve a tax of 6p on a packet of 20 cigarettes.  Is it justified in order to get rid of wealth tax to replace it with 6p on 20 cigarettes?  By putting 3p on a pint of beer £10 million could also be collected or 8p on a glass of spirits would collect that amount. When, as inevitably he will this year or later, the Minister for Finance and the Fianna Fáil Government come into this House to collect additional revenue, the people of Ireland will recall that at least some of the additional tax being imposed on them need not have been imposed if wealth tax had not been abolished.</P>
    <P>This country has done extremely well with wealth tax since it was introduced. We have the fastest growth rate in the EEC and our unemployment did not increase by the same amount as it did in other countries. We did not suffer a recession as severe as other countries did and we have had the highest rate of investment in the EEC in 1976 and 1977, not much of an indication of a flow of money out of the country.  I feel sure that we could have delayed the abolition of the wealth tax for at least one year, if it had to be abolished at all.  That would have enabled the Government to give the old age pension to people of 65 years of age this year, a reasonable and humane thing to do and something which even in Fianna Fáil economic thinking would benefit the economy.  If people of 65 years of age got the old age pension they would spend it.  It would generate demand and jobs in Ireland.  It would also help to improve the economy.  I am not so certain that those who are saved £10 million on wealth tax will be spending that money in Ireland, if at all, in 1978.  The probability is that they will not.</P>
    <P>A gift has been given to comparatively few and it will not benefit the economy.  It was wholly unnecessary and it makes it very difficult for trade union leaders to get acceptance of the Government's package of inadequate <Col N="713" /> social welfare benefits and a 5 per cent limit on the wages front.  An economy is not run on financial statistics alone. It involves the thinking and the co-operation of the people and if one gets the national psychology wrong or if one provokes or annoys people one will not get from them the response which the Government are seeking.  It cannot be done and those who overlook the essential truth of political economy have had to pay a very dear price for it.</P>
    <P>When in office we were approached on many occasions to abolish VAT on newspapers.  I may as well admit, because I have said it to the people who approached me, that I was well disposed towards the idea.  I never savoured a tax on knowledge, but when we went into office we had a lot more than tax on knowledge.  We had tax on food, clothes, shoes and on the very essentials of life.  We abolished those taxes. I believe we were right to do so.  So, having done so much good and having also an immense problem because of the world recession, we had to postpone other adjustments in the tax system which I believe would have been merited when circumstances were more or less right again.</P>
    <P>Our economy is in a healthier state again.  It has its difficulties, unemployment the greatest of them all.  I believe in this year, when considerable tax concessions were being given, the Government ought to have abolished VAT on newspapers.  That would have been the right thing to do.  The Government have suggested, even if some of their policies are not exactly right, that they were in honour bound to discharge their pre-election promises.  I believe the abolition of VAT on newspapers was a pre-election promise.  It has not been honoured.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I did not have the opportunity of doing it when in office.  It was certainly on the top of our priorities last year, but the particular budget we produced was of benefit to every section of the community including newspapers because of the special incentives we gave in it.  I believe that VAT on newspapers should have been abolished this year. <Col N="714" /> I believe it was much more important to abolish VAT on newspapers than to provide duty free booze, tobacco and perfume for passengers crossing the Irish sea.  I do not begrudge the concession to the beneficiaries, many of the most frequent travellers travel on expense accounts, and they will be the main beneficiaries of the introduction of duty free facilities on cross-channel traffic.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a big issue of this but I believe that, if tax relief had to be given, newspapers should have got the assistance and not either the occasional passenger across the Irish Sea or the person who travels frequently.  I do not accept the utterly puerile and demonstrably false argument that the abolition of tax on limited liquor and tobacco sales on planes or boats will increase tourist traffic to Ireland.  If that be true it will also increase the amount of tourists going from Ireland to England.  In the middle of winter the big drive to collect tourists starts on the Sunday after Christmas when all the popular papers in England, television and radio advertise holidays in the sun and everybody thinks how glorious it would be to get away to the sun and they look at the holiday brochures.  I suppose a holiday at home or abroad, is probably in the region of £150 and upwards.  They will have other expenditure so that probably they cannot have a holiday of ten or 14 days for anything less than £200 a person, an expenditure of £400 for a couple.  Is it now being seriously suggested that such people might exchange Majorca for Ireland because they can save about £4 or £6 on liquor or tobacco they might buy on travelling to Ireland? It is completely ludicrous.  It will certainly increase the profits or reduce the losses of the air companies and the shipping lines.</P>
    <P>I am not saving that it is wrong.  I believe that it is a desirable thing, but there are many worthy things the Minister for Finance is called on to do and he ought to do them according to some worth-while list of priorities. He decided in pursuit of popularity to indulge in the gimmick which will be applauded by many people and which I will avail of if and when the opportunity <Col N="715" /> offers.  I would not consider it to be all that urgent.  I would prefer, as most other people would prefer, the removal of a tax on knowledge before the removal of tax on booze and cigarettes.  Maybe it was done as a slap in the face to the Minister for Health, Deputy Haughey, who has turned over a couple of new leaves and is encouraging us all to do the same as himself. I find it amusing to hear the Minister for Health in almost every public utterance say that he has given up booze and cigarettes.  I have a little check list.</P>

I will not delay any longer on this.  I have got a little check list and I will be watching further statements from all members of the Government regarding improvement in their consumption and behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Government, notwithstanding the extremely difficult times which were there then, we made very bold strides in increasing the amount of aid to the developing world.  We inherited a disgracefully inadequate budget for poor countries of the world.  We stepped it up very dramatically.  We were very disappointed we had not done more but we entered into a pledge, not merely domestically but internationally, to bring Ireland's contribution to the Third World up to the levels which were recommended by international organisations.  We were, taking one year with another, making very rapid progress towards that.  Our opponents announced that they would go one better.  They gave very specific undertakings to people in Ireland concerned with the Third World, that when returned to office they would dramatically <Col N="716" /> increase the amount of aid to developing countries.  In respect of 1978, the Fianna Fáil Party through their then shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is now Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Kennedy, entered into a commitment to pay £19 million for development aid.  The amount being paid is only £9,500,000. His Lordship the Bishop of Galway, to use his own colourful language, wanted to know what the hell the Government were doing.  I would not like to use such unparliamentary language without attributing it to its proper source.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if the Bishop uses unparliamentary language I do not think we should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  The Government know well what they are doing.  They calculate that there is no electoral advantage in Ireland, any political mileage in Ireland, in increasing aid to the developing world.  They prefer to use the money that ought to be going to the developing world to have cheaper booze, cigarettes and perfume on passenger movement across the Irish Sea or to let it go in abolition of wealth tax.  That is a strange order of priority and entirely wrong.</P>
      <P>I have spoken on development aid in this House previously and I do not want to dwell on it at any great length now.  Being fortunate enough to be in the league of the better-off countries of the world, we have a clear obligation to distribute at least something worth-while from ourselves to the starving millions in the world.  We have little hope of persuading other countries with a similar obligation to make a large contribution unless we practise what we preach.  The USA and the Federal Republic of Germany are not near the recommended level of development aid, and it is unacceptable for us to be encouraging them, who have certainly considerable ability to give aid more generously, to do so if we fail to give sufficient aid.  I hope, therefore, that the Government will have second thoughts about the matter and treat development aid as it deserves to be treated, as a top priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a selfish reason why <Col N="717" /> development aid should be increased, not only by ourselves but also by the whole developed world.  Thousands of millions of people in this world are hungry, ignorant, unclothed, with no prospects of acceptable standards of living, in despair, the most that some of them can look forward to being the prospect of a comparatively early death to free them from their misery. Unless we channel more funds to such people they are not going to be able to purchase the goods and services that the developed world can produce. Parts of the world are developing very fast and are now becoming rivals of ours both for home markets, and for markets abroad to which we would like to export.  Elsewhere hundreds of millions are still unable to purchase from anybody and will never be able to do so unless there is a magnanimous and very deliberate channeling of resources from countries such as ours towards the developing world.  If altruistic and generous motivation does not interest the Government, I hope they will see the economic sense in what I am saying.  It makes a lot more economic sense that what the Government have produced in their budget.</P>
    <P>There will be no future for us as a country if we remain a debt-ridden society.  We need to reduce drastically the amount of Government borrowing. I argued that in Government and our green paper and our white paper argued the same.  Fianna Fáil did not disagree with that argument, they wholly endorsed it.  Therefore, I find it impossible to understand why at this time they should have rejected the very good advice they had received from us and which they themselves endorsed again and again.  They have done it at a time when we have the fastest growing gross domestic product in the Community and when we also have the biggest rate of borrowing in the Community.  When Ireland received from the EEC a loan some years ago at a favourable rate of interest we accepted as a condition of that loan that we would reduce the Government's borrowing as a percentage of GDP.  We gave that under-taking because, even before the loan had been approved and the conditions set, I on behalf of the Government of <Col N="718" /> Ireland had announced here to the Dáil, the country and the world our intention to reduce the level of borrowing. I doubt very much if there has ever been such a total disregard of a solemn commitment entered into by a Government on behalf of a nation as we are witnessing now in the Government's behaving in such a way as to convince the EEC that conditions which are imposed on us in relation to aid which we receive from them will not be honoured.</P>
    <P>I do not want to mention another European country although any person who is aware what happens in the world money markets and in the world economy will know the country to which I refer.  Another country in Europe received from the Community a very substantial loan and other assistance some years ago but failed to fulfil the obligations which were attached to the assistance then given. As a result of failing to observe the conditions&mdash;which were no more than guidelines of economic wisdom&mdash;they had to return to the Community seeking further aid because they were <i>in extremis.</i>  Then the Community said, &ldquo;You failed on the last occasion to fulfil the obligations which you accepted at that time as a condition of getting aid; therefore, before you get aid on this occasion we are going to fix the level of your budget&rdquo;, and that is exactly what happened.  The European Community set out in figures the precise amount which that Government could spend on current services and on capital.  They also specified the precise expenditure cuts which that Government would have to make.</P>
    <P>That is the peril we now face because we have wantonly breached a condition which attached to our EEC loan.  We are now in a position that when, as I believe is inevitable, we have to go to the European Community or elsewhere seeking aid, we will have our future economic, political and social policies fixed for us by other agencies.  Perhaps I should mention the name of the country to which I referred because it is world public knowledge.  It was Italy who got themselves into that difficulty and <Col N="719" /> they have not extricated themselves from it yet.  We have also seen what happened in Britain when they failed to follow the path of economic wisdom.  They had to receive help from the International Monetary Fund and accept the unpleasant measures which the International Monetary Fund laid down as a condition for advancing money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Community and the International Monetary Fund I am sure took no joy in laying down such specific obligations on the Governments of Italy and Britain, but they had to do it in order to protect the funds they were giving the countries which had behaved in an economically unwise manner.  The same unpleasant future is facing this country.  The sovereignty which we worked so hard to achieve and for which people have made such tremendous sacrifices before we received it, and since we received it to maintain it, is now being seriously jeopardised by a party who like to call themselves republican and nationalist.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that abstract political independence is worth much. Political independence is worth something only if you use it to give your-self freedom to determine the course of your economy and to determine how you will distribute what you produce&mdash;in other words to run your country as you want to run it.  That right is now in jeopardy.  Fianna Fáil and the country will have to pay for the mess of pottage which was their manifesto.  I believe that to be too high price to pay and that the country will be regretting it for many years come.  The Irish people are very generous.  They are usually ready to give a fool's pardon to a gambler who loses his own money.  However, I do not believe they will be ready to give a fool's pardon or any pardon to the Government, or to any gambler who gambles with the people's money.  That what Fianna Fáil have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One newspaper referred to Deputy Colley in three-inch letters as &ldquo;Gambler <Col N="720" /> George&rdquo;.  As Gambler George sits on the throne today I believe the very policies which he has introduced will dethrone him sooner or later.  I am convinced that economic realities will dethrone him long before the people will get an opportunity to do so in an election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this budget is an investment on the part of the Government which will give the maximum incentive to private enterprise to create much needed jobs, to expand the public sector and to give overdue tax concessions and relief to wage and salary earners.  Its aim is to give a real increase to social welfare groups and their dependants.  It restores the concept of planning the economic development of the country after the absence of such planning in the past four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we came back to power last June nobody doubted that the economy was in a poor state of health.  Listening to many of the Opposition speakers one would be pardoned for thinking that at the time of the general election last year the economy was thriving, that they had done everything possible to put it on the right road.  The recipe of the Coalition at that time was to <Col N="721" /> leave the economy alone in the hope that it would right itself.  But Fianna Fáil knew then as they know today&mdash; so did the Irish people who voted so overwhelmingly for Fianna Fáil&mdash;that the economy required a major operation if it were to be restored to reasonable health.</P>
    <P>We have set about restoring economic health and the dignity and self-respect of the nation by stimulating growth in every facet of the economy. The road to progress has been charted and it is clear and unmistakable. If we believe in the Irish people's capability to deal with the problems that confront them we must have an expansionary budget to provide the incentives for maximum effort by all sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>It has been known since last May what Fianna Fáil's budget strategy would be.  The social partners to wage agreements had the advantage of knowing this in the past six months and yet we had the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy FitzGerald, coming into the House to say that the budget would infuriate the trade unions and that it would wreck the proposed national wage agreement.  They were strong words uttered in order to bring about the destruction of the pay talks.  It ill becomes a leader of the Fine Gael to indicate that he wanted the talks to collapse.  It demonstrates the hopelessness that grips Fine Gael and it shows that they are scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Deputy FitzGerald underestimates the trade unions, the employer organisations and the ordinary people of the country if he does not appreciate that they will see the beneficial effects on their incomes and on the prospects of job opportunities for their children being provided in the budget.</P>
    <P>I do not want to pre-empt the pay talks, but the indications are that there will be agreement.  The gap between the parties has been narrowed and we can look forward in the next few weeks to a satisfactory agreement.  The workers suffered too much in the past four years not to recognise a real increase in their standard of living through the abolition of rates and car tax, which incidentally I interpreted Deputy Richie Ryan as indicating he <Col N="722" /> would restore if, God forbid, he got back to power.  The workers will know that the dramatic increase in tax-free allowances will be helpful to them in restoring a standard of living which had been gradually depreciated in the past four or five years.</P>
    <P>Comment was made that the fact that the Minister for Finance said that the extra percentage above 5 per cent which might be awarded in the national pay agreement would be clawed back would damage the prospects of a new agreement being reached.  I want to show what has been the consistent position down through the years.  As Minister for Finance last year, Deputy Ryan in his budget speech on 26 January, referring to the necessity to moderate incomes, linked this with the tax concessions and employment projects which he offered at that time and said:</P>
    <P>I must make it quite clear here and now that the implementation of these plans is contingent upon the ratification of the proposals for the new national wage agreement.  In the event of non-ratification, it would unfortunately not be possible to maintain the revenue-losing tax reliefs or to spend the £56 million on new job creation.</P>
    <P>In a further passage he said:</P>
    <P>Because of the limitation on resources, this expenditure depends upon the ratification of the proposals for a new national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>Later he said:</P>
    <P>Any further increase in public service pay would necessitate the imposition of extra taxation and would be harmful to the interests of the nation.</P>
    <P>I accept what Deputy Ryan then said, and I accept that the Minister for Finance was right last week when he clearly indicated to the social partners the necessity for wage moderation in order to combat inflation and keep down rising prices which in turn will protect existing jobs and be instrumental in creating more new jobs for the many young people and others who are waiting for them.  Last year Fianna Fáil did not say that Deputy Ryan's strictures would wreck the <Col N="723" /> national pay talks.  A responsible Opposition, and a potential leader, should realise that income moderation is a prerequisite to getting down inflation and getting the country going.  A statement like that, calculated to do the utmost damage to this necessary development, could only come from a politically bankrupt party.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of criticism about the provision made in the budget for the employment of young people. Members of the Opposition speak as if the position for young people was fine last June, as if there were ample opportunities for young people, as if we inherited a situation where everything was fine.  There were thousands of young people waiting for jobs in 1977.  There were 117,000 unemployed. The 1977 budget was the last occasion on which we could judge the thinking of the National Coalition in relation to the provision of jobs for young people.  In the Budget Statement Deputy, then Minister, Ryan said that provision would also be made for the employment of young people in desirable community works that would not otherwise be undertaken in the normal way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the extent to which the National Coalition were prepared to go to meet the job requirements of a growing population of young people.  The embargo on recruitment to the civil service, which in 1975 and 1976 saw a measly 1 per cent increase to the civil service compared to a 5 and 6 per cent increase in previous years, has been lifted.  Provision has been made for 11,250 jobs in the public service, including teachers, gardaí, workers for telephone development, for the Revenue Commissioners, the health service and county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the construction apprentice scheme which has been launched by county councils.  I would like to see this scheme developed and expanded by the county councils into other trades.  Young people will benefit from the expansion in the building <Col N="724" /> and construction industry.  Five million pounds has been provided for youth employment schemes.  Provision has been made for an increase in the intake to AnCO of over 3,000 and there has been an increase in employment premiums from £10 to £14 for school leavers.  All of these measures will help to relieve unemployment.</P>
    <P>I have outlined some of the concrete steps we are taking to provide jobs.  At present there is a backlog of work in the Land Registry.  More agricultural instructors for the county committees of agriculture are needed. More grant inspectors under the farm modernisation scheme are needed to help accelerate agricultural development. More teachers are needed to reduce the pupil/teacher ratio in schools and more people are needed in the security areas.  Allowing for all the work that can be done in the public service not enough jobs will be created without reliance on the public sector.  The public sector can provide full-time employment for our well-educated young people.  Industry will have to be discouraged from installing labour saving equipment, instead they should be encouraged to expand and employ extra people where possible. These are some of our proposals.  We do not have all the answers. We are open to suggestion.  We will welcome and implement any worth-while suggestions from the Fine Gael or Labour Parties.  Our obligations to the young people transcend any political gain.  Their future is our future.  So far we have got no suggestions or concrete proposals from the Fine Gael or Labour Parties in relation to employment for young people.  They ridicule and condemn what we are doing but they have not put forward one single proposal which would increase employment.</P>
    <P>Listening to the former Minister for Finance, who spoke just before me, I felt that the Coalition have learnt nothing from the election of last year. Prophesies of doom and gloomy talk about the problems which lie ahead were foremost in what Deputy Ryan said in his speech.  Reference was made by Deputy Ryan and others to the amount of money that had to be borrowed under the provisions of this <Col N="725" /> budget.  This attitude of the Coalition in relation to problems ahead dominated their period in office and sapped the confidence of the people.  They consistently painted a picture of gloom, and only coming up to the general election last June did the picture change.  It was not a Fianna Fáil man who said that we have as little control over the economic destiny of the country as a cork in the ocean.  That gloomy talk, the despondency and the hopelessness that paralysed the Coalition Government in their term in office demoralised the people, hampered expansion and ran down the economy. The restoration of that confidence by Fianna Fáil is a step forward.  We face problems and we can try to overcome them.  In the past six months a fair degree of confidence was restored. At the end of 1957 a former Minister for Local Government and Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Paddy Smith of Cavan, was asked why was it possible after a couple of months in office for Fianna Fáil to pay out housing grants which lay on the table of the Coalition Government and could not be paid.  He said that the answer was one word&mdash;&ldquo;confidence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The rate of borrowing is a serious matter.  The percentage of borrowing of GNP in 1975 was 16.9 per cent under the National Coalition Government. The following year it was 11.5 per cent and last year it was 11 per cent.  That was the level of borrowing, the percentage of GNP, in years when unemployment was rising.  The impact of the additional money which the Coalition got at the time was not sufficient to get the country over the hurdle.  We are asking that an additional 2 per cent of gross national product be borrowed.  On the basis of National Coalition thinking borrowing this year would be of the order of £700 million and our borrowing is approximately £100 million more.  We are borrowing this money on behalf of the Irish people so that we can provide incentive for expansion&mdash;with an element of risk no doubt&mdash;to see if we can find the jobs to get the economy really moving.</P>
    <P>We are borrowing £100 million more than the National Coalition would <Col N="726" /> borrow if in power, so presumably they would cut back some of our proposals.  Wealth tax would be restored which would give them £8 million.  On the basis of what Deputy Ryan said it is likely that car tax would come back.  They did not agree with the abolition in full of rates on domestic dwellings and so, we may take it that if they were in power part of this would be back.  These concessions were made to keep down inflation even though the Coalition represent them as promises so that the people would vote for us.  We argue that when these indirect benefits are given to the people there will be more moderation in the demand for increased incomes.  Consequently inflation will be kept down and the evidence of that is there to be seen.</P>
    <P>The building and construction industry was one of the worst hit in the past four or five years.  It has a new lease of life since June 1977.  In this industry, the second greatest in the country, in recent months from drawing boards to building sites there is evidence of new growth.  The introduction of the £1,000 new house grant and reconstruction grants, the increase in SDA loans from £4,500 to £7,000 and the increase in the income limit to £3,000 have all contributed to the impetus in building activities.  The business incentives in this budget will also make a contribution to ensuring that the number employed in that industry by the end of 1978 will be 10,000 greater than in the spring of 1977.</P>
    <P>All of us want to see developments in hospitals and schools and in roads and much more money must be spent in these areas.  We trail behind our European partners as regards our road network and we must spend more on it.  Communications need to be improved.  Water and sewerage schemes must be accelerated so that we shall have a pool of land to keep up the thrust in the building industry. These are the veins of life for our future progress.</P>
    <P>Perhaps only in the area of social welfare can I agree with my Opposition colleagues in that enough is not being done for old age pensioners.  No <Col N="727" /> Government has yet done enough for the old aged and infirm.  The only real way to ensure that they can have a true increase in their standard of living is to widen and strengthen the base of the economy so that additional innovative schemes can be introduced to help these classes.  Much play has been made in this debate to suggest that the 10 per cent granted by the Government&mdash;I admit I should like to see more given&mdash;is not anything like the increase which the previous administration gave to the social welfare groups.  I have a table here which indicates that while the percentage increases granted by the Coalition were greater than 10 per cent in most cases they did not amount to any significant real increase for these classes.  In 1973 the non-contributory old age pension was £293.  In 1974 it was increased to £349.70, an increase of 19 per cent.  The inflation rate in 1974 was 17 per cent.  Unemployment assistance for 1973 was £252 and it was increased to £304, an increase of 3 per cent.  The old age contributory pension was increased from £348 to £408, an increase of .1 per cent. Unemployment benefit flat rate was increased from £314 to £372, a percentage increase of 18.2 but with inflation of 17 per cent, in real terms it was only an increase of 1.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the percentage increase over 1974 was 27.5 but the inflation rate that year was 22 per cent.  In 1976 the increase over 1975 was 18.2 per cent but the inflation rate was 18 per cent.  In 1977 the increase over 1976 was 15 per cent and the inflation rate 13.8 per cent.  From this we can see that while the percentage increases granted to the social welfare classes in those years were greater than what is offered in the present budget the inflation in those years completely eroded any real benefits.  Hopefully the 10 per cent this year will give the social welfare recipients a real increase in their standard of living and we can look forward to an improving standard for them in the future if the economy develops as we hope it will.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases, the free rentals for War of Independence veterans <Col N="728" /> and free travel in their own right for spouses of veterans.  I am delighted that capitation grants to schools for the mentally handicapped have been increased. Nothing is too much for these schools, the sisters and other people who work for the mentally handicapped. They show boundless interest and devotion and we are indebted to them as a community and anything we can do to help should be done.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made about children's allowances not being increased. We should like to see them increased but not too long ago the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, was thinking of abolishing them completely.  Hopefully, we shall have increases in children's allowances in future years.</P>
    <P>In the case of agriculture, unlike oil or gas, it is an industry with continuing capacity for expansion. Each year we can take more out of agriculture, expand it more and still expand it in the following year and take more from it.  Sometimes people do not realise the real potential of agricultural development.  The capacity of a five-year agricultural programme to provide more jobs, reduce the balance of payments deficit and increase the prosperity of farmers in the service areas through agriculture and to expand the food processing industry is immeasurable.  Therefore, any tax system must be designed to encourage the maximum farm output.  Otherwise, the incentive effort would be counter-productive.</P>
    <P>Farmers accept that they must pay their fair share towards the running of the economy but they are anxious that consideration be given to the uncertainties of farming&mdash;for example, weather conditions, animal diseases, markets and so on.  There has been created the impression that farmers have amassed enormous wealth in recent times.  For the majority of farmers standards of living have increased since our accession to the EEC.  Many farmers can now afford facilities and can afford to develop their farms and their homes to an extent that would not have been thought possible ten or 20 years ago. But these improvements have been made against a very poor background. <Col N="729" /> One asks how the farmer with the brucellosis herd or with the TB reactor herd has fared.  What has been the position of farmers with broken and disjointed holdings that were incapable of being managed well?  Farming is a business that requires heavy investment, but the return on the investment is slow and not comparable with many other business enterprises.  While the rates of increases in incomes have increased dramatically, the cost of inputs such as fertilisers, machinery and service costs as well as farm building costs have doubled in the past four years.</P>
    <P>I am a little disappointed that the Government have not set out in the budget to expand and create a better climate in which more of our farmers could be brought up to their full potential.  Our cattle population is about seven million and I have little doubt that with more use of fertiliser, more reclamation of land and with better farm management generally we could expand that population to more than ten million within four or five years.  To this end, too, better winter facilities for cattle are needed.</P>
    <P>The development of the co-operative enterprise and of the food-processing industries as well as the creation of additional jobs would ensure that agriculture could play a greater part in the real wealth of the country.  We must make every effort to process fully our agricultural goods.  We must strengthen our arm in the market place all over the world, because we export the bulk of what is produced on our farms. We must be imaginative in discovering by-products and in stimulating every industry into ensuring that non-processed agricultural products are not exported which could be reimported as manufactured goods.  Such a situation would deny us the opportunity of creating further employment in this sector.</P>
    <P>The proposals in respect of the taxation of farmers show enlightened changes from those put forward in the 1977 budget when the multiplier was increased from 40 to 65 on the notional system.  That was an increase of 60 per cent.  The increase this year in the multiplier from 65 to 90 represents an increase of 37 per cent.  The <Col N="730" /> real difference is in respect of tax-free allowances.  In last year's budget the then Minister for Finance said that deductions would be allowed only in respect of the normal personal reliefs, that the proposed multiplier of 65 took account of that and that, in order to simplify and expedite assessment, wages, contractor's fees and depreciation would not be allowed as deductions under the notional system.  He said the proposals were designed to yield £35 million.</P>
    <P>In this budget the aim is to collect £24 million from 22,000 farmers.  Consequently, the situation is that, despite the bringing into the tax net of an additional 7,000 farmers, the yield aimed for is £9 million less than that forecast in last year's budget.  Subsequently, however, the then Minister, faced with opposition not only from Fianna Fáil but from his own back-benchers, decided to allow wages as being deductible for tax purposes on the notional basis; but despite repeated requests from the various farming organisations rates were not allowed to be deducted for this purpose.  In addition to allowing rates to be deducted for income tax purposes on the notional system Fianna Fáil have included also contractor's fees.  In addition farmers are to be compensated for VAT borne by them in respect of machinery and other inputs.</P>
    <P>I fear, though, that the abolition of the agricultural grants for the purposes of rates will mean hardship to some categories of farmers who under the accounts system are not eligible because of incapacity to farm well and who therefore cannot write off the rates against their income tax.  Perhaps the Minister would consider some measure that would alleviate hardship caused in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Unless farmers are made aware of what the multiplier will be for a three-year period I expect that it will be very difficult to get agreement from them regarding their opting for a three-year period under either the notional or the accounts system, because the absence of knowledge regarding the multiplier brings an unknown quantity into the question of farm tax.  If the three-year obligation must stand, the multiplier too should <Col N="731" /> stand for that period.  Having said that, I believe a reasonable balance has been struck between the various categories of farmers.  We have not heard yet what the National Coalition would propose in this regard.  I challenge them to let us have their proposals.  Would they reduce the threshold from £75 to £60, or is it more likely that the Labour Party influence would be exerted to such an extent that valuations would not be considered relevant for the purposes of farm tax?</P>
    <P>There are certain trends in agriculture of which the Government should take cognisance and on which they should take action.  I refer first to the astronomical prices being paid for land with the result that very many small farmers are no longer able to go into the market place to purchase the additional land they require in order to make their holdings viable.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, to consider ways and means of restricting the purchase of land by very large land owners and other non-farming people in order to ensure that there is a pool of land available which can be purchased by small and developing farmers who, without some aid of this kind, will be unable to see any prospects of enlarging their holdings.</P>
    <P>This budget will provide a solid foundation on which to build a prosperous future.  In order to achieve a lasting improvement in our economic fortunes we as a community must be united in purpose.  The extent to which the business community, commercial enterprise, farmers and workers grasp these opportunities will determine how we find the extra jobs for our young people.  As a party we have aimed high because we have confidence in our people to reach the national goal.  The answer can never be given by the Government alone. The tax incentives provided in this budget and the other benefits which will ensure greater profitability for most enterprises must bring about the production of self-sustaining jobs for young people.</P>
    <P>All of us must be more conscious <Col N="732" /> of the necessity to buy Irish goods. Every housewife going into the shops must remember that every time she purchases imported goods in preference to Irish goods she is affecting the employment opportunities of her sons and daughters or her neighbours.  The &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign must be revamped and we must ensure that the maximum amount of Irish goods will be purchased in our shops.  Otherwise the extra money generated by this budget could be spent on the purchase of imported goods and that would not be in our interest.</P>
    <P>We must act responsibly in relation to wage restraint.  The more that is paid to those in existing jobs the less money we have to provide new jobs.  We have the capacity, the drive and the will and for the sake of the country we cannot afford to fail.  This budget puts into the background the gloom and doom generated by Coalition inefficiency and I hope that by the time 1979 comes around they, too, will have learned a lesson from the capacity of the Irish people.  When given the opportunity, the Irish people can move forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the speakers on the Government side have said that this is the best budget ever introduced.  It is my honest opinion that it is one of the worst budgets ever introduced, if not the worst.  I say that in all seriousness and sincerity and I will try in as short a time as possible to explain why I have come to that conclusion.  We are told by the Government side and by the Minister for Finance that the principal problem facing the nation is the creation of new jobs and the solving of the unemployment problem.  I agree with that assessment of the situation.  The principal task is the creation of new jobs and the putting of our people to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this budget I can see no signs of any appreciable number of new jobs. The Minister has said openly that he relies on private enterprise to provide those jobs.  During the decade which Fianna Fáil like to refer to as the swinging sixties we had a great increase in output and in profits for the rich but there was not any increase <Col N="733" /> in the numbers employed.  There were fewer people employed at the end of that decade than there were at the beginning.  Through the years private enterprise has proved that increased productivity and profits do not mean an increase in the number of jobs.  The amount of IDA investment spent on machinery has increased ten and twenty fold.  In my own town there was a large investment which resulted in just 30 jobs.  I want to warn that increased production and increased availability of capital in many instances mean a reduction in the numbers employed.  I am not blaming private enterprise for that.  I know they must produce their goods efficiently and cheaply.  They are in it for profit. The Minister is relying on them to change that and to employ men even at the sacrifice of profitability.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not a guarantee that the extra money he is making available to the private sector will be used for the creation of jobs, and our past history makes that very doubtful indeed.  We are told that many jobs are to be provided in the civil service, but I can say that the 2,000 jobs in the Department of Health were provided for in the 1977 budget.  That fact cannot be denied.  These are the kinds of jobs promised in this budget and I have serious doubts about them.</P>
    <P>In order to give this bonanza to private enterprise the Minister is borrowing a sum in the region of £850 million.  This is to be handed out in concessions to the very rich.  In a situation where the Minister is borrowing on the head of every Irish person it is criminal to hand back to the very rich in our society £8.5 million.  That is what they paid last year in wealth tax and I presume it would have been increased this year.  That is what I would have expected.  It is criminal to hand back to people who have property of over £100,000&mdash;and, if they are farmers, the figure would be over £200,000&mdash;£8,500,000.  If one takes the succession tax and the capital gains tax into account the figure is £10 million.  That £10 million is just half what we could afford apparently to spend on social welfare.  The Minister, because of that criminal action, could <Col N="734" /> not afford to reduce the old age pension qualifying age this year and continue a process started by the previous Government.  It would have cost too much, but he had £8 million to £10 million to hand out to the very rich in our society.  This is a rich man's budget.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reliefs in taxation to lower paid workers but what the lower paid worker will get is way below what the man with the higher income will receive.  There is no restriction on profit in the private sector of industry. There is no restriction on what the industrialist may do with that profit. The Minister has no guarantee that he will not spend it at the Curragh races or at some other race meeting.</P>
    <P>Later on in his budget statement the Minister warns workers that if they get more than 5 per cent he will come in here and see that he gets it back.  I would not expect any worker to lie down under a threat like that unless the same threat also related to the employer and to the wealthy.  The Government have shown a complete swing to the Right, a swing towards the big holder of property, deliberately giving him the benefit of some £10 million and just £20 or double that to those who are worst off and helpless. That is a clear indication of a complete swing to the Right.  It is disgraceful. There is no excuse for it.  This is one of the worst, if not the worst, budgets ever introduced here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard two Fianna Fáil Deputies, one being the Minister for Agriculture, expounding on this budget and telling us what hopes they had of creating extra jobs in agriculture.  I come from an area where there are both large and small farmers.  I see no evidence in this budget of the carrying out of the Fianna Fáil promise in the manifesto relative to the processing of food.  There is no evidence of any policy designed to implement that worthwhile aim.  I thoroughly approve of food processing. If this were done it is estimated that 40,000 new jobs would be created.  I am a believer in State enterprise processing our food.</P>
      <P>A vital mistake was made by a previous Fianna Fáil Government when they allowed Erin Foods to run down.  I believe that was a deliberate action on the part of that Government. If Erin Foods and the Sugar Company are not supplied with the necessary raw materials in order to process food, thereby guaranteeing employment, they should be in a position to take land by conacre or buy land, if necessary, to guarantee the supply of raw materials.  I am a firm believer in that.  I do not care whom it offends or whom it does not offend.  Small processing plants should be established all over the country.  There is no attempt in this budget to introduce such a scheme.  That is the scheme that would create the jobs.  This is the only area in which the necessary jobs could be created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our soil is the greatest wealth we have.  It is not being properly husbanded and I believe the Government have no intention of trying to solve our unemployment problem by the establishment of a food processing industry.  I do not believe the job is too big.  I envisage small plants on <Col N="736" /> a co-operative basis with central control and a central marketing agency. There is nothing in the budget to indicate that the Government have any intention of implementing the manifesto promise to process our food. The Minister has given benefits to the wealthy in the hope that they will create jobs.  I hope he will get the response he is looking for, but there is no historical support in regard to that kind of job creation.  Considerable concessions have been made to private enterprise and to the wealthy.  I do not believe these people will respond in the way that is necessary to solve our unemployment problem and provide jobs for our young people and those leaving school in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that private enterprise will create jobs for a long time. The tackling of job creation will have to be done in some other way besides throwing carrots at people and saying, &ldquo;Be good boys now and do this for us&rdquo;.  In all the industries I know, even highly profitable ones, the idea has been to reduce the labour content and create more profits.  I do not blame them for that because they are in business to make profits.  The Minister has given them a further opportunity to continue in that fashion.</P>
    <P>The number of people employed at the end of the sixties, which Fianna Fáil described as the &ldquo;swinging sixties&rdquo; was less than at the beginning of that decade.  Yet with this kind of an offer we are saying to the people who are already working that they must have less in order to create jobs, that their standard of living must be lowered by at least 5 per cent in order to create jobs, but their bosses will have more profit and they can spend it where they like, at the race-course or on huge houses for which, if they are building for the first time, we will give them an extra £1,000. Anybody who seriously considers the history of private enterprise will have no doubt that the necessary job creation will not be provided by it.</P>
    <P>The food processing industry must be expanded.  The only way in which it can be expanded is by direct State intervention.  While I sincerely hope that Fianna Fáil will be able to provide <Col N="737" /> their forecasted job opportunities, I doubt that they will do so.  There are firms ready for expansion such as CSET, their subsidiary Erin Foods, and the meat-processing industry.  A few days ago when we were discussing the Bill to guarantee funds to the ACC it became clear that the ACC had the authority to buy land and to enter into the food-processing business.  As the Minister for Finance is their principal shareholder, it must be his policy for them to do that or they will not do it.  I suggest that that is the only kind of policy to create the jobs that are needed for our survival.</P>
    <P>A lot of play has been made about reducing inflation and the fact that the budget did not impose extra taxation. The old, the infirm and the very poor in our society were having to seek meat substitutes.  If they were meant to keep body and soul together on their pensions they would not have much meat in their diets, but they had an alternative which, I am told by those who know, has the same nutritive value, and that was cheese.  The Government decided to withdraw the subsidy on cheese which meant that these unfortunate people had to pay an extra 10p per pound.  Fianna Fáil are famous for withdrawing food subsidies when they return to power.  They with-drew the subsidy on fertilisers from 1 January.  By doing so they favoured the large farmer.  Anyone who watches television knows that the fertiliser companies advertise the early buying of fertilisers at a reduced rate.  The small farmer is not in a position to invest his money for long periods and has to wait until the spring before buying fertilisers.  Therefore the withdrawal of the fertiliser subsidy from 1 January did not affect the rich farmer because he had already bought fertilisers. These subsidy withdrawals were ill-timed and ill-advised.</P>
    <P>In regard to lamb prices, I know farmers in my area who have different kinds of lambs.  They have lambs which are fit for the French market at 85p per pound and they have lambs which are selling at 55p per pound. It seems that most of our butchers are selling the second category of lamb and that we are paying the French price for this meat.  I understand an <Col N="738" /> investigation has been carried out by the Department of Industry, Commerce an Energy.  I hope it will have more effect than previous investigations and will result in something being done to rationalise the price of lamb being sold by our Irish farmers at 55p per lb to the factories but making its way to housewives at 120p per lb.  That is why I stated that cheese had to be substituted for these meats by our poor, and the Government, by withdrawing the cheese subsidy, have stabbed our poor in the back.</P>
    <P>According to the Government's capital programme produced before the budget CIE will be receiving less by way of subsidy this year than last year, in spite of the fact that the company must pay out more in wages.  To me that means that CIE either will have to increase fares or employ fewer people.  Either course is not for the good of the nation.  I have just indicated three areas where the Government by their deliberate actions have increased prices.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to the changes in farmers' taxation.  The farmers, like everybody else, should pay their fair share in taxes but the Minister's proposals are far from the campaign which was carried on in my constituency by Fianna Fáil canvassers.  Those farmers who voted for Fianna Fáil on the issue of taxing farmers must be disappointed with that party.  Many farmers told me they were voting Fianna Fáil because their canvassers had indicated that taxation would be easier for them under Fianna Fáil. There was nothing about that in the manifesto although that document contained proposals to change the taxation system.  There was nothing in the document to the effect that 7,000 more farmers would be taxed.  Fianna Fáil kept very dark about that during those sunny days in June.  Fianna Fáil canvassers pointed out that they opposed the taxing of farmers bitterly, and they did.  I do not disagree with farmers paying tax but those farmers who changed their vote in the last election in favour of Fianna Fáil must be disappointed.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the budget except help for rich people and a miserable increase to the weakest section of <Col N="739" /> our community, old age pensioners, the unfortunate sick people and those unemployed.  The Minister should have reduced the age limit for old age pensions to 65 years and it would have been a benefit to society if he made retirement available to people earlier than at present.  When the old age pension was introduced the age limit was 70 years and when Fianna Fáil left office five years ago it was still 70 years.  That was not to their credit. During the term of office of the National Coalition that age limit was reduced by four years, a progressive step.  Even when the qualifying age for an old age pension was 70 years a worker with sufficient stamps could retire at 65 years of age and that is the position still.  That age limit should be lowered.</P>
    <P>In the budget Fianna Fáil have gone back to their old tricks.  They told us that this increase in social welfare benefits is a good one but it would be necessary to give an increase of 15 or 16 per cent if those benefits were to keep pace with inflation.  Because they have not got that increase the standard of living of old age pensioners which was low enough under the National Coalition is being reduced.  I am surprised that Fianna Fáil did not decide to give a cost of living increase to pensioners and others in receipt of social welfare benefits in October, as was the practice in the past.  Fianna Fáil are back at their old tricks of the fifties when they gave a rise of 2s in the old age pension of £1.  We all said that was miserable and it was 10 per cent.  It was always Fianna Fáil's policy to treat our old, our sick and those less well-off in our society in this manner.</P>
    <P>In the light of those facts it was irresponsible of the Government to give a present of £8½ million to our very wealthy people.  However, the budget contains some good provisions. For instance, I was pleased to see the Minister allowing single girls to qualify for social welfare, but I was disappointed that this will not come into effect in April.</P>

      <P>I accept it was not done but the Deputy must agree that a lot was done for the less well-off during that period.  I advocated such a change when I was on the Government side but it was not something that I should have brought the Government down on.  I hope Fianna Fáil will not adopt their old policy of granting increases from October, as they did in the past.  The National Coalition gave two increases annually. By giving £8½ million to the wealthy the Government have shown that they are irresponsible and have lost their social conscience.</P>
      <P>I believe that job opportunities may be improved by what they are doing. I told the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in an earlier debate that I did not believe private enterprise would ever produce the kind of job creation which is necessary.  The Minister for Finance said he has no hang-up on this and that he could change.  I do not know if he meant by that that he will come over to my way of thinking and have job creation in the private sector.  If he feels he could have job creation in the private sector he should do something about it because we want the jobs now.  For every job it is possible to create in the private sector we will need two more in the public sector as well.  I do not object to the Minister encouraging private enterprise because I believe in private enterprise if it creates full employment.</P>
      <P>Private enterprise and public enterprise have gone side by side in the past and I believe they can go together again.  The biggest potential for job creation is the agriculture industry and the processing of food.  I do not believe this can be done by private enterprise. It must be done by the public sector, setting up public companies.  It is time the Government implemented what was in the White Paper regarding the processing of all our food.  We must grow a lot more varied foods and land must be available.  I believe that the technical knowledge and skill to do this job must also be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural advisory sector of the public service has been totally neglected in all the boasting about the <Col N="741" /> creation of jobs.  We must double or treble the numbers employed in this sector in order to give a good service to our small farmers.  Most of the time of the agricultural advisers is taken up in drawing up programmes and assessing accounts for people who qualify under the modernisation scheme.  That accounts for only 25 per cent of our farmers.  If I read the new directives correctly I believe that fewer of our people will qualify for the modernisation benefits from the EEC in the future.</P>
    <P>Agriculture in general has not been referred to in this debate so far.  I listened carefully to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and to Deputy Smith but I did not hear them saying anything about giving one extra job in the agricultural sector where our principal potential for job creation undoubtedly is.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about mineral development.  I sincerely hope benefits will come here to improve our job opportunities and to improve our economy.  Despite that we have had available for many years the biggest potential for job creation approximately 12 inches from the top of the ground. This soil is capable of producing food which is the most saleable thing in any community.  Food will always have to be bought even in a recession. If it is properly processed and presented our food can compete with food in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>I have condemned the budget as a wealthy man's budget.  A large sum of money is being given to the very wealthy in our society by wiping out with one stroke of the pen existing legislation.  Those people are presented with £10 million, half the amount made available for the social welfare increases.  That is irresponsible.  The House should be ashamed of it.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about the remission of rates and car tax. Those things are of no benefit to the unfortunate old aged pensioner who has a rates waiver if he owns his house, and generally he does not own a car, so he does not get any concession from either of those benefits.  He is now being given a 10 per cent increase on a miserable income which can scarcely keep body and soul together. <Col N="742" /> An increase of 8 per cent or 10 per cent in the National Wage Agreement means a lot to a man with £10,000 a year but it means nothing to an unfortunate man with £14 a week because it will be eroded by increases in the price of cheese and butter as recently announced.  The previous Government introduced subsidies on butter but in recent weeks we have heard of an increase of 1½p per pound.  The price of cheese has been increased by deliberate Government action.</P>
    <P>The promise of taking off the tax on motor cars was one of the major things which won the election for Fianna Fáil.  I do not believe it was a responsible thing to do.  A lot of cars are used for pleasure.  People who travel long distances to work by car should be given some benefit.  There are some from my constituency who travel 45 miles to work and they do not get any tax allowance.  If they were important people in some big company they would be given cars and the company would get tax allowances.  The unfortunate man who drives long distances to work cannot get a tax allowance for that exorbitant expenditure. He has never asked for such an allowance but he has a legitimate reason for claiming it.  I raised this matter in the time of the previous Government and I raise it now.  I have raised it through my party on many occasions.  The Minister would have been well employed giving a decent tax allowance to people who can prove that they drive long distances every day to their work and have no car allowance from their employer.  These people were ignored and a broad blanket of tax concessions was thrown out to people using their cars for pleasure and who had perhaps two or three cars.  These concessions were irresponsible.  People who have to drive their cars to work should be compensated by a proper allowance.</P>
    <P>If trade unions in general thought that wage restraint would create the kind of jobs we are talking about they would be prepared to accept it.  They were never backward in accepting restraint, but it would be fair for them to ask what kind of restraint there will be on profits.  It seems from this <Col N="743" /> budget debate that it is a glorious thing to allow employers and industrialists generally to increase profits without any question of what they will do with them.  I hope they will plough them back into their businesses.  It is hard to expect a trade unionist to accept that criterion for an employer and the threat of the big stick for himself if he does not knuckle down to a 5 per cent increase.  While the threat may have been meant for both sides, any reasonable man would doubt whether the job creation hoped for by the Minister from those extra profits without apparently any real guarantee would materialise.  The process would be too slow.  I see in the Press that the Minister has changed 5 per cent to 8 per cent&mdash;&ldquo;Colley in favour of 8 per cent&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But a specific threat was made in this House that if 5 per cent was exceeded action would be taken by the Government.  What action will the Government take against the people who get the extra profits from this budget if they do not produce the kind of jobs that it is hoped they will? I hope sincerely that the Minister will be able to come back here this time next year and say that there are 30,000 fewer on the live register.  That is the kind of job creation that is needed.  I do not believe that private enterprise can ever produce that kind of job opportunity.  They have not done it in the past and I do not see any prospect of their doing it in this year of grace 1978.  In this context it is the duty of the Government to ensure that the public sector provide an opportunity for our people to work and live in our own country.  No Government&mdash;and I include all Governments, including the one I supported for the last four-and-a-half <Col N="744" /> years&mdash;have ever made any attempt to tackle this problem as it should be tackled and I see no prospect in this budget of this Government being different from any other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to spend much time dealing with the budget itself or with the strategy underlying it, because that has been adequately outlined by the Minister in his introductory speech and in the subsequent discussions inside and outside the House.  With this budget we were continuing to implement the policy that we put before the people last summer and on which we received a mandate.  Specifically we were implementing the remainder of a set of promises which we had undertaken to complete in the year 1977-78.  In the field of tax cuts we confirmed the abolition of rates on all residential property and we introduced income tax improvements which we had promised.  In the field of job creation, where we had set ourselves a target of 20,000 posts for the first year in Government, we were not alone confirming that target: we were improving it.  Because, as the budget statement made clear, the additional posts now authorised in the public service, allied with jobs which are expected to arise in building and construction and on special youth creation programmes, should now total at least 23,000 before the summer is out. Indeed, if one were to take account of the beneficial impact of actions to help the small dwellings housing programme and the indirect effect on some allied industries of this boost to building and construction, it would be perfectly plausible to construct estimates ranging as high as 26,000 extra jobs.  I will settle for the more modest figure of 23,000 as a very clear, specific, unambiguous target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those were the main items which we had spelled out for action in our first year and they were related to a very clear concept of the type of economic policy needed for this country at this time.  We were saying that it is absolutely essential that we make a vigorous attack on our unemployment problem.  Hand in hand <Col N="745" /> with that we had to bring about a rapid reduction in inflation, because the solutions to these two problems are intertwined.  It has been our view consistently over recent years that it would not be possible to succeed in our attack on unemployment if we were to ignore the serious inflation that had been raging. Equally there is no point in tackling inflation by means which, though they might prove successful in halting price rises, would also almost certainly lead to further massive increases in unemployment rather than do anything to help that awful problem.</P>
    <P>Having affirmed that that is our attitude, that we are more than keeping our promises, I want to spend my time dealing with some of the criticisms of the budget.  I will particularly take the speech by Deputy FitzGerald on behalf of Fine Gael last week.  I was angered and outraged by some of his remarks and by the incredibly perverted and distorted way in which he purported to use statistics and academic reasoning to bolster his case. The reason I say that in such strong terms is because of the manner of his introduction when he claimed he would seek to adopt the objectivity of the independent economist, that he would not behave in a political manner, and he then proceeded to carry out one of the worst forms of political pervertion I have seen in this field in recent years.  I can only assume he was hoping to get away with it by his usual technique of jumbling up figures and confusing people with a rapid exposition of illogical or unconnected arguments. I want therefore to take some of his points and deal with them slowly and carefully in order to make it clear why I dissent totally from some of the views he put forward.</P>
    <P>I note in passing that he claimed to have some sort of objection to the nature of the economic strategy we have been using&mdash;that this was based on some discredited or outmoded theories.  The interesting thing about that is that we were never presented with the alternative theories or the more advanced analyses which presumably represent the more substantial <Col N="746" /> and beneficial policies which Deputy FitzGerald presumably would have us believe he would be capable of presenting. So that sheet remains blank and perhaps can be filled in on another occasion.</P>
    <P>Early on he played around with the numbers game, in the form of jobs. I refer deliberately to the numbers game because I find it difficult to believe that the error was made accidently. He said this budget had brought forth some kind of a mouse in the form of 6,500 extra jobs.  The number to which he referred was of additional posts sanctioned for the public sector for 1978.  I presume he must have looked at the budget speech and the material provided with it because he was able to quote from it to correct an error which he said some of the gentlemen of the Press had made when dealing with some of the other numbers in the field of job creation. Therefore it is hard to believe that he did not look at all the numbers on the page.  Had he done so he would have been quite clear that we had authorised something in the region of 4,500 public sector posts in 1977, that we were now authorising an additional 6,500, and that in combination they add up to something more than 11,000 posts, exceeding the target of 10,000 which we had set ourselves.</P>
    <P>In order to make sure there would be no confusion between posts sanctioned and posts actually filled, we supplied the statistics for the number of posts that had actually been filled by the end of the calendar year, indicating therefore the number remaining to be filled in the course of 1978. I will not go into the details of those numbers.  Deputy FitzGerald claimed that there was a discrepancy between the replies his party had received to a parliamentary question on the previous day and the numbers contained in the Budget Statement.  I have had the numbers looked at.  There were some differences which arose because of the format in which the question had been asked.  The easiest example to give, perhaps, is that something approaching 900 posts in the Department of Education had not been included in the reply to the question because Fine <Col N="747" /> Gael had asked for posts in the Department agencies under the control of each Minister and they, normally, do not contain numbers of teachers and other school staff.  There were one of two other variations of that type, but I can set Deputy FitzGerald's mind at rest by assuring him that the numbers can be fully reconciled.  I will arrange to have the appropriate numbers made available; indeed I had thought I might have done so later tonight or tomorrow because my original impression was that we would have Private Members' Business dealing with the question of employment, but apparently because of some inability in the part of Fine Gael to organise their affairs we are not to go ahead with that.</P>
    <P>So much for the numbers.  I do not know where Deputy FitzGerald got his mouse, but it is the wrong mouse and he should take it somewhere else.  The numbers are as they were in the budget speech.  More than beating the 20,000 target, we have now suggested something like 23,000.</P>
    <P>More important, in the matter of job creation the Deputy went through the crocodile tears bit, saying that much of the extra spending envisaged in the budget programme would not help to create jobs in Ireland but would help to provide jobs for the Japanese, the argument being that our own industries would be incapable of supplying the extra goods or, presumably, incapable of supplying them at competitive prices.  This is one of the things that made me angry, because for years while the Coalition were in power and while Deputy FitzGerald was a prominent member of the Government we were pointing consistently to the stupidity of the policy they were then pursuing, a stupid policy which in the wake of massive recession was subjecting our industries to very severe inflation.  The relevant consequences of inflation for industry was that it always paid to buy the equipment and substitute it for the workers, because when there were very high rates of inflation, far outrunning the then rates of interest on borrowed funds, you could instal your equipment and <Col N="748" /> know that its real cost was falling year by year, whereas in the case of workers you were confronted with the situation that their real cost was rising year by year.</P>
    <P>If as an employer you had any lingering doubt on that last score&mdash; that the cost of labour would rise&mdash; the Coalition spelled all that out for you by savage increases in the social welfare contributions of both employers and workers, which of course bore down hardest on labour intensive industries: footwear, textiles, all the industries most in difficulty as a result of recession, which might reasonably have expected any sensible Irish Government worthy of the name to do something to help them, instead of which they found themselves burdened with even greater taxes to add to their other difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Coalition appear to have been ignorant of the consequences of their misguided policies at the time, but we pointed it out to them on several occasions.  Far from seeking to mend their ways within any reasonable time, they were an incredibly long time making the journey on the road to Damascus, and it was only when the general election was almost upon them that they felt impelled to finally start moving away from their misguided policy and to start to adopt, at the eleventh hour, some of the proposals we had been advocating.  By then, massive damage had been done.  The jobs that were being exported to Japan or to anywhere else, were gone.  It can be seen in the eastern area, where the unemployment figures have really rocketed in the last few years, because firms and almost whole industries were wiped out as a result of this policy.</P>
    <P>Whether it was stupid, unintentional policy or deliberate I do not know, but the Coalition must bear responsibility for it.  That was their contribution to worrying about jobs for Irishmen in Irish firms.  We have set ourselves the task of trying to turn round that situation as quickly as possible.  In the case of those industries which had been most severely hit by that misguided policy, as well as being hit by external unfair competition such as the British subsidies which were being given to <Col N="749" /> British industries in similar circumstances, we have introduced special financial aid in the form of £5 per week for each worker.  The first tangible step to help these beleaguered firms came from a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald ought to have thought out his economic theory or he should come back and tell us what alternative theory he has in mind that would do a better job in strengthening our existing Irish industry and in enabling either existing Irish industry or new industry to expand at the fastest possible rate.  I have not seen any evidence of an alternative theory.  If we go on the old biblical phrase &ldquo;By their fruits shall ye know them&rdquo;, we know the bitter fruit that the Irish people had to swallow in the four years of misguided Coalition Government. The way in which the Coalition Government financed most of their massive borrowing, which was necessary to cope with their spending programmes was a factor which worsened the situation as well as the massive inflation and the wrong policy towards labour intensive industry.  They indulged in substantial foreign borrowing. For the first time in the history of the State there was large scale borrowing from outside the country.  If Deputy FitzGerald is so eager to quote academic text books and the objectivity of the economist, I am sure he will not mind being reminded that external borrowing is the most inflationary form of finance in which any country can indulge.  It is a last resort and a Government using this should make sure that they can control its impact on their money supply and on the economy. That did not happen.  One has only to look at the inflationary figures for Ireland during the years of the Coalition's reign to see the consequences of it.  I have said enough to illustrate the suspect nature of remarks in relation to borrowing.</P>
    <P>In relation to policies which can help or hinder the maintenance or creation of jobs in Ireland I must mention the wealth tax.  Deputy FitzGerald, with the apparent objectivity of the economist, peculiarly only managed to refer to the wealth tax in much the <Col N="750" /> same way as Deputy Bermingham did: he contrasted the amount of relief given there with the apparently inadequate provision made for improvements in social welfare benefits. No reference was made to the part which a wealth tax might or might not play in either helping or hindering the productive sector of the economy.  In three articles in <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash;one as early as August 1974&mdash;I spelled out carefully the economic arguments for and against the various capital taxes and I demonstrated reasonably clearly that a wealth tax was unnecessary if the other taxes were operating efficiently, and that wealth tax would be dangerous economically.</P>
    <P>That was a general argument, true for almost any economy at any time. In the circumstances of the Irish economy we must note two characteristics. It is a small, relatively open economy, one that does not have absolutely tight exchange controls; and, not surprisingly, an unknown amount of wealth can leave the country rather than remain to be taxed.  One might say: &ldquo;Too bad.  You are better off without them.&rdquo;  Then we are saying that the wealth that remains must bear the greater burden.  It is bad enough that they should bear this burden but we are asking them to face other extraordinary actions of an Irish Government. We had a situation where if one had the misfortune to be Irish one found oneself liable for wealth tax, if one were sufficiently patriotic or misguided enough to invest money in factories, hotels or any activity which could generate employment.  An Irish Government were putting Irish people at a disadvantage when facing up to competition with foreign based firms. If that were not enough the Government gave exemptions from wealth tax in a form which encouraged non-productive use of wealth.  If one bought a big house and stuffed it with antiques and other valuables one could find oneself able to exempt very large amounts of wealth from liability to this tax.  Any lingering doubt that an Irishman might have had on this score was dispelled.  The only sensible thing to do, if one could retrieve one's wealth, was not to use it for anything which might help another Irishman to <Col N="751" /> get work.  That is the economic contribution of the wealth tax to our society.  It was absolutely essential that we got rid of it in its present form because it could serve no useful economic purpose.</P>
    <P>I will refer later to the equity arguments about what constitutes a fair system.  I can assure Deputies that that is a far more complex issue than simply waving the red rag of £8½ million alongside the social welfare payments.  They are separate issues which do not directly relate to one another.  It is always easy to show that somebody has wealth, and that there are large sections which do not have it.  Does anyone seriously believe that, if we could confiscate all the privately owned wealth tonight and distribute it evenly among the population, that would make us better off in six months' or a year's time?  Does anybody seriously believe that there would be more people at work at the end of the year?  We must think through about the consequences that would follow from such a policy.</P>
    <P>In saying this I am not advocating, supporting, condoning, or endorsing excessive wealth accumulation or antisocial uses of that wealth.  I am saying that all economic and social progress as we have known it since man came out of the cave has depended on the ability to accumulate wealth and to use it productively to improve the lot of mankind.  Every farmer knows the moral of that.  Even in a lean harvest he knows that he must hold on to sufficient seed to ensure the following season's crop even if that means going hungry for part of the winter.  Our forefathers knew that lesson very well, but it is one of the interesting things about history that each new generation repeats some mistakes rather than benefiting from historical experience.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I should be the last to claim perfection but I should try to claim honesty.  That is why I am so vicious or so bitter in this attack&mdash;because I will not stand for hypocrisy, humbug and <Col N="752" /> double talk.  When I come here to make a political speech I make a political speech.  I use one hand.  I state my view and I stick to it.  When I want to write an academic paper I know where to go and do it in academic form.  I cannot stand anyone sailing under false colours, claiming to be doing one thing while doing the opposite. I am sorry for being so firm on the issue but I have my views also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said sufficient about the wealth tax to show that it can be relevant to job creation and is a far more complex issue than simply relating it to the social welfare improvements. Let me deal briefly with these improvements.  The substance of the objections was that 10 per cent was not enough and that we were getting it as a second phase which for some peculiar reason was regarded as a very beneficial feature to be incorporated permanently.  Why?  The only reason why the Coalition found themselves saddled with the necessity to introduce a supplementary payment in the autumn of each year for the past few years was that inflation was so appalling that they knew the people depending on these benefits were suffering falls in their living standards through the almost daily fall in the value of the benefits and they had to try to prop them up temporarily for a few months until the next annual budget.  Once you get rid of inflation should there be a need for this?  Surely not; that is why the other day when Deputy FitzGerald said he would like to see this second phase become a permanent feature, I interrupted and invited him to clarify this position.  A few other Opposition speakers rallied to the defence of their leader which was a foolish thing for them to do at the time but, in any case, he declined to withdraw his remarks and I had to take it that he meant them.  Therefore, I must say to him that I presume he must have been banking on inflation being permanent or else he wants to get a double benefit from the amount of real money he will spend on social welfare improvements in a year by doling out a little of it in the spring and another slice in the autumn.  We would prefer to be more honest and practical about it and say that we <Col N="753" /> wanted to use the annual budget as the annual budget and give an annual increase which will hold its value so that you do not have to come back every few months to top it up again with supplementary increases to cover excessive inflation.</P>
    <P>Is 10 per cent inadequate?  Of course every Government would like to spend more in these areas.  There is never any conflict between the two sides of the House on this.  The only way you can appraise the 10 per cent this year is to relate it to what has been happening in recent years.  The Coalition are always complimenting themselves on the very substantial improvements in this area.  But were they improvements? On my calculations, old age pensioners in 1977 enjoyed a real increase of between 1 and 1.5 per cent in their social welfare benefit.  In the previous year it was between nil and 1 per cent whereas this year, because of the very substantially lower inflation, the real value of their increases will work out at between 5 and 6 per cent, in other words, the first real substantial increase for three years and the best increase for five years.  One may still think it is not enough and I should like to do more, but not enough by comparison with what?  It is five to six times better than the Coalition managed in the last few years despite all their talk.</P>
    <P>We have had all these references to the extravagant treatment of the rich and the niggardly treatment of the poor.  These, I can only say, were used by Deputy FitzGerald and one or two others virtually as an incitement to the trade union movement not to proceed with negotiations for a reasonable wage agreement.  People are entitled to express their opinions and advocate any viewpoint they like but that was my interpretation of what he was saying and I shall return to it later because they are certainly not entitled to back both horses in my book.</P>
    <P>That was the general tenor of the Opposition speeches.  Coming to the end, we got, as expected the chestnut about our extravagant rate of borrowing, this massive, appalling, unsustainable level of borrowing and the awful uncertainty it would create throughout <Col N="754" /> the community.  First, the actual level of borrowing is precisely what we said it would be, 13 per cent of GNP, and not what Deputy FitzGerald claimed last summer it would be when he was saying there was no way in which it could be less than 15 per cent.  I refer to this just to point out that it is Deputy FitzGerald's figures that have to be adjusted, not ours. May I also point out that this first shot at the wealth tax in 1973-74, 2½ per cent, was also quickly demonstrated to be economically incredible and was very rapidly amended.  Given time, which I realise is scarce, I could produce many more examples of the way in which there have been some peculiar number games going on but those coupled with my earlier reference to jobs will suffice for this evening.  We can see the hyprocrisy of talking of borrowing and the massive uncertainty it creates since not only were we confirming the figure we had given much earlier without benefit of the most up-to-date information and all the details of actual Government spending and so on, but we had also recently in our White Paper spelled out the levels of taxation which we regarded as a target for the period up to 1980. In other words, we had already committed ourselves as a Government to saying that there would not be any massive increases in taxation, the very ogre that Deputy FitzGerald tried to conjure up.  Of all people, he should not talk in these terms because if you go back to the Coalition years, nobody was sure from one year to the next&mdash; sometimes from one month to the next&mdash;whether taxation would go up or go down or be unchanged.  If we must talk about uncertainty people in glass houses are throwing some peculiar stones.</P>
    <P>As regards the borrowing, how large and unsustainable it is and why we are driven into it&mdash;how much extra borrowing is involved in our package this year?  All the people who complain about it being so excessive, about this enormous increase, have never once bothered to say how much is involved. They try to create the impression that all of the £821 million is in some sense or other connected with <Col N="755" /> our specific policies.  Of course, it is not.  Had they the misfortune to still have the Coalition in office, they would have been borrowing on a very substantial scale.  We can debate the numbers if you like.  I am going to toss out a figure that says that they would have been borrowing 10 per cent of GNP instead of 13 per cent. Happily I will supply the justification for that if necessary, if anybody on the opposite benches feels it is an unfair representation of their position.  That figure says to me that this year we are borrowing something in the region of £180 million to £200 million extra to finance the specific programme of extra job creation and tax cuts which we have initiated.  Apparently this is what will create all the uncertainty, will undermine confidence, destroy the country and so on.</P>
    <P>Let us get it into perspective.  First of all, what benefits do we have to get back before that sort of expenditure is justified?  In crude terms, I suppose we could say that to service a borrowing of £200 million these days would cost a little over £20 million, 10 per cent plus.  That is a figure that would work out at approximately one-third of 1 per cent of our GNP, of our total national production this year.  There-fore, as a nation, we have to get back more than that before this gamble, risk, investment&mdash;whatever term one prefers &mdash;is justified.</P>
    <P>Reverting to one of my earlier themes&mdash;that the attack on unemployment and inflation are related to one another&mdash;already it can be shown that the gamble can be worth while. As a direct consequence of some of our tax cuts the rate of inflation will be approximately 2 per cent lower this year than might have been expected otherwise.  There is some academic work of an economic nature to suggest that every 1 per cent improvement in our price levels can be accompanied by a 2 per cent increase in exports. If we apply that to non-agricultural exports&mdash;because I recognise that agricultural exports are caught up mostly with the common agricultural policy of the EEC and so on&mdash;one ends up with a calculation suggesting that we <Col N="756" /> should be capable, as a nation, of achieving a 4 per cent growth in our industrial exports.  That translates out at approximately one-half to 1 per cent of GNP, in other words, already more than enough to cover the original debt service associated with our additional borrowing, that is if we get no other benefit from our programme, whereas, of course, we have committed ourselves, and fully expect, to get about 23,000 jobs from that extra spending also, which is surely a benefit of no inconsiderable consequence.</P>
    <P>I could go on in this vein for a very long time, but I wish to terminate my remarks as quickly as I can.  Before doing so I want to relate one or two of those remarks about the attitudes adopted in commenting on this budget to the final humbug note Deputy FitzGerald struck when he got on to his high horse about political morality, how he was not going to come down to the standards of Fianna Fáil, seeing himself as the custodian of some form of whatever it was which he never made clear, but he would have us believe that Fianna Fáil had done something terrible, unworthy of politicians, both in the election last summer, in the manifesto commitments and now in the budget in actually keeping to our word.  Deputy FitzGerald was in no position to make that sort of case, given that earlier in his remarks he struck a tone which if the trade unions were to respond to would virtually constitute an incitement that said not to conduct a national wage agreement.  But, more than that, he was implying that there was something wrong, undemocratic or unhealthy in a political party spelling out a policy clearly, presenting that policy to the people, inviting them to adjudicate on it; then, when given the authority to do so by being elected to government, that the party should actually keep its word and do what it had said it would do.</P>
    <P>I found that really incredible. Apparently we would have been more moral had we broken our word and not done what we had promised to do. Presumably we would have been more moral still had we not said anything specific last summer; in other words <Col N="757" /> fudge the issues, go in for the traditional approach&mdash;if you can avoid saying anything specific, for heaven's sake do not commit yourself to anything, just talk in general terms and hopefully you will fool enough of the people enough of the time to get yourself re-elected.  It was because we were determined to put an end to so much of that political humbug that we said what we did in our manifesto and what we are now doing in government.  We said: we will spell out very specific commitments and we will carry them through, deliberately, I might add, in political terms to point up the contrast of the Alice in Blunderland approach of the famous, or is it notorious, Coalition 14 point effort of 1973.</P>
    <P>That is the burden of my remarks on the budget.  I dealt at some length with the attempted criticisms of it made by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party.  In doing so I do not ignore the contributions made by other speakers, but many of them tended to follow the same line.  Since he sought to give his remarks a particular air of authority&mdash; which in my view they totally lacked&mdash; I felt it necessary to deal with them in that specific form.</P>
    <P>However, the final point I want to make is this: while we are busy debating the merits or demerits of whether we should have repealed the wealth tax, whether it is this form of adjustment or that form of improvement in social welfare and so on, not once have we heard from the opposite benches any credible alternative policy put forward.  They are running for the alibi somewhat this weather.  There is the tendency now to hear the speech which says: Fianna Fail got the country in good shape last summer; the recovery was under way, all was well and had the Coalition policy been continued one is expected to believe that the problems facing us by way of unemployment and inflation would disappear. I must point out that one of the reasons the economy was improving last year&mdash;and we never denied that&mdash;was because in the budget of January 1977 the Coalition, belatedly, started to implement some of the policies which we, then in Opposition, had been advocating, having attacked <Col N="758" /> and denounced us for them first.  They then proceeded, in a very limited way, to introduce our policy of tax cuts and extra Government spending for job creation.  At times I am flabbergasted, whether it is at the sheer brass neck or the confused thinking of the Coalition benches that, on the one hand, they will try to attack our policy and, on the other, seek to claim credit for some of the beneficial effects flowing from it in 1977.</P>
    <P>If one goes back and looks at the budget debate of last year one will see that our objection was not to what they had done but simply because they had not done enough of it; it was too little and too late.  The proof that it was too little&mdash;I will ignore the timing of it&mdash;lies in trying to ask themselves: what kind of unemployment situation would we be facing in the foreseeable future had we contented ourselves with the economic recovery that would get our growth rate up to 4 per cent or 5 per cent a year, and then what? Was there any fall in the unemployment numbers?  Does that enable you to cater for the increasing numbers of young people coming out of our schools and colleges and so on?  Of course not.  The so-called good shape which the economy was in when we took office last summer would have meant that the live register, then in the region of 110,000, would have been added to by at least a few thousand a year, and the total number of unemployed&mdash;we know there are many thousands who are not counted on the live register&mdash;could well have been rising by anything from 5,000 to 10,000 a year for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>There is no basis whatsoever for believing that there could have been a fall in unemployment had we simply been content to jog along with what was then happening.  I say that in the full knowledge that the actions we have already taken, while in our view representing a first substantial attack on the problem, again are not in themselves sufficient to solve it.  We were the first to say that.  What we have taken are nothing more than the first steps, but they are by no means the whole solution.  I have to repeat that in the absence of the action we have <Col N="759" /> taken, one trembles at the prospects for the unemployed and for our young people.</P>

      <P>This is the challenge I am putting up to the Deputy.  I am sick to the back teeth with some of his people who take this line. Go ahead and put on the record, either in this House or outside, how the Coalition would have averted the closure of Ferenka and Van Hool or anything else they care to talk about and I will be delighted to hear them. I am not pretending they might not have a formula.  As I said, we have never claimed a monopoly of wisdom or virtue.  The Deputy's leader was the person who was trying to go through that particular bit of political humbug last week when he was seeking to assume the mantle of superior political morality and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been the first to say all along, as in our manifesto commitments and before that, that not even Fianna Fáil could produce a policy that would simultaneously solve unemployment, inflation and the problems of the public finances.  We made our selection.  We said our first priorities are unemployment and inflation. When they are under control, then we will restore order to the public finances. We made our choice.  It was the best evaluation we could make of the situation. If the Deputies disagree with it, <Col N="760" /> as they are fully entitled to do, if they think they could have done better, tell us something about the nature of that better alternative, because they have been remarkably quiet about it so far.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the people, if the Opposition want to promote a more responsible, informed, enlightened type of debate, if they want an improved political morality, let us get it by being more frank with one another.  Let us see their cards.  Let us have a spelling out of this alternative policy.  For the past five years they have been singularly successful in concealing it not only from the people but from themselves.</P>
    <P>I stand four square behind our actions to date.  I have already indicated that they do not represent a solution to everything.  There are many more things to be done.  I say, and I invite contradiction, that they are the first substantial positive steps which have been taken in recent years to put our country back on the right road. They are also the first steps to be taken to try to recognise the human misery that lies behind the growing unemployment which this country has suffered in recent years.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition are so concerned about social welfare and social justice, surely one of the most positive acts of social justice which we as a nation can bring about, is to try to provide some form of work and some form of confidence for the future among our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad a number of Deputies came into the House to hear the Minister's speech, because for a long time we were alone and I felt like a schoolboy kept after school being chided for not knowing his economics. It is nice at times to hear a political neophyte in full flight, speaking with such sweet innocence as you have just heard.  The Minister's remarks, particularly those referring to Deputy Garret FitzGerald ill became a Minister, when, to use an expression in another sphere, he would not claim to be good enough to lace his boots. To use words like being &ldquo;angered&rdquo; and &ldquo;outraged&rdquo; by Deputy Garret FitzGerald's contribution is going from the sublime to the ridiculous.  Deputy <Col N="761" /> Garret FitzGerald has long been considered this country's leading economist. His views are respected not just in Ireland but all over the world as being valid and to the point.</P>
      <P>From my experience in politics, terms like &ldquo;anger&rdquo; and &ldquo;outrage&rdquo; should be kept for outside the polling booth on the day of the election when you see the other side hauling in one of your best supporters or a similar incident.  Such feelings should not be engendered here where men of stature come to debate.  In time the Minister will learn the hard way.  He still has a lot of rough edges, and they will be knocked off little by little.  Whether this is done by the Opposition or by some of his senior colleagues in Government remains to be seen.  We had the unseemly spectacle of seeing the Minister and the Tánaiste having to disagree in public because their roles crossed, with the resulting sparks and fire.</P>
      <P>To accuse Deputy Garret FitzGerald of manipulating figures about the numbers employed in the public sector is to my mind erroneous.  Deputy Garret FitzGerald will answer the Minister in his own good time.  To be enraged and angered over such figures or, as he called them, the manipulating of figures, is petty, small minded. Before the last election we had to put up with the smear of 175,000 unemployed when there were actually 110,000 unemployed.  We took it.  We were probably too quiet and did not hit back hard enough, but we thought the public would see through that type of smear.  Unfortunately some of the mud stuck and this had an impact.</P>
      <P>The Minister implied that this Government were elected due to his brilliant political strategy.  This Government were elected by an accident.  The most surprised people were the members of the Government, including the Taoiseach.  There was no great political strategy involved.  Many promises were held out to the public.  The public are greedy and grabbed at them. While there may have been a number of other contributory factors, that was the major factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view we should leave the immediate past alone.  I regard this <Col N="762" /> budget as a non-event.  We knew almost precisely what it would contain. We had little surprises here and there.  We expected increases in social welfare benefits.  We also expected increases in duties on spirits and beer. The overall content of the budget was not unexpected.  It cannot be described as a very illustrious or adventurous budget.  It gave us what we were promised. It reaffirmed the Fianna Fáil election promise that income tax allowances would be increased considerably. It provided money for things like car tax and the abolition of rates on domestic houses.</P>
    <P>Such a budget cannot do anything fantastic for the major problem facing us at the moment.  That problem is unemployment. Despite what the Fianna Fáil Party said, despite what the Minister for Economic Planning and Development said, I do not see this problem being solved easily or quickly. The creation of jobs in the public sector does not appear to be the solution. Creativity should be the theme of any new policy on employment.  I have not seen any signs of creativity.  Bringing in firms, or the creation of new firms at home which would provide diversified types of jobs, or an increase in the number of positions in existing firms&mdash;we have not seen that type of activity.  If we are to achieve our target&mdash;and we would be poor Irishmen if we did not all wish the Government well and wish the Ministers involved success in achieving their goal; and we do wish them well&mdash; the type of effort we have seen so far will not provide the solution.  It is merely taking people off the dole queues and putting them into sectors which are already overmanned and where there is no need for extra employment.</P>
    <P>There is room for employment in hospitals.  There is a need for more nurses.  There is a need for more teachers in schools.  The pupil-teacher ratio is not satisfactory in secondary or primary schools.  In spheres like that, I agree there is a need for an increase in employment in the public sector.  That is a small fraction of the 6,500 mentioned.  If it involves more clerical assistants and employment on such routine duties, I would say that <Col N="763" /> type of employment is not relevant. You could almost say you are paying people dole at inflated rates.  It is not productive employment, and that is what the country needs from the point of view of productivity in the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not be upset if Deputy FitzGerald takes him to task about these figures.  The Minister is on record as having made a particularly stupid statement in recent weeks.  He said if he had to provide jobs he would get people to dig holes and fill them in again.  That is not planning.  That is a lot of rubbish.  We want to see productivity and creativity.  That is what the Government were elected to do.  We did our best, and we were hammered at the polls by the Fianna Fáil Party. Before the election they said our best was not good enough.  We will hammer them if they cannot produce anything better.  We hope they can do better, because we are all in this together and we want to see a better future for our youth.</P>
    <P>Through the thirties, forties and fifties we had the safety valve of emigration.  Emigration almost ceased in the late sixties and early seventies. It was a wonderful safety valve.  It got successive Fianna Fáil Governments out of all sorts of problems.  There were no great unemployment queues. If you had not got a job you went to England.  In the sixties there was a boom in the world economy which Fianna Fáil claimed was theirs.  The boom which was experienced in industry was deemed to be at the behest of the Fianna Fáil Government and caused by their astute policies.  Of course, that was not the case.  Every country in the world was in a similar position.  We were like a pimple on the back of the lot of them because of our size in comparison with them.  Fianna Fáil claimed the credit, and there were enough stupid people about to believe them.  There is this myth that they are the people who can provide full employment, and a myth it is.</P>
    <P>In recent months there has been a tendency towards increased emigration. That is one way of solving our problem, but we have seen also a disturbing <Col N="764" /> trend in Britain in recent weeks. The Tory Party leaders are trying to see whether bigotry could be a major factor in the next general election.  If they think bigotry could score heavily for them&mdash;and the present indications are that they feel it could&mdash;one of their platforms would be to stop the flow of emigrants not just from the West Indies but from the Republic of Ireland.  There would go one of our safety valves, the safety valve.  There-fore, it is more important than ever that we see to it that jobs are made available.</P>
    <P>I would hate to think we would see the day when relations between Britain and Ireland would reach that level. When people have a lust for power they will go to extraordinary lengths to try to justify themselves and to gain that power.  Let us not take it for granted that as our dole queues get longer and longer we can ease our problems by letting people emigrate to Britain as the British economy improves, as it has improved and will improve for several years to come according to all reports.  If this policy is adopted in Britain we will be faced with an extremely difficult situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the abolition of the wealth tax and admonished some speakers from this side of the House for disagreeing with its abolition. I will not take him to task for that.  He is perfectly entitled to his view.  I would go so far as to say his view may be valid.  There is something to be said for allowing people with large sums of money a certain amount of latitude in the hope that they will use an appreciable amount of that money for the good of the country in which they live.  Over the years the evidence has been that people with considerable estates and fortunes have been guilty of hoarding them or investing heavily abroad and not using them for the betterment of this nation.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the wealth tax may have taught these people a salutary lesson.  I should like him to know that, while it has been abolished and they are being given a fair crack of the whip&mdash;maybe more than a fair crack of the whip in the view of some <Col N="765" /> members of my own party and certainly members of the Labour Party&mdash; its re-introduction would be considered seriously if they were not seen to perform a national duty by making a major contribution to the provision of employment and the investment of their money in this country and not abroad.</P>
    <P>We had to face a most effective smear, especially in rural Ireland.  It was the threat that if we stayed in power we would reduce the threshold so that many more farmers would become eligible for payment of income tax, and it was also threatened that if we remained in power we would increase the multiplier considerably. This was not just a veiled threat; it was said at the doors of farmhouses especially throughout the rural constituencies where farmers came into this bracket.  I experienced it at first hand; I lost many good supporters because of this smear.  The canvassers for Fianna Fáil may not have been advised on this matter by headquarters but they were probably advised by their own candidates, sitting TDs and prospective Ministers. Their smear was effective, but they forgot to tell the people that if they got back to power they would do precisely the same, or even do it in greater measure.  That is what they have done.</P>
    <P>At the best of times farmer taxation is a ticklish problem.  I agree that farmers should pay tax.  Those of us on the PAYE system know how difficult it is to live when you are taxed heavily. All of us agree that farmer taxation had to come, but we object to the manner in which Fianna Fáil gave the impression that if they got back to power farmer taxation would be reduced and not increased as has happened in the budget.  It is not for me to say what should be the method of taxation, whether the notional or the accounts system is the better.  Perhaps neither system is the correct one, but there definitely should be an equitable form of taxation.</P>
    <P>We had the distasteful task of introducing farmer taxation and we tried to do it as fairly as possible.  It is very difficult to introduce any new form of taxation: there are growing pains <Col N="766" /> and anomalies of all kinds.  Some people seem to be treated unfairly while others appear to get away with murder.  This is true because of the archaic rating system existing here, where land that was designated as mountain has been reclaimed and is now among the best pasture in the country.  Such land is now being rated at a ridiculous figure.  I know of one stretch of land of the best pasture, 330 acres, which was sold recently. That land has a total valuation of £1. I know of land that basically is not as good where the valuation is £1.50 per acre.  We cannot have a fair taxation system with that kind of anomaly. The onus is on the Government to equate these valuations, to equate the quality of the land and to distribute the valuations accordingly.</P>
    <P>A commission was set up in the early 1960s to examine this question, and it reported in 1967 to the then Government.  The report stated that it would take approximately 11 years to carry out a complete revaluation of the land in the country, but recently I was told that that is not necessary because An Foras Talúntais have a good analysis of practically every acre. Within a matter of months they could come forward with a system that would give an equitable comparison in the qualities of land.  That is urgently needed.  Until such time as this is done there will be bad feeling among neighbouring farmers.  There will be a feeling of injustice on the part of those whose land was highly valued 130 years ago mainly because it was on the bank of a river or close to the sea-shore. Much of the land on the banks of rivers that was highly valued 130 years ago is now swamped; in many cases land that was by the seashore does not exist any more, as I explained recently to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Wyse.  I know of one farm where 100 acres have gone but the owner is still being levied for rates for the land that was washed away. There are many anomalies in our agricultural rating system, and it is about time we got down to remedying the situation.  It is time we were fair to those who are affected, and it is time also that we started to catch up with <Col N="767" /> people who are getting away with blue murder, such as the person whose holding of 330 acres is valued at £1.</P>
    <P>I was rather disappointed with the social welfare proposals in the budget. We do not expect fantastic goodies to be distributed.  The 10 per cent overall increase was appreciable, but it could have been more.  Things have improved quite considerably now.  At one time if a person kept six chickens their pension could be cut.  Nowadays there is a reasonable means test, but I look forward to the time when that can be eliminated completely.  I know some very hard-working parents who have handed over most of their land to their children but who have kept a few acres for a small number of cattle just for an interest.  Their pensions have been halved because of this, or they get only a tiny fraction.  This seems most unjust on people who have worked hard all their lives.  The means test should be relaxed.  It is a common occurrence that the person who is affected by a means test is a hard-working, God-fearing individual who has spent 50 or 60 years in hard toil but who because of his thrift is penalised.  Because such a person does not want to retire completely he suffers, but the ne'er-do-well who never did anything, who got benefits from the day he was old enough to draw them&mdash;in many cases he was not even entitled to them&mdash;will qualify for all the benefits available.  Our social welfare benefits are not wonderful but they are quite good.</P>
    <P>Women were very disappointed that there was no increase in the children's allowance.  They look on that as their money.  It is the only money most of them get directly into their hands.  They have to depend on what their husbands decide to give them as a weekly allowance for shopping, clothing and so on. They depend on the children's allowance for that little extra.  There should have been an appreciable increase in this respect even if a means test were to be applied.</P>
    <P>The other area of social welfare that disappoints me so far as the budget is concerned is that the old age pension qualifying age was not reduced to 65. We did a good job in this regard during <Col N="768" /> our term of office bringing the age down from 70 to 66, something that was much appreciated.  It would not have hurt all that much to have reduced the age this year to 65.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the concessions in the housing field.  The new house grant of £1,000 will prove very valuable.  It is a worthwhile gesture.  I regarded the abolition of the old grant for a new house as a mistake on the part of the Coalition.  It was not abolished totally but the limits were so low, for instance, £2,350 in the case of a person with three or more dependants, that perhaps 95 per cent of the people buying new houses were not eligible for the grant.  However, we all make mistakes.</P>
    <P>Another commendable change is the increase in the limit for loans, £2,250 to £3,500.  Although I do not wish to be critical in this regard I have found during the past six months that the new increased figure is not sufficient so far as the average industrial worker is concerned. I find that many young married people are being turned down when they apply to their local authorities for a grant.  Consequently, there is a case for increasing the limits further.  The old figure was ridiculous.</P>
    <P>It is good to know that the reconstruction grant is being increased to £600 but in this area there would appear to be an omission.  Perhaps this results from a genuine mistake.  I refer to the apparent abolition of that scheme administered under section 30 of the Housing Act and which provided for grants for the repair of houses that were in very bad condition.  If I am right about this, undue hardship will be caused to a number of families who are living in very bad conditions.  I am not talking about council houses but private houses.  Very often these are thatched houses.  Because of the very poor circumstances of the owners these dwellings can fall into a very poor state of repair.  If the grant has been abolished I wonder whether it is intended to replace it by some other scheme.</P>

This was a grant for the reconstruction of a private house the occupants of which were in very poor circumstances and could not avail of the normal reconstruction grants because of their inability to provide their share of the cost of the work. County councils acted as agents for the Department of Local Government in such cases and carried out the work at no charge to the occupants of the house.  To qualify for the grant it was necessary that the county council certify the dwelling as not being in a condition to stand if left as it was.  In those circumstances the work carried out would not be very substantial but would be sufficient to keep a roof over the heads of the applicants during their life time.</P>

      <P>To get back to a point I was making earlier when the Minister for Economic Planning and Development became quite agitated, I should like to quote from the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  There is a statement here which sounds very well.  It refers to something that we should all like to see being put into practice.  I quote from pages 14 and 15 of the manifesto:</P>
      <P>The value of our natural resources to us as a nation must be judged primarily by the amount of spin-off employment they generate in downstream industries.  This applies equally to agriculture, oil, gas, fish, zinc and lead.  There is no use our exporting these products to create employment and wealth in other countries.  Our most assured long-term development will come from processing those to the fullest degree. To export unprocessed zinc concentrates is like exporting fresh, unprocessed milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State should retain control of <Col N="770" /> the conversion process of minerals, oil, gas, etc. to assure that they are used here to maximum benefit.  A State-owned smelter could be established here for £40m.&mdash;£10m. of this could further the equity capital.  This is equivalent to the sum paid by the Government in the Bula affair.  The balance could be easily financed from contracts with Irish mines.  The zinc production could thereby be made available for manufacturing purposes here at a price that would make it competitive.</P>
    <P>It is in the industrial use of these refined metals that their real value to Ireland lies.  There are tens of thousands of secure jobs only waiting to be created.  It is here, rather than in the exclusive encouragement of ephemeral foreign finishing industries, using foreign raw materials, that Fianna Fáil's industrial efforts will lie in the future.</P>

      <P>This is the type of productivity we like to see.  We are told that there are tens of thousands of secure jobs only waiting to be created. We are asking why, eight months later, a start has not been made.  We have not seen the first sign of such a smelter or processing procedure being brought into operation.  As far as I can see, it is not even being talked about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It ill behoves Deputy O'Donoghue to come in here and attempt to lacerate <Col N="771" /> Deputy FitzGerald for pointing out that the jobs which have been created were largely created during our time in office in 1977 and that the remainder are in the public sector, which is purely non-creative.  We want to see some action in this field.  I have every confidence in the IDA in carrying out this type of work.  They are outstanding in this field if given proper backing by the Government of the day. If the Government can create the right climate, the IDA have the people to go abroad to persuade industrialists of the advantages of this country.  There is an intelligent, educated work force and there are incentive grants and every type of facility they could wish for.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which annoys me.  It does not enrage or anger me as it did Deputy O'Donoghue.  How can we attract foreign industrialists if there is not a good political climate within the country?  I specifically refer to the Taoiseach's speech some three weeks ago which I feel has done more harm to Ireland industrially than anything that has happened for many years.  We must be seen to be an island where there is peace and harmony.  There has been such peace and harmony.  For all practical purposes and intents the Northern Ireland situation is over.  We were getting a drift back of foreign industrialists and there was a feeling that there was nothing further to be afraid of.  We did have the humbug in the early seventies promoted by the British to suit their own ends that many of the problems and much of the violence emanated from the South.  By a lot of hard work and diplomacy and through the efforts of our politicians in foreign places that erroneous feeling was dispelled.  Companies which originally shied away were again showing an interest in returning.  If it serves a dual purpose that is twice the reason why one should advocate a low profile.  If it will bring about peace and harmony, that is the main reason; if it will promote industry, that is another excellent reason.</P>

I want to see British tourists coming back to this country. I do not want them to be alienated once again.  One could call them a major industry.  Tourism is our second industry and they were by far the major portion of that industry.  Talk that is liable to give sustenance to violence will drive them away.  Bord Fáilte have told us that the figures for 1977 were very much up on previous years and they were projecting that there would be an increase in the number of British tourists in 1978.  I hope they are right but I do not think that this type of &ldquo;wrap the green flag round me&rdquo; talk will bring anybody back to this country.</P>

      <P>The techniques used for the calculation of the growth rates for revenue generally in 1978 were no different from those used in other recent years.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance prepares periodically forecasts of the main macro-economic aggregates which take account of current and prospective economic trends in Ireland and abroad and of changes, when they occur, in Government economic policy.  The macro-economic forecasts so prepared for 1978 took full account of the stimulus given by the public expenditure and taxation proposals announced in my recent budget and indicated a growth of about 7 per cent in the volume of GNP and an increase of 7 per cent in consumer prices at end-1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revenue buoyancy depends on the level and composition of economic growth.  Standard econometric techniques, adjusted where necessary in the light of information on relevant behavioural phenomena.  were used to derive revenue buoyancy estimates, including those for PAYE income tax and for value-added tax, from the main aggregates in the macro-economic forecasts.  The estimates of revenue from corporation tax and from income tax on the profits and <Col N="671" /> earnings of self-employed persons did not, of course, depend on the economic conditions expected in 1978 as these forms of taxation relate to the profits of earlier years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following consultations with representatives of the sheep producers and meat exporters it was decided that it was in the best interests of the sheep industry that the lamb trade with France should be developed on the basis of a high quality carcase of good conformation and within a specified weight range.  This is the type of carcase lamb that we have traditionally exported to the French market and that realises the best price there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" /> A proportion of mountain lamb can meet the quality criteria laid down and with improved feeding, which will now become economic in view of the attractive price for top quality lamb; this proportion is likely to increase.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for justice the number and rank of gardaí assigned at present to Cabinteely Garda Station, County Dublin and on 1 January 1973; the area covered by the station and its approximate population on 1 January 1973 and on the most recent date for which figures are available; and if he will recommend an increase in the staffing to the Garda Commissioner.</P>

      <P>The present strength of Cabinteely Garda Station is six sergeants and 21 gardaí; on 1 January 1973 it was four sergeants and 16 gardaí.  The area served by the station, which has not changed since 1973, can most conveniently be described by reference to the townlands concerned.  These total 19 and a list of them is appended.  The population of the Garda sub-district on 1 January 1973 was estimated at 25,000; the present population is estimated at 35,000.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are primarily responsible for the precise arrangements made for policing particular areas, that the current allocation of gardaí to Cabinteely is the maximum that can be provided at present having regard to the overall demands on Garda resources. The police needs of the area will, however, be further considered according as the additional manpower at present being recruited becomes available for assignment to the various centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the steps that have been and will be taken to secure an improvement in Ireland's favour in the trade imbalance between this country and the USSR; and if he will particularly state how the objective of an improved balance in trade will be achieved in the light of the efforts by the Soviet authorities to slow down their import growth with a view to reducing the Russian trade deficit with the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The expansion which occurred in the commercial exchanges between Ireland and the USSR between 1974 and 1976 was characterised by a rapidly increasing imbalance in favour of the Soviet side.  In 1977 this trend was halted and indeed reversed when, due mainly to a 240 per cent increase in the value of Irish exports to the USSR, our trade deficit with that country fell slightly from £20,203,855 to £19,278,000.</P>
      <P>While much remains to be done before trade between the two countries can be judged to be developing in a truly balanced fashion, some satisfaction may, I think, be derived from the more positive trend experienced last year, a trend which coincided with the first year of the operation of the Agreement for Economic, Industrial, Scientific and Technological Co-operation between Ireland and the USSR and with the first meeting&mdash;last June &mdash;of the joint commission established under the terms of that agreement.</P>
      <P>I am nonetheless still concerned at the extent of the imbalance and have sought and received reassurances from the Soviet authorities that everything possible will be done to facilitate access for our exports to the USSR.  In seeking these reassurances I have indicated that a reasonable balance of trade and trading opportunities is vital for the development of understanding and goodwill between a small country such as Ireland and the USSR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> Last year our exports to the USSR rose from £1,853,974 to £6,336,000, an increase as I mentioned earlier of some 240 per cent.  While not satisfied that this figure comes anywhere close to representing the limit of the potential which can be reached, I am encouraged by the trend and look forward to a greater balance in trade between the two countries in the future in the context of the co-operation agreement which now provided the framework within which our exports to the USSR can be expected to expand.  In this regard the Government will continue to provide Irish exporters with the official help and assistance which they require in their dealings with the Soviet authorities.  It cannot, however, as the Deputy is aware, compel them to concentrate their efforts on the Soviet market.</P>
    <P>The slowdown which has taken place recently in Soviet import growth &mdash;imports from the West actually fell by 8 per cent in the first six months of 1977 compared with the corresponding period in 1976&mdash;will naturally make the achievement of an improved balance in trade more difficult than might otherwise have been the case. However, I take heart from the fact that we have actually succeded in increasing our exports and reducing, albeit slightly, our deficit at a time when the Soviet authorities are cutting down on their imports and I would hope that the positive trend which emerged last year will continue as the full effects of the co-operation agreement are felt in the coming years.</P>
