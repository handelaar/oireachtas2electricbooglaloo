    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on his recent meeting with the United Nations Secretary General in relation to clarification of the mandate for UNIFIL troops in the Lebanon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: When I raised the question of the mandate, the Secretary General indicated that he had just received an assurance from Mr. Yasser Arafat to the effect that the PLO were not seeking confrontation.  Mr. Waldheim said that on the information available to him, the picture was a great deal more satisfactory in this respect&mdash;though, of course, no one could be certain that extremists on either side would not cause trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I thank the Taoiseach and Mr. Waldheim for their reassuring <Col N="2" /> statements.  Would the Taoiseach agree with me that from two points of view&mdash;one, the safety of Irish troops and other contingents with UNIFIL and also from the point of view of achieving the objective of having the United Nations there, which is to restore peace in that area and prevent it from being used for further violent purposes&mdash;it is highly desirable that it be made absolutely clear that the troops who are there are authorised to prevent persons with arms entering the territory over which the United Nations have responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: What the Deputy says is a reasonable interpretation of what is the mandate in that respect.  I understand the troops have been instructed to use force in self-defence only.  Self-defence would include resistance by forceful means to <Col N="3" /> attempts to prevent the contingent from discharging their duties along the lines suggested by the Deputy, that is, to free it from the forces that are in there, either Israeli or Palestinian, and to restore the territory to the Lebanese Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Taoiseach able to say that it has been made absolutely clear that the United Nations are authorised to prevent persons bearing arms entering the territory over which the United Nations have control, or is there still uncertainty as to the degree of authority which the United Nations troops may have to disarm people who are bearing arms unlawfully?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not know that there is absolute uniformity in the manner in which the different elements of the contingent are carrying out their duties.  As the Deputy is aware, there are five or six other nations there&mdash;French, Sengalese, Norwegians and others&mdash;and there may be differences of shade of interpretation. But, by and large, the mandate means preventing people interfering with the enforcement of the mandate to clear the area and keep it clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Taoiseach say whether or not it is the Irish Government's intention that the mandate extend to the point of preventing the area being used by people who are entering it with arms and also includes the prevention of the territory in question being used as a new base for attack of any type by anybody?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: The essential part of the mandate is that the United Nations interim forces there are for the purpose of confirming withdrawal of Israeli forces, restoring of international peace and security and assisting the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area. There are armed forces going in there. Obviously arms must be an element in ensuring the carrying out of that mandate.  If armed forces were not necessary ordinary negotiators would <Col N="4" /> probably be sufficient to carry out the mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I take it the Taoiseach would confirm as highly desirable, in the interests particularly of the UN forces who are going there in a peace-keeping role, that there should not be any confusion or dispute about their authority in the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: May I add that it would be impossible, even with the assurances that the Secretary-General told me he had got from Mr. Yasser Arafat&mdash;that the PLO generally were prepared to co-operate&mdash;to ensure that there would not be maverick groups, extremists, who would be prepared to engage in confrontation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware of recent allegations of grossly inadequate fire safety precautions at the premises of a firm (details supplied) recently destroyed by a fire which almost resulted in serious loss of life; and if he will publish the details of the inspector's certificate granted to the firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will draft the necessary legislation to ensure public access to inspectors' reports and certificates in relation to fire safety precautions at business premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the most recent occasion on which the clothing factory on Merchant's Quay, Dublin, which was burned down recently, was inspected; and the findings of this most recent inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Questions Nos. 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the press reports in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These premises were inspected by an inspector of my Department on <Col N="5" /> 27 February 1978.  It has not been the practice to make public the reports of inspections by the Department's inspectors under the Factories Act, 1955, which are confidential documents and which in some instances may lead to legal proceedings.  However, I am proposing in the Safety in Industry Bill, at present before the House, to make provision for the communication of certain information to representatives of workers.</P>
    <P>In regard to means of escape in case of fire, the primary concern of the Department's inspector, under section 45 of the Factories Act, is to check that a certificate of means of escape in case of fire issued by the local sanitary authority is in force, and that these means of escape are properly maintained and kept free of obstruction. The inspector who inspected the premises on 27 February confirmed that a certificate was in force and that the means of escape specified in that certificate were available.</P>
    <P>Any question regarding certificates of means of escape in case of fire would be a matter for the local sanitary authority who, under the Factories Act, 1955, are responsible for issuing them.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has recently told this House that the local authorities have been urged on numerous occasions to intensify their fire prevention work and that this, as well as other aspects of the local fire service, is now being reviewed locally as part of the general examination of the state of the service which local authorities have been asked to undertake.  I will be consulting with the Minister concerning factories or other work places coming within my area of responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>: Might I ask the Minister, if in fact there were defects in the fire safety position in this factory?  Does he not feel that he should inquire into the reason for their existence after, apparently, a safe certificate had been given to the factory?  Is it that after the certificate was given precautions were not available to people; we hear that there was one exit only, that that <Col N="6" /> was difficult to reach and that there were iron grills on the windows.  In the circumstances is the Minister satisfied that a certificate should have been given and, if a certificate was given, were the conditions under which it was issued in operation at the time of the fire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should explain to the House again that my information is that the inspection of 27 February related to the general inspection in addition to the issuing of the certificate by the sanitary authority and to ensuring that the requirements of that certificate were complied with.  My information is that these were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware that this certificate to which he referred was issued 20 years prior to the date of this inspection, which took place on 27 February?  If he is so aware can he say whether the initial certificate and subsequent inspection two decades later allowed for the installation of grills and bars at the window which took place in the interim and which were not referred to, as far as I am aware, in the initial certificate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: The issuing of a fire certificate by the sanitary authority in the case of fire is the first requirement. When the regular inspection is carried out by the inspector of my Department he checks that the requirements of that certificate are complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is it not theoretically possible, and perhaps factually possible in this case, that alterations to the windows or any other aspect of a building could after significantly the effect of the fire escapes mentioned in the initial certificate and that the subsequent inspection seeks to confirm only that the initial conditions remain? It does not seek, apparently, to consider to what extent subsequent operations might affect that certificate, and this is the weakness of the whole process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: The certificate provides for certain means of escape and they are referred to.  In this case the compliance was with the requirements <Col N="7" /> of the certificate.  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for the Environment has already been questioned on this in this House and has made known the fact that he is intensifying the fire prevention and fire precautions situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: I ask the Minister, finally, is it not possible that the subsequent inspection could have confirmed the existence of a fire escape but it might have had no reference to bars placed at the bottom of that fire escape which would mean that the provision of the fire escape was pointless? In other words that sort of contradiction or paradox is not allowed for under the present situation.  Is the Minister aware that in this case but for the very good work of the Dublin Brigade there could have been an enormous tragedy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not so aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>: Leaving aside all the apparent confusion, the Minister has not made his answer very clear, to me anyway.  Would he not agree that in this instance a number of lives were seriously in danger as a result of some misconceptions, some misuse or failure to carry out the spirit if not the letter of the law here?  In these circumstances should the question not be reviewed and should detailed inspectors' reports not be made available to the public and especially to this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have explained to the Deputy the provision of a report by the inspectors of my Department under the Factories Act, 1955. As I have said, I propose under the Safety in Industry Bill to make these reports available to the workers' representatives in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>: How frequently are inspections carried out by local authority officials and by officials of the Minister's Department?  What action takes place after a report is furnished to the Minister's Department? Finally, what power has the Minister if a company fails to implement <Col N="8" /> the recommendations contained in the fire officer's report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: The first part of the Deputy's question refers to another Minister who has already been questioned in this House on the subject. The sanitary authority issues a certificate and then when the inspector inspects the premises concerned his concern naturally is to ensure that the escapes and so forth as detailed in that certificate still apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy said some time ago that he was asking a last supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Very finally, does the placing of bars and/or grills on the windows of a factory such as this comply with the Minister's requirements for factory safety?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have answered that question already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister has not answered it.  Would he like to answer it now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if for each EEC country he will give details of legislative protection for workers where a company goes bankrupt, and if he has any proposals in mind to bring Ireland into line with EEC practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: Information on the position in the member countries, which has been compiled by the Commission of the European Communities, is available and I can arrange to send it to the Deputy if he wishes.  The relevant draft directive, recently prepared by the Commission, will now be examined by the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Council of Ministers.  Ireland will be represented at all the stages of this examination.  We shall be participating in the discussions on the <Col N="9" /> assumption that a directive will emerge in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is due consideration also being given to cases of factories which were not bankrupt closing down where the interests of the employees have not been sufficiently protected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is a separate issue, but I have given the answer as far as the Deputy's question applies at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister accept that, in view of the Ferenka situation, a problem has arisen where factories other than those which go bankrupt, close without giving the minimum notice, and that the situation calls for urgent action by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is a completely different question.  If the Deputy puts it down to me I will give him the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: A number of factories have gone bankrupt.  The Minister had to tell the House recently the number of firms which closed since he became Minister.  Will he take urgent action to protect the interests of those workers pending EEC legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: My concern will always be for the workers in this situation, but I think I have outlined fairly clearly the position as it is.  We will be participating in the discussions on the assumption that a directive will emerge in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the action he proposes to take by way of response to the most recent British measures to subsidise industrial employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: Under the employment incentive scheme premiums of £20 and £14 per week for 24 weeks are payable in respect of additional employees recruited by industry.  With regard to the clothing and footwear industries and certain sectors of the textiles industry I would refer the Deputy to the announcement in the budget statement of the intention to introduce an employment maintenance scheme under which payments of £5 per week are to be made in respect of workers in eligible firms in these industries. A draft of the scheme is at present with the EEC authorities.  The scheme will have effect from 3 April 1978 and first payments will be made in July 1978.</P>
      <P>The effects of the British measures on employment in Irish industry and the effectiveness of our own schemes will be carefully watched.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Why is this question not being answered by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to whom it was originally addressed and who has dealt with this topic in the House before now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Surely I am entitled to know why the Minister to whom I addressed this question tossed it like a hot potato to a Minister who never previously has handled this topic in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I realise that questions are passed from hand to hand but usually there is some excuse for it.  In this case there is no excuse, since the Minister to whom I addressed this question previously handled this topic in the House when he had to.  On other occasions he got his Man Friday to do it, but this is the first time that he has pushed the question completely out of his Department, and I want to know why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy should be aware that the temporary employment subsidy scheme will be operated by the Department of Labour. I take it that that is the reason why any such question regarding the operation of the TES scheme will be dealt with by my Department, and that is sufficient reason why I should answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Can the House take it that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is stepping out of the picture as far as this area of operations is concerned, and that the Minister at present on his feet will be handling the matter from now on? Are all questions on this topic to be addressed to this Minister in future? Has the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy no function at all in the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy will recall that in the budget statement in February the operation of a temporary employment subsidy was announced for certain industries, and with the usual co-operation of Ministers of this Government, when details of the scheme had been worked out it was decided then, and understandably so, that the scheme would be operated by the Department of Labour.  That is why the Deputy's question regarding the temporary employment subsidy which had been awaited for so long by Irish industry should be answered from my Department.</P>

    <Col N="12" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: May I leave that topic and move to the substance of the Minister's reply?  The question related to response to the most recent British measure.  Is the Minister aware that six weeks after the budget statement here the Employment Secretary in London announced a new scheme&mdash; that was on March 15&mdash;of industrial employment subsidies?  In that connection is the Minister aware that there is a difference between what the British Minister and his Department say will be the cost of that scheme and what Deputy Burke, Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, said here a month ago?</P>

Will the Minister accept from me that I have heard personally from the Press Officer of the British Department, whom I telephoned, that that information was not correct and that the scheme will still cost £300 million and also that the number of workers supported by the scheme in Britain and at the expense of Irish jobs will increase from 328,000 to 400,000?</P>

In relation to the question put by Deputy Kelly I cannot be held responsible for the comments of any press officer from anywhere other than the one from my Department and certainly not from a British officer.  The new schemes as announced have serious restrictions compared with the previous schemes, those that existed during the Deputy's term in Government when no temporary employment subsidy was given here to these industries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware that, under the restrictions imposed on the functions of the Joint Labour Committee for Agricultural Workers, the second phase of the 1978 National Agreement could be due for payment before the first phase has been fully implemented; and if it is his intention to facilitate the expeditious implementation of the National Agreement to workers employed in a prosperous industry, by the immediate promotion of legislation to suspend section 42 (3) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, where National Agreements are in operation; or alternatively, if legislation will be promoted to enable the Joint Labour Committee for Agricultural Workers to apply the phases in the National Agreement with retrospective effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: The minimum rates of pay and other conditions of employment of agricultural workers are statutorily regulated by employment regulation orders made by the Labour Court on the basis of proposals submitted to them by the Joint Labour Committee.  It is a matter for the committee, who are representative of employer and worker organisations in the agricultural industry, to consider the manner in which the terms of the National Wage Agreement 1978 will be applied to agricultural workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that it is open to the committee to include in proposals to the Labour Court provision for the implementation in one employment <Col N="15" /> regulation order of the two phases of the National Wage Agreement, 1978.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am afraid the Minister has not got the full facts.  Is he not aware that the body charged with the task of fixing the wages cannot meet for six months after the date on which the last wage-fixing agreement was made and that consequently it will be at least 31 July plus a three-week statutory period before, in the normal way, farm workers will receive a weekly increase of £3.50 which, under the National Wage Agreement, they have been entitled to from 1 March? Would the Minister agree either to bring in the necessary legislation or to consider the legislation which the Labour Court have laid down for the purpose of remedying this mistake, a mistake which I admit freely was made when the legislation was going through the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: Any problem that concerns my Department during my term in office and which affects workers will be considered seriously and sympathetically by me.  The Joint Labour committee have the opportunity of making certain arrangements. I am glad that the Deputy referred to the 1976 Act.  Obviously, that was the opportunity to introduce the legislation the Deputy is seeking.  However, hopefully with an early report on the structure of the Labour Court and its ancillary services, including the joint labour committees, it would be premature of me to bring in one narrow piece of legislation in the form sought by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>: I admit that the proper time to have introduced this legislation was when we were putting through the 1976 Act but the advice we got from the Department then was that this legislation was not necessary. We considered it to be necessary and we were proved right and therefore the recommendation of the Department was incorrect.  In these circumstances would the Minister be prepared to go to his officials and ascertain whether they are prepared to cooperate in order to remedy something <Col N="16" /> that was caused mainly by incorrect advice on their part?  At the time I am sure they considered their advice to be correct but the effect of not taking action now to deal with the situation, be it by way of a narrow piece of legislation or anything else, is that farm workers&mdash;the lowest paid workers in the country&mdash;will continue to be left short to the extent of £3.50 per week from 1 March until mid-September at the earliest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy will be aware that the Minister and the Government of the day are responsible for legislation.  I appreciate the problem being raised by the Deputy and I am aware of it.  I have a certain amount of sympathy for the situation but it would be undesirable to bring in narrow legislation within months of possibly more general legislation as a result of a review of the structures that we have at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister will agree that sympathy is a very rare thing but one cannot buy bread with it.  Therefore, his sympathy is not worth anything to the farm workers concerned. I am not making this a political issue but I am putting it to the Minister that he is now getting an opportunity to remedy the situation.  I would ask him to go back to his Department and I am sure the honest men there will admit a mistake has been made and they will try to remedy it as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Details of the scheme (c) were circulated to local authorities on 23 February and they were asked to suggest suitable projects by end of March. The period of effective operation is, therefore, very short.  The number employed on the environmental improvement schemes up to end of April was 250 involving an expenditure of £75,000.  Present projections of employment under the scheme to end of July, however, amount to 1,283.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: The information requested in the Deputy's question is as follows:</P>
      <P>Central Model Boys' School: Nine water-closets, all in working order and nine wash-hand basins with cold water supply.  Last painted in 1974 as part of a major scheme of reconstruction and adaptation.  Figures of cost in respect of painting are not available.</P>
      <P>Central Model Girls' School: Twelve water-closets, all but one in working order.  Twelve wash-hand basins, ten having both hot and cold water supply, two having cold water only.  Accommodation is in prefabricated buildings erected in 1974 and not since painted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Central Model Infants' School: Twelve water-closets, all in working order.  Eleven wash-hand basins with cold water supply.  Last painted <Col N="22" /> internally in 1974 as part of a major scheme of reconstruction and adaptation. Figures of cost in respect of painting are not available.</P>
    <P>Scoil Cholmcille: Seven water-closets, all in working order, Six wash-hand basins with cold water supply. Accommodation in prefabricated buildings erected in 1974 and not since painted.</P>
    <P>Scoil Mhuire: Seventeen water-closets, all but two in working order. Six wash-hand basins with cold water supply, plus one sink having hot and cold water supply.  Last painted, externally, 1973, at a cost of £500; internally, 1976, at a cost of approximately £5,000.</P>
    <P>An Scoil Ghaelach Ullmhúcháin: Eight water-closets, all in working order.  Four wash-hand basins with cold water supply.  Accommodation is in prefabricated classrooms erected in 1974 and not since painted.</P>
    <P>These figures do not, of course, take account of an old toilet block in the school grounds, which is not required nor suitable for use and which is due for demolition and removal.</P>

When I was on the programme referred to by the Deputy I did not refer to this structure because I thought that people might hammer others in that area about it.  I did not say that the block <Col N="23" /> had been vandalised and consequently had been rendered in part dangerous.

    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> The replacement or improvement of school premises is proceeding and is under continuous review in my Department with a view to providing a maximum standard of educational facilities within the limit of resources available.</P>
    <P>Schools lacking modern facilities are, in the main, smaller schools in the one-teacher and two-teacher categories.  Quite a number of them are due to go out of existence as soon as proposals for their absorption into larger school units are effected.  One of the advantages of amalgamation is that physical conditions in the resultant larger schools are generally much better than those which existed in the individual smaller schools involved.</P>
    <P>Last year my Department circularised chairmen of boards of management of national schools notifying them that grants would be available for essential improvements to schools which will continue in existence for a reasonable period. Such improvements would include the installation of water-flushed sanitation, the provision of adequate heating and lighting, the improvement of play spaces and, in certain instances, the making good of minor structural defects which have arisen otherwise than by neglect of normal maintenance. They were informed also that they could arrange for the carrying out of these works on their own initiative in accordance with guidelines issued to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to make a statement for the information of the ouse about my recent visit to the United States for the purpose of addressing the Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly on disarmament.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, most of the heads of state or of Government of the European Economic Community, including President Giscard d'Estaing of France, Mr. Joergensen of Denmark, Chancellor Schmidt of Germany, Mr. Thorn of Luxembourg and Mr. Callaghan of the United Kingdom spoke or are due to speak at the session.  The attendance also include Chancellor Kreisky of Austria, Mr. Trudeau of Canada, Mr. Desai of India, Mr. Fukuda of Japan, Mr. Odvarnordli of Norway and Mr. Ecevit of Turkey.</P>
      <P>I addressed the session in the afternoon of 25 May.  I am having copies of the address laid before the House, for information.  I will, therefore, touch here only on the principal points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The world today spends about $400,000 million annually for military purposes.  This is more than the total spent on education and about 20 times the total aid given by the industrialised countries to the Third World.  Yet 1,000 million people lack adequate <Col N="56" /> housing; 2,800 million are without safe water; and 25,000 people die every day from water-borne diseases.</P>
    <P>The enormity of the tragedy represented by these statistics is not limited or static.  Military expenditure is growing.  The world is engaged in an armaments race.  Each country fears domination by an alien ideology.  The consequence of this is the allocation from national budgets of ever-increasing resources as the fear escalates and technology perfects new instruments of destruction.</P>
    <P>No meeting, even if held under the auspices of so prestigious a body as the United Nations, could, of itself, bring an end to this deadly competition. The essential purpose of the special session is to sharpen public awareness of the dangers, help end the waste and perhaps prevent an escalation which could lead to world annihilation.</P>
    <P>In my contribution, I said that it was important that whatever proposals emerged should be based on consensus and should, as far as possible, impose a limitation by reference to gross national product, on the proportion of resources devoted to armaments. I stressed the necessity for the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and a halt to the qualitative development and refinement of new nuclear and other weapons.</P>
    <P>Following my address, I discussed with Dr. Waldheim, Secretary General of the United Nations, the general problem of disarmament and the situation in the Middle East, with particular referece to the mandate for the United Nations Force in Lebanon.  I also took the opportunity of telling him of developments in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I availed of the opportunity afforded by my visit to put before the American people our views on the situation in Northern Ireland.  I stressed, particularly, the dangers that lay in the way of any movement towards further integration with the United Kingdom and the necessity for a new political initiative in the area as a counter to terrorism.  I mentioned our belief that the way forward lay in the encouragement by the British Government of <Col N="57" /> the coming together of the Irish people, in reconciliation, and under agreed structures.  I said that in advance of such initiative we would support the idea of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland, based on power-sharing, participation, or partnership &mdash;however described&mdash;which both sections of the community in Northern Ireland found acceptable.</P>
    <P>These views are based on the necessity, for the sake of all the people of our island, of ending the waste in human and economic terms involved in the present situation.  The cost to the United Kingdom Government in 1977 of sustaining Northern Ireland was well over £800 million.  The cost to the Irish Exchequer, since the troubles began, is now approaching £200 million.  These are simply cash figures and do not reflect the other economic costs, like lost tourism, lost employment and lost opportunities in Ireland, North and South.  The real tragedy, which cannot be summarised, is in the human suffering, and in the bitter divisions which violence accentuates.</P>
    <P>I stressed that economic growth in this part of the island over the past decade or so has brought us to a point where average gross domestic product per head here is now probably about the same as that in Northern Ireland, if it is not more.  I emphasised the community interest, of both parts of Ireland, in the industrial, competition, agricultural, regional and social policies of the European Economic Communities. I stressed, above all, our interest in progress by discussion and in co-operation, with the people of Northern Ireland.  We have a common interest, in this island, in the achievement of a just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland&mdash;and in the political stability on which all economic and social progress ultimately depends.</P>
    <P>The third major purpose of my visit was to discuss with business leaders in the United States the prospects for investment here.  I told them of the economic advances of recent years, of the progress we were making which put us at the head of the growth league in the European Economic Communities and among the leaders in the wider forum of the OECD countries, <Col N="58" /> both in 1977 and probably in 1978. I mentioned the success we were having in reducing inflation&mdash;from a rate of more than 20 per cent in a recent year to a figure estimated to be of the order of 6 or 7 per cent in the year to the present month.  I emphasised the importance of American investment in Ireland, where it represents over 50 per cent of all investment from abroad, and approximately 15 per cent to 20 per cent of industrial employment here.</P>
    <P>This investment does not deprive Americans of jobs.  It is simply a means of access by American companies to markets which they could not otherwise reach.  The investment benefits them, benefits us and benefits the Communities, of which we are a part, in the employment it gives, in the new and sophisticated products it brings to the market, and in the access it gives in turn to other markets and opportunities.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I was anxious to indicate, now that five years of membership of the European Economic Communities have passed, just what that membership has meant to us.  Over that period our total exports to the countries of the Community on mainland Europe have increased by approximately 600 per cent.  Similarly, our imports from the other eight member countries of the Community have risen by percentages measures in multiples of one hundred.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anyone in this House is so naive as to expect that a visit over a period of a few days could be sufficient to bring concrete decisions on new investments.  I do not intend to list this firm or that firm as having decided to come here as a result of my visit.  I went to the United States to describe the economic background and to emphasise our welcome for new investment.  The results will be seen, not in spectacular announcements immediately on my return, but in what happens over the next year or so.</P>
    <P>Finally, I took the opportunity afforded by my visit to thank the leaders of the Irish-American community in America for their understanding and support of Irish Government <Col N="59" /> policies, particularly on Northern Ireland.  I met with Speaker O'Neill, Senators Kennedy and Moynihan and Governor Carey and had extremely useful and constructive discussions with them in relation to the North and to the question of American investment and certain tax problems.  I would like to place on record now, in this House, the appreciation of the Irish Government of the statement by President Carter in August 1977, and of the courage and effort of the distinguished public representatives I met for their help in spreading understanding among the Irish community in the United States of the complex problems with which we have to deal in relation to Northern Ireland, and of the necessity for progress there to be based on reconciliation among the people of this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: On behalf of my party I should like to give the fullest support to the Taoiseach's stance on the disarmament issues that came up for discussion and the particular positions he took on them.  It is a tragedy that possibly because of Soviet activities in Africa and the expansion <i>inter alia</i> of the Soviet Navy these developments now seem perhaps to be leading to second thoughts on <i>détente</i> and, at the very moment when the Disarmament Conference is taking place, to a heightening of tension and a danger that the movement will be in the opposite direction.  Anything that we can do, as a small nation with few armaments, to support the principle of disarmament we should do and I am glad the Taoiseach has spoken for us on this issue.</P>
      <P>I hope the Taoiseach will be successful in his industrial contacts in face of the difficulties that have been caused I am afraid by the mishandling by some of his Ministers of the Ferenka and the telecommunication disputes.  In what he said I noted he placed great reliance on the state of the economy as it was handed over by our Government and that is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> I should like to congratulate him on the firmness and clarity of his statements with regard to aid to the IRA and I should like in particular to deplore a malicious and false report in one of our newspapers that the Taoiseach's remarks about Congressman Biaggi earlier this year and what he said during this recent visit had increased support for the <i>ad hoc</i> committee in Congress.  My information is that the exact opposite is true and that the clarity of the Taoiseach's statement earlier this year and what he said in the United States has diminished greatly support for this committee.  I have heard that at a recent meeting only three people turned up.  I think it a pity that a newspaper here should publish a report stating what would appear to be the exact opposite to the truth and casting reflection on the efficacy of the work done by the Taoiseach and by the previous Government in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>I shall be glad to reinforce his stance on this matter during my forthcoming visit to the United States in ten days' time and, regardless of domestic differences on economic policy, to reinforce his efforts to encourage US investment in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: On behalf of the Labour Party I should like to welcome the statement made by the Taoiseach. When the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Frank Cluskey, visits the United States next week, he will cojoin with the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Fine Gael Party in emphasising the united approach here this afternoon.  We are concerned about the proposals relating to disarmament. The Labour Party still think that there is an element of double thinking at international level in that regard. On the one hand, we have pious expressions of concern for disarmament by many countries.  We are not in a position to trade in arms.  Simultaneously those countries indulge in a sordid export of military equipment. It should not be forgotten by the people of this country or by our political parties here that many of those countries making those pious enunciations still indulge in that kind of trade <Col N="61" /> and are quite prepared to avail of military expenditures to protect, in particular, their powerful economic interests. I only refer to the French in Zaire in that regard, if one wants to have a classic recent example.  One has to take the UN declaration on disarmament with a certain amount of candid cynicism.  This in no way undermines the influence of the Taoiseach's statement from this country because in Ireland we can regard ourselves as having clean hands in this particular world issue.</P>
      <P>With regard to the United Nations peace-keeping forces in the Lebanon the Labour Party are pleased to note the assurances received directly by the Taoiseach from the Secretary General of the UN that the PLO will co-operate with the United Nations to the greatest possible extent.  I hope that those assurances which were sought by the Taoiseach in his visit to the United Nations will be honoured fully by Yasser Arafat because they are of critical importance in view of the substantial Irish UN presence in this area.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party are satisfied that the Taoiseach has been quite unambiguous during the course of his visit on a number of aspects of Northern policy and, in particular, on the provision of funds by Irish-Americans for the relief of distress in Northern Ireland.  It is interesting to note that the Taoiseach at one of the receptions said that the mere withdrawal of Britain would not of itself unite Irish men and women divided by a legacy of bitterness and mutual fear and distrust.  I feel that kind of approach should be stressed not merely on visits to the United Nations but should also be stressed at party political meetings within the domestic framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach pointed out that of all investment in this country now some 50 per cent of it comes from America and that 15 per cent to 20 per cent of industrial employment is provided by American companies.  It is time that the House took stock of the impact of that particular statistic because the slightest change of policy in internal <Col N="62" /> American investment or export credit policies and tax policies will have a major impact on Irish employment and on the Irish industrial framework. The Labour Party, with that reservation, urge that we consider diversifying our investment base, not having it entirely dependent on one economy, that we should seek greater diversification and greater domestic strength within our Irish-based manufacturing industries because otherwise there could be catastrophic repercussions if American policy were to change dramatically.  That is something over which we have little influence in the long run.  On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the entirely useful and productive visit of the Taoiseach to the United States on 23 to 28 May.</P>

      <P>: It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 7 (Resumed), 5 and 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I wish to raise a point of order which I believe affects in a very significant way the rights of the Opposition and the freedom of debate in this House.  I am asking you for a formal ruling on the interpretation of Standing Order 88, paragraph (3).  This Standing Order is a relatively recent amendment to the earlier Standing Orders arising from a report of the Informal Committee on Reform of Dáil Procedure, chaired by the present Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, Prl. 2904, published in January 1973.  Paragraph 23 of this report says that the leave of the House is necessary for the introduction of every Bill and went on to say that the main effect of this procedure was that many efforts by private Members to initiate proposals for legislation failed on First Stage so that the proposals <Col N="63" /> were neither printed nor circulated to Members and not considered by the House on their merits.  They said that later in their report they were going to propose that a limited number of Private Members' Bills could be initiated without leave of the House.</P>
      <P>This proposal was put forward in paragraph 49 which said:</P>
      <P>As the leave of the House is required to introduce a Bill the Government can, if it so decides, normally defeat a private Members' Bill on First Stage.  In that event the Bill is not printed and the Member concerned is deprived of an opportunity of having his Bill discussed by the House on its merits. Many private Members' Bills are defeated on First Stage.  While we do not accept that all private Members' Bills should be printed irrespective of the prospects of time being found to debate them on Second Stage&mdash;</P>
      <P>I emphasise the words that follow:</P>
      <P>we believe it to be unfair that in all cases the private Member must in effect be dependent on the Government to secure a second reading debate in private Members' time. In paragraph 22 we have recommended that a Bill presented by a Member of the Government may be printed and circulated before it comes before the House on First Stage when all that will be required is the making of an order for its second reading.  We recommend that a private Member should also be allowed to present a Bill in this fashion provided he is nominated for that purpose by the group (within the meaning of Standing Order 86 (1) to which he belongs.</P>
      <P>I emphasise the next words:</P>
      <P>It will then be up to the group to avail of its right in rotation to nominate the Member to move the second reading if it desires to secure the appropriate priority in Private Members' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is perfectly clear from this that the committee decided to eliminate the <Col N="64" /> dependence on Government agreement for the Second Reading of Private Members' Bills in Private Members' time when these have the support of a group.  They intended to leave the timing of the introduction of such Bills entirely to the group in question &ldquo;availing of its rights in rotation to secure the appropriate priority in Private Members' time.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The committee proposed to do this by introducing a new standing order. This standing order was introduced by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which clearly intended to give effect to this recommendation, the new standing order being Standing Order 88 (3) which reads:</P>
    <P>A member of the Government, Parliamentary Secretary or a private member nominated for the purpose under Standing Order 85 (2) may present a Bill without previously obtaining leave of the House and any Bill so presented shall be printed and an Order for its second reading shall be made.</P>
    <P>I raise with you the question of the significance and meaning of this.  It seems to me that the wording of this is peremptory.  I ask that you, in considering the interpretation of this, bear in mind the intention of the informal committee and the obvious desire of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to give effect to it.  If in fact the significance attached to the words &ldquo;that an Order for its Second Reading shall be made&rdquo; were to be that this order was to be made by the House and that the House could reject such an order, then this would be contrary to reason and it would vitiate the whole purpose of the recommendation of the committee and so it does not seem to me to be a reading or an interpretation of 88 (3) that would stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges were never given to understand, and does not understand it to intend, that anyone by using this wording could in effect subvert totally the clearly stated intention of the informal committee whose recommendation they thought they were implementing.  I should, therefore, like to submit to you, a Cheann Comhairle, <Col N="65" /> that, first, the order contemplated in Standing Order 88 (3) is not an order of the House but an order to be made by you and, secondly, and alternatively, in the event of your ruling in a negative manner on that point, the House is required by its own Standing Order to make the order in question.</P>
    <P>On the first point, namely, that the order in question here is an order to be made by you, rather than by the House, the only relevant provision appears to me to be Standing Order 87 (1), which provides for decisions of the Dáil to take the form of resolution, order or initiation of a Bill and paragraph (3) provides that the matters that may be dealt with shall include &ldquo;the printing of Bills&rdquo;.  It says &ldquo;include&rdquo;. It does not say &ldquo;comprise&rdquo;.  In fact, nowhere in Standing Orders is it required that all matters that may be dealt with by order are matters for decision by the Dáil and neither does the Constitution so require.  Moreover, Standing Order 88 (3) is still governed by Standing Order 88 (1), which refers to procedure in relation to the First Stage of Bills as requiring the title of every Bill and a short description of its purpose prepared by the proposer&mdash;and I quote&mdash;&ldquo;and accepted by the Ceann Comhairle, shall appear on the Order Paper&rdquo;.  The criteria for its acceptance by the Ceann Comhairle are specifically laid down but, by implication, would appear to be that he is satisfied that the provisions of Standing Order 85, relating to the group responsible for proposing the Bill, have been complied with together with other provisions relating to revenue, <i>et cetera</i>.  Once the Ceann Comhairle is satisfied that these have been satisfied, it would appear the Ceann Comhairle has no function but to accept the Bill.  Having accepted it, the words of 88 (3) &ldquo;shall be printed&rdquo; are incapable of any other meaning than that the printing shall immediately take place.  Moreover, I submit that, consequent on printing, the order must be made.  There is nothing either in Standing Orders or in the Constitution requiring that such an order come before the Dáil.  The order automatically follows 88 (3) provided the provisions of 88 (1) have been complied <Col N="66" /> with just as the official journals are prepared by virtue of the operation of Standing Orders themselves.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that Standing Order 85 (4) provides&mdash;I am omitting irrelevant words relating to motions&mdash; that at least ten days prior to the date on which a Stage of a Bill is taken in the Dáil the Members nominated by a group shall indicate to the Ceann Comhairle the Stage of the Bill to be taken and the Ceann Comhairle will give the Bill appropriate precedence in the Private Members' Business on the Order Paper.  This Standing Order makes specific provision for the Ceann Comhairle to order the taking of the Bill in a particular period of Private Members' time.  It does not give the Dáil any function in the matter.</P>
    <P>I therefore submit that the correct course of action in relation to Private Members' Bills submitted under Standing Order 88 (3) is for the Ceann Comhairle, the Bill having been printed, to make an order for its Second Reading in Private Members' time in accordance with the priority indicated by the relevant Member of the particular group.  The only alternative interpretation of this new Standing Order, which was intended to liberalise the procedures for Private Members' Bills, would be that the House is required automatically to make such an order.  If neither of these interpretations were accepted, then the effect of the new Standing Order 88 (3) would be the exact opposite of the intention of those who introduced it, namely, it would have the effect of preventing any debate at all on Bills introduced by this new and allegedly liberalising procedure, even the five minutes' speech permitted on a contested First Reading under the older procedure, which has survived in Standing Order 88 (2).</P>
    <P>I therefore ask the Chair to rule in my favour on one or both of these points.  Failure to do so would entirely vitiate the purpose of this new Standing Order and would have the effect of permitting the Government preventing any debate whatever taking place on a Private Members' Bill introduced by the new procedure, a <Col N="67" /> procedure specifically designed to overcome what the informal committee described as the unfair character of the older arrangement under which a Private Member was dependent on the Government to secure a Second Reading in Private Members' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I permitted the Deputy to make an unduly long statement.  I am afraid I cannot agree to either of the two alternatives he submitted.  The procedure, so far as the Chair is concerned, is clearcut and has a precedent; but even without that precedent, I still find Standing Orders quite clear and unambiguous.  Without going into any great length about the history of this, the reform committee sought to do something in order to remove an amomaly in the previous Standing Orders&mdash;that was that frequently the Second Reading was refused without anybody ever having seen the Bill.  This was manifestly an anomaly and the new Standing Order now permits the Bill to be printed.</P>
      <P>The Second Stage must be proceeded with by order&mdash;&ldquo;An Order shall be made&rdquo;.  The Ceann Comhairle does not make orders and the phrase &ldquo;An Order shall be made&rdquo; has appeared in Standing Orders from the first day on which Standing Orders came into being.  &ldquo;An Order shall be made for the Third Stage&rdquo;; &ldquo;an Order shall be made for the Fourth Stage&rdquo;; &ldquo;an Order shall be made for the Fifth Stage&rdquo;&mdash;these words appear frequently in Standing Orders and they mean an order of the House.  In the past such orders have frequently been contested and opposed and carried only by a vote of the House. &ldquo;An Order shall be made&rdquo;&mdash;it does not say, as Deputy FitzGerald argued, that an order must be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Standing Order 87 (3) it is clearly set out that the order is an order of the House.  It is not the Ceann Comhairle who makes an order.  It is the Dáil.  I am, therefore, ruling accordingly.  The procedure to be adopted here&mdash;the Bill has been initiated by the Fine Gael Party in the name of Deputy Deasy&mdash;will be for Deputy Deasy to move that the Second Stage be taken in Private <Col N="68" /> Members' time.  There has been a precedent for this within the last few years.  There was a precedent set in 1976.  My ruling is in accordance with past procedure.</P>

      <P>: If the Deputy wants to go into legalistics, well and good. It is a well-known maxim of law&mdash;I am sure Deputy Kelly will agree with it&mdash;that legislation or orders made <Col N="69" /> under legislation are interpreted by the courts exactly as they are expressed and the courts do not go behind that expression to find out what the intention of the legislation was.</P>
      <P>If Deputy FitzGerald wants to fix me on the strict interpretation of rules, that is the interpretation of what legislation is when it comes before the courts.  I am not agreeing by any means with what Deputy FitzGerald says the intention of the committee was, but no matter what the intention of the Legislature was, the interpretation is exactly as expressed or as it should be expressed. I believe, Sir, you were right in your interpretation.</P>
      <P>If what Deputy FitzGerald says is correct, the House is bound to discuss and debate the Second Reading of a Bill no matter what its content, no matter how obnoxious, no matter how irrelevant to or inconsistent with the tenets to which this House should have regard.  If Deputy FitzGerald wants to follow the ordinary rules and take the Bill his colleague has before the House, we will have no objection notwithstanding the fact that we will have a much more comprehensive Bill which is necessary and is in the course of preparation to be taken in the ordinary course of preference under Standing Order 85 (4).</P>

      <P>: Would the Ceann Comhairle reconsider his ruling since he indicated there was no precedent for what is being proposed?  As Ceann Comhairle you must be aware that there was exactly the same precedent in relation to a Fisheries Bill introduced by the then Opposition.  An order was requested by the then Opposition to have it transferred into Private Members' Time.  We are not asking to have this Bill taken during Government time.  The then Ceann Comhairle, in consultation with his staff, ruled clearly that the then Government would have to make time available for the Bill to be taken in Private Members' Time.  We are not asking the Ceann Comhairle to invade the Government's time.  We are asking that a Bill be transferred into Private Members' Time for debate.  I served <Col N="70" /> as a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which specifically amended that section of Standing Orders.  This nullifies and destroys the very purpose for which we amended Standing Orders to enable the Second Stage of Private Members' Bills to be debated in Private Members' Time.

    <Title>Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1978: Second Stage (Resumed) and Subsequent Stages .</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Fine Gael Party fully support this Bill to make an extra £500 million available to the Local Loans Fund.  I am sure it will not prove half as contentious as the issue certain people have been discussing for the past while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> Making available an extra £500 million is an indication of the huge price increases which have taken place since this Government took office.  It is a good thing that this money is being made available for these essential services.  As the Minister of State said, this money is the principal source of capital available to local authorities for a number of projects and to the regional health boards, vocational education committees and harbour authorities for the provision of water and sewerage facilities.  It provides finance for county councils.</P>
    <P>In 1974 when a similar Bill was before the House, Deputy Colley on behalf of the then Opposition, was very critical of the £400 million being sought at that time.  When does the Minister anticipate it will be necessary for a Minister to come before the House again seeking a further allocation? I have certain ideas about this matter.  Rather than having a debate on the Local Loans Fund every few years, in my view it would be better to give Members an annual opportunity of expressing their views on this matter.</P>
    <P>Local authorities rely heavily on this fund but since Fianna Fáil took office there has been a lack of emphasis on the public sector.  Ministers, Deputies and Senators on the Government side are not alone trying to encourage people to get involved in the private housing sector but they are telling them that it is a proper thing to do.  They are getting away from their responsibility as a Government which is to provide houses for people who cannot afford to build their own.  The average price of houses has increased by 19.2 per cent since the Government took office&mdash;that information was given in answer to a question on 26 February 1978&mdash;and when one considers that one will realise that the £500 million referred to in this Bill will not last long.  The grant of £1,000 for new houses which was part of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto has been gobbled up many times by inflation since last June.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that local authorities must rely on the Local Loans Fund to cater for the VECs to <Col N="74" /> a certain extent.  In that direction there has been a decrease in the amount of money available from £4 million to £3.9 million for 1978.  There has also been a reduction of a little less than £1 million in the area of primary education.  The Minister for Education when he was interviewed on television by Michael Heeney recently said that his aim was similar to that of the INTO in regard to the provision of new schools and the repairing of others.  If there is a decrease in the allocation for primary schools I cannot see how the Minister can contend that his aim is similar to that of the INTO.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: Was the Deputy referring to a decrease in relation to primary schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are getting away from the terms of the Bill.  It is a limited Bill and we cannot discuss in detail every aspect of public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The debate was not that limited when this matter was discussed before.  I read that debate and saw that those who contributed covered a wide area.</P>
      <P>There is a great need for eliminating a lot of red tape which must be gone through to get money from this fund. For instance, a health board anxious to avail of the fund must first apply to the Department of Health who in turn must refer the application to the Office of Public Works.  The Office of Public Works then refer the application to the Department of Finance. The same position applies in relation to harbour boards, educational authorities and all others anxious to avail of the fund.  The Minister should devise a method of short-circuiting his system in order to eliminate a lot of the red tape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that £28.6 million was sought from the Local Loans Fund this year and £22.6 million was allocated. The Minister should look into this matter.  I support the measure but I must complain about the lack of expenditure by local authorities on sewerage and other schemes.  There is little sense in making £500 million available <Col N="75" /> if local authorities must wait a long time before a decision is reached on their applications.  Invariably, such applications are not granted.  There is a long list of rural towns in my constituency seeking assistance from this fund for sewerage schemes and they have been given the standard answer that the money is not available for those schemes.  It is my hope that future applicants will be given assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: We welcome the Bill and feel that for the time being the limits proposed are reasonable. There was an increase for 1977-78 of £36 million but we have no indication of what the position will be in 1979. The increased capacity of an additional £500 million should mean that there will be reasonable accommodation available for the next four or five years. We must emphasise that the previous administration, particularly during 1973-74, drew heavily from that fund. I hope that that pace of withdrawal will continue although I am apprehensive about it doing so.  I am a member of Dublin County Council and I am aware that over the years we drew heavily from that fund.  Should there be any major cutback on public expenditure, as is foreshadowed, withdrawals from the fund will substantially diminish. The amount referred to in the Bill should be adequate for the life of this Dáil and it should be an incentive to local authorities to avail of the money. We do not cavil with the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome the Bill. It is a sign that we are being constructive when we welcome such a measure. I remember 1974, to which other speakers referred.  At that time Deputy Colley said he supported the measure and supposed it was an indication of the extent to which inflation had gripped our economy that the Minister was obliged to come into the House with a proposal to increase the maximum figure allowable by £400 million, whereas the previous increase, after a period of four years, raised the maximum limit by £200 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> At that time it was described as inflation.  Today, the Minister of State, Mr. Wyse, described it as an indication of the improvement of work because of increased loans.  Having made that statement in 1974, I am not surprised that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, is not in the House now.  In fairness to him, he could not possibly sit over there today and tell us that he was sincere in looking for the £500 million without admitting that inflation is very high.</P>
    <P>In 1974 the price of houses, the ceiling on loans, and the ceiling on supplementary grants were widely discussed. Today the loans have been increased but that increase has found its way into the hands of the builders instead of into the hands of those who are trying to build their own homes. The Government have not taken action to put a ceiling on the price of houses. Last night I met a person who informed me that cement blocks have increased by £25 per thousand in three weeks.</P>
    <P>In fairness, the people on the other side should admit that they have now realised that we had inflation and a recession.  The only consolation left to the people is that there was a change of Government in 1973.  What would have happened to the unfortunate house seekers between 1973 and 1977 if we had pursued the policy of the present Government?  People are asking why the price of houses is not being controlled.  How could we control the price of houses when the price is too high as far as the builders are concerned?  There is a group known as the Tacateers who are associated with the building industry and the unfortunate people are asked to make their contributions.  Fianna Fáil cannot introduce a ceiling on the price of houses.</P>
    <P>We have heard much of the £1,000 grant but that grant has gone into the pocket of the builders and of the Tacateers.  I ask the Government and the Minister to admit the truth and tell us what is happening.  If any of the Ministers were sentenced for sincerity they would be wrongly imprisoned.  Never in our history has there been so much insincerity from the Government benches.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> It is maddening to read the 1974 speeches on inflation.  That remark also applies to the second House.  I am not allowed to mention the second House, but I will say that this Government have stabbed the people who are seeking houses in the back.  It is well known down the country that the Government cannot control house prices because there was a certain guarantee for certain people to start building at a certain price, which cannot be reduced.  To prove my argument you will not hear any of our Ministers speaking about control of house prices.  When he was in Opposition the Minister spoke frequently of the price of houses, cement and other building materials. I want to make it clear that the thousands of people down the country are not being codded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is a limited Bill.  We are talking about financing the local loans fund.  I appreciate the remarks made by some of the speakers in welcoming the increase.  Any member of a local authority will naturally welcome any increase in the local loans fund.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan said we should have a review of the matter in 12 months.  I do not believe that is necessary because there will be sufficient money for the next three years.  However, if a review is necessary the Government will review the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>: I see the Deputy's point but he can always avail of a discussion on the Estimates for the Departments responsible for drawing from the fund.  It would be no harm to avail of those debates to ask for a review.  I am quite satisfied that the money made available to the local loans fund will be sufficient for three years.  If not, the matter can be reviewed.</P>
      <P>The last speaker went into the area of local government rather than finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> I am glad the Bill was welcomed and I am sure it will be welcomed throughout the country.  I hope the money will be availed of by the local authorities. Deputy Donnellan raised the question of confusion and delay in payment. Those of us who are members of local authorities know that we are often responsible for delays in paying local funds.  As far as my Department are concerned, there will not be any delays in financing worthwhile projects.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the Protocol for the Fourth Extension of the Food Aid Convention 1971 which has been laid before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Food Aid Convention 1971, which is part of the International Wheat Agreement, was originally established for a period of three years which expired on 30 June 1974.  Under the terms of the Treaty of Accession to the European Communities, Ireland was obliged to accede to the Food Aid Convention because the original member states and the European Economic Community as such were parties to it. We did so in June 1973.  In June 1974 and June 1975, with the approval of Dáil Éireann, we deposited Declarations of Provisional Application of Protocols for one-year extensions of the convention.  In 1976, again with Dáil approval, we deposited a Declaration of Provisional Application of a Protocol for a further two year extension of the convention until 30 June 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent conference under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was held in Geneva for the purpose of establishing a new Food Aid Convention. However, the conference failed to complete the necessary <Col N="79" /> arrangements in time and will now be re-convened in September.  Meanwhile, in order to maintain a food aid programme for developing countries, the Food Aid Committee&mdash;which administers the Food Aid Convention&mdash;decided that the present convention should be extended for a further year. On 23 March, the Council of Ministers decided that the member states of the Community should participate in this one year extension and accordingly Ireland, together with our EEC partners, signed the Protocol for the Fourth Extension of the Food Aid Convention on 17 May 1978.  Given Dáil approval, Ireland will have until 23 June to deposit the final instruments of ratification.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Food Aid Convention is to carry out a food aid programme in cereals, mainly wheat, for the benefit of developing countries. The countries party to the convention, apart from the Community, are Argentina, Australia, Canada, Finland, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and the USA.  Under the convention and its protocols the Community has undertaken to supply 1,287,000 tonnes of cereals as its minimum annual contribution in the form of wheat, coarse grains or derivative products suitable for human consumption.  This contribution is discharged partly by the Community from their own resources and partly by the member states in accordance with a fixed scale.  For 1978-79 Ireland's share is 0.54 per cent of that part discharged by the member states, which amounts to 3,060 tonnes.</P>
    <P>Ireland's national contribution under the Food Aid Convention is channelled through the World Food Programme and, in the current year, the Government have allocated a sum of £500,000 in the Vote for the Department of Agriculture for the discharge of this obligation.</P>
    <P>The provision of a food-aid programme in cereals for the benefit of developing countries is to be of major importance in the field of development assistance.  Unfortunately, food production in these countries falls well below requirements due to a combination of inadequate agricultural development, <Col N="80" /> international economic dislocation and natural disasters.  The international community has, however, begun to recognise that priority must now be given to increased and more efficient agricultural production in the developing countries themselves.  The recent establishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, to which the Government have pledged a sum of £570,000 over a three-year period, is a significant step in this direction. The fund is now operational and should do much to tackle these vast and serious problems of underdevelopment. In the meantime, however, it is generally recognised that short and medium-term programmes of food aid are indispensable if many more millions of people in the Third World are not to become the victims of starvation and disease.  The Government, therefore, fully support the further extension of the Food Aid Convention and accordingly I recommend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am sure the Minister of State anticipates our agreement from the Opposition benches to this motion.  However, I should like to use the opportunity to make a few brief remarks in support of the motion. Small and all as is Ireland's aid to the developing, hungry Third World, it is important that we make our contribution. This contribution, under the Food Aid Convention, is one of the smaller contributions we now make.  We are making more significant forms of assistance available in other sectors.  I was particularly glad that the Minister of State mentioned what I would regard as the more positive aspect of our aid, that is, to give technological advice and specific assistance to helping the underdeveloped world to develop its own capacity to feed itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a country like ours, which suffered for over a century from the serious consequences of a natural disaster affecting our principal food supply, of course we should be immediately and very significantly touched by natural disasters which afflict particularly the arid countries of the world, as a consequence of which sometimes tens of millions of people can be plunged into conditions of most appalling hunger <Col N="81" /> and malnutrition.  This is not an unusual phenomenon.</P>
    <P>Hardly a year passes by that there are not serious natural disasters affecting hundreds of thousands and, indeed, unfortunately, millions and tens of millions of people.  Because they are remote in far-flung parts of the world whose names we sometimes have difficulty even in pronouncing it takes a great deal of effort for people here to comprehend the degree of misery which these natural disasters can generate.  Were it not for the fact that we have so many hundreds and thousands of Irish people abroad assisting the needy&mdash;because of their personal dedication to bringing physical and spiritual aid to the less well-off in the world&mdash;we would probably know a great deal less notwithstanding the very significant strides that have been made in the area of international communications.</P>
    <P>There is not in an economic way a direct benefit to Ireland arising out of its participation in the Food Aid Convention because, as the Minister of State pointed out, the Food Aid Convention is an extension of the International Wheat Agreement which distributes food gains from those countries which have a surplus to export. It is very seldom that Ireland finds itself in that position.  We had a temporary surplus of barley last year but, by and large, we are importers of food grains.  It is an appalling comment on man's inability sensibly to order his own affairs.  It is also a reflection on man's inhumanity to man that there can be in the developed, better-off sections of the world, huge surpluses of grain sometimes destroyed or fed to animals rather than being distributed to tens of millions of people who could benefit greatly by their consumption.</P>
    <P>We should not consider the need for aid to arise only when famine and extreme suffering arise.  There are nearly 200 million people in the world who do not receive at any time during their lives anything that could be regarded as sufficient to maintain them in a decent state of health.  Yet there are countries, of which we happen to be one of the fortunate members, in the developed world who from time to <Col N="82" /> time consider that they have mountains of good foodstuffs of which they cannot dispose.  The reality is that the developed countries will never dispose of these food surpluses&mdash;as they are called&mdash;until such time as there is generated in the Third World, in the developing, impoverished nations of today, a capacity to consume those surpluses. If only we were to treble the existing consumpion of the Third World then the developed world, of which we are lucky to be members, would enjoy a state of wealth unprecedented in the history of mankind simply by disposing of its present surpluses at the cost of production.</P>
    <P>Those are the economic and social arguments that can be advanced for subscribing to the fourth extension of the Food Aid Convention.  But there is a very serious military aspect to this.  One must be struck these days very deeply by the acceleration of the arms race.  The last two years have seen a frightful acceleration in the inclination of all states, wealthy and poor, to devote more and more of inadequate resources to the development of arms with the intention of using them for the destruction of their enemies, or potential or suspected enemies.  One of the enemies which undoubtedly will threaten a neglectful developed and wealthy world is the threat of the hungry hundreds of millions who are not going to accept indefinitely as their lot in this world the hunger and misery which the present world order seems to assign to them.  While people might be smug enough to believe that their existing wealth and strength will prevent any world revolution against them, the history of mankind down the centuries would contradict that supposition. Again and again we have had revolutions by the dispossessed and the underprivileged against forces and powers which seem to be secure, and what happened yesterday can happen again tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Where the alternative is to live on in misery or to strike outwards into adjoining areas of apparent wealth, the tendency for mankind, as for the animal world, is to break through the barriers which surround them and <Col N="83" /> seek the promised land.  Therefore, it ought to be regarded as sensible for the developed world in its own interests to help the Third World. I do not offer that as the principal reason why assistance should be given. The principal reason is obviously the moral obligation which lies on those of us who are better off to help those who have not the capacity to sustain their own life at acceptable standards; but if altruism does not move people, selfishness might.  It is important that legislation should bring the argument of self-interest before people in this and every other environment in which the elected representatives of free democratic societies speak.</P>
    <P>I therefore commend this proposal which the Minister of State has made to the House and to the people of Ireland seeking their support.  It is regrettable that the number of states who have subscribed to this Food Aid Convention, 1971, is limited.  I think I am right in saying that no countries from the Comecon areas are subscribers to this Food Aid convention. I know they have huge difficulties with their own harvests and serious failings in their own economic systems, and they have failed to produce surpluses which could be given in food aid to the undeveloped world.  But they have the same capacity as we have to contribute money, and that is all that Ireland has to give to this food aid convention.  We have not surplus food which other subscribers to this convention have.  However, we should urge here and elsewhere that those who have not the surplus food grains but have the capacity to give aid&mdash;in money or in some other form&mdash;should do so as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: I wish to make a number of points on behalf of the Labour Party with regard to this motion.  The Minister of State might be able to clarify some of the questions when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a limited motion asking us in a sense to extend a convention for another year and we have no objection to that.  We are concerned that this is the fourth extension and that the process of getting a proper short-term <Col N="84" /> food-aid programme started and properly organised is not as close as we would like it to be.  We urge the Government and the Minister to try to get some resolution as a result of this extension so that he does not have to come back this time next year looking for a fifth extension to the convention.  I am sure that all sides of the House will support that.</P>
    <P>Our concern is that the Community &mdash;and we relate to this convention because we are members of that Community&mdash;have not been very good in the area of food aid generally, and specifically with regard to cereals.  A European Parliament working document dated 15 November 1976 entitled Document 407/76 reviews the three-year indicative food aid programme for 1977 to 1979 inclusive.  It states on page 9 that the European Community alone among the major donors have not so far responded to the call for an increase in food aid in cereals. In this document the figure for cereals for 1976 is given as 1,287,000 tons, and the same figure is quoted in the speech of the Minister of State.  I would, perhaps mistakenly, conclude from this document that the three-year indicative food aid programme for the Community has specified a minimum annual target of 1.650 million tons. Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the position on that.</P>
    <P>The Community in the view of their own parliamentarians have not a good record in the matter of increasing their supply of cereals to the Third World. Let us be honest about the attitude towards food aid in many countries. It has been seen largely as a way of off-loading surpluses to the hungry of the rest of the world without a lot of regard to the dietary needs of the hungry but with a hell of a regard to the base market price for cereals in the producer countries.  The apparent goodwill of the donor countries when analysed can be seen frequently to be dominated as much by their necessity to preserve market price levels as by response to the pressure for revolutionary changes that Deputy Ryan outlined in his contribution.</P>
    <P>The terms of this motion are specific and it is not my intention nor, Sir, <Col N="85" /> your desire that we would broaden it. Having regard to this request for an extension to the breakdown of the north-south dialogue with regard to food aid generally and the obvious necessity to get an effective food aid programme of a mid-term kind operating out of the Community, with a conscious food policy as distinct from the offloading of surpluses, we urge the Minister and the Government to bring the views of this side of the House to the convention and to the various organisations involved in the food aid programme generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am grateful to the various Deputies who have contributed.  As was pointed out by the Opposition spokesman, Deputy Ryan, there is no controversy about what we are dealing with. In relation to the fourth extension of the Food Aid Convention, 1971, as Deputy Ryan has rightly pointed out, this is a small aspect of the overall aid programme from this country.  It is, nevertheless, a very important part of our programme.</P>
      <P>On the question of sending food aid, and aid generally, to developing countries, while some countries may not be motivated by altruism the same countries may well be motivated by self-interest. However, in the final analysis, it is fair to say that our aid programme is motivated by concern for Third World endeavour, by idealism and by a will to help the less well-off sections of the nations of the earth. But the goodwill which emanates from these countries to Ireland in the context of world aid generally cannot be under-estimated.  We have a very good reputation in this regard.  I agree totally with Deputy Ryan's remarks in relation to the question of world food aid and the arms race.  The comparison is significant.  To say the least, it is a rather horrific comparison when one recalls part of the Taoiseach's statement today which was as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The world today spends about $400,000 million annually for military purposes.  This is more than the total spent on education and about 20 times the total aid given <Col N="86" /> by the industrialised countries to the Third World.  Yet 1,000 million people lack adequate housing; 2,800 million are without safe water; and 25,000 people die every day from water-borne diseases.</P>
    <P>That puts in perspective the comparison Deputy Ryan mentioned and which I intended raising also.  It is an appalling commentary on humankind. Countries like ours who may not be militaristically-minded have a moral role to play in the context of the arms race.  To this extent the Taoiseach did a good job for the world and for Ireland in pointing out the dangers inherent in the arms race.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan raised the question of the number of countries contributing to the Food Aid Convention 1971.  In addition to the nine EEC countries there are contributions also from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Finland, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and the USA.  Undoubtedly that is within the structure of the food aid convention. The Deputy raised also the question of whether the Comecon countries contribute. I am not sure of what they do but in any case I do not think the question arises on this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am sure the Minister would agree that Russian involvement in the wheat market has a significant impact on the availability of wheat within the markets of the convention countries and indeed within the markets of the rest of the world, too.  Can he say if there is any technical objection to Comecon countries being involved if they so wished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have not got that information to hand but I should not imagine that there would be any technical difficulty involved.  The Deputy is entitled to the information and I shall communicate it to him.  Deputy Quinn referred to this being the fourth extension of the food aid convention.  That is a matter of historical fact but to put the reason for this on the record I should add to what has been stated already by me in moving the motion. I understand that conference was held in Geneva from 13 February to 28 March this year.  This was under the <Col N="87" /> auspices of UNCTAD and was for the purpose of negotiating a new wheat agreement to replace the one which is due to expire on 30 June this year.  The conference failed to complete in time the necessary arrangements and is to be reconvened in September next for the purpose of trying to ensure that it will not be necessary in 12 months' time to have to seek a fifth extension.</P>
      <P>I understand that the difficulties encountered by the conference centred almost exclusively on certain aspects of the proposed new wheat trade convention such as, for instance, the question of minimum and maximum price levels and that there was no substantive problem regarding the negotiating of a new aid convention as such.  In effect the problem is technical but we are hopeful that the matter will be resolved finally in September and that the House will not be burdened at a later date with the need to seek a fifth extension.</P>
      <P>On the question of the amount of food the figure mentioned by me was that under the food aid convention each donor country undertakes to supply a certain minimum amount in cash or in kind which would be wheat, coarse grains or derivative products suitable for human consumption.  The EEC have pledged 1,287,000 tons of wheat annually, 56 per cent of which, that is, 720,462 tons, is provided through the Community budget.  Ireland's proportionate share of the cost amounts to about £510,000 which is paid through the Central Fund.  The remaining 44 per cent of the Community's pledge, that is, 566,538 tons is supplied directly by the member states.  Ireland's share of this amounts to 3,060 tons which at present market prices costs about £360,000.</P>
      <P>Again, I take Deputy Quinn's point that the minimum sought on an annual basis was 1,650,000 tons.  It is hoped, when the package is negotiated in September, that this figure will be settled on but in order to reassure the Deputy I would remind him that on a number of occasions Ireland has urged as a matter of urgency that this figure be reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their concern <Col N="88" /> and for the manner in which they have expressed acceptance of the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move: <Col N="89" />&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend and extend the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Acts, which is the basic legislation regulating our meat export trade. The changes provided for in the Bill would not in any way interfere with the fundamental principles of the basic legislation but rather are intended to adapt aspects of it to the circumstances of a changing meat export industry.</P>
      <P>In essence the Bill consists of four distinct provisions: first, it provides for the introduction of fresh meat classification at meat export premises; secondly, it would replace the existing absolute ban on the breeding or keeping of coloured pigs with a more flexible arrangement; thirdly, it provides for the collection of veterinary inspection fees at meat export plants on a monthly basis, instead of half-yearly as at present, with effect from 1 July 1978, and fourthly, it provides for the possible employment of detention officers at meat export plants, subject to certain consultation with the Veterinary Council of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now some months since the Minister for Agriculture announced his intention of introducing a mandatory beef carcase classification scheme, and the reaction since then from all the interests concerned has been most encouraging.  Sections 2 and 3 of this Bill would enable the Minister to make regulations providing for the compulsory classifications and appropriate marking of fresh meat.  It is envisaged that for the time being such regulations would apply only to carcase beef for export markets.  The classification of beef carcases is bound to benefit all the interests concerned with the beef industry, and in particular it should convey the preferences of overseas customers back through the exporters to the producers of the cattle.  We export, in one way or another, more than four-fifths of all the cattle we produce.  If we are to get the best return from the market we must produce the right kind of cattle and must avoid over-finishing them.  In an industry worth over £500 million pounds a year even a modest price increase, reflecting improved <Col N="90" /> quality, would have major consequences for the income of farmers, for factory profits and for the balance of trade.  It is evident that the preference in most export markets is for a leaner type of animal than we have traditionally supplied and we can get significantly increased returns by recognising this and adjusting our breeding and feeding policies to take account of it.</P>
    <P>The scheme, which, subject to the enactment of this legislation, would be brought into operation early next year, will apply to all cattle&mdash;steers, heifers, cows and bulls&mdash;slaughtered at meat export premises.  It will be operated by trained classification officers employed by the Department of Agriculture and the cost of their employment will be borne by the Exchequer. Classification as such will have two main elements&mdash;conformation and fat score&mdash;probably with seven sub-categories of each.  Other data such as sex, age and weight may also be included in the information fed back to producers.  The sole duty of classification officers will be to determine, as objectively as the nature of this exercise permits, the conformation class and the fat class of every animal slaughtered at the meat export premises.</P>
    <P>The determination of the price to be paid for cattle by the meat factory will remain, as it has always been, a matter between the factory and the producer. The Department or the classification officers will have no role to play in the determination of prices as a result of this particular scheme.  It is important to make this distinction.  Factories and producer representatives may agree to base payment for cattle on the results of classification, but this will in no way influence the classification officers in their work.  However, the ultimate success or failure of a scheme of this nature must depend on impartial objective assessment of the beef carcases, the maintenance of rigid standards and the recognition of this by both buyer and seller.</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe that the scheme will relate to beef carcases and not to boneless beef.  This is because, at the carcase stage, differences in conformation and fat cover will be readily <Col N="91" /> apparent to the trained eye and overseas customers can contact with confidence on the basis of classification. Boneless beef on the other hand introduces other elements, such as butchering skill and the degree of fat trimming, which a customer might prefer to judge for himself.  We do not thereby mean to suggest that we should concentrate on the export of carcase beef.  Far from it.  Indeed, we look forward to seeing a major increase in exports of vacuum-packed boneless beef in consequence on the big improvement in the MCA co-efficient which was secured as part of the recent price package.  Even if the carcase trade were to cease altogether, however, carcase classification would still be indispensable as a means of informing producers about the market suitability of the cattle they are producing and as a guide to improved future production.</P>
    <P>Under the Pigs and Bacon (Amendment) Act, 1956 there is an absolute ban on the keeping or breeding of pigs of a colour other than all white.  Under this Bill the absolute ban is removed and the importation of coloured pigs can be allowed in accordance with regulations made by the Minister for Agriculture.  These regulations would only be made if circumstances so warrant at any time.  We have no plans in mind at present for such regulations. The provision in the Bill is, therefore, merely an enabling one.</P>
    <P>Sections 5, 6 and 7 would amend the various statutory provisions relating to the collection of veterinary inspection fees at meat export plants by allowing for the collection of the fees on a monthly rather than on the current half-yearly basis.  The intention is to allow for a more orderly flow of funds from the inspection fees.  As the Minister for Agriculture has stated in this House on a previous occasion, the receipts from these fees cover only part of the cost of the service.  Under the present arrangement of half-yearly collection it is well into the new year before the fees for the preceding July are collected, which is a wholly unjustifiable situation nowadays.  This provision does not entail any increase in the level of inspection fees: it <Col N="92" /> simply facilitates their collection on a more even basis throughout the whole year.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill, which relates to detention officers, is an enabling provision.  Veterinary inspectors at meat export plants are required to carry out an ever-broadening range of duties. This is attributable to the requirements of EEC directives on meat inspection and export certification and to the other controls that have become necessary as a result of the introduction of MCAs, intervention and so on.  In addition, the level of throughput and the range of products at meat factories are also increasing.  The function of a detention officer would be to relieve the veterinary inspector of some of the routine inspection of carcases and viscera and allow for the better deployment of veterinary resources. The detention officers would have to be specially trained for the purpose and section 8 of the Bill requires the Minister to consult fully with the veterinary council regarding their training and qualifications.  They would, of course, work under the supervision of the veterinary inspectors.  Detention officers are used in many other countries, inculding most other member states of the EEC and in the USA and New Zealand.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, this is an enabling provision and I do not want the intentions in this regard to be misinterpreted. There are no plans to employ detention officers at present and if at any time in the future a decision to employ detention officers should be contemplated, there will, first of all, be frank and open consultation with the veterinary profession.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Bill before the House is intended to make some relatively minor changes in legislation which was framed many years ago and which has in the meantime served us very well.  The technology and structure of our beef industry has, however, since changed and has expanded very considerably, now being worth some £300 million in beef exports alone, compared with £61,000 in 1930 when the original Act was passed.  The industry has the capacity for continued growth and the legislation must take this into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome this legislation. In relation to the introduction of a beef carcase classification scheme, the key statement in the Minister's brief is that beef classification will convey the preferences of overseas customers back through the exporters to the producers of the cattle.  The classification scheme will provide what could be described as a common language whereby the needs of the market can be conveyed right through to the farmer producing animals and he can be informed of how they conform with requirements.  The fact that the Department inspectors who have no axe to grind in favour of either the factories, the farmers or the customers of the factories will carry out a classification will ensure the confidence in, and the success of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some points should have been clarified before we were asked to agree to the Second Stage of the Bill. As the Minister said, this Bill is merely an enabling Bill.  It enables the Minister to make regulations.  The beef classification scheme has been talked about for some time and the Department of Agriculture, at various shows throughout the country, demonstrated to people what would be involved in the scheme they intend to introduce. We have been told that there will be seven classes of conformation, corresponding to the letters of the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;, in relation to shape and there will be classes from one to six in relation to fat cover.  I have given this information in a rather inadequate fashion but it would have been more appropriate if the Minister had given it.  The Minister is asking us to give him power to make regulations without telling us what sort of regulations he intends to make.  If the Department of Agriculture can tell people outside this House what they intend to have in their carcase classification scheme they should tell the House.  As this matter has been thrashed around time and time again I have not the slightest doubt that the Department have specific and detailed proposals in their possession in relation to this matter.  I would not be surprised if they had a draft of the regulations ready.  We should be told what the Department intend to do because there <Col N="94" /> is no guarantee that we will have an opportunity to discuss the regulations at a later stage if they are made under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I presume that an order introducing the classification scheme will be made under section 51 of the 1930 Act and unless we seek to annul the scheme as a whole there will be no discussion. There is no requirement for the Minister to get the approval of the House before introducing the scheme.  We are being asked to agree to the introduction of a scheme about which we know nothing but about which the people outside of the House know and about which if the Department's intentions were disclosed we might have legitimate grounds for objection.  That is not satisfactory and if the Minister of State were on this side of the House he would agree with my point of view. I am at a disadvantage in speaking about what I know from secondhand information to be the Department's intention in this matter.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a slight problem in relation to our scheme.  In so far as conformation is concerned, our scheme will go on seven different classes of conformation conforming to the letters of the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;.  In France they have only six classes corresponding to the letters of the word &ldquo;France&rdquo;, and there is a European scheme with six classes corresponding to the letters of the word &ldquo;Europa&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If we are trying to export to Europe and if the whole intention of the beef classification scheme is to enable us to export more effectively and to give us information on continental markets, why are we introducing a scheme which contains seven classes as against Europe's six?  If we want a common language we want one which operates not only between the Irish factories and the Irish producers but which can be understood as between the Irish factories and their customers abroad. Therefore it is in our interests as a producer country to adopt a scheme as near as possible to the scheme that is known and accepted in European countries.</P>
    <P>This Government were not alone in discussions on this matter.  I remember questioning the then and present Minister <Col N="95" /> for Education and the Minister for Agriculture in 1972 about a classification scheme.  I readily accept there is a bipartisan responsibility in relation to this matter.  However, it seems to me that we should have gone for a scheme closer to the continental one.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how our scheme as far as conformation is concerned corresponds with schemes being used on the Continent, apart from the fact that there are seven different classes.  For instance, I should like to know if our grade I corresponds with their E grade in EUROPA or, as I have been told, does it correspond with the letters EU and half of R in EUROPA?  If my information is correct, our top class corresponds to almost half of the classification in Europe and the remaining six classes, R, E, L, A, N and D correspond with the other half of their O, P and A. There seems to me to be a difference not only in the number of classes but in the distribution of classes.  The whole thing is being introduced to enable us to export more effectively, and it seems to me as a layman that this divergence is difficult to explain. It might be suggested that if we introduce the EUROPA scheme we would not be getting enough cattle into the allegedly top classes of E and U and that because of our traditional breeding policies when we were catering for a different market, the British market, too many of our cattle would not be getting into E and U.  I am not suggesting that we should be too worried about that, but we will have to export to those countries in the long run and if what I have been saying is the case, the sooner Irish producers come to terms with the fact that they are not producing enough cattle to get into the E and U grades, or the F and R grades in the French scheme, the better for Irish producers because they can then adjust their feeding and breeding patterns.</P>
    <P>I have said I am speaking in the absence of information on this matter, but if we are to have a large I class covering animals whose conformation is ideal for the continental markets and also other classes which would correspond <Col N="96" /> to the top half of R in the EUROPA scheme, if there is such a wide range, a farmer who produces cattle which correspond to the I grade will expect to get the same price regardless of the fact that there is a wide range of cattle within the I grade, some of which are ideally suitable for the continuental markets.  The problem of having such a wide range within the I grade would lead to expectations as to price which cannot be fulfilled by individual factories because some of them may find they are producing for a specific market which corresponds to E and not to U in the European scale.  The Minister has been at pains to tell us in his opening speech that the scheme does not promise a price; but, naturally enough, if people get into the I classification they will have expectations as to price and it is important that these expectations would be fulfilled.  Otherwise the scheme will not be as successful as we would all hope it will be.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to allay the fears I have expressed.  If I have been wrong I have been making an honest mistake because the scheme is not before the House, but it is important that these fears should be raised at this stage rather than when the Minister has become committed to a regulation.  That is one danger that could arise from the nature of the scheme.</P>
    <P>There is another danger, and I know from his speech that the Minister is conscious of it.  It is necessary that the staff carrying out this classification will be of very high quality and that their decisions will be uniform across the country.  It would not be a good thing if there was a classifier in a factory in one part of the country who would be more lenient about the number of cattle he let into the I grade than a classifier in another part of the country who would not be as lenient and who, when a doubt would arise, would be inclined to put cattle into R grade.  If that happened it would immediately lead to a grave lack of confidence in the scheme.</P>
    <P>These men will be operating far from each other and they will not necessarily be meeting each other in <Col N="97" /> the course of their work.  There might be a classifier in a factory in the south and another in County Monaghan and unless the Department bring them together to compare their work, there is no reason why they should make exactly the same judgment.  But it is essential for the success of the scheme that they make the same judgment. I agree that the Department will exercise intensive supervision of their work in different parts of the country, that there will be people moving between the factories who will spot any divergence, but there will need to be a high standard of training before the classifiers take up duty.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister in his reply to give the House specific information in relation to the training he has in mind and the supervision arrangements in regard to the work of the officers who will be responsible for classification.  It is important that we have men of quality operating.  It will be visual assessment.  Men who will classify carcases will not do so on the basis of measuring sticks to determine fat content as is possible with pigs. That cannot be done with cattle because there is not the same uniformity of fat content distribution.  It will be visual and physical assessment and much will depend on the accuracy and the judgment of the officer concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like some information about how much the scheme will cost the Exchequer.  How much will be provided this year and next year and when will the scheme be introduced? This is enabling legislation and it does not introduce the scheme. We should like to know when it will be introduced.  The classification scheme is the most important. Although I have had some critical things to say about it, I should like to make it clear that I welcome the introduction of the scheme.  I hope the points I made were constructive and that the Minister will answer them to my satisfaction.</P>
    <P>Section 4 allows for the breeding and keeping of non-white pigs.  The ban on such pigs was introduced in 1956. It was introduced then because the Danes had a similar ban on non-white pigs and it was felt that in order to compete one had to be sure that one <Col N="98" /> could satisfy the consumer.  At that time apparently the consumer was not happy with the non-white pig&mdash;the saddle back, I think&mdash;that was prevalent then.  It was largely a case of consumer resistance.  It was not that the meat of the non-white pig was intrinsically worse.  It was just that the consumer had got used to a certain type of colouring in the rind.  However, I understand that with recent developments in the breeding of non-white pigs, in many respects these pigs have a better performance than white pigs.  For instance, in terms of muscle content the new breeds of non-white pigs&mdash;the New Hampshire and the Pietron breeds &mdash;are somewhat equivalent to Charolais in beef.  They produce more quantities of lean meat than is the case with the Landrace, the white pig that is quite common in this country.</P>
    <P>There is a case for introducing the facility for breeding and keeping non-white pigs, subject to proper regulation. It is my information that these pigs are being bred here in contravention of legislation.  I know this is being done&mdash;and not by private individuals either&mdash;for very good reasons because the people concerned are anxious in the interests of better husbandry to find out how these breeds compare. That kind of thing should not be illegal; it should be encouraged, not discouraged.  It would be ridiculous if any person was prosecuted in such a case so long at it was being done subject to proper controls, as is the case in the situation I mentioned.  There is not question of a deterioration in the general breeds.  The animals are being kept apart and their performance is being observed to see if they come up to standard and compare well with what has been done elsewhere with white pigs.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to come off the fence with regard to this matter. He has said he will introduce enabling legislation with regard to non-white pigs but he has also said that he has not any immediate intention of doing anything about the matter.  He should do something about it immediately so that we can have the best range of breeds.  I know that some people will not thank me for saying that.  Those who are involved heavily with existing <Col N="99" /> breeds may not want to see the other breeds introduced, but in the area of beef production that objection had to be overcome.  It was overcome by the intensive introduction of Charolais cattle, and latterly by Simmenthal, Limousin and other breeds which are making a worth-while contribution to producing the kind of beef needed for the export market in particular. Non-white breeds of pigs are allowed in France and they are the rule in the United States.  I visited farms in America where they produced hogs. Generally speaking those animals are of a coloured variety.  If that can satisfy the American consumer, who is very pernickety about all kinds of food, certainly it should satisfy the consumer of Irish pig products.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to introduce a regulation to ensure that only the best breeds are introduced, subject to the necessary control.  At least we should experiment and see how they work rather than have the absolute ban that exists at the moment.  I cannot understand why the Minister would go to the trouble of introducing an enabling provision unless he had some intention of using it.  I should like him to come off the fence when he is replying to this matter.</P>
    <P>It is probably reasonable that arrangements should be made regarding monthly payments of the fees to the Department.  There is no doubt that this will have an effect on the liquidity of meat plants.  Up to now they were able to keep the money for six months. They got the interest but now they will have to pay it every month and the Department will get the interest.  That can pass itself back to the farmer in terms of slightly lower prices paid by the plants because they will not be able to get the interest.  They will not be able to hold on to their money for as long as they have been able to up to now.  Some of them may have to borrow money to pay the fees.  They will have to pay interest on money borrowed to pay fees on a monthly basis as against holding it for six months and that interest charge met by the factories inevitably will be reflected in a marginally lower price to the producer.  When that is taken in <Col N="100" /> conjunction with the recent decision of the Department to increase the veterinary fees in meat plants by more than 100 per cent, and in addition to various other levies which it is suggested may have to be met by meat plants, we will see that the amount of money being taken out of the meat plants by various people will be quite considerable and will be a good deal more than would be taken out of the export of live cattle.</P>
    <P>We already know, quite apart from those various schemes that meat plants are at a disadvantage in relation to the anomalies in the MCA system.  Those are far more serious than the small matters I have been mentioning.</P>
    <P>The Minister during the course of the prices negotiations in Brussels succeeded in having a change made in the co-efficient for the calculation of the MCA for chilled beef but he failed to do anything about frozen beef in this respect.  Frozen beef represents almost as important a component of our exports of carcase beef.  I cannot understand why he did not do anything about frozen beef when he was doing something about chilled beef because the principle is the same.  I presume if the principle is accepted at the negotiating table that it will be applied across the board.  The Minister seemed to suggest in the House&mdash;I may have misinterpreted him&mdash;that the problem of not dealing with the frozen beef and dealing only with the chilled beef arose from the fact that, allegedly, the fresh meat exporters did not tell him that they wanted both frozen and chilled beef to be dealt with in this matter.  That is my impression of what the Minister said.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be quite inexplicable because the Minister is the person responsible and he and his officials should know the trade as well as any fresh meat exporter.  They should know that chilled and frozen beef should have been dealt with in so far as this change in the MCA is concerned and that the change should not have been confined to chilled beef. If there was not an alleged failure of communication between the Minister and the fresh meat exporters' society I would like to know what was the reason that this was not dealt with <Col N="101" /> at the price negotiating table.  It is all very fine for the Minister to say that he is removing a particular anomaly in relation to chilled beef, that the other anomalies will be dealt with in the normal way, that a study group is being set up by the Council of Ministers to deal with the matter and that he will try to get it brought forward quickly.  Once you leave the price negotiating table your bargaining position is greatly reduced.  If you withhold your agreement to the price package and say: &ldquo;I will not agree to this until I get agreement on other MCA problems&rdquo; you have a much stronger position there for getting action in relation to, in this case, the MCA on frozen beef.  Once you agree to the price package and leave the price negotiating table and it goes into the normal course of all the various matters dealt with by the Commission all the time, that are being reviewed <i>ad infinitim</i> by the Commission, there is no guarantee that you will have any equivalent bargaining power at any other time during the year until the next price negotiation.</P>
    <P>The danger, because this matter has been left over and only the anomaly in relation to chilled beef has been dealt with, is that the frozen beef anomaly, which is almost as serious, will not be dealt with until next year's price negotiations and a whole year will have been lost.  We all know the substantial amount of employment which could be created in our meat plants if those anomalies in the MCA were removed entirely, not just in part as has been the case so far.  There is very substantial employment in the meat plants in my constituency and in the constituencies of all the Deputies who are present in the House at the moment.  They are giving added value. We are all committed to added value as far as agricultural production is concerned. I believe the Minister should have been successful in dealing with the entire MCA problem in the recent negotiations and not successful in dealing with only part of it.  He will be judged in this respect by the results rather than by the intentions.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the detention officers.  I gather that this is only <Col N="102" /> an enabling provision and that extensive consultations will take place.  I welcome this enabling provision.  I agree that consultations must take place so that the high standard of work of the veterinary inspectors will be maintained.  The only consideration in those negotiations should be the maintenance of the standard of the work.  The justification for a professional restriction in relation to who may do what must be nothing but the fact that by having people of a particular profession doing the work it will be done to a standard to which it would not otherwise be done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the negotiations may now take place.  There are grave dangers to our long-run competitiveness across the whole area of industry and social services if professionalism operates on any other basis than solely that to have work done to a certain standard you must have a professional.  The only justification for the existence of a restriction is performance and nothing but performance. I welcome this Bill and I ask the Minister to give more information on the precise nature of the regulations he has in mind to introduce under the various enabling provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: Our agricultural spokesman has welcomed the Bill.  I would like to make some comments in relation to some of the provisions in it.  Section 2 enables the Minister to make regulations for the mandatory beef carcase classification scheme. There has been a lot of comment on this provision and it has been generally favourable.  I doubt if the scheme will be effective because while the classification scheme may be mandatory and be administered independently of the trade by officers of the Department the negotiations concerning the price paid for such carcases lie entirely with the factory managers and the suppliers of the live cattle.  It is obvious to me that there will be resistance by many suppliers to having their prices based on the result of the classification. The essential benefit of the classification scheme will result at the sales end where the customer abroad will at least know that he is getting <Col N="103" /> a certain quality carcase from the factory.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's comment in this respect is interesting because we have now three schemes, the one we will implement, the one used in France and the one used in Europe generally, the Europa scheme.  It seems unnecessarily complicated to my way of thinking. We should be moving towards a unified European classification scheme. Instead of doing that we seem to be unnecessarily fragmenting our schemes.</P>
      <P>In relation to the reclassification scheme, there is one matter of burning interest to both the factories and the suppliers.  I refer to the point in time of the inspection by the official of the Department.  Will the inspection to determine the grading of the carcase take place prior to trimming or will it take place after trimming?  As the Minister may be aware, the breeding of our beef stock is slightly on the fat side and we are only now slowly moving towards producing the leaner continental-preferred type of beef.  Many factories trim the meat after weighing and after veterinary inspection.  By doing so they improve the grading of the carcase certainly from the point of view of the continental buyer.  Will the Department allow this trimming to be done before classification or will the classification be made prior to trimming? If it is made prior to trimming will the Department allow subsequent trimming after the carcase has been classified?  That may seem to be a technical point but here we are talking about substantial sums of money and substantial benefits which would accrue to the customer and to the supplier as well as to the factories.  It is a vital point and I should like the Minister to reply to it.  If classification inspection takes place after trimming certain benefits will accrue to the supplier and to the factory.  I would like the Minister to look into this matter very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the scheme itself, we are now apparently going to have 48 different grades and grading may, in fact, reach as high as 64 different grades of carcase.  This is unnecessarily complicated.  I speak from my <Col N="104" /> own experience and I maintain that at most six gradings are quite sufficient. All these gradings suggested here will only lead to arguments within the trade and at the factories and between the factories and the inspectors. I do not believe this number of grades is necessary.  It goes beyond reason from the point of view of the practical operation of a beef classification scheme.</P>
    <P>Will the officers come from the present people employed in the factory or will they be specifically recruited? Will they go through a special course and, if so, where?  Of what will the course consist?  Will the classification officer be combined with the detention officer?  Will there be two separate people or one composite person?  I believe these officers should be sufficiently paid to ensure they will carry out their duties in an independent manner as, indeed, the Department officers have done down through the years.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister introduce a classification scheme for lambs?  There is need for such a scheme.  The present scheme in respect of lamb exports to France is unnecessarily narrow.  The 48 lbs limitation is too limiting.  Excellent quality lambs which should be exported to France are not allowed because of this limitation.  The permitted quality is unnecessarily high. It eliminates the possibility of exporting mountain lambs unless they are finished on the lowlands or intensively fed.  There is a varied trade for lambs in France at different price levels. There is a good trade for heavier lambs and, indeed, quite a good trade for poor lambs.  The price levels would, of course, be different.  At the lower level relatively good mountain lambs should be allowed into France. The price received would be good and it would benefit the mountain sheep producer.  That would give the industry a tremendous fillip.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made public statements about the great deal he got. It was very welcome certainly but it was too narrow in its perspective in regard to the sheep industry.  We should move forward.  I am worried about the establishment of a common agricultural policy in regard to <Col N="105" /> sheep.  From the information I got at the beginning of this week I believe Europe is moving towards a lower retail price policy.  I believe that, if we have a common agricultural policy in relation to sheep, we will be going back to a 20 per cent customs duty applied to sheep.  I am very worried about the prospects of the common agricultural policy because England is in a special position from the point of view of the importation of lambs from New Zealand.  I believe they will continue to import cheap frozen lamb from New Zealand and will benefit from the CAP on lambs by exporting their own domestically produced lambs to France.  This will have a deleterious effect on the Irish sheep trade to France.  This is a very important field and I wonder what we will do in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I digressed.  I want to know if we are to establish a classification scheme for lambs.  I am in favour of one.  It is a pity this Bill was not extended to enable the Minister to establish a classification scheme for the export of sheep as well.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that the cost of the levy scheme to the factory is extremely high, unnecessarily high? This is being reflected back on the price to the producer.  Is the Minister aware that the same veterinary staff who inspect carcases at slaughter houses are also there to inspect live cattle at the point of exportation, to carry out testing for brucellosis and TB, to carry out inspections at the registered boning offices, to carry out inspections in relation to APS contracts going into and coming out of cold storage, and to inspect the intervention system at cold storage point?</P>
    <P>At present the abattoirs finance the veterinary service.  If there is to be an increase in the fees in the future, before the Minister increases the fees, he should have serious regard to the other work done by the veterinary service. That work is excellent.  Our public veterinary service is second to none in Europe or, indeed, in the world. Our veterinary standards for the meat we produce are second to none.  We can be proud of the standards in Ireland of meat we export which goes <Col N="106" /> out having had a very thorough inspection. The quality is controlled right through to the point of export.</P>
    <P>If the fees are to be increased, rather than the increases falling on the slaughter houses, there should be a reassessment of the broad spectrum of work done by the veterinary service and an equitable charge should be made on all the participants in this sector of the meat industry in order to arrive at an equitable burden of the levies charged.</P>
    <P>The question of detention officers was mooted in the Department some years ago.  This is welcome in the Bill and it is in line with the practice in other European countries.  The enabling part of the Bill is welcome but I was disappointed to read in the Minister's speech that there are no plans to employ detention officers at present.  They would be welcome in the abattoirs and in the factories and also in such places as boning halls and intervention centres.</P>
    <P>Qualified veterinary inspectors have a better role to play as supervisors and overall managers of factories.  A very real role could be played by detention officers.  I am aware an agreement has been reached between the Veterinary Officers' Association after consultation with the Veterinary Council of Ireland. It is not specified in the Bill whether detention officers will have responsibility for pre-slaughter inspections of live animals.  Obviously this is work they could carry out.  It is a visual inspection requiring some training but it is not necessary to have a veterinary inspector.  A detention officer should be able to inspect live cattle, or sheep, or pigs for that matter, and should be trained to do so.</P>
    <P>There is no such provision in this Bill.  I do not wish to put down an amendment but the Minister might consider an amendment which would allow detention officers to carry out pre-slaughter inspections to relieve veterinary officers of the need to do so. I should like to know what training detention officers will get.  What ratio between detention officers and veterinary officers will be established?  Will they be recruited from the present AO staff?  What staffing level will they attain?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> I have already asked if the work of detention officers will be merged with the work of classification officers.  In all this development, where do the present permanent and temporary AO staff of the Department stand who have done quite an amount of work down the years?  I was sorry to see that in some factories temporary AO staff were made redundant some time ago.  Many good men who had good experience were let go, and they should not have been let go especially as this Bill was coming up from the engine room, so to speak.  The AO staff do excellent work.  Where do they stand?  What opportunity will they get for recruitment as classification or detention officers?  This is a very interesting field. I should like an assurance that the AO staff will be given every opportunity to get the training required.</P>
    <P>I should like clarification on two small points.  Section 6 refers to fees payable on exporters licences and section 7 to exporters' permits.  I am a little puzzled about the distinction and I should like clarification from the Minister on that point.  All in all this is an interesting development.  I hope it will be carried out properly.  As the Fine Gael spokesman said, we now have three schemes for classification. This is unnecessary.  We should have gone for the European scheme. Nevertheless, the Bill is welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>: At this stage everything that should be said about this Bill has been said.  I welcome the Bill, which is long overdue.  I am satisfied that it would have been introduced much earlier were it not for the resistance of various interests in the meat business.  Whenever a change is proposed there is always resistance and that is understandable.  I do not think the Bill goes far enough.  I would be obliged if the Minister would tell the House if he can extend the terms of the Bill by regulation to cover vacuum packing if he wishes.  It is of considerable importance that that be covered.  In my view broken down carcases in any shape or form should be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the criticisms I have listened to over the years in relation to the <Col N="108" /> export of boneless beef in whatever form was that there was an absolute disregard for the fat content and it was totally unreliable.  We could have anything from 5 to 25 per cent fat and for that reason it was not acceptable in the continental markets.  I do not know whether my suggestion can be covered by regulation, but I am sure there is a way for measuring fat in boneless beef.  It is important for the country that we should be breaking down our meat to such an extent that it is ready for consumption.  It is a pity that this has been left to be dealt with in the future.  It should be dealt with very quickly.  I accept that Rome was not built in a day and that the introduction of classification to carcase meat is a big step forward.  The people involved in this work would have to gain some experience before the measure can be extended to cover vacuum packed and broken down beef.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton was concerned about the type of classification, but I do not think it matters a lot.  The important thing is to have a scheme that can be understood so that people can buy their beef by description over the telephone. It does not take business people long to understand descriptions. It is only right that people should be able to buy according to a label on a side of beef at any time and know what they can expect to get.  It is disappointing that we are pushing the application of such a measure into the distant future as far as the boneless beef is concerned.  That is where the jobs are. We are all taking it far too easy in relation to the sale of beef.  We are exporting anything up to 80 per cent of our total production and we know that every extra unit of beef produced here in future will be for export.  This has never been taken seriously and the people in the processing industry never took it seriously.  Farming organisations have not done enough either.  If we are to solve the problem of unemployment here everyone must be concerned about the unemployed. The capability of the agricultural industry to find jobs for an enormous number of people is not fully realised. This is a chance for us all to lay emphasis on the importance of being able to export a boneless beef and the <Col N="109" /> customer should be able to rely on the label on the box.  The customer should know that he is getting a certain quality of beef with a certain fat content.  The Bill does not cover that and that is one of its shortcomings.</P>
    <P>I accept that it is a big step forward that people outside the country can buy beef according to a description. That is long overdue.  Like Deputy Collins, I regret that lamb was not covered in the Bill.  I do not know why. We are now going to the trouble of bringing in classifications and it should not be necessary to introduce further legislation to be able to describe sheep meat in the same way as we are describing beef here.  Even if we do not have sufficient trained staff to do this, this legislation should have provided for the introduction of such a scheme. When we are exporting sheep meat there should be a quality control. There should not be any restriction on markets and we should be able to send our lamb to any market in Europe. People should know exactly what they are buying.  It is to be regretted also that CBF are not in some way involved in this operation because they are concerned about the promotion of Irish beef.  It is quite on the cards that they will be involved in selling Irish beef. I would welcome that move because there is a place for CBF in selling. CBF should have been given some responsibility in this question of classification. They should be close to this scene if it is their intention to sell in future.</P>
    <P>There has been some demand for some time for the introduction of coloured pigs.  It is wrong to resist that demand.  There is little danger of people going mad in the wrong direction in the pig industry at present because it must be a specialised operation if people are to make money. Pigs are being produced in big units and those who are succeeding in that industry are specialised people.  They will not do anything crazy.  This is a very cautious approach to this matter and the impression is given that we do not intend to do it all immediately.  It would be better to ask the people who would like to import some coloured pigs for crossing purposes to help their business to come and talk about it.  It <Col N="110" /> would be better to tell them that so far as the Department are concerned no great obstacle will be put in their way.  It is known in the Department and in the pig industry generally that this would be an advantage in certain instances.</P>
    <P>A good job has been done in regard to pig breeding during the last ten or 15 years.  We have good quality pigs. However, we should not rest on our laurels.  Further improvement is possible and will continue to be possible.</P>
    <P>In regard to the introduction of detention officers, this is normal and it is done by our competitors.  Costs are important and the right type of staff in any industry is important.  We must follow the example of processors in other countries and employ the type of people they employ so that matters can be equalised as far as possible. This is a sensible move and I cannot see any objection to it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is to be welcomed.  It does not go as far as I would like it to go. I should like the Minister to tell us whether he is enabled to include boneless beef, or what I would call brokendown beef, by regulation rather than having to come back with further legislation. My reading of the Bill is that he can include it.  If that is so, he should indicate that he intends that this should be done as early as it is found possible, by making a real effort, to do so.  We should give all the encouragement we can to having the maximum amount of our beef broken down here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton dealt with the various obstacles to the export of vacuum-packed and the portion type of trade. I was surprised at a number of happenings recently.  Going back a year or so, there seemed to be only a couple of processors in trouble.  Only couple of processors were complaining that things were against them at that time in relation to trade.  We took up the case on their behalf and settled it after a few months.  We did not settle it without a good deal of pressure. We settled it at the price-fixing time, when we had leverage, even though we were promised it months earlier.  Deputy Bruton was correct in saying that you lose your bargaining power and put the day off when you <Col N="111" /> can really put pressure on.  There is a great deal of serious trouble in this type of business at present.  I am afraid it will take quite a long time to settle this matter and to get canned and cooked meats included and also chilled and frozen meats.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that it was possible to get the co-efficients changed somewhat, and that did bring some benefits. Some years ago it was settled that there should be no change in the co-efficients in the middle of the year or between price-fixing times.  This was done on one occasion and it caused a lot of trouble.  We finally agreed that it would only be done at price-fixing time.  There are various items which it does not apply to, such as frozen and chilled beef, and it does not cover canned and cooked meats.  These are the areas in which jobs can be found here. As I said during Question Time recently, it is the first time in our history that we are sending beef to Kent for boning.  That is a terrible shame for the Irish people: there is something terribly wrong about it in a country which has more than 100,000 people unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a step in the right direction, but it does not go far enough.  I am sorry it was not introduced sooner, as it should have been.  The type of classification to be used was decided upon at least three years ago.  At that time the system was tried out in a few processing centres and agreed, but there was resistance to it for other reasons. I am glad that the resistance has been broken down and that it has been found possible to introduce the scheme.</P>

      <P>: I thank Deputies Bruton, Clinton and E. Collins for their constructive contributions to the Bill.  It is generally accepted that the measures proposed in the Bill are very necessary having regard to the changing circumstances in the meat market.  The legislation which this Bill proposes to change was framed many years ago and it has served us very well.  We all realise that the maintenance of high standards is essential if we are to hold a fair share <Col N="112" /> of the export market.  It is essential to ensure that the meat we sell abroad is of the highest quality, not alone for the farmers and the people involved in the industry but for the country in general, and this Bill goes some of the way towards ensuring that this is so. I am glad the three Deputies opposite, who have considerable experience in the trade, have given the Bill a favourable reception.</P>
      <P>The Deputies raised a number of points and I will try to answer them as briefly as I can.  If there are other problems in relation to the Bill they can be sorted out on Committee Stage. Deputy Bruton asked for a detailed description of the beef classification scheme.  We all want to ensure that the scheme will be workable.  Anybody who visited the Spring Show could see a clear illustration of how the scheme works.  The regulations have not yet been drafted.  The draft will include detailed definitions.  The trade, the farmers' organisations and CBF will be consulted during the drafting.  I want to emphasise that we all want to ensure that the scheme will be workable. That is way it is essential that all those concerned with the industry are consulted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: In a few months. Deputy Bruton asked also why we had seven classes and not six as in Europe.  The answer is that the European scheme is matched by their type of animals whereas our seven classes cover the broader range of Irish animals.  Of course, it would be incorrect to assume that all of our classifications are suitable for the export market; a number are not because they would be too fat.</P>
      <P>With regard to the French scheme mentioned by Deputy Bruton also, as far as I am aware the French tried to get the other member countries on the Continent to accept their scheme but they did not succeed in achieving that aim.  Until there is a common EEC scheme we must cover all our types of animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton spoke also of the different standards operated by <Col N="113" /> different officials.  I might tell him that those operators will be specially trained for the job and there will be area supervisors.  The Deputy also requested some specific information on training programmes and so on but this cannot be given at this stage because the Bill is only an enabling one.  Deputy Bruton asked about the cost of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: If we are to have the regulations within a few months surely the training would need to be under way almost immediately, or when is it going to be initiated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are at present recruiting staff.  The regulations will come into operation immediately but it is not necessary to have this staff trained immediately.  That can be done towards the end of the year.  The cost of the scheme will be £150,000 per annum.  Ninety five per cent of this will be for salaries and travelling and five per cent for equipment.  Again, subject to the enactment of this Bill the scheme will be brought into operation early next year, which was another point raised by Deputy Bruton.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of coloured pigs, there is no demand at present for the importation of non-white pigs. We have to ensure that such would not damage the predominant strains which, in turn, could damage our bacon industry.  This is something of which we must be very careful.  The introduction of a new strain warrants careful examination not only in regard to its attributes but also its effect on cross-breeding and to the element of disease risk in regard to the areas from which imports might be arranged. This is something we must also monitor very carefully.  As Deputy Bruton pointed out, if it should be found necessary at any time or for any purpose to import that kind of animal, it is important that the Minister should have the power to do so.  That is what this Bill enables him to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to factory fees, I am not aware that factories have any liquidity problems.  The fees are not so large as to cause any factory to borrow. During his negotiations in Brussels the Minister raised the question <Col N="114" /> of the frozen beef co-efficient at the prices negotiated.  The case for frozen beef is not a clear-cut one nor is it identical to the case for chilled beef. The pattern of our trade in frozen beef is to countries where the MCA represents a charge and not a subsidy.  I understand that Deputy Bruton has tabled a question about this subject and perhaps it would be possible to have more information given at that time.</P>
    <P>Deputy E. Collins raised some questions in respect of classification.  He was concerned particularly about when classification would take place.  Classification will be carried out after carcases have been trimmed to standardised dressing specifications agreed between the factories and the farmers.  An agreed dressing specification is at present in operation in all factories.</P>
    <P>Regarding classification officers&mdash; another point raised by Deputy E. Collins&mdash;these will be people drawn from one of the agricultural officer grades.  They will not be drawn from the recruitment grade but rather from one of the promotion grades and, therefore will be experienced and responsible officers.  The duty of the classification officer will be completely different from that of the detention officer so that there will be no merging of the jobs in that operation.  Deputy Collins also mentioned the possibility of classification of sheep meat.  As Deputies know, there is nothing in this Bill about classification of sheep carcases. That would be an entirely separate matter and I dare say will come in its own time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would it be possible under the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes, it is possible under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: For example, it could be goats meat or anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is correct.  In fact, Deputy Clinton mentioned that in his contribution.  Fresh meat is defined in the 1930 Act as meaning and including beef, veal, pork, mutton, horse flesh and goat flesh.  Therefore, any of those can be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="115" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: When will we have a classification scheme for goat meat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Classification could be extended, by regulation, to all of these as the market demands.  Therefore, if there is the demand we can arrange to bring in the goats as well.  Deputy Clinton wanted the classification scheme extended to vacuum-packed meat.  I referred to that in the course of my introductory remarks when I said:</P>
      <P>Deputies will observe that the scheme will relate to beef carcases and not to boneless beef.  This is because, at the carcase stage, differences in conformation and fat cover will be readily apparent to the trained eye and overseas customers can contract with confidence on the basis of classification.  Boneless beef on the other hand introduces other elements, such as butchering skill and the degree of fat trimming which a customer might prefer to judge for himself. We do not thereby mean to suggest that we should concentrate on the export of carcase beef.  Far from it. Indeed we look forward to seeing a major increase in exports of vacuum-packed boneless beef in consequence of the big improvement in the MCA co-efficient which was secured as part of the recent price package.</P>
      <P>I think that is covered in that passage. I had mentioned the classification of other meats, one of the points made by Deputy Clinton.  It would not require an amendment of the Act.  It could be covered by regulations.  Of course, this could be watched when we get adequate experience of the operation of the carcase classification.  I think that covers as briefly as I can all the points made by Deputies and I thank them for their contributions to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Will the Minister consider between now and Committee Stage the possibility of introducing an amendment to allow these regulations which are going to be made to be debated here in the House?  It is important that they should be, and I ask him at least to consider that possibility as at present they will not necessarily be debated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann expresses its condemnation of apartheid and its solidarity with all engaged in promoting International Anti-Apartheid Year 1978.</P>
      <P>It is less in anger than in sorrow that I move this motion for which I look forward to the support of all sides of the House.  In condemning apartheid we are condemning man's inhumanity to man but we are not suggesting that there is a facile solution to the agonies of the different races in South Africa.</P>
      <P>The question of apartheid in South Africa has been on the agenda of the United Nations for about 26 years during which time it would have been difficult to recognise any significant progress towards a solution to the racial tensions of South Africa.  To a large extent the reason for apartheid is an underlying fear.  Anybody who has read <i>Cry The Beloved Country</i>, by Alan Paton, will recognise the veracity of the words in that famous novel that &ldquo;the agony of South Africa is the bondage of fear from which so many Europeans suffer and the fear of bondage from which Africans suffer&rdquo;. It is the fear and distrust on the part of each race as to the sincerity and the capacity of the other to behave reasonably and to honour an agreement if and when an agreement might be reached.  One does not like talking in racist terms but it is impossible to discuss apartheid without talking from an assessment of the racial position.  The fear of the white minority is of a sudden and violent intrusion in which they would become the victims not merely of the dispossession of property but also of the destruction of their lives and the lives of their children and dear ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> If one is to be sincere about a problem one must recite these facts before engaging in a condemnation of apartheid. The euphemism for apartheid is separate development of race groups. In a healthy environment that would appear to be something capable of being considered if as a consequence there were richer cultural development and a full achievement of each group's individual potential.  However, one of the great drawbacks of apartheid is that as applied it does not allow the development of the potential of the majority of people of Africa. Not only does it deny them the opportunity to achieve full potential but it belittles them as human beings.  Because apartheid is an affront to the dignity of man, because it is a system which discriminates against people on the grounds of the colour of their skin and because it denies the fundamental truth of the equality of those who are created in God's likeness, it is a system which must revolt anyone who has a conception of the equality of human beings.</P>
    <P>Some idea of the scale of discrimination which is apartheid can be found from some figures I should like to put on the record.  If the facts are studied carefully, any fair-minded person would have to join with the many organisations around the world and in Africa in particular who are opposed to apartheid and who can join in opposition to apartheid without engaging in any violent or vicious act. It is possible that an error was made in recent decades in that well-intentioned people who are opposed to apartheid have engaged in such a propaganda war and in such unqualified condemnation of apartheid that they have created an embattled minority attitude in South Africa which has blinded the white people of that country from seeing not merely the evil of what they are doing but also, from their own point of view, the folly of their policy.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the last census, which I think was in 1976, the white population of South Africa was 4,300,000.  They are the privileged people of South Africa but because the society there is racist, people are <Col N="118" /> segregated into many different groups, the main ones being whites and coloureds&mdash;people of mixed race and people of black blood.  The coloured population is 2,400,000 while the Indian population, which in accordance with the local phrase includes all Asiatics, is 760,000.  The black population is 18,760,000.  Therefore, the total non-white population is 21,900,000 as against a white population of 4,300,000.  The latest year for which I have income statistics indicate that the white population, which represents less than one-fifth of the coloured and black population, had an income of 68.2 per cent while the Asiatic population, most of whom are engaged in commerce, had income of 10.7 per cent and the black population had an income of 21 per cent. Clearly there is something wrong with a society in which there is such a disproportion in incomes.  I shall not refer to the incomes as earning capacity because earning capacity is different from the way in which income is awarded.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the solution to the racial tensions of South Africa suggested by Government there the white population would take 87 per cent of the land of South Africa.  That would include all the cities, all the industrial centres, the ports, the mines and the best agricultural land.  The remaining 13 per cent would be given to the coloured population of 22,000,000.  In the main that land would be the poorest land and the land remote from industrial areas, the areas that have been neglected deliberately because of a policy in South Africa to concentrate development on what is described as the &ldquo;white areas&rdquo;.  That 13 per cent of the land on which the 22,000,000 would be confined to live, would be divided or subdivided into nine Bantustans, in a manner which would crystallise all the national and different family tensions which traditionally existed in Africa, and in many other parts of the world before people were allegedly civilised.</P>
    <P>There have been some improvements in South Africa in the seventies and figures are often quoted to suggest that the rate of progress has been more <Col N="119" /> rapid than might otherwise on reflection appear to be true.  When you have people starting from an extremely low base of income, any substantial percentage increase obviously is meaningless. I have already quoted figures which show that 4,300,000 people enjoy 68 per cent of the income while 22 million enjoy only 21 per cent of the income.  There has been some improvement but I think it is necessary to look at these things so that one can identify that there can be progress for the majority of the black population in South Africa without upsetting the settled pattern of life.  It certainly brings about changes, but it is sometimes argued that you cannot have any improvement without insurrection and destruction.  I do not believe that is so.</P>
    <P>For instance, the income of black workers in Johannesburg increased by 112 per cent in 1975 while the increase for the white population in the same area for the same period was only 57 per cent.  There have been tentative moves on what I might call the less important aspects of apartheid in relation to sport and the provision of increased money for housing, education, health and so on.</P>
    <P>I mentioned sport very deliberately because it appears to be regarded as the most important aspect of apartheid in international circles.  There are many people who do not play sport and I imagine in the social economic conditions of South Africa that the proportion who engage in competitive sports is probably smaller than it is in other parts of the world.  I do not always go along with the campaigns to obstruct international sports meetings, but I must acknowledge that apparently that campaign has had some success because the South African authorities are now prepared to accept that the Republic of South Africa's sporting teams should be selected without regard to the colour of the people on them.  Perhaps this is an indication that international pressure and comment can bring about an improvement of the situation in South Africa.  I mention that as an aside because I do not regard <Col N="120" /> it as the most serious aspect of apartheid.  The matters to which I have already made reference speak for themselves, including condemnation of the system of apartheid.</P>
    <P>I am not going to labour this point. If anybody thinks I am making a political issue, I am not.  In 1977 South Africa shared with Ireland an extraordinary experience.  That Government like the Irish Government achieved the biggest majority for a Government ever.  Obviously there are dangers in giving governments historically large majorities.  Last year the white population, the only people qualified to vote in the South African elections, a population of only 4.3 million, gave the Government 134 seats and the Opposition 31.  South Africa must be the greatest evidence of the silent majority in the world today or at any time in the history of mankind. I assume the Opposition are opposed to apartheid and represent 22 million plus, but they have only 31 seats.  There is something indefensible about such a system.  Because the white people are the only people entitled to vote, the African population regard elections and political matters as the white man's affair.</P>
    <P>Why did the white people of South Africa vote in that way?  I do not pretend to be an electoral analyst but I suspect most of them voted for the Government, not out of an inherent love of them&mdash;on many occasions they have protested about various aspects of the policy of apartheid and about ordinary economic and social management, as is done in any system of elections where people are free to complain&mdash;but because they were concerned about their own economic and group interests and the manner in which they were threatened.  They voted for that Government because they regarded them as being their main protection, the protection of the white economic and group interests. They also voted at a time of Immense international political emotion and excitement. I believe they voted against western liberalism and eastern communism. They gave this dangerous support to the Government of South Africa because they were alarmed as they have <Col N="121" /> never been alarmed before by the presence of Russians and Cubans in Angola, Mozambique and the guerilla warfare in Rhodesia, or Zimbabwe as the majority in Rhodesia call it.</P>
    <P>This underlines an argument that has often been advanced, and rightly so, that if apartheid is continued in the form we have seen it, or in any form, it will inevitably end in violence in which those who have sought to preserve the old order will suffer most, in which western society and the western economic order will be damaged, and in which the principal profiteers will be Russia and the Communist world.  It has always been argued by reasonable people that a peaceful solution would benefit South Africa and Western Europe from which the white people of South Africa came, the Afrikaaners and those of English decent.  A peaceful solution would benefit those people who now have behind them centuries of living in South Africa.  They argue that they arrived, cultivated and developed many areas of South Africa long before many of the people in adjoining areas moved into the industrial areas developed by the white settlers.</P>
    <P>That is a valid argument but it does not mean that the basic human and political rights of people are to be denied today on the grounds of colour or because they arrived later on some area of the earth.  That is an unacceptable doctrine.  I am talking about arguments and the kind of thoughts that motivate people.  One does not have to go to South Africa to see how people are motivated by thoughts of that kind.  We cannot find a solution to these problems unless we recognise that they exist and recognise the motivations of people who become inheritors of these dangerous, unhealthy traditions.  Race relations in many parts of the world are more difficult and potentially more explosive today than ever before.  That is the dilemma of the modern world.</P>
    <P>Race relations, family disputes, geographical rivalries and so on have upset the world in the past, have caused a lot of misery and have changed the maps of the world.  Powers have come and gone and the lives and fortunes of <Col N="122" /> people have been changed.  We live in an age of mass communication at a time when we have what are called world powers, where the fortunes of people of small military significance are changed not because of their own ambitions and legitimate desires but because of the rivalries of the big powers.  That is one of the most sinister aspects of Africa today.  In the sixties we, having been the first emerging nation of the 20th century, and having had such close attachment with the oppressed people of Africa down through the years, as our missionaries and others worked on behalf of the African people without looking for a return in this world, shared with the people of Africa a great sense of joy and pride as one area after another was granted or won its freedom.  Nowadays we share an immense concern with the African people that their fortunes are being dictated not by their own interests but by the interests of external powers with little regard for the interests of the people of Africa.</P>
    <P>It is significant and encouraging that the African churches in South Africa which do not represent the majority, and the Islamic system, have expressed their concern about developments.  The purpose of our motion, which as we all know has no political mileage here, is to put on record that Ireland, which has an international influence, partly voluntary and partly involuntary through unavoidable emigration, is, through its public representatives, expressing solidarity with all who work for the promotion of human dignity and for the legitimate aspirations of oppressed people.  It is our belief that a society that cannot exist without imprisoning people and interrogating people until they die or that bans people and what they say is not worth defending.  That, unfortunately, is the basis of the racist regimes in South Africa.</P>
    <P>So much has been said about apartheid and so many comments continue to be made that it is almost dangerous to pick one comment and criticise it without criticising them all, but I will refer to one particularly nasty comment which appeared in a magazine which most Deputies and Senators <Col N="123" /> received through the post.  This magazine has a great deal of merit in it, in some of its comments and it gives a tremendous amount of coverage to Africa.  Because of that it is worth reading but there is a certain bias in it.  A fortnight ago this magazine had a leading article in relation to Africa which made savage, unfair comments on Bishop Lamont and on Mr. Seán MacBride.  It referred to Bishop Lamont as a despicable cleric who ought to be denounced as the chaplain to the Kremlin and to Mr. Seán MacBride as an emissary of Soviet Russia.  Most of us know both gentlemen to be Christian people concerned with human dignity and human rights and they insist that these be respected without regard to the political nature of the regimes under which people live.  This unfortunate article condemned these two Christian gentlemen, who suffered a considerable amount for their beliefs and who worked for the cause of human rights far beyond what was required of them as human beings.  They made their contribution with an absolute conviction about the correctness of what they are doing and nobody could challenge the objectives of Bishop Lamont and Mr. MacBride who have invariably acted from right motives.  They should certainly not be condemned in the intemperate and vulgar way they were condemned in <i>To the Point</i> recently. The author and publisher of that article bring no credit to themselves in their defence of the white people of South Africa, Rhodesia or any other area, by making attacks upon concerned people endeavouring to secure fair play and decent opportunities for personal development for the majority race in Africa.  Whatever else might be said on this I hope we will not have such vicious personal attacks in the future on two splendid people who have done a great deal for people throughout the world without regard to colour, religion, race or political views.</P>
    <P>The campaign against apartheid is not helped by the sinister and unhelpful presence in Africa today of Russian and Cuban interference in Angola, <Col N="124" /> Zaire, the Horn of Africa and Zambia.  Unfortunately that involvement has arisen due to the failure of the western world to convince those who emigrated from the western world to Africa of the consequences of their policies.  The only way in which the evil influence of the communist world can be eradicated from South Africa is by convincing the indigenous Africans that their real friends are the people of Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand and so on, the people of the western world, the people of the free world.  There is nobody free under communism, under the type of society Russia has maintained in Eastern Europe and now wants to impose on central Africa so as to divide the African continent and to hold it and the western world in its sinister grip.</P>
    <P>However, as long as the South African Government continue to behave in their evil ways they weaken their opportunity to convince the Africans that the Communists are not friends of the African people.  I wonder just how sure are the South African Government of their policies.  On 19 October last they banned 18 organisations working for the black people of Africa.  They were not all political organisations, far from it.  Some of them were not doing anything more than looking after the basic human needs of millions of underprivileged black people.  They banned two newspapers for no other reason than that they were arguing for a fairer share for black people.  They detained large numbers of leaders of African political movements and indeed of many non-political movements.  They banned many African people, and many white people supporting the African's cause from moving out of their homes.  Since June 1976 they have banned open air meetings.  You do not change people's views and you cannot conquer a people by prohibiting them from meeting.  All you do is to build up greater frustration.</P>
    <P>One of the most unsavoury aspects of the South African regime is the large number of people who have died from violent causes while in police custody. Some 20 such cases occurred in 1977 alone.  There is little point in reading out a litany of the martyrs, because <Col N="125" /> that is what they are.  Even if some of them had committed crimes of violence they were still entitled to be treated with dignity and not subjected to torture while imprisoned.  At least one of them, like Mahatma Ghandi, condemned violence of all kinds, criticised those who engaged in it.  He was a man who was noted for the calmness of his comments, and though he disagreed with those who championed the black man's cause in some other way, he always did it mildly, and when he was criticising apartheid he did it with mildness, always expressing his understanding of the fears that motivated people to pursue evil and foolish courses.</P>
    <P>I speak, of course, of Steve Biko who died after three weeks in police custody in Port Elizabeth on 12 September last.  One of the most horrific aspects of the South African regime exposed as a consequence of that is the manner in which the judicial system were prepared with euphemisms to conceal the ugliness of all that happened. It is impossible to have confidence in an administration that could allow such things to happen not merely to Steve Biko but to others.  One can think also of the student Bonaventura Malaza who was held since July last year in prison and was found hanged in his own cell on 18 November last. Ahmed Timol was described as having fallen to his death in Johannesburg at police headquarters on 18 November 1971.</P>
    <P>They are just three cases but there are many others, but I never believe in trying to stir up people's emotions by quoting individual cases.  The fact that these can happen with such frequency and that those who criticise them can have restriction orders imposed on them while those who commit the crimes can be indemnified under an Indemnity Act which goes back to the Soweto Riots of June 1976 is in itself a terrible condemnation of the system of apartheid.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to be unfair to anybody and I hope I have not been.  I have tried to understand what can motivate people to such desperate and evil policies.  Obviously it comes back <Col N="126" /> to the main cause of man doing wrong through the centuries, and that is fear, and in our condemnation of apartheid, therefore, we should not try to suggest that there are any facile or easy solutions. There are not.  We have known this on our own shores in relation to sectarian tensions.</P>
    <P>A few years ago I was in Boston and at that time there were riots day after day there, in what were known as the bussing riots.  Buses were overturned, people were killed and houses were burned as white people protested against black children being brought from black areas to white areas to schools.  You can understand my sense of shame when in the most read local newspaper there was a leading article pointing out that the main protesters against bussing were the Irish in Boston&mdash;that they were doing to blacks of Boston what they objected to being done by violent people on the Orange side to the Catholic minority in the North.</P>
    <P>So as we express our condemnation of apartheid, as we support those who are working towards its disintegration, let us not cast stones about us or pretend that if we had the problems or the anxieties of the people of Africa we would act in a different way.  We might well not.  I return to what I said earlier that as we condemn we must also work towards a solution.  We must encourage progress along the right lines.  We must persuade the embattled white community&mdash;they are not embattled but they seem to be&mdash;that their relations, as they see us in Europe and in America, have some understanding of what worries them.  They have seen so much violence in Africa, the latest exhibition of which has been in Zaire promoted by Russia and Cuba, that we must consider what we would do in that situation.  We must understand both sides, but let us, as we suggest in the motion, condemn apartheid because it is wrong, it offends human dignity and can never be defended. Let us also try to work in all channels, not merely in the sophisticated diplomatic international sphere but elsewhere, to try to bring harmony to these people without regard to colour <Col N="127" /> of skin, because we are all made in God's likeness.</P>

      <P>: First of all I wish to express my support for the motion proposed by Deputy Ryan and to commend its acceptance to the House.  As we know, apartheid is an evil system.  It is wrong and it offends against human dignity and all the decent accepted standards of humanity.  Though accepting the motion, I am glad to express on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government our abhorrence of apartheid and our hope that there will be effective action against it by the international community.</P>
      <P>The proclamation by the General Assembly of the United Nations of the year beginning on 21 March 1978 as &ldquo;International Anti-Apartheid Year&rdquo; was intended as a way of helping to mobilise world public opinion on this whole dreadful question.  Ireland voted for the resolution and it is appropriate that the Dáil, under the terms of the motion before the House, should express its solidarity with those engaged in promoting this effort.</P>
      <P>In condemning the apartheid system as we do, it is necessary to be clear that our condemnation extends equally to abuses of human rights everywhere. However, there are particular aspects of the apartheid system in South Africa which make it both wrong and dangerous and which merit special condemnation and concern by the international community.</P>
      <P>The apartheid system is wrong in the first place because it is built on racialism.  As we know, racialism means discrimination between human beings on the basis of the colour of their skin and the fact that they are not of a particular race.  That is a denial of their common humanity which we consider the basis for all human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In South Africa racialism has been made the formal and explicit basis for a whole political system.  The rights and the political and economic status of each individual in that society <Col N="128" /> depend on his or her racial origin, on the colour of his or her skin.  This is bad enough in itself but the system, as applied in South Africa, has been used to establish and maintain a position of dominance for a white minority of approximately five million people over a black and coloured majority of more than 20 million people.</P>
    <P>In applying this system the South African Government claim to apply a policy of separate development.  The theory is that eventually there will be a territorial separation of the black and white populations and the black population will be given independence in a series of homelands or Bantustans. However, the reality is that it is no more than a facade, a degradation by one race against another, the suppression of the majority by the minority. To say the least that is rather ironic.</P>
    <P>The homelands comprise 13 per cent of the present territory of South Africa and the land is generally poor and lacking in resources.  Deputy Ryan has outlined the case very clearly.  He has given us the facts and figures of the ownership of the land by the white minority.  He gave us a graphic and thorough description of the exclusiveness of the society as operated by the minority.  The homelands are scattered throughout the country and often they are fragmented in such a way that they cannot be viable as independent countries. Yet, these homelands are put forward as a compulsory alternative to South African citizenship for black or coloured South Africans, many of whom have never seen the homelands to which they are supposed to belong. That is another incredible aspect of this historic horror story.</P>
    <P>Theoretically this is a policy of separate development but in practice it becomes a justification for every kind of discrimination and abuse.  Because black South Africans are seen in theory as entitled to citizenship rights in these artificial homelands, they are excluded from rights of all kinds in South Africa proper.  There is a mass of laws covering all aspects of life in South Africa and they discriminate against the black African, the coloured and the Asian peoples. They ensure their continuing political <Col N="129" /> and economic inferiority.  The majority of the population of South Africa are condemned to degradation, despondency and to frightful conditions that are difficult to describe.  Humiliation might be a better word to use in this context.</P>
    <P>The idea that because a person's skin is black he is inferior to a white person does not make sense by Christian or any other standards. Least of all does it make sense by the standards of the people who practise the form of religion of most white South Africans.  I think it is the religion of the Dutch Reformed Church which is based on the precepts of some form of perverted Christianity.  It is an exclusive form of religion because it includes only those people with white skins.  The unfortunate aspect of that type of Christianity is that those who embrace it extend it to their everyday life, economically, culturally and socially.  The millions who practise this unusual form of Christianity use it to exclude those whose skin happens to be different.  It is an unusual tragedy.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ryan said, South Africa in the first instance was populated by white people and subsequently the black people of the Continent moved to that part of the land.  The white population were described as the first white African tribe and, as a result, they considered that this entitled them to rights over and above those who followed them.  If the people who come after them are white they are in, but if they are black they are out.  It is an appalling prospect.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have said why we consider the situation in South Africa to be wrong and unjust. However, it has now become increasingly dangerous as well and this must clearly be a cause of great concern to the international community.</P>
    <P>For many years the leaders of the majority black African population have tried to lead their people to seek their most basic rights by peaceful means but except for minor details the system has remained unchanged.  Accordingly, each new generation must learn to accept a system which stunts their <Col N="130" /> whole lives.  It is little wonder in the face of this that many of the younger generation are unfortunately turning to more militant and more bitter tactics and that they are increasingly tending to look to other means of ending the permanent degradation and humility of their people.  The result is a gradual growth of violence since this appears to be the only means of bringing about change within that crude, insensitive structure based on the principles of apartheid.</P>
    <P>When I had the privilege of speaking on behalf of the Government at the World Conference for Action against Apartheid organised under the United Nations in Lagos late last year I tried to point out the grave dangers of a slide into violence in South Africa.  I said on that occasion:</P>
    <P>The opponents of apartheid within South Africa have shown great patience in the face of great provocation. When they have tried to reason and persuade they have been imprisoned or ignored.  In the course of our history in Ireland we have also experienced oppression and the consequences of the failure to redress political grievances in time.  When resort to the gun is seen as the only means of action against injustice this has incalculable and tragic consequences.</P>
    <P>There are particular dangers to be seen at the moment.  If what I called the slide into violence continues in South Africa and Southern Africa generally, there is in the first instance a danger of what in effect would be racial war with many neighbouring States of black Africa ranging against the intransigent white population of South Africa. There is a further danger, which will be evident, of outside intervention in such a situation.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out during the course of this debate, this has now become a reality in some of the southern States of Africa with outside intervention from as far away as Cuba.  It is an appalling prospect.  We cannot ignore the fact that Russia has interests and also sees some future for herself in an African role.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> I believe there is an increasing danger that if racial violence grows in South Africa there will be a tendency there to outside intervention and polarisation in East-West terms.  This is one of the great dangers.  This could be disastrous.  It is very much in the interest of the international community as a whole and of the western powers in particular to see that this situation does not develop.  It will not be enough to appeal to the black population in South Africa to continue to use peaceful means and to avoid violence in their efforts to promote change.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is right, despite the provocation and difficulties which they face, to urge them not to turn to violence.  It is an easy thing for me here in this House to make that appeal but one wonders if they would find my appeal acceptable in circumstances of the continuity of their oppression and suppression.  We are urging them not to turn to violence.  If we do this there is a corresponding duty on the international community to support and encourage them and to help as effectively as we can to bring pressure on the South African Government and the white South African population to change their present policies.</P>
    <P>This will not be an easy task.  The white South African population feel they are an embattled white minority in Southern Africa but that it is one which is long established in the territory. The tragedy is that they are descendants of a people who themselves fought for freedom and equality and proclaimed in 1847 in the Retief Manifesto that they were resolved wherever they went &ldquo;to uphold the just principles of liberty&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, they have in practice seen liberty as an exclusive prerogative of one race. In face of the very wrong and dangerous situation in South Africa and the stubborness and intransigence of the white minority it behoves all of us to show our concern and do everything we can to promote peaceful change and avert disaster.</P>
    <P>In addition to speaking at Lagos last year on behalf of the Government <Col N="132" /> at the world conference on apartheid, I also had the opportunity of speaking at the conference organised by the Irish anti-Apartheid Movement given in Dublin.  It was a conference on churches, racism liberation in South Africa and took place in St. Anne's Parish Centre, Molesworth Place on 22 October last.  On that occasion I congratulated the anti-apartheid movement for their untiring efforts to bring to the attention of the Irish people the fact that the injustices of the apartheid system affected not only the people of South Africa but all people concerned with the cause of peace and democracy. I also said:</P>
    <P>Who can be served by refusing to listen to the voice of progress?  The law which is meant to uphold freedom, liberties and rights of the individual which is increasing in South Africa is being used to suppress those very things.  This, we are told, is done in the name of law and order.  I am in no doubt that such actions will be unsuccessful.  You cannot suppress the voice of reason or discontent by increasing repression.</P>
    <P>This was my humble offering to that conference which I had the pleasure of addressing and opening on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I believe that the international community, who understand the ways in which the oppressive character of the apartheid system provokes people to violence, should nevertheless continue to encourage the majority in South Africa to rely on peaceful means to bring about change.  The international community have a corresponding obligation, as I have already stated, to mobilise public opinion around the world in support of those who seek change in South Africa so that the people in South Africa who are oppressed and are suppressed are seen not to stand alone.  The international community must also do everything open to them to bring effective pressure on the South African Government for change, and countries like ourselves, who have a very important moral role on the international scene, diplomatic and otherwise, should also <Col N="133" /> be prepared to contribute as far as they can to educational and other funds under the auspices of the United Nations and other bodies so that there will be opportunities open to black South Africans elsewhere, which they are at present denied in their own country.</P>
    <P>I believe that Ireland is playing her part in all of those ways.  In the effort to mobilise world public opinion and to show solidarity with the oppressed majority of South Africa, the International Anti-Apartheid Year, the proclamation of which the Irish Government supported in the United Nations, can be of particular help.  The motion now before the House can also be an effective way of assuring the people who are at present living in conditions of degradation that they are not alone in their efforts to fight a system but can count on moral support elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In efforts to bring effective pressure to bear in South Africa we have also played our part.</P>
    <P>Last November the Security Council of the United Nations imposed a mandatory arms embargo against South Africa.  They recognise at last that the build-up of arms in South Africa is a threat to international peace and security, a threat which was forcibly brought home recently by South Africa's invasion of Angola.  Ireland has fully accepted, and strictly observed, the voluntary arms embargo since it was first imposed by the General Assembly some 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>To return to the latest conference for action against apartheid, last autumn I myself called, on behalf of the Government, for a mandatory embargo. It was later imposed and we welcomed that imposition.  That was a very important contribution made by the Government at that particular world conference in Africa.  Some eyebrows were raised on the occasion because of the strength of the Irish call and the manner in which it was made, but subsequently the waverers, who may have had doubts, accepted the sincerity of the call and the morality of what we sought.  We played a very important role in that conference designed <Col N="134" /> to bring about a mandatory embargo and, for my part, I hope the international community will continue now to put pressure on South Africa and consider further measures.  Black leaders there have frequently stressed that more sanctions make life more difficult for the very people those sanctions are designed to help, but that is a price they are prepared to pay willingly for international pressure and support.</P>
    <P>Successive Irish Governments have always held that for international measures to be effective they must be mandatory and therefore imposed by the United Nations Security Council as otherwise they will achieve little and may even lead to widescale evasion. There are loopholes being used by certain nations which publicly proclaim, on the one hand, their wish and desire to support mandatory sanctions and, on the other hand, hypocritically evade them.  We have joined with many countries in calling on the Security Council to consider imposing a ban on new investments in South Africa, and we will consider supporting other measures in the light of how successful they are likely to be and how seriously intentioned they are in their objective of ending the insidious and evil apartheid system as quickly and as peacefully as possible.</P>
    <P>In the European Community, of which we are a member, Ireland proposes to use the weight of the community to bring effective pressure on South Africa to change its policy.  So far the Nine have adopted a code of conduct which they have recommended to companies in their countries with branches and subsidiaries in South Africa.  This code stresses in particular the encouragement of black trade unionism.  It is an attempt to provide basic human rights which the apartheid system of its nature denies, such as equality of opportunity and equal pay for equal work.  The Nine are at present considering other measures of a similar kind, and I can assure the House that Ireland will support any effective steps in this direction.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also been contributing regularly to a number of United Nations funds designed to assist the <Col N="135" /> victims of the racialist policies of the South African Government.  These contributions are well known and I do not think the time of the house should be taken up in reiterating exactly what the contributions are.</P>
    <P>While maintaining our efforts in the direction I have indicated I cannot hide the fact that there is unfortunately little room for optimism in face of the tragic situation inside South Africa. Year after year the world has condemned South Africa and yet the system remains strong and the hearts which perpetuate it seemingly remain unmoved.  September last saw the murder of Steve Biko in prison. October witnessed further efforts at peaceful defence. Yet, in the general election which followed the National Party was re-elected with an unprecedented majority.  It is as well to stress once more that, whilst 4,000,000 had the opportunity of voting, the prerequisite for membership of that exclusive electorate was the colour of one's skin because, out of a population of 25,000,000 to 26,000,000, 20,000,000 were excluded because they were black, or coloured, or suffered from what the whites there would call a &ldquo;skin defect&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Hopes that a new, strong Government would use its position to bring in meaningful reforms have not been realised, and immediately after the election Mr. Vorster emphasised that there would be no far-reaching changes.  The changes in some of the apartheid laws are welcome and should be encouraged, but I really think they are far too little and unfortunately far too late.  Any changes which occur in the apartheid laws must be seen against the background of the Bantustan policy, the homeland policy, which is gradually but steadily being implemented and which is designed to negate any rights the black population have or may be given in South Africa as a whole.  In an interview as recently as 14 May last Mr. Vorster reiterated that it is not the policy of his Government ever to allow blacks to vote in South African elections and that they can have political power only in their specially created <Col N="136" /> homelands, homelands which a large majority, as I have already indicated, have never even seen.  This is the perfidy, the insidiousness and hypocrisy of the system.</P>
    <P>In face of this situation, difficult as it is at times to do so, it is necessary to continue to press as strongly as we can for peaceful change and show solidarity in every way we can with the vast majority in South Africa.  I believe the present motion offers the House a suitable opportunity of doing this, and once more I commend it to the Dáil for adoption.  I believe it should have the support not only of all parties here but also of the great majority of the Irish people.  It is a fitting way of showing our support and encouragement for international anti-apartheid year.  I am very glad to have had this opportunity of expressing as strongly as is possible the Government's opposition to apartheid and their support for those who would seek to change the system peacefully, and I am grateful to the House for giving me this opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: In supporting this motion I believe it is as yet impossible to estimate the extent of worldwide repercussions to the evergrowing conflict in southern Africa. We have seen the Russian, Cuban and American forces slowly but surely being drawn into this African revolution, and it seems to me we will yet unfortunately witness in the not-too-distant future a new Vietnam in southern Africa, but I believe the extent of that war would prove to be even worse.  We have a situation where the quite fanatical&mdash;and that is the only word one can use&mdash;leadership of the white minorities in these countries is still backed by powerful western economic forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no way they can turn back the tide of African history.  I do not believe they will succeed in reversing the advancing African revolution, just as previous generations did not succeed. We read about the American revolution, the French revolution, the Russian revolution.  In our own lifetime, our own generation will witness the beginning of the African revolution. <Col N="137" /> I am not a pessimist by nature and I would not wish to predict any gloom or doom in the future evolution of Southern Africa.  It is the considered opinion of many observers that that revolution will probably end in the rather bloody defeat of the armies of that 10 per cent minority overall who would proclaim racial dictatorship over the massive African majority.  I do not wish to paint a scenario as grim as that, but I see little prospect of the Vorster regime changing their policy at this stage.</P>
    <P>This House will have to appreciate that the current white domination, in the short run, or in the long run&mdash;and the short run seems to be getting quite short&mdash;will end in political insurrection probably based on racial war.  I view with some cynicism the criticism of Mr. Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser, who waxed eloquent against Soviet and Cuban military activity in Africa.  The reality is that they are there because successive American Administrations and multi-national corporations&mdash;the mining interests alone&mdash;have profited enormously from the exploitation of the African peoples.  In those circumstances, is one to suggest that the African peoples are likely to turn to them?  They are fighting a war of national liberation, as they regard it, and if the Americans, or the Cubans, or the Soviet Union, were to provide weapons and, for that matter, if China were willing to get in on the action and supply weapons, they would be willing to accept them.  They have not got much prospect of getting much support from the Americans.  The other world powers now want a slice of the action in terms of future political influence on that Continent.  When real power and influence on the situation in Southern Africa were needed, there was not any great American impact.  Perhaps there is a desire to have one now.</P>
    <P>In this International Anti-Apartheid Year we should place on record that Dáil Éireann recognises that the apartheid system in South Africa is a unique system, an evil system of racial rule which denies to the vast majority of the population of southern Africa basic human, legal and national rights <Col N="138" /> based, as it is, on economic exploitation and the institution of terror and violence against the black population. I further suggest Dáil Éireann should affirm its support for the UN Convention on the crime of apartheid which very clearly described apartheid as a crime against humanity and condemned the Pretoria regime's persistent aggression against their own population and the neighbouring states of Southern Africa which constitutes&mdash;and the UN Resolution was quite specific about this&mdash;a grave threat to international peace and security.</P>
    <P>We have to be more specific.  We have to condemn the role of those States and multi-national companies which collaborate with South Africa both in the nuclear field and in military and economic fields, thus strengthening apartheid.  It is not enough to talk about disarmament out of one side of one's mouth if one belongs to a western European nation and turn a blind eye when some military exporting individual in one's own country flogs arms directly to the Southern African governments by whatever circuitous route they evolve to sell those arms.  That kind of hypocrisy does not impress and never impressed those brave people in South Africa, in Namibia, and in Zimbabwe in their struggle against oppression.</P>
    <P>We should place on record in this House our support for the general work of the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement.  My own interest arose over the years from my contact with two people in particular who came here some 15 years ago, Kader and Louise Asmal.  Their work has been quite outstanding for the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement and their adopted country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: We should also urge the Government to implement the programme of action against apartheid in a number of ways.  We have to sever political, cultural, commercial and consular links and sporting relations with the organisations of the South African regime.  For example, there is the proposal <Col N="139" /> that South Africa should participate in the forthcoming world tug-o'-war competition.  We have to oppose this.  We have to ensure that no public funds are spent on a competition involving a team which would in no way represent the population of that country. We had it close to home in recent months when we had the cancellation, which I welcomed, of the world golf cup competition in Waterville in County Kerry.</P>
      <P>It has been recognised in almost every sphere of international sport that teams of that nature from South Africa in no way represent the sporting population of that country.  This is recognised by the international Olympics committee and every other organisation in the major world sports.  I am glad that competition was cancelled.  We lost from the point of view of tourism and we lost income, but that is the price we must pay if we do not want to be contaminated by such a function which gives credence to the system.</P>
      <P>We should call on the Government to increase economic support to the neighbouring African countries.  They carry a very heavy burden because of their proximity to the apartheid regime.  Our Irish programme of development aid to those countries is most welcome.  It has a growing effectiveness.  I commend the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs over the last three years in that regard.  It was excellent.  The allocation of money and development aid within the budget has been growing.  I would be appalled if there was any cutback in public expenditure in that area.  That kind of programme, not solely in the financial sense, is of great benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big number of Irish people who go to Africa&mdash;I have met quite a number of them&mdash;return with a thorough knowledge of the situation there and make a distinctive contribution.  We should also call on the Government to give material and moral support to the oppressed people of South Africa in their struggle for political and economic freedom.  In doing that we should be careful at home about our domestic promotional work.  It has <Col N="140" /> happened that companies have come here seeking capital grants and mineral exploration licences, and many of them have massive subsidiaries in southern Africa.  If we told them that their investment accumulated with the blood of African miners on their hands which is something that we do not want we would be better off.  We should tell them that we do not wish to be contaminated.  I accept that it is not easy to turn down an industry in any constituency, but industries from such companies should be rejected in the national interest.</P>
    <P>There is also a great need to inform Irish public opinion, particularly our young people, about the evils of racism.  It is difficult for the many thousands of Irish people who never got an opportunity of travelling abroad to see the impact of racism to know what the situation is like.  By and large they live in a country which for all our sectarianism does not have a particular brand of apartheid&mdash;racism, which is condemned in this resolution &mdash;but it is true to say that there is a percentage of people living here who are racist.  The extent of that percentage we cannot guess, but we must be honest about this.  There are people here who are anti-black and who are quite positive, bigoted and prejudiced in their view in favour of what they would call white supremacy.  I have met constituents who hold such views.  They do not hide them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Richie Ryan referred to the prejudiced attitudes of the Irish in Boston on the issue of school buses, but the question should also be asked: to what extent would the people of Dublin prove that different in their reaction to a similar issue?  We are not all virgin purity when it comes to our attitudes in terms of race. Those who read Father McGrail's recent book on that subject here would see the relevance of my point. I am not under any illusion about how virulent the infection of apartheid and racism can become.  For example, we have seen a support for one particular brand of racism&mdash;a very subtle kind&mdash; in the policy enunciated by the leader of the British Conservative Party.  In my view she has a brand of racism. <Col N="141" /> We also see and abhor the role of the National Front in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>We must ensure by our actions at all levels that the cancer is exposed and eradicated in our society.  I favour a multi-racial society in southern Africa based on majority rule.  I do not advocate a violent solution, but I do not presume to advise the population of southern Africa that it should not resort to a violent solution.  In that context I differ somewhat from the Minister of State.  I do not believe in dictating to the majority of people in southern Africa as to how they should bring about the end of that blot on humanity.  In their own way they will choose their own method.  That will be their privilege as it was the privilege of the Irish people.  We cannot tell them what they can do or that they should be nice boys and the West will keep things ticking over smoothly while it is all happening.  The older one gets the more relevance that approach has in life.  The issue is not just one of racism. It is one of economic, social and political independence of the majority of the people of southern Africa.  Above all, it is the establishment of self-government in those territories by the majority of people of those countries.  For those reasons we are glad that the House has been given an opportunity of debating this motion.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging that there is all-Party support for the motion.  I have no doubt that the record of the debate will be read elsewhere.  To the extent that we exert some influence on the national scene and to the extent that we endeavour to bring to our own people an understanding of the situation it is a privilege to be given an opportunity of participating in the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to express my thanks to the Minister, and the Chair, for accepting this question. The reason I raised it is my concern in relation to the statement by the INTO at a special conference that they will withdraw their services in sub-standard <Col N="142" /> schools as and from 3 October next.  It transpires that there are about 700 to 800 such schools although I am awaiting confirmation of the exact number.  I am surprised at the silence of a number of committees of management on this subject. Nevertheless, the threat of the INTO to repeat a withdrawal of service which they carried out in 1967 must obviously cause concern to me, to the Minister and to the House.  In the past month we have had a spate of headlines on this subject.  I quote from a report of the INTO conference in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 30 March last:</P>
      <P>The incoming Vice-President, Mr. Gerry Keane, told the union's Annual Congress in Tralee it was disgraceful that hundreds of teachers and thousands of children were still in primitive school conditions.  He said that many schools were ratinfested. They had no caretakers and teachers or children had to clean them after school hours.  In many cases the teachers still had to light fires in the mornings which meant that &ldquo;arctic conditions&rdquo; prevailed until the building got warm.</P>
      <P>In addition, many schools only had quagmires for playgrounds and no running water.</P>
      <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 14 April reported that Seán Brosnahan declared that their policy would be &ldquo;No heat no school&rdquo;.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 20 April carried the headline &ldquo;Mice nibble through INTO chief's school&rdquo;, and that headline referred to a school in Ballybrack where the president of the INTO, Mrs. Fiona Poole, works. Another interesting headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 16 April is &ldquo;Wilson's Budget Pledge&rdquo; The article reads:</P>
      <P>An early meeting will be held between the Minister for Education, Mr. Wilson, and the executive of the INTO, which yesterday decided to pull out members from hundreds of sub-standard schools after October 3 next.  The Minister told the <i>Sunday Independent</i> he would be meeting the teachers shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say what happened at that meeting in relation to <Col N="143" /> the sub-standard schools which are scattered throughout the country. Between last April and now, which is more than a month, he should have had a full survey of the situation and should be able to report to the House on the results of his inquiries into this matter.</P>
    <P>The headline &ldquo;School closed because it was overrun by mice&rdquo; in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 April, refers to a national school in north County Dublin which had to be closed for a week because it was overrun by mice.  <i>The Irish Times</i> of 13 March carries a comprehensive article on the INTO Conference in Tralee.  It is obvious that the teachers are annoyed about the situation and about the lack of finance for maintenance and improvements which are necessary to ensure that all our primary schools remain in good condition.</P>
    <P>The present £8 State subsidy for maintenance, which was announced by Mr. Peter Barry when he was Minister for Education, and the £2 local contribution is not sufficient now.  The State contribution should be raised to £9 or £10 for the next school year.  I should like the Minister to give a commitment in relation to this aspect of finance.</P>
    <P>In regard to the necessary improvements, in the House today the Minister was quite happy about the fact that £14.3 million was provided in the capital budget.  I should like to point out to him that in the past year the allocation of expenditure on the erection, extension and improvement of primary schools was £13.5 million. This year the amount is £14.3 million, which is an increase of 9 per cent.  I suggest that this figure would cover only the increased rate of inflation and would not allow any new improvements to be undertaken.  If this is so, how is it possible to tackle the vital question of bringing schools up to some modicum of a standard for the teachers and children?  I suggest that the capital sum for primary schools is inadequate for raising the standard of substandard schools.  I want to know if the Minister intends to introduce a special supplementary estimate to <Col N="144" /> cover the necessary improvements in many schools.</P>
    <P>In relation to the maintenance cost, I suggest bluntly that special consideration should be given to the position of small schools.  It is obvious that the capitation system of maintenance grants does not suffice for small schools.  The simple economics are that small schools have a basic and essential overhead charge which is far higher in relation to the per capita cost than that of large schools and it cannot be properly reflected in a capitation-type scheme.  I suggest that the scheme should be adapted to ensure that there is a different capitation grant for small schools.  The grant for small schools should be £12.  The capitation grant for large schools is £8 and it should be between £9 and £10. Clearly there is an excellent case to be made for giving separate capitation grants to small schools.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Keating's involvement in this issue by raising the subject in relation to a school in East Wall and another school in County Dublin.  His interest in this matter is quite obvious, especially in relation to schools in the north city area of Dublin.</P>
    <P>In his reply this afternoon the Minister referred to the closure of one- and two-teacher schools.  I should like the Minister to clearly state the number and location of these schools, when these schools are going to close, the transport and amalgamation procedures agreed to, and the consultation he has entered into on this subject. While I understand the Minister's philosophy and his anxiety to ensure a good standard of education, I make the point that you can have a negative value in so far as the long time spent travelling to and from school&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am referring to it because it arose in the course of the Minister's reply.  I should like the Minister to give me some indication of the extent of further closures: can we expect a large scale spate of closures throughout the country, a situation with which I would not at all agree, especially bearing in mind the long time spent by young children travelling to and from school?</P>
      <P>I should like to know also from the Minister&mdash;in relation to the circular he sent to chairmen of boards of management of national schools in relation to grants&mdash;what response he has received, what commitments have been entered into, what costs will be incurred and also if such moneys have been provided for in the current Estimate.  As far as I can ascertain there are not extra moneys available for this very important task.</P>
      <P>In passing I should like to refer to the need for remedial teachers to be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I mentioned it in passing in so far as that the smaller schools cannot afford such remedial teachers.  There is a very good case for the concept of sharing remedial teachers because the need for them arises especially in substandard small schools.  Some kind of policy is warranted in this area.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer also to the question of the schools under the Minister's direct control and to inquire if he is satisfied that all of these schools are up to the standard he would like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the extent of the sub-standard schools is quite evident. I am satisfied also that the Minister has not at his disposal the requisite moneys to rectify the position, as it has now evolved.  I am satisfied further that the <Col N="146" /> action threatened by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation will take place. If it does take place the blame will lie squarely on the Minister's doorstep, because he has been given, so to speak, the entire spring and summer to rectify the situation.  I want to know from him now quite specifically what steps he has taken to spend moneys on such schools and where such moneys will come from.  I want a further assurance from him that the threatened withdrawal of service by national teachers will not take place.  It is important to establish that now before the Dáil adjourns for the summer recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>: Let me say that I appreciate very much the concern of Deputy E. Collins for the school-going population.  I know that that is what motivated him to ask for this brief adjournment debate. During the course of his contribution he used the words &ldquo;I am satisfied&rdquo; on a number of occasions.  He is at fault in being satisfied about certain things which are based, as he said himself, mainly on headlines in newspapers and not on research carried out carefully and facts carefully ascertained and verified.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about 700 to 800 substandard schools and said that he was surprised at the silence of boards of management.  I appreciate his thought in that regard.  Were there so many sub-standard schools then the silence of the boards of management would be not merely surprising but crassly negligent.  The Deputy referred to a meeting with the INTO which was mentioned some time in April and said that a long time had passed between then and now.  I want to tell the Deputy that the INTO do not want to meet me on this subject until after their own survey.  That is their expressed wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred briefly to amalgamations in the context of there being substandard schools in situations where amalgamations are mooted, in other words, if a central school were provided&mdash;one of the many fine, commodious and well appointed central schools we are building at present that will stand comparison with those being built in any country in the world&mdash;in <Col N="147" /> those circumstances there may be schools which, for one reason or another, are the subject of some controversy, where people do not want to see them go even though facilities cannot be provided in them.</P>
    <P>The position is this: my general policy is well known.  I do not intend to exert any bully-boy tactics on parents, citizens, in any part of the country.  But I want to express very forcefully my view, that, in certain circumstances, there is no alternative to providing a central school where the very finest facilities are available, facilties specifically connected with the teaching work in the school and the general atmosphere, that only the very best accommodation is good enough for the children and that, at times, there are parents who are very shortsighted and in fact damaging to their children's prospects.  A census of the accommodation and facilities in national schools is undertaken periodically by the Department of Education. Since I came to office I have sent out letters to my inspectors asking them to report right up-to-date on this matter. For example, there was a full census taken in 1974.  At that time the position about sanitation, heating and drinking water was ascertained.  At that time the position was that 3,301 schools had indoor or outdoor flush toilets; 3,050 schools had oil-fired central heating or electric heating; 3,003 schools had a supply of drinking water available.  Since then there has been quite a number of new schools erected and a number of the smaller schools with poor facilities have been closed.  Therefore, it seems quite clear to anybody that the position has improved since then.  The exact figures will be available to me when my own survey has been completed, which I hope will be in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The total number of primary schools in the country is 3,508.  In view of the figures I have given and of the conclusions that can be drawn from the fact that many new schools have been built in the meantime and many old schools closed, it is quite clear to me that it is a very poor mathematician who can say that 700 to 800 schools <Col N="148" /> are substandard with regard to these particular points.  The system dates back to the early part of the last century and there are bound to be some schools not up to standard.  The capital provision in the Book of Estimates for national schools is, as Deputy Collins has said, £14,300,000. On the principle which has always been adhered to in this House of comparing like with like, that compares favourably&mdash;I am not talking about the outturn which is a different thing altogether&mdash;with what was provided in the Book of Estimates&mdash;£11.5 million&mdash;at the corresponding time last year, that is in 1977.  I want that to be carefully noted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: Can we expect a Supplementary Estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy can take it that £14,300,000 is the figure in the Book of Estimates as compared with £11.5 million at the same time last year, and it is important to reflect on that.  These are substantial provisions by any standards and will be used by me for the building of new schools and the repair of old schools.  I stated in this House today that the schools which lack modern facilities are mainly small one- and two-teacher schools, and in an effort to speed up improvement on any of these schools that were to be kept open for any considerable period a circular was issued by me in August 1977.  This circular went to boards of management authorising them to carry out on their own initiative essential improvements to these schools in accordance with guidelines which were provided.  The number of applications received at the time was approximately 200.  The processing of these applications is a matter for arrangement between boards of management and the OPW.  The OPW are concerned when the board of management have brought the project to tender stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that mention was made of 800 sub-standard schools.  That figure is taken from the air and there is no evidence to support it.  I think that Deputy Collins will accept that there is something wrong with the mathematics <Col N="149" /> somewhere.  I appreciate that standards are rising all the time, and the old saying was that the Ritz is open to everybody.  I am talking about reasonable facilities; I am not talking about luxurious facilities that do not exist on the education scene in any country to my knowledge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister will appreciate that they are not my figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: Quite so, but I would challenge the Deputy only in questioning his accepting figures from sources which have not necessarily verified them, from headlines and so on.  When in the House of Parliament of this country, An Dáil, statements are made about important public matters they should be as a result of research and of figures that have been properly verified and taken from the proper sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister saying that the president of the INTO is not a reputable source?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would not suspect the Deputy of trying to embroil me with the INTO.  There would be no point in such embroilment because in this matter of schools and the standard of schools our objectives are identical. When figures are issued they should be verified and should be given as the result of research properly carried out. People are all the time comparing our <Col N="150" /> schools with schools of other countries. I find this lap-dog attitude somewhat dismaying and a little out of date.  This country is now reaching the stage in its development when it is sure of itself, and I say again that we have produced very fine modern schools in recent years which stand comparison with any schools in any country in the world.  I am personally as much concerned about the physical quality of the schools and as confident of the quality of the people teaching in them as is any organisation.  Since 1922 as regards building schools and replacing obsolete schools and as far as concern for schools goes, this country has not on the whole been found wanting.  I shall continue while holding this office to strive to improve the facilities.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that a substantial capital sum of money has been voted for this year.  I will not be satisfied so long as there is in existence in this country even one school the standard of which can be challenged.  The Deputy who raised the matter on the Adjournment can be assured that the boards of management, the teachers' union and Department of Education have the same objective.  In so far as it concerns me&mdash;and it concerns me percentagewise very considerably&mdash;I assure him that this part of the education scene will not be neglected.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 31 May 1978.</P>

      <P>: I am of the opinion that the present system of pension order books is the most reliable method of ensuring punctual and regular payment of pension to old age pensioners. Where pensioners are unable to travel to post offices regularly, there is provision for the appointment of agents to cash orders on their behalf.  Alternatively, the weekly payments due may be allowed to accumulate for longer periods provided the cashing of any pension order is not delayed longer than 13 weeks.</P>

      <P>: The person referred to by the Deputy claimed disability benefit under the Social Welfare Acts in December 1977, being certified as incapable of work due to blood dyscrasia.  This is not a prescribed occupational disease and the claimant did not attribute it to his employment. He was paid disability benefit on foot of this claim up to 11 February 1978 when he submitted a final certificate stating he was fit to resume work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A claim for injury benefit under the occupational injuries scheme was made on 20 February 1978 in respect of blood lead poisoning which is a prescribed occupational disease and was claimed to have been contracted at <Col N="38" /> work.  Inquiries necessary to establish the facts of the case are continuing and as soon as they have been completed a decision will be given on the claim for injury benefit.</P>

    <P>The board tell me that about 130 of <Col N="48" /> the 200 or so householders in Mayo, who qualified for subsidised connection to the electricity supply under the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1976 remain to be connected, and they hope to have this work completed by the end of March 1979.  The board also tell me that day-to-day applications from householders and so on in County Mayo for connection to the electricity supply are dealt with in the ordinary way of business, a period of some eight to 12 weeks normally elapsing before applicants are connected.</P>
    <P>The employment of such staff as is necessary is a matter for the board themselves who tell me that the optimum number of labourers which it is possible to utilise within the constraints of available resources, including skilled supervisors, have been employed in their Galway and Sligo districts. The board add that they are not aware of any problems in the area of planned maintenance.</P>

    <P>It is evident that the major part of the imports consists of high technology products such as tractors, combine harvesters and other heavy machinery which are outside the scope of the existing Irish manufacturer.  Within the medium technology range there should be opportunities for the development of the Irish industry.  The IDA have had discussions with representatives of the industry to identify ways in which the sector can expand.  These discussions <Col N="49" /> will continue with a view to establishing an overall development plan for the sector.</P>
    <P>In the past five years the IDA have approved grant assistance of £2.2 million to firms in the agricultural machinery sector.</P>

The abolition of domestic rates has meant a further substantial reduction in the local financial contribution. Toilets provided by local authorities in tourist, or Gaeltacht areas, are eligible for financial assistance from Bord Fáilte, or Roinn na Gaeltachta, where the works meet the requirements <Col N="51" /> of the grant schemes operated by these bodies.

      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 175 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that the grant of an extra period of vacation to teachers who are entitled to such extra vacation by reason of having attended a course or courses approved by my Department is under Rule 58 of the Rules for National Schools subject to the approval of the board of management of the school in each case.</P>
      <P>Rule 58 provides that where all the teachers recognised in a school are entitled to such extra vacation the school may be closed, subject to its being in operation for the minimum number of days prescribed (184) in the school year (Rule 59).</P>
      <P>Where only a number of the teachers recognised in a school are entitled to extra vacation, under Rule 58, it is a matter for the school board of management to ensure that the absence from school of those teachers is so arranged as to cause as little disruption as possible to classes in the school.</P>
      <P>The recoupment of the cost of employing substitute teachers in such circumstances is not contemplated.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the consultation, if any, which has taken place with any teaching body prior to the issue of <i>litir</i> 23/77 in relation to the placing of mildly handicapped pupils in ordinary national schools; and if he will give details of any such consultation.</P>

      <P>: Special classes for mildly mentally handicapped pupils or pupils functioning at that level have operated in national schools for many years and are being extended according as needs are identified.  As the Deputy will be aware, there are medical and social, as well as educational, aspects to this matter.  In the context of the developing community care services of the regional health boards, the circular gave guidance on the procedures necessary for the assessment of children before admission to special classes.</P>
      <P>There was no formal consultation with any of the teaching bodies in relation to the circular before its issue.</P>
