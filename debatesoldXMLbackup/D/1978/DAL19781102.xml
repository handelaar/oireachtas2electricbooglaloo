    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Lenihan) Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Lenihan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Lenihan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Elections of Conservators (Postponement) Order, 1978, a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 19th day of October, 1978.</P>
      <P>Elections to boards of conservators, which under the Fisheries Acts would normally be held every five years, have been deferred by amending legislation since 1974.  Under the Elections of Conservators (Postponement) Order, 1977, elections were postponed to 1978. I now propose to make an order postponing these elections to 1979.  Before I may make this order, it must, in accordance with statute, be laid in draft before each House of the Oireachtas and a motion approving of it must be passed by each House.</P>
      <P>This further postponement is necessary as it is considered inappropriate to allow elections under the old system to go ahead in advance of the new legislation designed to give effect to the main recommendations of the Inland Fisheries Commission.  This legislation, which is entitled the Fisheries Bill, 1978, has already been introduced by way of long and short titles and the text of the Bill will be circulated shortly.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, changes in the existing structure of boards of conservators are warranted having regard to the fact that the present system, which has been in existence for over 100 years, still retains some of the unsatisfactory features of a 19th century type administration.  Under the proposed new legislation the boards will be abolished and no further elections in their regard will arise.  The boards and the Inland Fisheries Trust will be replaced by a central board and seven regional boards whose constitution will be suited to present-day requirements. The boards of conservators, whose existence this order will maintain, will cease to exist when, on enactment of the new legislation, the new boards are created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="4" /> Despite the handicap of their outdated structure, boards of conservators have for many years carried out invaluable work in the protection and conservation of inland fisheries.  I wish to again express my own personal and my Department's appreciation of the great work done by the boards and by their staffs.  This is all the more praiseworthy when one considers that members of boards give up their time and energy voluntarily.</P>
    <P>It is fortunate that our inland fisheries have had the benefit of the service of such dedicated people who have been willing to continue in office beyond their normal term.  I have no doubt that when the new boards come to be constituted, we will see included many of the people who have given such loyal service down the years.</P>
    <P>I accordingly recommend to the House that a resolution be passed approving of the draft order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Deasy, our Fisheries spokesman, who is abroad at the moment, I have been asked to deal with this matter.  In principle, it appears that we have no option but to agree with this Motion which provides for the further postponement of elections to boards of conservators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing, however, I must comment on the delay of the Government in producing the long-promised Fisheries Bill.  In a situation where a Fisheries Bill was needed to deal with foreign poachers again there were many promises and considerable delays and it was ultimately only as a result of Opposition pressure, and indeed a Private Members' Bill being put down by Deputy Deasy, that action on the part of the Government was forced.  In this situation the only question I have to raise is how long more do we have to wait before this Bill is circulated?  Will it be necessary for us similarly to put down a Bill to deal with this problem? On that point will we even be permitted to put down a Bill and have a Second Reading thereof, in view of the new restrictive approach of the Government, a dog in the manager approach which does not permit a Second Reading of a Private Members' Bill?  We will be <Col N="5" /> returning to that point on another day to insist on freedom of speech for the Opposition in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>On the point before us we have a Motion to which we agree.  However, when the Minister says that the Fisheries Bill, 1978, will be circulated shortly, what does &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; mean?  Are we talking about a week, a month or another year? I ask him to give us a specific time on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite surprised that the Minister is seeking further postponement of the abolition of the boards of conservators.  We recollect quite clearly the manner in which he waxed indignant last year when he said that this was the last time he would be asking the House to postpone this legislation.  In his opening and concluding speeches of 20 October of last year he was quite firm that this was the last time and that he would be producing the appropriate legislation in early 1978.  Not only was he convincing in his approach to this matter but he reflected considerably on his predecessor because it had been necessary to have some two or three postponements.  I quote from the Official Report of 20 October 1977, column 915, Volume 300:</P>
      <P>Mr. Deasy: ... We did agree in the past year, or maybe two years, to postpone them for just one year.</P>
      <P>This is the elections to boards of conservators.</P>
      <P>Mr. Lenihan: This is the last time.</P>
      <P>Mr. Deasy: The Minister hopes to introduce the legislation early in 1978?</P>
      <P>Mr. Lenihan: There is no question about that.  We have it in hand and it will be ready for publication shortly.</P>
      <P>Again, in his concluding remarks the Minister was absolutely convincing that there would be no further need for postponement. At column 939 of the same Volume the Minister reiterates this point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave no cogent reasons as to why it was necessary to postpone this measure once again.  Is it because there is difficulty in drafting it?  Surely we are not expected to believe that it takes three or four years to draft a Bill in this House.  Measures much more <Col N="6" /> delicate, important and intricate have been dealt with in much less time.  Is it because the necessary money is not available to back up the legislation? Perhaps that is the more certain reason.</P>
    <P>My concern with postponement of this kind is that the important work affecting our inland fisheries is suffering as a result.  The boards of conservators have been under sentence of death for the past four or five years.  They have been clearly told that they were about to be abolished.  In such a situation they could not be expected to continue their work with the same enthusiasm and devotion to duty as heretofore.  Without reflecting on the members of the boards in respect of their duties, one could not expect a man who has been served with a notice of dismissal from his job to take much further interest in that job. Likewise, for the past four years we have had this dithering situation of an effete and sterile organisation which the Minister himself admits is outmoded by 100 years.</P>
    <P>We have a serious problem to contend with in respect of inland fisheries with pollution of a massive kind in certain of our lakes and rivers, not the least of them the River Suir, which passes through my constituency and that of my colleagues in County Waterford.  Here pollution has been rearing its ugly head time and time again in the main artery of the River Suir and its tributaries, and nothing positive has been done.  When we raise these questions time and time again in this House we are told by the Minister that the boards of conservators are the responsible bodies for dealing with the problem of pollution.</P>
    <P>In a situation where these boards have been sentenced to extinction it is hard to expect any initiative which would solve this problem.  I do not blame the boards as they have neither the finance nor the expertise to carry out the work.  One must not forget that the work which they perform is of a voluntary nature and that we owe them a debt of gratitude.  I am not reflecting on the personnel involved, but I do say that in a situation where legislation is being introduced to put them out of business they cannot be expected to face up to their responsibilities. Indeed, they may well feel that they have <Col N="7" /> no responsibility any longer for the important duties of dealing with pollution and poaching and the need to give back more and more of our inland fisheries waters to our people through the angling associations who are in dire need of extra fishing waters.</P>
    <P>It is with regret that we observe a further postponement order being introduced here today.  It sets back the good work which should be in train in respect of the things which we all know are wrong in our inland fisheries.  It is a way out for the Minister.  He can blame it on the conservators.  They have been sentenced to death anyway.  I ask the Minister to face his responsibilities.  He has had to come in here today, despite his statements of this time 12 months ago, and eat humble pie.  He waxed eloquent that it was the last time he would ask the House for a postponement and here we have it once again.  How long is this messing going to continue?  We were to have the legislation early this year on the Minister's say so.  The year 1978 is fast dying and there is no sign of the legislation.  Will we have it before the year is out?  We will, the Minister nods his head.  Could we have something on the record of the House, Minister?  Will this Bill be introduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Whom does the Minister blame in these circumstances?  What is wrong?  The Minister's office and all concerned with the massive back-up service which he possesses were aware of the very strong sentiments which he expressed this time last year.  One would imagine that they were working exceptionally hard to ensure that the necessary legislation was drawn up.  Is it a question of money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>All the boards of conservators have been doing in recent years, while this threat of abolition hung over them, is engaging in a holding operation, letting things tick over until such time as <Col N="8" /> they are formally replaced by new legislation.  Nothing tangible has been done.  No initiatives have been embarked upon.  Consequently, I contend that fishery interests are suffering as a result of this twilight situation.</P>
      <P>We look forward to the new legislation because we expect that many of the anomalies and wrongs which are patent in our present system will be resolved; that positive steps will be taken to deal with pollution and to ensure that personnel and expertise will be quickly on the scene; that we shall have expert advice in dealing with it, in locating it and in punishing those responsible for it, whether the effluent be from industrial sources, farming sources or from our local authorities.</P>
      <P>Perhaps our local authorities are the biggest culprits of all.  Those of us who have been members of local authorities are only too well aware that it was not because of any indifference to their responsibility in the matter, any reluctance to face up to that responsibility, but purely a matter of inability to secure the necessary funds to implement the kind of treatment works and proper sewerage systems which we require to offset pollution of the kind to which I refer.  There is indifference in industry. There is marked indifference in respect of farms, especially pig farms, the effluent of which is of a highly toxic nature.  We need strong effective legislation to deal with these problems.</P>
      <P>There is also a great need to replenish stocks of salmon and trout in rivers and lakes and for the setting up of an authority to be responsible for that work.  We need to assist our angling clubs to secure extra fishing waters, which they are unable to do at the moment because of the exorbitant cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may not be the appropriate occasion to do so, but I should like to ask the Minister if this type of postponement, this inactivity, will be allowed to prevail much longer.  It is his duty to tell us what he can do to redress inequalities in relation to ownership of Irish fishing waters. He should bring rivers and lakes more and more into public ownership.  It is sad to realise that in the matter of ownership of our inland fishing waters, the conquest <Col N="9" /> of Ireland is still very much there 56 years after the attainment of our freedom.  We have evidence that 90 per cent of our rivers and lakes are owned and controlled by private interests, that 25 per cent of our best salmon fisheries are still owned and controlled by the old ascendancy classes, the lords, the dukes, the earls.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that we should deal with this in a rash manner. Although it is an emotive subject, it should be dealt with realistically and pragmatically.  We should be seeking ways and means of bringing a vast number of these fishing areas into Irish ownership, especially to our angling clubs who are responsible bodies of people and who know how to treat fishing waters fairly and equitably.  At least the Minister should be availing of every opportunity to purchase fishing rights when they become available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to be the first Minister for Fisheries since the foundation of the State who has done so, in respect of the Galway Fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be ready, willing and able to purchase these fishing rights when they become available.  Too often it is the people with the fat cheque books who get them and this has been creating a new Irish ascendancy class to replace the old.  There has been very little change, and our angling clubs are still restricted to 13 per cent of our fishing area, and these areas are not the best. The best is reserved for those who claimed ownership as a result of conquest hundreds of years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is with the utmost reluctance that I, on behalf of my party, agree to this postponement.  There has been hiatus and inactivity in this important area.  I ask the Minister particularly, and not for the first time, to have a look at the pollution situation in the River Suir with which I am most familiar.  When I visited my colleagues in Ardfinnan last Friday they brought to my notice the condition of the river on which there was a thick dirty white scum.  It had been there for some days.  No one knew where it had come from, its nature, or how deleterious it was to fish life.  These signs <Col N="10" /> are evident in many of our rivers.  There is also widespread inability to fish because of overhanging trees and bushes and because of lack of arterial drainage. There is a tremendous job of work to be done and I submit that this device of postponement is being used once too often.  I hope the Minister will not come before us again to introduce motions of this kind, that the Government will honour their obligations in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement of the Minister that the new Bill will be circulated shortly to deal with the recommendations of the Inland Fisheries Commission.  I do not think the Opposition can expect us to take them seriously when both the previous Minister, Deputy Clinton, and his Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Michael Pat Murphy, came in here year after year since 1974 with motions to postpone these elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not say &ldquo;This is the last time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a matter of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly:</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know and appreciate the efforts made by the present Minister, especially to deal with poaching at sea which has reduced our salmon stocks to a dangerously low level.  We also know the neglect in the past four years in this respect, especially in regard to areas like the Shannon estuary. I compliment the Minister on his efforts to stamp out this form of poaching, and we hope that the pending legislation will deal with this matter once and for all because, as I have said, our salmon stocks are becoming dangerously low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to learn this week that the ESB have decided to curtail their salmon fishing activities on the Shannon in an effort to conserve stocks.  I know of the conservation problems facing the Limerick Board of Fishery Conservators in relation to the whole Shannon.  They are the biggest board in the country but none of these fishery boards have been relaxing in their obligations or slowing down their activities, even now when their term of office is coming to an end. <Col N="11" /> These boards realise that changes are necessary.  The Limerick Board, as I have said, have not been relaxing their efforts to stamp out illegal poaching on the Shannon and the various pollution problems they have been faced with. There has been no relaxation by the board in their activities during the past few years.  They recognise that legislation is necessary and they have been working closely with the Department and the Minister in an effort to get legislation that will be effective and ensure that salmon stocks are protected.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister today that new legislation will be introduced soon.  I hope that it can be implemented quickly; otherwise the future for the salmon stocks is grim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M. P. Murphy Mr. M. P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy:</NameTxt>
      <P>When we had discussions on previous postponement orders they were of a wide-ranging nature.  The debate on one of the orders con-tinued into the second day.  It was a very wide-ranging one and covered not only inland fisheries but sea fisheries as well.  I could give many quotations to the House of what was said by Members who were then in Opposition, including Deputy Daly.</P>
      <P>We must go back to the root of the problem.  When we took office in 1973 we found that the system by which boards of conservators were elected was, to say the least, repugnant.  On examination I found that some board members got their entitlement to membership on an <i>ex officio</i> basis because they paid a certain amount in fishery rates.  We had the peculiar system where some voters had four votes in the election of conservators. There was another rule under which other people were deemed to have two votes while the small man down the line had only one vote.  Fianna Fáil were quite happy with the system and there was no mention of changing it until 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we took office we considered it advisable to change the system.  I made it clear that so far as the Government and myself were concerned election to boards of conservators would never <Col N="12" /> again take place under what I call the rotten system that obtained up to the last election.  We devised legislation to cover the necessary changes.  It was found essential to bring postponement orders to the House for approval, and that arose because the Government had in mind to bring forward exceptionally comprehensive legislation to cover sea fisheries as well as inland fisheries.  When the postponement orders were discussed here many speakers did not confine themselves to the question before the House but they roamed over the entire fishery area.  At that time our present Minister, Deputy Lenihan, unfortunately was not with us and he does not share any of the blame for what happened in the many discussions that took place here.</P>
    <P>One assertion was made repeatedly, namely, that if Fianna Fáil were in office this type of legislation could be brought in almost overnight.  Fianna Fáil speakers said that as soon as they got into Government we would have the legislation within a few weeks.  Such assertions were made by people who are very prominent in the Government today. The contributions made by Fianna Fáil to the fishery debates were mainly made by what might be termed their front bench spokesmen.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Gallagher, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Kennedy, the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Haughey, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Molloy, and some other prominent members of Fianna Fáil offered their views on how they could put forward legislative proposals that would ensure many advantages not only for our inland fisheries but also for our sea fisheries.</P>
    <P>Some 16 months later we know what actually happened.  We know from recent statements that Fianna Fáil tried to create as many difficulties as possible.  I am a firm believer in criticism but it should be constructive.  We know that Deputy Haughey and Deputy O'Kennedy offered their advice and financial help to the IFO not only to help them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Salmon can be described as being a sea fish, too, in the broad interpretation.  However, I wish to recall what has transpired in regard to fishing in the past 16 months.  We are all aware of the statements made by the man who now holds the office of Minister of Foreign Affairs and who is also a senior counsel regarding a 50-miles exclusive limit.  The then Deputy O'Kennedy was positive that as soon as Fianna Fáil were returned to office only Irish boats would fish in an area within a 50-mile radius of our coast.  We were told that licences would not be issued to fishermen from France, Spain or any other country and there was no question then of quotas. We were assured that in office Fianna Fáil would preserve a 50-mile area for <Col N="14" /> Irish fishermen.  One need only refer to any of several volumes of the Dáil debates to find these sort of assurances. However, the promises have not been fulfilled.  Fianna Fáil won the votes of many of the fishermen by making promises which they knew were not capable of being fulfilled.  It is no harm to make that point and to draw attention to the deceitful tactics in which Fianna Fáil engaged in debates relating to fisheries during 1975, 1976 and in the early part of 1977.  But I shall not pursue that point on this measure as the debate is confined although when Fianna Fáil were in opposition they did not regard a debate of this kind as being confined. Perhaps when replying the Minister will broaden the subject and tell us what happened in regard to the promises his party made while in opposition. Regarding the sea fishing aspect of the industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have heard Deputy Daly refer to remarkable strides having been made by the Minister.  I should like to hear from the Deputy as to what these remarkable strides are. Have they concerned the 50-mile limit or was the Deputy referring to the development of boat yards or harbours?  Is he not aware that it is almost impossible to get money from the Department for such works?  Apart from the system of election of the boards being repugnant, I have found from a small study I undertook long before I moved into the Department that many of our private fisheries were given to the descendants of the original owners by way of charters made by British monarchs, Charles I and James II being the most prominent in this regard.  Under these charters the right to fish was taken from the ordinary Irish people.  I mentioned that again and again down through the years in fishery discussions here.  Some of the then Ministers for Fisheries got annoyed when such a question was mentioned. It is not necessary for me to repeat their names because they have left <Col N="17" /> us.  I always thought we should take steps to rectify that position and acquire fisheries on a compensatory basis.  The State is entitled to acquire fishery rights, but how is the price to be determined?</P>

      <P>I can see difficulties in determining a price.  In my opinion the price should be determined by a State tribunal or an official with the necessary qualifications.  I do not think it is right that we should have to pay big money for something that should always have been in possession of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, poaching was never regarded as a sin, certainly not as a mortal sin, in our way of life.  That was a pity but it was mainly due to the fact that our lakes and rivers were privately owned and therefore the ordinary people did not see anything wrong with poaching in these waters.  I have always maintained that poachers are fishing illegally and should be punished in the same way as people who break the other laws of the land.  As a nation we must lay down laws and then we must ensure that they are adhered to.  Those who conflict with them must be punished by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I already said, I will spare the Chair and the House from quoting from numerous books because that is a practice I do not like.  While we in this House are concerned mainly with the future, we cannot overlook what happened in the past.  I hope that after 16 months <Col N="18" /> hatching the Minister will bring in this measure in a few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <P>Twelve months ago the Minister said it would be introduced in a few weeks.  It is very hard to measure what he means by a few weeks.</P>
      <P>I have no hesitation in expressing the view that in this coming legislation the Minister should keep the whip hand.  I am not too favourably inclined towards the view that if something is difficult it should be handed over to a board.  I do not know how many boards have been set up&mdash;some were set up as delaying tactics and others to provide cosy seats for political friends.  I do not believe in the farming out system.  The Minister and the Government of the day should hold authority when establishing the inland fisheries board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M. P. Murphy Mr. M. P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to establish a national board and seven regional boards.  I would not take issue if thE Minister kept authority and did not pass it to the board, but it could then be argued: why set up a board?  A board with executive power of a limited nature could be very useful advising the Minister and co-ordinating the work of the seven regional boards.</P>
      <P>At Question Time when Deputies are anxious to get information for their constituents on national questions they find themselves confronted with the statement by the Minister that he has no function in the matter and that &ldquo;this is a matter for the board&rdquo;.  I do not like that kind of reply.  I believe all boards have too much latitude.  We should be prying into the affairs of existing boards more than we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a nice kind of life for directors of state boards, from the financial side. They have no worry about where their pay cheques will come from.  They know that whether the board is good, bad or indifferent, the taxpayers must pay their wages.  It is very different for the man who is managing his own business, <Col N="19" /> because if it suffers a setback he may not be too sure where his pay cheque will come from.  We must bear these facts in mind.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by expressing a personal viewpoint.  The Minister should hold authority and the national fishery board to be set up under the proposed Bill should be an advisory board, advising and assisting the Minister and his Department on legislative proposals for the development of the fisheries industry.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in formulating the Bill.  I am sure it will be a rather complicated measure.  If it contains the provisions we feel it should contain it will be of general advantage to the development of our inland fisheries and, to a limited extent, our sea fisheries.  I hope the House will approve of it.  On national questions like this I do not believe in opposition for the sake of opposition.  That was the tactic employed by Fianna Fáil but two wrongs do not make a right.  No matter what proposal was brought in by the National Coalition Government, Fianna Fáil tried to find some fault in it. That was their main stock-in-trade.  The think-tank was working under the management of the present Minister for Economic Planning and Development with his agents.  They were planning ways to smooth the road back to office. He succeeded, but there are serious difficulties so far as our fisheries are concerned, and there are other serious difficulties so far as other aspects of Irish life are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  Like other speakers I am disappointed that the Minister has not honoured the commitment he gave the House 12 months ago to introduce this legislation in 1978. We can take with a grain of salt any suggestion that it will be introduced in 1978. Possibly we will see it in 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister comes from a fishing constituency.  No matter what legislation he introduces, and no matter who he gets to enforce it, whether it is the army, the navy, the Garda or the water bailiffs, it will not be a success unless he incorporates in it power for the fishermen to protect our fisheries.  There is goodwill in <Col N="20" /> the fishing industry.  I want to say strongly to the Minister that he should have confidence in the fishermen and give them a real say on the board he is setting up.  It is the fishermen who must provide conservation in the heel of the hunt.  He will spare himself an enormous amount of worry and an enormous amount of expenditure by the State if the fishermen are allowed to protect their own interests.  The situation in Kerry is chaotic.  Four salmon fishery licences have been issued for the whole county by the Kerry Board of Conservators while in Letterkenny there are 250 licences and in Dunmore another couple of hundred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Another couple of hundred in west Cork.  In Kerry there are many young men who are traditional fishermen and will be fishermen all their lives.  It is regrettable that these young men who want to be genuine fishermen are not getting a chance to be involved in how their own future will evolve.  The Minister's Department are not as quick off the mark as they should be.  Not so long ago they had to be forced by Deputy Deasy, Deputy O'Keeffe and myself to bring in legislation to protect our fisheries from the Spaniards, and to increase the fines.  Admittedly the Minister produced his own legislation after we showed him ours.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Committee on Procedure and Privileges decided by a majority vote that in future no Opposition Deputy can introduce legislation. From the point of view of democracy, this makes the Opposition completely irrelevant. It inhibits us from introducing legislation dealing with boards of conservators or anything else.  I appeal to the Minister to expedite the introduction of this legislation and to have the fishermen involved at every level.  Last Thursday I put down a question about the number of illegal nets seized by the navy and the reply was very lopsided.  There were 13 seizures in Kerry and none in Galway.  A direction was given to the corvette by the Minister for Defence to keep away from the Galway coast and to concentrate on Kerry.  That is the reality of the situation, I repeat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Lenihan):</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no basis for that suggestion.  I should like to apologise unreservedly for the fact that we have not got the legislation ready for a Second Reading.  It will be ready in a matters of weeks.  There are a few small matters to be ironed out.  I will have the Bill ready for publication before the end of this month and I hope it will have its Second Reading in the Dáil in this session.  That is the objective.  I was beaten on my commitment by a few weeks and I apologise for that.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that this is not just a small one or two section Bill. It runs into 200 pages with over 60 sections and complicated schedules.  The main reason for much of the complication is embodied in what Deputy Treacy suggested.  For the first time we are bringing in State powers of compulsory acquisition of fisheries, purchase of fisheries, and a system of compensation in relation thereto.  In other words we are bringing in a Land Commission type system in relation to fisheries.  This involves the whole question of title and ownership of fisheries.  It is an entirely new departure and has to be viewed in a constitutional context.  I can assure the House it took some time to prepare the Bill and this was the main cause of delay in drafting it.  When it emerges, we want it to stand up to any constitutional scrutiny.  In advance of the introduction of the Bill, I have already made one decision on a fishery which became available on the market, the Galway Salmon and Eel Fishery which has been acquired by agreement.  The Bill will have stringent powers of compulsory acquisition where the acquisition of such fisheries is deemed to be advantageous from the national point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in anticipating the Second Reading of the Bill.  The whole structure and administration of our inland <Col N="22" /> fisheries and fisheries up to six miles from our baseline is being re-organised. A completely new staff situa-tion is envisaged with the merging of the present Inland Fisheries Trust and the existing boards of conservators into a totally new organisational structure with substantial extra financing, with extra penalties for illegal fishing, and a whole series of new measures designed to ensure that in future we will have a proper system of organisation for the protection and the development of our salmon fisheries and our inland fisheries, and that the control both for protection and development purposes will be the very best and properly managed, not on an <i>ad hoc</i> casual basis such as we have had heretofore, but with staff properly remunerated and superannuated and organised.  All these matters have been missing heretofore by reason of the casual <i>ad hoc</i> manner in which the administration of our fisheries has been carried on for over 100 years.</P>
    <P>I will not say any more because it is only anticipating the debate.  I hope we will have a constructive debate in this session on the Second Stage and that we can have a constructive Committee Stage debate as well because it is the type of measure that commands in principle a broad measure of agreement and we should be able to have a constructive and responsible discussion here in the House on the details.  The motion itself of course is merely to ensure that the present regime continues.  It will automatically terminate on the passage of the new legislation.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I would like to refer to is the matter Deputy Begley referred to and I think it is worth taking up.  It is the question of getting the fishermen involved in protection.  I agree with him very fully here.  Just to take one specific instance, that of salmon, I do not see any way of protecting our salmon in the long run without the co-operation of the legitimate small traditional inshore salmon fishermen. The sort of illegal fishing that we have to beat is not of their making.  It is illegal fishing by much larger trawlers further out to sea&mdash;other Irish fishermen, by the way&mdash;using larger trawlers, illegal nets <Col N="23" /> and taking away the livelihood from those traditional fishermen.  I would like to see a system&mdash;and I have already had discussions with the Salmon and Inshore Fishermens Assocation&mdash;in which they can become more closely involved with the new board's protection staff and with the Navy whom we have now recruited in this endeavour and with the Garda in ensuring the protection of their own livelihood apart from the general interests, the angling and tourism aspect of our development.  But essentially the protection of our salmon stocks can only be carried out with the goodwill and co-operation of the traditional inshore fishermen.  These fishermen, by reason of their methods of fishing, are not really affecting salmon stocks.  It is our own huge commercial operators&mdash;we cannot blame the foreigner in this instance&mdash; both at sea and engaged in distribution on land who are responsible for the depredation of our salmon stocks in recent years.  In my view we can, with the co-operation of the angling interests and with the co-operation of the staffs of the proposed new board, the Garda and the Navy, sustain a real campaign&mdash;it was started last summer and will continue in the summers ahead&mdash;to ensure that we save our salmon stocks.  That is literally what we have to achieve, to save a species that is in danger of extinction unless this co-operation takes place.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to thank the other Deputies for their co-operation.  I welcome the contribution of Deputy Treacy and I am certain that we can cover much of the ground that he covered in the debate on the Bill itself. The same goes for the contributions of Deputies O'Keeffe, Begley and Murphy. As a previous incumbent of the office of Minister for Fisheries.  Deputy Murphy made one point with which I agree.  He said that ultimately the power in this respect in the new legislation in dealing with fisheries administration will reside with the Minister for Fisheries.  That is the way it should be.  In an important matter like this the ultimate power should reside with the relevant Minister, because whoever is the custodian for the time being is the person who is <Col N="24" /> answerable in this House.  I agree with Deputy Murphy's views.  I know they are on record in the Department and they coincide with my own.</P>

    <P>Sa bhliain 1971 mhol Comhairle na Gaeilge go mbunófaí meitheal oibre, comhdhéanta d'ionadaithe ó Ghaeltarra Éireann agus ó Chomhlacht Forbartha Shaor-Aerfort na Sionainne Teoranta, chun tuarascáil speisialta a chur ar fáil i dtaobh na Gaeltachta.  Chuaigh an mheitheal i mbun oibre agus d'ullmhaigh siad an tuarascáil <i>Gníomh don Ghaeltacht</i> inar moladh Údarás na Gaeltachta a bhunú.  Cé go bhfuil moltaí áirithe a rinneadh sa tuarascáil sin á gcur i bhfeidhm sa Bhille seo&mdash;mar shampla, seisear comhalta le ceapadh go díreach ag an Aire&mdash;ní miste a lua go bhfuil difríocht mhór ó thaobh na hionadaíochta a bheidh ag pobal na Gaeltachta ar an údarás; triúr a moladh sa tuarascáil agus ní trí an ngnáthchóras daonlathach a thiocfaí orthu: seachtar atá i gceist sa Bhille agus iad le toghadh <Col N="25" /> go daonlathach, ar mhodh an aonghutha inaistrithe, faoi mar a thoghtar comhairleoirí contae&mdash;córas toghchánaíochta a thuigeann an pobal go maith.</P>
    <P>Is léir go bhfuil fonn ar an Rialtas seasamh i bhfad níos láidre a thabhairt do phobal na Gaeltachta ar an údarás ná mar a bhí i gceist roimhe seo.  Tá súil againn go nglacfaidh an pobal leis an deis chun ionadaithe cumasacha a thoghadh.  Trí na hionadaithe a thoghfaidh siad féin beidh tionchar nach beag acu ar ghnóthaí an údaráis.  Thar rud ar bith eile sílimse gur mór an chéim ar aghaidh é go mbeidh roinnt daoine ar fáil faoi dheireadh a mbeidh dlúthbhaint acu leis na fadhbanna atá le réiteach agus a mbeidh ar a gcumas labhairt go húdarásach thar ceann phobal na Gaeltachta: go dtí seo d'fhéadfadh daoine gan mórán tacaíochta a thabhairt le tuiscint gur thar ceann an phobail a bhíonn siad ag labhairt&mdash;rud nach mbeidh chomh héasca céanna dóibh feasta.</P>
    <P>Trí thoghlach atá beartaithe do na limistéir oifigiúla Ghaeltachta agus is mar seo atá na hionadaithe le toghadh iontu:</P>
    <P>&mdash;beirt do Dhún na nGall.</P>
    <P>&mdash;triúr do Ghaillimh, do Mhaigh Eo agus don Mhí le chéile, agus</P>
    <P>&mdash;beirt do Chiarraí, do Chorcaigh agus do Phort Láirge le chéile.</P>
    <P>Beidh deis ag Teachtaí ceist na dtoghchán a phlé go mion&mdash;ní amháin ar Chéim an Choiste den Bhille seo ach arís nuair a chuirfear dréacht de na rialacháin faoi Chuid IV faoina mbráid, mar beidh an dréacht sin le ceadú ag an Dáil agus ag an Seanad.</P>
    <P>Ach na hionadaithe&mdash;seachtar acu&mdash;a bheith tofa beidh seisear eile le ceapadh agus lá le hainmniú chun an tÚdarás a bhunú agus Gaeltarra Éireann a dhíscaoileadh.  An lá sin aistreofar feidhmeanna, dliteanais agus foireann Ghaeltarra chuig an údarás.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfaí a rá nach mbeadh san eagraíocht ar an lá ceaptha ach Gaeltar-ra faoi ainm nua.  Ón lá sin amach, áfach, is gnó do chomhaltaí an údaráis &mdash;agus a bhformhór tofa go daonlathach ag pobal na Gaeltachta&mdash; féachaint chuige go mbainfear feidhm éifeachtach ar mhaithe leis an <Col N="26" /> nGaeltacht as na cumhachtaí a bheidh acu faoin mBille seo.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, beidh na feidhmeanna uile acu atá ag Gaeltarra faoi láthair agus tá forálacha solúbtha chun na críche sin in ailt 8 agus 10 den Bhille atá bunaithe cuid mhór ar alt 4 den Acht um Thionscail na Gaeltachta, 1957, arna leasú sna blianta 1965, 1968 agus 1971. De réir sin leanfaidh an tÚdarás ar aghaidh le foirgnimh a thógáil, deontais a thabhairt agus scaireanna a cheannach d'fhonn fostaíocht a chur ar fáil.  Ní miste a lua go bhfuil cumhacht de bhreis ar a bhfuil ag Gaeltarra i ndeireadh alt 10&mdash;chun a ráthú go n-aisíocfar iasachtaí a fuair daoine ar thug an tÚdarás cunamh airgid ina leith.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bheidh comhaltaí an údaráis i mbun oibre agus a gcumas léirithe acu, má mheasann siad gur fearr a d'éireodh leo forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn dá mbeadh cumhachtaí eile fós acu, tig leo iarratas dá réir a chur ar aghaidh agus breithneofar go báúil é.  Ó tharla gur dheacair cumhachtaí den chineál sin a shonrú go cruinn roimh ré, tá foráil leathan in alt 9&mdash;an t-alt is suimiúla sa Bhille, b'fhéidir&mdash;faoina bhféadfar na cumhachtaí a thabhairt le hordú ón Rialtas.  Luaitear san alt sin go bhféadfar feidhmeanna de chuid údaráis áitiúil a thabhairt don údarás.  Luaitear ann freisin go bhféadfar forálacha reachtúla a mhodhnú le hordú: is é sin le rágur féidir Acht a leasú gan Acht nua a rith. Ní i ngan fhios don Dáil a dhéanfaí amhlaidh, áfach, mar bheadh dréacht d'aon ordú le leagan faoi bhráid na Dála lena cheadú.</P>
    <P>Beidh airgead mór ag teastáil d'obair an údaráis agus, chomh maith le deontais bhliantúla faoi alt 22, féadfar suimeanna suas go £50m. a airleacan as an bPríomh-Chiste faoi alt 23.</P>
    <P>Is ar éigean is gá dom tagairt d'aon fhoráil eile sa Bhille ag an bpointe seo.  Is Bille cuimsitheach atá ann agus beidh na hAchtanna um Thionscail na Gaeltachta, 1957 go 1977, le haisghairm.  Sa Bhille seo glactar le forálacha maithe sna hAchtanna sin agus cuirtear leo.  Sílim gur fearr agus gur soiléire na nithe uile a bhainfidh leis an údarás a thabhairt le chéile in Acht amháin.</P>
    <P>Os rud é go mbeidh Gaeltarra Éireann <Col N="27" /> le díscaoileadh nuair a thiocfaidh an tAcht nua i ngníomh ba mhaith liom glacadh leis an deis seo chun lucht Ghaeltarra a mholadh as ucht a bhfuil déanta acu le 20 bliain anuas agus go háirithe ó tugadh cumhachtaí breise dóibh sa bhliain 1965 chun tionscail a chur chun cinn.  Is obair leanúnach atá ar siúl chun an Ghaeltacht a shlánú agus is ar an dúshraith atá leagtha go maith ag Gaeltarra a bheidh an tÚdarás ag tógáil.  Is amhlaidh a bheidh páirt ghníomhach ag ionadaithe tofa na Gaeltachta san obair feasta agus tuilleadh cumhachtaí fós ar fáil dóibh.  Tá súil againn uile go mbeidh rath Dé ar an obair sin.</P>
    <P>Is deimhin liomsa go gcuideoidh an Bille seo chun eagar a chur ar chúrsaí i gcaoi go mbeidh fonn ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta fanacht sa Ghaeltacht, leanúint orthu ag labhairt na Gaeilge agus páirt éifeachtach a ghlacadh i bhfeabhsú agus i bhforbairt a ndúiche agus a ndúchais féin.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Bille don Dáil dá réir sin agus, má bhíonn leasuithe le tairiscint ag Teachtaí chun feabhas a chur air, beidh áthas orm iad a bhreithniú.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní ceart agus ní cóir &ldquo;An Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1978&rdquo; a ghlaoidh ar an mBille seo.  Níl an tAire ná an Rialtas dáiríre mar gheall ar údarás daonlathach a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Measaim féin nach bhfuil sa Bhille seo ach iarracht ar dallamullóg a chur ar na daoine agus an geall deireannach den manifesto a chur i gcrích, mar dhea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scrúdaigh mé an Bille seo arís agus arís chun a fháil amach na cumhachtaí breise a bheadh ag an údarás seachas a bhí ag Gaeltarra Éireann ach theip orm aon chumhacht breise a fheiceáil a rachfaidh chun cúnamh do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Ag cainnt ar clár radio agus arís sa mhéid adúirt an tAire inniu linn, dúirt sé go mba mhaith leis cumhachtaí pleanála agus a leithéid a fheiceáil ag an údarás, agus bhí súil aige, mar adúirt sé inniu arís, dá n-iarrfadh an túdarás ar an Rialtas go dtabharfadh sé dó iad.  Leis na focail sin, admhaoinn gur theip air <Col N="28" /> glan aon chumhachtaí breise i leith na Gaeltachta a bhuachaint ón Rialtas.</P>
    <P>Bhí muintir na Gaeltachta ag súil go mbeadh cumhacht ag an údarás forbairt a dhéanamh ar gach gné dá saol ag chur isteach ar a slí maireachtála ach, faraoir mar adúirt an Oráisteach: &ldquo;What we have we hold&rdquo;.  Coiméad gach Roinn Stáit a cumhachtaí féin agus níor tugadh faic don údarás.  Bhí seans mór ag an Aire anseo an iascaireacht a chur ar bhonnaí cheart san Ghaeltacht.  Is ag an údarás ba chóir go mbeadh tabhairt amach na gceadúnas bradáin.  Is é an tÚdarás ba chóir a bheith freagrach as forbairt na cuanta Gaeltachta, ach ní mar sin a bheidh an scéal.  Choimeád an tAire Iascaigh, An Teachta Brian Lenihan, agus a Roinn na cumhachtaí. Maidir leis na ceadúnais bhradáin, ní raibh focal ar bith le rá ag an Aire nuair a gheall sé an bord nua maidin inniu.</P>
    <P>Caithfimíd cuimhneamh go bhfuil an iascaireacht ana-thábhachtach i saol eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta.  I gcás na hiascaireachta níl faic le fáil ón údarás. Níl tagairt dá laighead san Bhille mar gheall ar an oideachas&mdash;bun oideachas, meán oideachas, gairm oideachas nó an tríú leibhéil.  Tá fhios ag gach duine, i leith na múinteoirí scoile atá ag teacht amach as na coláistí ullmhúcháin nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge chomh líofa acu agus a bhí.  Mar adúirt Eámonn Kelly: &ldquo;Fadó, fadó&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Cad mar gheall ar na coláistí samhraidh agus an fhorbairt gur féidir na mná tí agus na máistrí scoile a dhéanamh agus, b'fhéidir, coláistí geimhridh a bhunú do leanaí taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht?  Tá na cumhachtaí sin ag an Aire Oideachais. Sin mar a raibh, sin mar atá agus sin mar a bheidh.</P>
    <P>Níl cumhacht ar bith á thabhairt ag Roinn na Gaeltachta féin don údarás. Mheasfá go dtabharfadh an tAire cumhachtaí áirithe ón a Roinn féin go dtí an tÚdarás ach is dócha na focail adúirt sé: gur mhaith leis rudaí áirithe a fheiceáil ach ní maith leis a shrian féin a scaoileadh in aon chor.  A Aire, deirim leat: bíodh muinín agat as muintir na Gaeltachta.  Tabhair cead a gcinn dóibh. Ba chóir go mbeadh an tÚdarás <Col N="29" /> freagarthach as na bóithre, séarachas poiblí, deontaisí tithe, halla pobail, cuartaíocht, pleanáil; ach arís choimeád an Roinn Comhshaoil na cumhachtaí sin a bhí acu féin.  Ní raibh an Roinn Comhshaoil sásta aon srian nó aon chumhacht a thabhairt don údarás.</P>
    <P>Mar adúirt mé, níl sa Bhille seo ach Gaeltarra Éireann.  Nílim féin sásta go mbeidh an tÚdarás daonlathach.  Chun go mbeadh sé daonlathach caithfí gach aon bhall den údarás a thoghadh ag muintir na Gaeltachtaí.  Nílimse sásta go bhfuil sé de chead ag an Aire seisear a ainmniú agus gach seans go n-ainmneodh sé duine nó beirt gur theip orthu san iomaíocht.  Mar sin a thuigimse an focal &ldquo;daonlathach&rdquo;.  Lena seisear féin ní gá ach beirt agus beidh an tromlach acu.  Masla an cleas sin don fhocal &ldquo;daonlathach&rdquo; ins an free world. Nílimse sásta leis na Dáilcheantair, mar adéarfá.  I gcás ceantar na Mumhan tá cúig Gaeltachtaí ann&mdash;Corca Dhuibhne, Uíbh Ráthach, Oileán Cléire, Múscraí agus an Rinn&mdash;agus níltear ach chun beirt a thoghadh ins na Gaeltachtaí sin.</P>
    <P>Níl sé sin ceart.  Tóg Gaeltacht Phort Láirge agus Gaeltacht Chorcaí, níl an daonradh acu siúd chun duine a chur isteach san údarás.  Is dócha go mbeidh an bheirt ó Chiarraí agus tá fhios agat, a Aire agus a Leas-Chathaoirleach, tá i bhfad níos mó brú ar na Gaeltachtaí beaga ná ar na Gaeltachtaí móra, agus iarraim arís ar an Aire é a leathnú amach agus duine amháin a thabhairt do gach Gaeltacht ionas go mbeidh sé ábalta freastal ar an mbord.  An scéal céanna mar gheall ar Ghaeltacht Chonamara agus Gaeltacht Chontae na Mí, Ráth Cairn.  An bhfuil aon seans acu aon duine a fháil?  Iarraim ar an Aire féachaint arís ar an bpointe sin agus b'fhéidir go mbeadh sé ábalta duine amháin a thabhairt do gach Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá na Gaeltachtaí beag agus cúng a dhóthain.  Níl gá ar bith leis an Aire seisear a ainmniú.  Is féidir leis an mbord na saineolaithe a fhostú agus ós rud é gurb é Gaeltarra Éireann atá i gceist, tá an t-eolas agus an expertise acu cheana féin.</P>
    <P>Poinnte eile a chuireann isteach orm agus is é sin na h-oileáin.  Tá tagairt déanta cheana féin don gá atá ann chun <Col N="30" /> teorainn na Gaeltachta a scrúdú.  Ba mhaith liom go ndéanfadh an tAire scrúdú arís ar alt 8 agus an tagairt sin. Ba cheart dó dul chomh fada leis na hoileáin amuigh ón gcósta, thiar, thuaidh-thiar agus theas.  Tá beagán Gaeilge acu i gcuid de na hoileáin agus tá a lán Gaeilge acu i gcuid eile de na hoileáin, agus tá siad ina luí ansin mar dhileachtaí san aigéan thiar.  De réir deallraimh, níl suim dá laghad ag éinne iontu.  Níl ach scata beag daoine ag maireachtaint sna hoileáin siúd agus iarraim ar an Aire duine amháin ón na hoileáin sin a ainmniú mar bhall den údarás nua seo.</P>
    <P>Agus mé ag féachaint ar an mBille, bhíos ag lorg an mbeadh cumhacht ar bith ag baill an údaráis.  Measaim nach mbeidh.  Faoi section 4 den Acht a bhaineann leis na gcómhairlí chondae, tá na baill in ann a rá leis an bpríomh oifigeach rud áirithe a dhéanamh.  Níl rud ar bith mar section 4 sa Bhille seo. Ní thuigim chomh balbh anois agus atá an dream a bhí ag béicíl mar gheall ar Údarás na Gaeltachta nuair a bhí an Teachta Tomás O'Donnell i mbun Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Is deacair a dhéanamh amach anois an údarás daonlathach Gaeilge a bhí i gceist acu, nó an raibh siad ar fad i gcoinne an Aire an uair sin.  Níl faic le rá ag na heagraisí Ghaeilge.  Cá bhfuil na comhar-chumainn, na ceartaí sibhialta?  Tá siad an-chiúin anois.  An sórt duine anseo is ansiúd a chuaigh ar an radio nó ar an teilifís agus adúirt go rabhadar sásta leis an údarás, is dócha go raibh sé ina gceann go n-ainmneodh an tAire iad nuair a bheadh an Bille rite.</P>
    <P>Níl mórán eile le rá agam ag an bpointe seo ach go mbeidh a lán leasaithe againn ag an gcéad Chéim eile chun slacht a chur an an mBille.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille i bprionsabal.  Ba mhaith liom freisin tréaslú leis an Aire mar gheall ar an modh daonlathach in ar thug sé an Bille os ár gcómhair.  Má bhíonn sé ar chumas an Teachta Begley feabhas a chur air tré leasuithe, beidh áthas orm iad a bhreithniú.  Ta súil agam go bhfuil sé dáirire.  Má tá sé, beidh athrú mór ar an mBille sula rithfear é. <Col N="31" /> Dúirt mé go n-aontaim leis an mBille i bprionsabal, agus is mór an prionsabal é údarás a chur ar bun chun an Ghaeltacht a neartú, ach is mór an difríocht idir an prionsabal agus an scéim atá le feiceáil sa Bhille seo.</P>
      <P>We are dealing in this Bill with nothing more or less than a national emergency.  It is an emergency whose dimensions are not immediately apparent to many people because they do not live with it but nonetheless it is an emergency.  It is an emergency that is perhaps not so obvious to people, because the change that takes place in the characteristics of the Gaeltacht appears to be one that is taking place relatively slowly so that there is no particular need for haste or hurry.  However, the particular characteristic of change as it affects the Gaeltacht and the people living in it is that it is more radical and less reversible than change in almost any other area of our national life.</P>
      <P>It is a truism to say that without the Gaeltacht as such the Irish language will effectively cease to exist.  It may exist in scattered households from one end of the country to the other but without a central point, without a series of living and vital communities in which it is established, real, ongoing and part of a tradition the language will become no more than a code spoken by mandarins to each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is precisely because of this point that I must stress the seriousness of the crisis that the Gaeltacht is faced with today. It is a crisis which this Bill, in part, attempts to deal with, although we know that legislation alone cannot solve the problem.  When we talk about this Bill we are not dealing with special legislative arrangements to make sure that a picturesque national minority does not become extinct.  The people and the communities of the Gaeltacht may be a minority in a numerical sense but they are, and remain, the only authentic representatives of what was once the majority tradition on this island and of a tradition and a culture that is still officially, and more than officially in the hearts of the people of this island, <Col N="32" /> something that is vital and that should be preserved.</P>
    <P>I suspect that this is the ultimate rationale behind any legislation that seeks to cut across established lines of administration, of authority and of power, to set up a new organisation with new powers for the Gaeltacht.  One could argue that if the situation was going well there would be no need for an Údarás na Gaeltachta or for Bord na Gaeilge, that if every citizen, every Government Department and every local authority played their role in full there would be no need for special provision for those parts of our island in which this tradition is a living, communitarian one.  Of course this has not happened.  Not everybody is playing a full part.  Not every Government Depart-ment or local authority is playing a full part and, therefore, there is a need for emergency action.</P>
    <P>If I might draw a parallel with the situation that developed in Northern Ireland in the years after 1969 it might be instructive to the House.  The parallel is that involved with the creation of the Ministry of Community Relations in the North.  Again, one could argue that if all the public authorities and individual citizens there had a sense of community relations there would be no reason for having a special department to deal with community relations.  There was an emergency of a different kind there and the Ministry was set up to do the work that should have been an integral part of all the Ministries.  There is a somewhat similar rationale for the setting up of Údarás na Gaeltachta here, although I hope they will be more successful in relation to their objectives than was the Ministry for Community Relations in the North.</P>
    <P>There is always the danger that by setting up a specific authority for a specific purpose in an area like this in relation to culture or the Irish language it will afford people the opportunity or excuse of saying that they do not need to do anything about the Irish language and Irish culture, that it is a job for Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The way to ensure that people do not do that is to make certain that Údarás na Gaeltachta <Col N="33" /> are given sufficient powers to enable them to do their job properly.  In three generations there may be no need for Údarás na Gaeltachta.  If they have done their job properly, hopefully there will not be any need for them any more, but there is a great danger that the reason there will not be any need for Údarás na Gaeltachta in three generations is that the Gaeltacht will have died and that this will have happened because Údarás na Gaeltachta were not given adequate scope and powers to enable them to do their job properly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley in relatively scathing terms referred to the sparseness of the powers conferred on Údarás na Gaeltachta by this Bill.  In his opening remarks the Minister said that if Údarás na Gaeltachta after they have been constituted come to the conclusion that they require different powers and functions these can be conferred on them by Government order.  I would have thought that we have been examining for long enough and have been familiar for long enough with the problems of the Gaeltacht to know in very broad terms what powers a real Gaeltacht authority would need and what powers could, in broad terms, be conferred on them as a first step in the Bill which leads to their establishment.</P>
    <P>I recognise part of the Minister's intention. It is a gesture towards a democratic element on the Údarás, to the fact that people should in some sense have a right to make their democratic input to the structure and function of the Údarás.  But that input is by no means a guarantee because it must go through the filter of the Department of the Gaeltacht and need not come through the filter of this House.  To put it mildly, I am intrigued to note that part of the Minister's speech in which he says that statutory provisions may be modified by order, that that is to say that an Act may be amended without passing a new Act. The Minister goes on to say that this would not be done without the knowledge of the Dáil, that the draft of any order would have to be laid before the Dáil for approval.  I should like to hear more from the Minister as to whether this is the first occasion on <Col N="34" /> which a device of this kind by which legislation has to be amended by order has been laid before the House.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the need of Údarás na Gaeltachta for real powers, we may specify a number of areas in which these powers are necessary.  First, there is the cultural area and then there are the educational, planning, basic services, research and the industrial development areas.  I am putting the industrial development area last deliberately because this is the only area that receives any treatment of a worthwhile nature so far as the Bill is concerned, but even in this respect there are some questions to be asked.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cultural area the Bill is sadly deficient because section 8 (1) reads that An tÚdarás</P>
    <P>shall encourage the preservation and extension of the use of Irish as a vernacular language in the Gaeltacht and shall ensure that Irish is used to the greatest extent possible in the performance by it and on its behalf of its functions.</P>
    <P>With all respect that is perhaps the kind of phrase in a Bill which is like the directive principles of social policy in the Constitution.  It has no legislative effect. It does not confer on the Udarás any power to ensure the achievement of the worthwhile objectives.</P>
    <P>When we turn to the later sections of the Bill we find that effectively the main area and perhaps the only area in which the Údarás are empowered as a result of this Bill to provide financial assistance is in section 10 and that assistance is for industrial purposes.  There is no provision whereby the Údarás can make financial provision for cultural purposes. Subsection (1) of section 9 reads that:</P>
    <P>For the purpose of promoting the economic, social, cultural, linguistic and physical development of the Gaeltacht an tÚdarás shall have, in addition to the functions specified in this Act apart from this section, such powers as are conferred on it by order made by the Government.</P>
    <P>These Government orders may provide for payments by an tÚdarás but the Bill does not empower the Údarás to spend <Col N="35" /> money on anything that is not authorised in section 10 which is for the purpose of:</P>
    <P>establishing, developing or maintaining industries and productive schemes of employment in the Gaeltacht....</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that there has been considerable controversy during the past few years in relation to the competence of Bord na Gaeilge in terms of the expenditure of moneys in the Gaeltacht areas.  To the best of my knowledge the effective governmental decision&mdash;and I know not nor care not whether it was a decision of the last administration as much as of this Government&mdash;is that Bord na Gaeilge activities and financial assistance should be located effectively outside the Gaeltacht areas.  Therefore, we have Bord na Gaeilge who are not allowed, at least not to any appreciable extent, to spend money for cultural reasons inside the Gaeltacht while we are to have the new Údarás who may be allowed at some indefinite date in the future to spend an unspecified sum on the development and the culture of the Gaeltacht.  In the meantime it is left to private organisations, like Gael Linn for example, to support, not necessarily by way of grant but so far as they can do so commensurate with their normal commercial activities, the priceless work of recalling and ensuring the continued availability and spread of the Gaeltacht culture.  This is the sort of omission that should be remedied before the Bill leaves this House.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer, too, to the educational area.  During the debate on Bord na Gaeilge we discussed at some length the role of the Department of Education, and it is not my intention to repeat any of the points I made then.  However, there are a couple of specific points in relation to which the Údarás should be given specific responsibility.  For example, in the primary sphere an tÚdarás should be given, by way of whatever administrative mechanism is deemed to be appropriate, an effective veto on the amalgamation of Gaeltacht primary <Col N="36" /> schools where such amalgamation would involve the transfer of Gaeltacht children outside the Gaeltacht or even to a breac Gaeltacht school.  The small primary schools in the Gaeltacht should be given every possible subvention, and more than subvention, they need the kind of structural support which would enable them to resist amalgamation with neighbouring areas which are not Irish speaking or which are only part-Irish speaking.</P>
    <P>In the post-primary and third-level areas it is more difficult to think of specific administrative and executive powers that could be conferred on the Údarás in order to enable them to do their job properly, but the over-riding consideration here should be that no Gaeltacht child be deprived of the right to a good education in Irish in his locality or within reasonable proximity to his locality.  We have made two major mistakes in the past four or five decades in relation to our attitudes to schools and to the revival of Irish.  The first was by concentrating on the schools and on the curriculum as a method for reviving Irish.  We have allowed other sectors of society to go their own way unhampered and unhindered by any sense of responsibility for the language.</P>
    <P>The second thing we have done, and successive Governments must bear the blame for this, is that we have failed to ensure what I am suggesting the Údaras should have the power to ensure, the availability of good education in Irish for everybody who needs it, above all the Gaeltacht areas but also I would argue outside them.  The reason why we have failed to do this is that we have traditionally allowed the provision of education to be dictated with very few exceptions by whether private institutions of one kind or another choose to start schools.</P>
    <P>If it should be necessary for the provision of good second level education through Irish for the children of a particular location the Údaras should have the power to establish such a school.  I believe that successive Governments have fought shy of allowing any State body, such as the Department of Education, the Department of the Gaeltacht or <Col N="37" /> any semi-State body, such as An Údarás na Gaeltachta as envisaged here, directly to establish schools because that would involve challenging the existing structure of education.  It would involve in some cases at least setting up competition between State-owned and privately-owned schools.</P>
    <P>In the case of the survival and development of the Irish language above all, there has been an overwhelming argument in favour of the establishment by the State and its agencies of high quality Irish language schools wherever they are needed, inside and outside the Gaeltacht.  In so far as inside the Gaeltacht is concerned, I believe the Údarás should be given the facility and the power, and where necessary the money, to establish a school if they believe it to be necessary.  No doubt there would have to be some overall con-trol, some interface, as the in-word has it, with the Department of Education on this matter.  But to leave them without any function in the area of education is to neutralise any good effect that the establishment of an tÚdarás may have.</P>
    <P>The third area to which I want to refer is the planning area.  This is vital because a Gaeltacht is not just a line drawn on the map.  It is a Community.  It is a collection of homes, families, shops, pubs and churches where the Irish language is habitually spoken.  If it is not all these things, ultimately it is not a Gaeltacht, no matter where the lines may be drawn on the map, or what the role of an tÚdaras may be.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to consider the operation of the planning laws without coming to the conclusion that, very often with the best will in the world, the operation of these laws has been such as seriously to threaten the existence of some relatively small Gaeltacht communities.</P>
    <P>The social disruption in any western, south western or north western rural community which is caused by the building of large numbers of houses or factories is a matter of fact, but when the social disruption is accompanied by a linguistic disruption we must be doubly on our guard.  If you put 50 or 80 houses into a Gaeltacht area, whether they are for permanent or even summer occupation, <Col N="38" /> and if these houses are to be occupied for the most part by people whose normal language is English, it will be inevitable that in a very short space of time the language of commerce, of the pub, and of the church of that area will change.  Irish will retreat to the heartside and eventually will be extinguished there as well.</P>
    <P>That is why there is a very strong case to be made for allowing an tÚdarás to exercise in the Gaeltacht areas the planning powers that are currently exercised by the local authorities for those areas. This is a problem that will have to be faced sooner or later.  I have no doubt but that the Minister will eventually receive a request of this kind from the new Údarás when it is established.  This is all the more reason why we should face it now, because the longer we delay facing it the more damage will be done.</P>
    <P>The fourth area I want to refer to is in connection with basic services.  One of the main problems affecting the development of the Gaeltacht is not just the absence of basic services but very often a whole series of unresolved conflicts between different statutory authorities about who has responsibility of providing these services.  Whether is it a pier at Rossaveel or anything else, the needed development of a Gaeltacht area can be held up for months, if not for years, while the buck is passed from the Department of the Gaeltacht to the Department of the Environment, to the local county council, to the local TDs and back again.  It goes round and round in a complete merry-go-round.  Development is delayed and ultimately the Gaeltacht suffers.  The development of basic infrastructure and services in the Gaeltacht is too important to be left to this haphazard, who pays for it, passing the buck kind of idea.  This is where the Údarás should have a role in the preservation and development of the Gaeltacht communities.</P>
    <P>The fifth point I would like to discuss is the area of research.  This is a fundamentally important area because, while research is sometimes used as an excuse for putting things on the long finger, it is also an essential in the establishment of priorities.  Under the Bill <Col N="39" /> an tÚdarás have the right to employ consultants but I suggest that this right is not broad enough, because they should have the right to establish their own research section so that the relationship between the priorities they are establishing and the evaluation of the work that is going on is a constant one, and one which works to the benefit of an tÚdarás and of the communities which they are trying to help.</P>
    <P>My sixth point is on the industrial side.  Here there is, unfortunately, more than a little evidence to support Deputy Begley's contention that what we have in the present Bill, as unamended, is no more than Gaeltarra Eireann with knobs on.  We must look in the light of this assertion at the track record of Gaeltarra Éireann and ask whether enough is being done to ensure that the future industrial development of the Gaeltacht is brought hand in hand with the cultural, social and physical development of the Gaeltacht for which an tÚdarás is being given responsibility and no power.  The traditional jibe against certain people is that they seek power without responsibility. Here we are being given an tÚdarás which is being given responsibility without power.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the composition of an tÚdarás one wonders whether such an údarás without a permanent research service will be able to evaluate sufficiently the industrial projects which will come up for attention and authorisation.  Even Gaeltarra which has a fair amount of professional expertise and a fair amount of professional help had its financial fingers severely burned in the recent past by developments which did not take off as they were supposed to take off.  The risk of the same sort of thing happening under an Údarás must be a very real one.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of all this is the economic development of the Gaeltacht in certain circumstances can contribute to a shift away from Irish towards English directly opposite from the way in which it was supposed to operate. Here, too, is a problem with which the new udarás will have to come to terms no matter how it is constituted.  We <Col N="40" /> might leave to Committee Stage the question of the arrangement of the constituencies. It could be argued that no Administration which put Galway, Mayo and Meath into one constituency can have anything further to complain about in the activities of the former Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully.  There is almost an argument for saying that, if you are to have widely geographically spread constituencies, the one widely spread geographical area which has common cause and perhaps needs its own representation is the area comprised by the islands.  They are already united in many respects.  They share many similar problems and might form a powerful, cohesive and coherent force within the new údarás if they were allowed to become one.</P>
    <P>Many of the other points of detail will remain to be raised by us, and I would hope to be listened to constructively by the Minister, on Committee and Report Stages.  At this stage I must warn the Minister and the House that the great danger of creating an Údarás with responsibility and without power is that it will provide the people of the island as a whole with an excuse for not doing anything to save that which is most dear to them when they admit it in their heart of hearts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is mian liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo chun Údarás na Gaeltachta a bhunú.  Táim cinnte gur céim mhór ar aghaidh é agus comhartha eile go bhfuil an Rialtas agus an tAire i ndáiríre faoi thábhacht na Gaeltachta agus faoi thábhacht na teanga.  Ní aontaím le focal ar bith adúirt an Teachta Begley.  Dá mbeadh an Bille léite aige d'fheicfeadh sé go bhfuil na cumhachtaí go léir a luaigh sé go raibh in easnamh go bhfuil siad san ann agus gur féidir leis an údarás na cumhachtaí sin go léir a ghlacadh cuchu ach dul i gcomhairle leis an Aire nuair a fheiceann siad gur gá iad a bheith acu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is dóigh liom gur fearr go mór gan na cumhachtaí sin a chur san Bhille ach iad a fhágáil faoin Aire faoi órdú a dhéanamh.  Is fearr a thuigfidh comhaltaí an údaráis cad a bheidh uathu nuair a thiocfaidh siad le chéile agus nuair a <Col N="41" /> chuirfidh siad a gcuid éirim aigne le chéile.</P>
    <P>Ní aontaím leis an Teachta Begley ach chomh beag go bhfuil a lán daoine ciúin agus nach bhfuil focal as Chonradh na Gaeilge nó eagrais eile Ghaeilge.  Dá léadh sé páipéar de 11 Deireadh Fómhair chífeadh sé go bhfuil a lán lochtanna le fáil ag an gConradh ar Údarás na Gaeltachta, agus aon duine a léadh an t-alt sin chífeadh sé leis gur ar éigean a léigh an dream sin an Bille ach chomh beag.  Má bhí an Comhrialtas chomh tógtha le ceist na Gaeilge, is ionadh liom nár dhein siad aon iarracht ar feadh ceithre mblian an tÚdarás a bhunú.  Is dóigh liom go ndúirt siad bliain i ndiaidh bliana an fhad is a bhí siad ann go raibh an tÚdarás le bunú ach is beag a tharla ina thaobh sin.</P>
    <P>Anois ba mhaith liom dul isteach i gcúpla rud atá san Bhille.  Is céim mhór é seachtar a bheith iontofa go daonlathach i dtrí réigiúin Ghaeltachta, agus is dóigh liom go ndeachaigh an tAire agus an Rialtas isteach i gceist daonra ins na ceanntair sin nuair a bhí siad ag socrú cé mhéad Teachtaí a bheadh ós na trí cean-tair. Táim cinnte go neartóidh an tÚdarás cúis na Gaeilge agus go mbeadh dul chun cinn i gcúrsaí eacnamaíochta, cultúrtha agus sóisialta.</P>
    <P>Go dtí seo sé an t-easnamh a bhí i nGaeltarra Éireann gur mó an cúram a bhí orthu deantúisí a chur ar bun.  Anois beidh cúram orthu gach gné den Ghaeltacht a bhreathnú agus comhoibriú a dhéanamh idir an saol eacnamíochta, an saol cultúrtha agus an saol sóisialta.  Is dóigh liom leis go bhfuil an t-ádh linn duine ón nGaeltacht a bheith againn mar Aire mar tuigeann sé siúd fadhbanna na Gaeltachta níos fearr ná mar a thuigimidne atá sa Ghalltacht iad.  Tá sé sáite i ngach gné de shaol na Gaeltachta.  Tá sé sáite i saol cultúrtha, i gceol agus i rinnce.  Chomh maith leis sin, tá an croí san áit ceart aige agus tá misneach aige.  Táim cinnte go dtiocfaidh toradh fónta ar aon rud go gcuirfidh sé a lámh leis.</P>
    <P>Ar ais go dtí an méid a dúras roimhe seó, nach raibh aon duine ag clamhsán faoin Bhille.  De réir an méid a léigh mise le cúpla lá, tá lobby áirithe ag fáil a lán locht ar an mBille, agus ón méid atá <Col N="42" /> scríofa acu dheallródh sé nar léigh siad an Bille in aon chor.</P>
    <P>Tá freagra le fáil ar gach locht a fuair siad ar an mBille.  Ba cheart dóibh siúd atá ag clamhsán, pé áit ina bhfuil siad, i gCúige Mumhan nó i gCúige Connacht nó in aon áit eile, dul os comhair an phobail ina gceanntar féin agus chífimíd ansan an bhfuil níos mó measa ag muintir na gceanntar sin orthu ná mar atá ar an Aire agus an méid atá leagtha amach aige sa Bhille.  Tá aon pháipéar amháin a raibh &ldquo;leading ar-ticle&rdquo; ciallmhar aige agus sé sin an <i>Galway Advertiser</i> den 19 Deireadh Fómhair.  Dúirt sé:</P>
    <P>... over the past six years, successive Governments and Ministers have promised and promised&mdash;and failed to deliver.</P>
    <P>For that reason alone there will be a general welcome for the Udarás na Gaeltachta Bill published by Mr. Denis Gallagher last week.  It marks a major step on the road to Gaeltacht self-realisation.  But the Minister in publishing it has demonstrated a determination to push ahead with the Udáras as quickly as possible, and to have the show on the road in the first half of 1979, with the Gaeltacht elections being held, hopefully, before the European poll and the other local elections in June.</P>
    <P>... the fact remains that several of the main demands of Gaeltacht interests have been met in the proposed legislation.  The principle of an elected majority is conceded.  There is provision for transferring local government power to the Udáras in any particular area in which that seems necessary. This would be done by Ministerial Order following recommendations from the Udarás itself.  And there is the very important recognition that the body which will replace Gaeltarra, now to be dissolved, must have a positive linguistic social and cultural responsibility.</P>
    <P>That is where I believe Gaeltarra Éireann had a lúb ar lár previously.  The article continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This role was never spelled out clearly for Gaeltarra in the past and, in restrospect, it may be argued that it was in this area the greatest failures <Col N="43" /> lay.  It is now recognised that Gaeltacht development means more than building advance factories at every cross-roads or even getting commercial ventures into some or all of them.  Not only that, but the record shows that such activity has serious implications for Gaeltacht life itself which cannot be ignored.  It will be the difficult task of the new Údarás not only to provide jobs, but to ensure that this is done in a manner that helps rather than hinders the survival of Irish as the vernacular of those employed.</P>
    <P>That in a nutshell sums up the whole content of this Bill.  All the complaining we have had of An tÚdarás not having this power and that power in education, in planning, in all the different fields of work and government, show conclusively that an tÚdarás has such powers.  As we who have read the Bill carefully know, on the request of the údarás and wherever these powers appear necessary the Minister will be only too glad to deliver the goods to them.</P>

      <P>Beidh a lán eile le rá gam nuair a bhéas an Bille i gCoiste. Aontóidh aon duine atá macánta go bhfuil éirithe ag an Aire rud a dhéanamh taobh istigh de bhliain nach raibh sé i gcumas an Chomh-Rialtas a dhéanamh an fhaid a bhí siad in oifig.  I ndeireadh na dála, pé rud a déarfaimíd faoi Bhord na Gaeilge, nó Údarás na Gaeltachta, nó aon ghluaiseacht eile a bhaineann leis an Ghaeltacht nó an Ghalltacht is orainn féin sa Ghaeltacht is sa Ghalltacht atá slánú na Gaeilge ag brath.  Guím rath Dé ar an Aire agus ar an údarás chun cuspóirí an Bhille a chur i gcrích.  Tá obair mhór le déanamh acu.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty:</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an mBille seo atá chun Údarás na Gaeltachta a bhunú.  Sé mo thuairim gur cóir go mbeadh sé mar phríomh-aidhm ag an Aire an teanga álainn seo a chothú ní amháin sna <Col N="44" /> Gaeltachtaí oifigiúla ach sna ceantair bheaga atá scaipte ar fud na tíre ar a dtugtar &ldquo;Breac-Ghaeltachtaí&rdquo;.  Tá ceantar mar sin san áit in a raibh an tAire é féin cúpla seachtain ó shin, i ndúiche Fhiachra Éilgeach.  Le blianta bhí an teanga beo sa dúiche sin agus is mór an trua é nár deineadh aon iarracht go dtí cúpla bliain ó shin an teanga a aithbheochaint san dúiche sin.  Siad na daoine féin a rinne an iarracht sin.  Cúig bliana ó shin tháinig pobal an cheantair le chéile agus thosaigh siad gluaiseacht nua chun an teanga a chur chun cinn, agus is íontach an dul chun cinn atá déanta acu san tréimhse sin.  Tá an teanga beo anois agus ag feabhsú gach lá.  Ach níl aon fhocal misnigh dá chur chuig na daoine sin sa Bhille seo.</P>
      <P>Sé an príomh-aidhm atá ag na daoine sna Breac-Ghaeltachtaí ná bheith aitheanta mar Ghaeltachtaí oifigiúil, agus bheidís réidh don chéim sin.  Iarraim ar an Aire an suim agus an t-aitheantas chéanna a thugann sé do na ceantair Ghaeltachta a thabhairt do áiteanna bheaga mar Baile Mhic Óda, An Rinn agus áiteanna mar iad.  Tá fhios agam nach bhfuil, b'fhéidir, caighdheán na Fhíor-Ghaeltachta ag na háiteanna seo ach níl aon amhras orm dá mbeadh a leithéid acu sna Breac-Ghaeltachtaí agus a bhí acu cheana go mbeadh an caighdheán seo go furasta ionnta.  Níl ann ach ceist bheag ama sula shroisfidh cuid de na háiteanna seo ar a laghad caighdheán a bheidh ag fás i dtreo go mbeidh caighdheán sár-ard sroiste acu a thuillfidh dóibh aitheantas oifigiúil mar Fhíor-Gaeltachtaí.  Mar a dúirt an tAire féin cúpla seachtain ó shin, tá formhór na ndaoine ansin ag caint agus ag cleachtadh na teanga agus ag freastail ar ranganna Gaeilge agus rinncí Gaelacha.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>De réir mar a thuigimse an t-údarás seo, tá gach seans ann nach mbeidh aon daoine tofa lasmuigh de na fíor-Ghaeltachtaí.  Faoi mar atá leagtha síos ag Roinn na Gaeltachta faoi láthair ba mhaith an rud é dá mbeadh duine nó beirt ar a laghad ó lasmuigh de na fíor-Ghaeltachtaí i dtreo is go bhféadfai meon agus cuisle na ndaoine lasmuigh de na fíor-Ghaeltachtaí a mhothú ó am go ham.  Sa chaoi sin bheadh sé soiléir nach raibh dearmad déanta ag an Aire <Col N="45" /> ar na daoine sna breac-Ghaeltachtaí agus chomh maith le sin thaispeánfadh an tAire a spéis agus a shuim sna breac-Ghaeltachtaí. Chuimhnigh go bhfuil suim na ndaoine sna ceantair sin chomh láidir ó thaobh na Gaeilge agus atá sé san bhfíor-Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá fhios againn na mí-bhuntáistí atá ag baint le hiarrachtaí an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh san Ghalltacht i gcomparáid leis an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh sa Ghaeltacht.  Toisc gur air-gead an náisiúin atá i gceist níorbh aon díobháil dá gcaithfí cuid den airgead leo leis an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh sna breac-Ghaeltachtaí agus sna Galltachtaí. Tuigimid an méad atá déanta agus atá á dhéanamh ag Bord na Gaeilge do na Galltachtaí.  Ach teastaíonn níos mó ná sin.  Cúis mhisnigh agus dóchais dom féin gur tháinig an tAire nua chugainn i mbliana agus tá mé fíor-bhuíoch dó dá bharr sin.</P>
    <P>I had to prepare those few lines in Irish because I am in the process of endeavouring to re-learn the language.  It is many years since I went to school and when I took up farming I had not time to develop my knowledge of the language.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to involve in this Bill areas that are genuinely interested in becoming Irish-speaking districts. I referred to one, not because it is within my own constituency but because I believe that if we are serious about the language as a living language we cannot just set up a number of pales or iron curtains around the land.  We must allow for a growth and there is no reason why efforts made with enthusiasm in a new area cannot be successful.  Due help and consideration must be given in the fostering of that effort.  Not enough is being done in this field.</P>
    <P>In the past we had this idea of a breac Gaeltacht and that in itself gave status and recognition to those areas.  They were entitled to special grants.  Those things in themselves were incentives, but above all the areas were identified in the minds of people as special areas where the Irish language was being fostered successfully.  For whatever reasons, those areas have dwindled.  The language has failed.  In one generation we have almost succeeded in losing the language that was successfully preserved through <Col N="46" /> penal days.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the Bill deals not only with specific Gaeltacht areas, which are the real home of the language, but breac Gaeltacht areas as well.  We admire what has been done and what will be done in the future for the Gaeltacht areas.  It is very necessary work and our children can visit those areas during the summer to learn the language.  However, I should not like to think that we are continuing the &ldquo;closed shop&rdquo; approach to the language.  I should like to see the reintroduction by the Minister of the breac Gaeltacht in specific areas where the efforts of the people merit recognition, though not the recognition as a full Gaeltacht; that would not be right. Recognition as a breac Gaeltacht would be a preliminary step towards becoming a full Gaeltacht.  Because the Minister comes from the Gaeltacht he would perhaps appreciate this more than anybody else.  I hope he will act on what I have said.</P>
    <P>The efforts made by Gaeltarra Éireann have won worldwide recognition. I hope that a similar effort under the údarás will carry on that good work. We are not doing half enough to foster the cottage-type industry.  Rarely does anyone take any notice if a group of Irish people get together with a good idea, but people from abroad with plans for a project get lots of attention.  Very often such projects are not successful.  In Ballymacoda and other such places there are wonderful opportunities for cottage-type industries.  There are opportunities for boat building or for a woollen industry or even, as in Ballymacoda, the construction and manufac-ture of form machinery in a small factory. The Minister saw some of these things for himself.  This is how to keep a community together.</P>
    <P>There is very little point in spending a lot of money on the language if we cannot keep the people at home to speak it. If people from Gaeltacht areas must go abroad, they very often forget their Irish. This is not the ideal system.  The communities within the Gaeltacht areas should be built up and the people should be allowed to make their living at home. For this reason I should like to see an emphasis on the industrial aspect of this <Col N="47" /> Bill.  I do not want to project the mercenary idea, that people should learn Irish for what they can get out of it.  The practicality of the situation is that, if you have industries, you will have people and, if you have people, then you have the language.  I should like to think that the Minister would bear in mind our small area of east Cork where an effort is being made.  I am sure there are other such areas around the country.  I hope that something positive will be done in the future in giving them identification.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach fáiltiú roimh an mBille seo toisc go bhfuil sé faoi bhráid an Tí agus go bhfuil an chaint ar fad thart maidir leis an mBille a bhí le teacht.  Tá an oiread sin cainte déanta faoin mBille seo le cúpla bliain anuas taobh amuigh den Teach seo go bhfuil sé in am dúinn anseo beagán díospóireachta a dhéanamh faoi sa Teach.</P>
      <P>Anois, agus an méid sin fáiltiú déanta agam roimh an mBille, ba mhaith liom i dtosach cúpla focal a rá faoin mBille go ginearálta.  Beidh mé ag rá cúpla rud agus is deacair iad a rá os rud é gur Maigh Eoch eile atá san Aire agus atá freag-arthach as Roinn na Gaeltachta, ach tá mé cinnte go dtuigfidh sé céard atá i gceist agam agus go dtuigfidh sé cén fáth go mbeidh mé ag clamhsán beagán.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis an mBille go ginearálta, tá sé toirtiúil.  Tá an-chuid scríobhtha ann ach má scrúdaíonn tú an Bille diabhal mórán atá ann taobh thiar de na leathanaigh fada ann.  Mar tá leagtha amach ann céard a d'féadfaí a dhéanamh dá mbeadh sé ar intinn ag an Aire é a dhéanamh nó dá mbeadh an tAire sásta é a dhéanamh.  An t-aon rud amháin atá leagtha amach ann ná go bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta á bhunú. Chomh fada agus is eol domsa ó bheith ag léamh an Bhille&mdash;agus léigh mé cúpla uair é&mdash;maidir leis an údarás céanna níl mórán difríochta idir Údarás na Gaeltachta mar atá sé sa Bhille anseo agus Gaeltarra mar atá sé ann faoi láthair.  Níl ann ach aistriú cumhachta ó Ghaeltarra go dtí an rud nua seo ar a dtugann an tAire Údarás na Gaeltachta air.  Go deimhin ceapaim féin go <Col N="48" /> bhfuil cailliúint le feiceáil maidir le muin-tir naGaeltachta chomh fada agus a bhaineann leis an údarás seo; go raibh siad i bhfad níos fearr as ag plé le Gaeltarra.  Thuig mise i gcónaí go raibh an rud go bhfuil an-eolas air sa tír seo special position&mdash;a cuireadh ar ceal in áit eile cúpla bliain ó shin&mdash;go raibh sé ag Gaeltarra maidir le forbairt eacnamaíoch na Gaeltachta; sé sin nach raibh ar Ghaeltarra dul i gcoimhlint leis an IDA, cuir i gcás maidir le forbairt eacnamaíoch sa Ghaeltacht.  Feictear dom chomh fada agus a bhaineann leis an mBille agus le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta gur fíor-bheagán is féidir a dhéanamh gan dul chun cainte le beirt Aire, go gcaithfidh Aire na Gaeltachta agus an tÚdarás dul chun cainte leis an Aire Tionscail, Tráchtála agus Fuinnimh&mdash;bhí sé sin ann i gcónaí&mdash;ach b'fhéidir go ndéanfaidh an tAire, nuair a bhéas sé ag tabhairt freagra orainn, léiriú dúinn céard atá i gceist leis seo agus an bhfuil aon difríocht idir an chaoi a n-oibríonn Gaeltarra faoi láthair agus an chaoi a n-oibreoidh an tÚdarás nuair a bhéas sé curtha ar bun agus nuair a bhéas an Bille seo reachtaithe ina Acht. Sin ceann de na ceisteanna, mar má thuigimse an Béarla agus an leagan Gaeilge atá san mBille anseo beidh ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ar na cean-tair Ghaeltachta a bheith i gcoimhlint náisiúnta anois le haghaidh monarcana nó le haghaidh forbairt eacnamaíoch a fháil dóibh féin, rud nach raibh orthu a dhéanamh go dtí seo toisc go raibh staid speisialta ag Gaeltarra agus go raibh brú faoi leith á chur ag Roinn na Gaeltachta ar Ghaeltarra agus chomh fada agus a thuigimse tharla sé go minic go bhfuair an Ghaeltacht tús áite maidir le reachtú monarcain nó forbairt eacnamaíoch, rud nach mbeidh fíor faoin údarás.</P>
    <P>Anois tá clamhsán eile agam.  Mar adúirt mé i dtosach, bhí a lán cainte faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta le cúpla bliain anuas.  Bhí mé i láthair ag cruinnithe in iarthar na tíre seo agus bhí an cheist seo faoi chaibidil ag a lán daoine agus bhí siadsan ag súil&mdash;gnáth phobal na nGaeltachtaí&mdash;nuair a chuirfí an tÚdarás ar bun (1)  go mbeadh sé daonlathach agus (2)  go mbeadh cúmhachtaí aige.  Anois maidir leis an daonlathas&mdash;tá fhios agam go ndéarfaidh <Col N="49" /> an tAire go bhfuil iarracht á dhéanamh a bheith chomh daonlathach agus is féidir agus tá an t-iarracht sin déanta, ach ní dóigh liom go dtéann sé fada go leor.  Tá seisear á thoghadh ag an Aire ar an údarás agus fágfar seachtar le toghadh ag muintir na Gaeltachta.  Ní dóigh liom go mbaineann daonlathas le sin sa chiall ina dtuigimse daonlathas agus, tá mé cinnte, sa chiall ina dtuigeann an tAire daonlathas agus mar gheall ar sin ní dóigh liom go mbeidh pobal na Gaeltachta sásta ar an bpointe sin.  Deirim nach leor é sin agus chomh fada agus is eol dom deir pobal na Gaeltachta an rud céanna faoi láthair.  Mar sin níl a nguth láidir go leor taobh istigh den údarás.  Ar ndóigh braitheann sé ar cé hiad na comhaltaí a thoghas an tAire é féin.  B'fhéidir, má thoghann sé daoine ó na Gaeltachtaí go mbeidh sé ag déanamh rud éigin leis an fhadhb a cheartú.</P>
    <P>Ach maidir leis na cumhachtaí&mdash;agus seo é an fhadhb is mó a fheicimse go bhfuil daoine ag clamhsán faoi&mdash;cé hiad na cumhachtaí a bhéas ag an údarás taobh amuigh de na cumhachtaí atá ag Gaeltarra faoi láthair?  Ní dóigh liom ó léamh an Bhille seo go mbeidh aon cheo níos fearr acu ná mar atá ag Gaeltarra agus ag an Roinn faoi láthair.  Dúirt an tAire é féin, agus bhí mé ag éisteacht leis agus d'aontaigh mé leis, gur mhaith leis ceist phleanála a fheiceáil faoi bhráid an údarás sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom gur leor é sin.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an cumhacht sin anseo sa Bhille.  Bhí an tAire ag caint ar RTE an Domhnach tar éis don Bhille a bheith foilsithe.  Ní raibh mise ariamh in mo Aire agus níl fhios agam céard a tharlaíonn istigh ag cruinnithe an Rialtais, ach tá mé cinnte go mbeadh an tAire in ann a rá le muintir na Gaeltachta agus muintir na tíre: beidh cumhacht pleanála ag an údarás, nó ní bheidh mar ní bhfuair mé comhoibriú ó mo chomh-Airí sa Rialtas.  Seisean an tAire agus tá an cumhacht aige an cheist phleanála seo a réiteach agus é a chur sa Bhille má tá chomhoibriú agus má tá tacaíocht aige óna chomh-Airí sa Rialtas.  Iarraim air anois a insint dúinn anseo sa Teach an bhfuil an tacaíocht sin aige agus an mbeidh cead ag an <Col N="50" /> údarás ceisteanna pleanála a réiteach.  Sé sin: an aistreofar an cumhacht pleanála atá ag na comhairlí contae go dtí an údarás chomh fada agus a bhaineann leis na ceantair Ghaeltachta?</P>
    <P>Ceann eile de na mí-bhuntáistí a fheicimse maidir leis an údarás taobh amuigh den phleanáil agus sin ceann an-mhór, is í ceist na cumhachtaí atá ag na comhairlí contae, cuir i gcás, bóithre, uisce, séarachas agus a leithéid.  An bhféadfaí go n-aistreofaí na cumhachtaí sin ó na comhairlí contae mar&mdash;agus tá mé cinnte go bhfuil fhios ag an Aire é seo&mdash;seo é a bhí ar intinn ag muintir na Gaeltachta.  Nuair a bhí mé ag cruin-nithe le blianta beaga anuas bhíodar i gcónaí ag leagan béime ar an taobh seo den údarás&mdash;nár b'fiú faic an t-údarás muna mbeadh na cumhachtaí seo acu, cumhachtaí pleanála agus freagrathas maidir le bóithre, uisce, séarachas agus a leithéid; sé sin na cumhachtaí atá faoi láthair ag na comhairlí contae sna ceantair seo.</P>
    <P>Tá sé de cheart ag an Teach seo ordú a chur ar ceal taobh istigh de lá is fiche muna n-aontaíonn an Teach seo leis an ordú sin.  Thuig mise go raibh sé de dhualgas ag an Rialtas am a chur ar fáil leis an ordú sin a phlé.  Sé mhí ó shin thug mise isteach anseo ceist faoi ordú a chur ar ceal taobh istigh den lá is fiche atá leagtha síos de réir dlí.  Níor cuireadh an t-am ar fáil domsa.  Anois ní Aire na Gaeltachta a bhí i gceist ach ceann dá chomh-Airí.  Níor chuir an Rialtas an t-am ar fáil.  Dúradh liom dá mba mhian liom an t-ordú seo a phlé go gcaithfinn é a phlé in am príobháideach an Fhreasúra, rud nach raibh mé sásta a dhéanamh, mar tá sé leagtha síos go gcaithfidh an Rialtas an t-am a chur ar fáil.  Anois iarraim ar Aire na Gaeltachta&mdash;agus tá mé cinnte gur fear ionraic é&mdash;geallúint solúnta a thabhairt go gcuirfear am ar fáil, agus go bhféachfaidh sé chuige go ndéanfar amhlaidh, le horduithe a phlé taobh istigh den lá is fiche atá leagtha síos.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile an-aisteach ann.  Baineann sé le heolas a nochtú faoin mBille.  Ní nochtóidh aon duine aon eolas a bhfhaighidh sé agus é ag comhlíonadh a dhualgais mar chomhalta den údarás nó mar chomhairleoir nó mar shain-chomhairleoir. <Col N="51" /> Má chionntaítear éinne as eolas a nochtú mar sin gearrfar fineáil air nach mó ná £100, faoi alt 15 den Bhille.  Ní thuigim cén fáth go bhfuil gá lena leithéid de mhanadh.  Ní fhaca mé a leithéid i mBille ariamh.  Más gá a leithéid do chur síos ar pháipéar, d'féad-faí an cheist a chur, cén mhuinín atá ag an Aire agus ag an Roinn as daoine go bhfuil páirt á ghlacadh acu san údarás, muintir an údarás féin nó saineolaithe atá ag cur comhairle orthu?  Ní mórán muiníne atá astu más gá a leithéid d'fhoráil a chur ar fáil, go ngearrfaí £100 orthu má thugann siad eolas ar bith faoi rudaí a tharla ag cruinnithe an údaráis nó aon chruinnithe eile a bhaineann leis an údarás.  B'fhéidir go gcuirtear rudaí dá shórt i mBillí, níl fhios agam, ach ba mhaith liom go ndéanfadh an tAire é sin a mhíniú agus an fáth go bhfuil sé ann a thabhairt dúinn.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Ghaeltacht go ginearálta, níl rud ar bith sa Bhille seo a chuirfidh le forbairt eacnamaíoch, for-bairt na teanga, forbairt shóisialta nó aon ghné eile de shaol na Gaeltachta. Cuir i gcás, an bhfuil tada ann maidir le feirmeoireacht, iascaireacht, forbairt céanna?  Níl, níl ann ach athrú ainme ar Ghaeltarra Eireann agus ar an obair atá ar siúl acu, ach amháin de bharr an Bhille seo go mbeidh rudaí níos measa don Ghaeltacht.  Tá díomá ar chuid mhór daoine sa Ghaeltacht i ngeall ar na pointí a luaigh mé go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Ag breathnú siar 50 bliain agus na polasaithe a cuireadh i bhfeidhm i leith na Gaeilge agus i leith na Gaeltachta caithfear a admháil go bhfuil teipthe ar na polasaithe sin.  Tá teipthe orthu má bhreathnaítear ar na Gaeltachtaí mar Ghaeltachtaí, áiteanna a raibh daoine ag suil go gcaomhnófaí an teanga iontu. Séard atá anseo ná leanúint ar aghaidh don pholasaí, más féidir polasaí a thabhairt air, a bhí ann leis na blianta, sé sin, ar iarraidh ar dhaoine iarrachtaí deonacha a dhéanamh ar theanga a labhairt, fanacht sa bhaile, agus ansin forbairt eacnamaíoch a chur ar fáil arís chomh fada agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Bhí bun-aidhm ag an tír seo leathchéad bliain ó shin i leith na Gaeltachta agus dob í an aidhm sin athbheochaint <Col N="52" /> na Gaeilge mar theanga labhartha.  Ar fhaitíos go mbeadh aon dul amú ar éinne i dtaobh cad atá i gceist agam, séard atá ann ná revival of spoken Irish for all the people of Ireland.  B'shin í an bhun-aidhm a bhí ag an tír seo.  Ansin am éigin sna tríochadaí tharla rud éigin, níl fhios agam céard é féin, ach dob é an toradh a bhí air ná cúlú i leith na bun-aidhme seo, agus ní athbheochaint a bhí ann as sin amach ach caomhnú, sé sin d'iompaíomar ó revival go preservation.  B'shin cúlú agus do réir mar a chuaigh na blianta ar aghaidh bhí cúlú níos faide siar ó preservation go reservation.</P>
    <P>An aidhm seo, athbheochain na Gaeilge mar theanga labharta do mhuintir na hÉireann, tá sé caillte le fada, agus mar adeirim, sna triocadaí, na dachadaí agus na caogadaí a thárla an cúlú sin. Tá revival, preservation agus reservation anois againn.  Tá fhios againn ar fad céard is ciall le &ldquo;preservation&rdquo;.  Séard atá ann anois, agus sé polasaí an Rialtais anois, ná cineál claí na muice duibhe a chur timpeall ar an nGaeltacht, agus muintir na Gaeltachta a fhágáil istigh, agus iarraidh orthu fanacht ann ar son cultúr na tire, ar son na teanga agus ar son na hEireann, agus gan tada eile a dhéanamh.  Sin é an polasaí de réir mar fheicimse polasaí na blianta a chuaidh thart&mdash;cúlú an t-am ar fad.</P>
    <P>Céard tá sa mBille seo?  Tá faitíos orm go bhfuil cúlú le feiceáil anseo freisin, mar sé ceann de na rudaí atá le feiceáil go soiléir go nglacann a lán daoine go mbeadh réiteach ar fhadhb na Gaeltachta agus ar fhadhb na teanga dá ndéanfaí iarracht é a chur i bhfeidhm, sé sin, in ionad an cúlú seo agus an reservation philosophy atá againn go ndéanfaí leathnú ar an nGaeltacht.  Bhí deis ag an Aire sa Bhille seo é sin a dhéanamh, agus tá an deis aige fós.  B'fhéidir leis breathnú ar an scéal agus ceantar an larthair go ginearálta a leathnú amach.</P>
    <P>Cuir i gcás, ní féidir leat iachall a chur ar dhaoine teanga faoi leith a labhairt.  Tá teipthe ar an nós sin agus ar an bpolasaí sin.  Tá fhios ag an Aire, tá fhios ag chuile dhuine sa Teach seo agus taobh amuigh den Teach nach féidir leat a rá le daoine, &ldquo;Caithfidh tú seo, siúd agus eile a dhéanamh&rdquo;, agus bheith ag súil go ndéanfaidh siad é, mar ni dhean-faidh siad.  Ach féadfaí ceantar an <Col N="53" /> Iarthair a leathnú amach, cuir i gcás go dtí na hoileáin.  Tá cuid de na hoileáin nach bhfuil chomh fada sin ón Aire, agus cén fáth, cuir i gcás, go bhfuil oileán amháin nach bhfuil na buntáistí céanna ag dul leis is atá ag oileáin eile toisc go bhfuil Gaeilge á labhairt i gceann amháin agus Béarla i gceann eile?</P>
    <P>Mar adúirt mé cheana, agus deirim arís agus arís eile é, theip ar an bpolasaí sin blianta ó shoin, sé sin, ag iarraidh béim ró láidir a leagan ar usáid na teanga, mar tá na hoileáin ann agus tá ceantair imeallach ann thart ar an nGaeltacht, agus tá na fadhbanna céanna ag baint leo is a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht fhéin, agus níl ann ach timpist go bhfuil Béarla á labhairt iontu.  Tá na fadhbanna céanna sóisialach, eacnamaíochta agus talmhaíochta acu agus atá ag na ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Ach, tre thimpist, is Béarla atá á labhairt iontu, agus mar sin níl na buntáistí céanna ag dul leis na ceantair is atá ag dul leis an nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Mar dúirt mé scór bliain ó shin, ní bhéinn anseo ag rá na rudaí seo ach gur cheap mé fhéin go mba cheart an Ghaeltacht a choineáil mar Ghaeltacht agus go mba cheart caomhnú a dhéanamh ar an méid atá fagtha againn agus chuile iarracht a dhéanamh an teanga a choinneáil beo taobh istigh de cheantair áirithe.  Ach, faoi 1978, biodh mé ceart nó mí-cheart, tá mé anois ar an tuairim go bhfuil teipthe glan ar an bpolasaí seo faoi chungú agus chaomhnú agus go gcaithfear an Ghaeltacht a oscailt agus ceantair faoi leith a thógáil isteach a mbeidh na buntáistí céanna ag baint leo is a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht inniu.</P>
    <P>Sé an t-aon bhealach amháin gur féidir an Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ná tré forbairt eacnamaíoch. Ní féidir leat bheith ag súil go bhfanfaidh daoine in áit nach bhfuil fostaíocht ann dóibh, nach bhfuil caighdeán maireachtála ar aon chéim leis an gcaighdeán atá in áiteanna eile sa tír. Is ceist stairiúil é agus is ceist geographic é go dtarlaíonn sé go bhfuil na ceantair Ghaeltachta ar na ceantair is bochta sa tír, agus ní tré thimpist a thárla sé sin.  Is ceist stairiúil é.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an nGaeltacht, tugadh <Col N="54" /> aghaidh ar an fhadhb sin i dtosach. Déanadh leathnú ar an nGaeltacht i 1956.  Comharsa liom fhéin agus comh-arsa leis an Aire a bhí mar Aire na Gaeltachta ag an am.  Tugadh &ldquo;Lindsay na Gaeltachta&rdquo; air, agus anois níl éinne in ann seasamh suas agus a rá gur dearnadh dochar, mar níor déanadh aon dochar, agus tá fhios ag an Aire é sin. Go deimhin, ba mhaith liom a rá nuair a bhí an tAire ina shuí anseo go raibh seisean i bhfabhar leathnú na Gaeltachta tré na hoileáin a thabhairt isteach agus ceantair imeallach na nGaeltachtaí, áiteanna go raibh na fadhbanna céanna ag baint leo agus bhí leis an Ghaeltacht a thabhairt isteach faoi réim na Gaeltachta.  Níl sé sin ró fhada ó shin, ach ar ndóigh nuair a chuaigh an tAire ar an taobh sin den Teach bhí athrú scéil aige.  Muna bhfuil daoine sa Ghaeltacht ní bheidh Gaeltacht againn agus ní bheidh teanga againn, agus is é forbairt eacnamaíochta, mar adúirt mé cheana, an t-aon pholasaí amháin gur féidir leis aon chaomhnú nó aon dul chun cinn a dhéanamh ar an staid atá ann faoi láthair sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom, mar fhocal scoir, a rá go mbeadh an t-údarás ann.  D'fhéad-faimid a bheith ag clamhsán faoi phointí faoi leith maidir le cumhachtaí, maidir le daonlathas agus rudaí eile.  An mbeadh sé ceart glacadh leis go ndéanfaidh an tAire beart de réir a bhriathair chun dul chun cinn na Gaeltachta agus dul chun cinn na teanga agus na fadhbanna a bhaineann leis a réiteach trí obair an údaráis?  Taobh amuigh den clamhsán ar fad atá déanta agamsa faoin údarás, mar adúirt mé cheana fáiltím roimhe toisc go bhfuil sé ann.  Níl sé mar a shíl a lán daoine a bheadh sé.  Bheadh an Bille seo ábalta a lán rudaí a dhéanamh dá mbeadh an tAire sásta nó ábalta bheith ag comhoibriú lena chomh-Airí, na rudaí gùr mhaith leis a fheiceáil i ngníomh sa Ghaeltacht atá ann.</P>
    <P>We had revival, we had preservation, we now have reservation.  Might I hope that the Minister will without further reservation ensure that the expansion of Irish in the Gaeltacht will be his priority and that he will abandon the policies which have been seen to have failed down the years.  The only solution that I can envisage to the problems that beset <Col N="55" /> the Gaeltacht areas and the expansion of Irish is a broadening of our political vistas, a broadening of the designated areas including the peripheral areas and the islands, giving them the same advan-tages that the Gaeltacht areas now enjoy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this Bill which is the fulfilment of an election promise contained in our manifesto.  Some criticism has been levelled at the Minister because this Bill was not introduced in the first year that this Government took office as we had stated it would.  However, I am sure the fair-minded people in the Gaeltacht will accept the Minister's explanation that the drafting difficulties were quite considerable and will be very happy that within 18 months of our return to office this Bill is now before the House.</P>
      <P>I admitted before the House the sadness I feel at not being able to speak in Irish, but I am very keen to see that my children learn to speak Irish.  I see one of the functions of an t-údarás as being the very important task which the minister referred to in his Second Stage speech of furthering the use of the Irish language.  I hope that one of the first tasks on the cultural side to be undertaken by this new body taking over the functions of Gaeltarra Éireann, which was largely concerned with industrial development in the Gaeltacht, will be the teaching of Irish to children from the cities such as Dublin.  I am aware that people can go to the Gaeltacht and stay with Irish-speaking families, but I hope an t-údarás will take on this important task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to note that the majority on this committee will be elected by the people of the Gaeltacht.  I agreed with the Minister's sentiments when he said that up until now individuals with little backing could convey an impression that they spoke on behalf of the community. This is true in all areas where groups of individuals have access to the media and get more coverage in propagating their views than people who are directly elected by the people.  There is nothing more sobering to the people who like to <Col N="56" /> be the great pundits than the test of going through an election.  It is very important for the democratic credibility of an t-údarás that the majority of members will be elected.</P>
    <P>The fact that it will be possible to advance sums totalling up to £50 million out of central funds under section 3 for the work of an t-údarás as well as annual grants under section 22 is to be welcomed.  This is not by any means a small sum, and I am aware of the tremendous responsibility which the first board of an t-údarás will have in setting up the framework within which future succeeding boards will work.  One of the most important aspects of their work will be in the gradual taking on to themselves of the powers of a local authority, which the Minister stated will be contained in section 9 of the Bill, which will allow the Minister to confer on an t-údarás powers giving them more and more autonomy as they earn it.  To start off by setting up an autonomous body without any real direction would be an error.  We are giving them certain functions&mdash;the initial ones being the functions carried out by Gaeltarra Éireann in the past&mdash;plus the extra authority of now having democratically elected members.</P>
    <P>There are many people who have a tremendous lack of faith in the Gaeltacht and its future.  Successive Governments have endeavoured in many ways to encourage people to stay in the Gaeltacht by giving them incentives and this has caused resentment in some quarters because some people felt that all people were not being treated equally.  We have all heard statements to the effect that people in the Gaeltacht were being spoon-fed.  I do not agree with that attitude. It is very important for the survival of our culture that the Gaeltacht receives every possible assistance and encouragement.  I do not think any Member would suggest otherwise.  I accept that there may be a few individuals who believe that the Irish language should be done away with, that it should be allowed die a natural death but we have always had to live with such people who found it embarrassing to be Irish. Sometimes those who turn out to be <Col N="57" /> most ardent supporters of retaining our culture are those who may have lost the language in previous generations.  They now wish to reacquire a knowledge of it and our traditions for the sake of their children.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the view that has been expressed that the Bill amounts to the setting up of a mini-republic in the Gaeltacht.  That is a cynical view and one which does not merit much attention. The new authority will give the people of the Gaeltacht a new sense of pride in themselves.  It amounts to a new challenge to them to show what they are capable of.  It will inspire in many young people a new sense of direction and idealism and will rekindle a love for our language in many.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the work done by Gaeltarra Éireann and in particular to the dedication and idealism of the general manager, Cathal Mac Gabhann.  I have known him for many years and I am well aware of his dedication to work.  He has made a great success of Gaeltarra Éireann and under the new framework I am sure he will play an equally important role.  The new authority which will oversee all the work that is to be done in relation to the Gaeltacht will have a tremendous responsibility and the importance of its work cannot be underestimated.  I am sure all Members will extend to the members their good wishes.  We will watch with interest and sympathetic understanding the initial difficulties we expect the authority to experience.  In the final analysis those who are elected to the authority by the people will be chosen because of their definite concern for the development of Gaeltacht areas. I hope the authority will be allocated a sizeable budget for cultural development so that they can encourage people to live in the Gaeltacht for long periods.  I have often had a desire to take leave of absence and go to the Gaeltacht to live for six months or 12 months.</P>

      <P>While some constituents might appreciate my absence for such a lengthy period others would not.  I am <Col N="58" /> not likely to ask the Chief Whip for leave of absence but I would recommend that young people spend a long period in Gaeltacht areas.  I would like the new authority to pay attention to that aspect. We can have many industries and all the trappings that go with prosperity but without our cultural heritage and our language we have nothing.  We will become another part of one industrial mass.  A Gaelic speaking Gaeltacht in a free Ireland should be the initial aim of this new authority.  In those areas people should be encouraged to delve into their heritage.</P>

      <P>Más mian leis an Teachta Briscoe teacht go Gaeltacht Mhuigheo beidh fáilte roimhe, ach ní dóigh liom go mbeidh morán in éineacht leis mura dtiochfaidh sé ann sé mhí amach anseo.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá leis an Aire i dtús báire go gcuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo chun Udarás na Gaeltachta a bhunú.  Is mór, go deimhin, a bhfuil ráite agus scríobhta faoin údarás seo cheana féin agus go dheimhin bhí sé geallta dúinn le fada.  Ar an bpointe seo cuirim fáilte roimhe.  Níl dabht ar bith ann, agus ní fhéadfadh duine ar bith cur ina aghaidh, go ndearna iar-Aire na Gaeltachta, an Teachta O'Donnell, forbairt iontach ar son na Gaeltachtaí ar fad.  Bhí an t-údarás seo le bheith bunaithe aige anois, ach mar a deirtear sa Teach seo, sin ceist eile.  Is mór an trua nach raibh sé bunaithe aige anois mar bheadh an tAire in ann na deachrachtaí a bheadh ann a fheiceáil níos fearr, agus an rud ba cóir a dhéanamh fúthu a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Deirtear nach bhfuil sa Bhille seo ach taibhse de Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Is iad na nithe is tabhachtaí sna Gaeltachtaí ná obair do na ndaoine, oideachas, cursaí sóisialta, talmhaíochta, iascaireachta, bóithre, uisce, teanga, cultúr na nGaeltachtaí, agus eile.  Deirtear freisin nach bhfuil an cumhacht ba gá ag an údarás nua i leith na nithe seo.</P>
      <P>In this Bill the Minister is afforded a unique opportunity of initiating an everlasting flow of progress for all Gaeltachtaí.  Coming from a Gaeltacht area he knows, possibly more intimately than many people in this House, the problems encountered in those areas.</P>

    <P>In welcoming this Bill, which will dissolve <Col N="59" /> Gaeltara Eireann, I too should like to mention its successes, its tremendous workload and that of its officials, particularly in recent years, in the formation, expansion and development of all Gaeltacht areas.  There have been calls from different bodies in Gaeltacht areas that the údarás should have been democratically set up long ago.  In this Bill the Minister proposes to have six appointees by ministerial appointment and seven by election from within the Gaeltacht areas themselves.  Anybody who has studied any political figures in the past 18 months will realise that the probable result will be that the board will be subject to the Minister's instructions and the Government's intentions in respect of political attitudes.  But from the point of view of being democratic, it cannot be said that elections will not take place democratically.  Perhaps the Minister would spell out the intentions he has in relation to those elections, how he intends having candidates nominated and so on.</P>
    <P>The use of Irish is to be promoted in Gaeltacht areas, which is to be highly recommended.  I trust the údarás will work in close liaison with Bord na Gaeilge to this end, endeavouring to promote the use of Irish as a living, vibrant, everyday language of people of all shades of opinion within Gaeltacht areas.  That is a very desirable aim of any Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (7) of the Bill states:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this section an tÚdarás shall have power to acquire, receive on transfer, hold, sell, mortgage, lease, let, or otherwise dispose of land, buildings, markets, premises or plant and to erect, alter or maintain buildings, markets, premises or plant.</P>
    <P>In relation to the setting up of an industry or possible widening of roads for that purpose there might be objections made by landowners in any particular area.  I wonder what authority the údarás will have in relation to the acquisition of such holdings.  This is a problem proper to the Department of the Environment in areas outside the <Col N="60" /> Gaeltacht.  It might happen that there would be very few suitable sites for certain industries, when problems in that regard would be encountered in some areas.</P>
    <P>The core of this Bill, to my mind, is contained in section 9 (2) (d) which confers on the údarás such local authority functions as it may specify.  In this Bill the Minister is afforded a unique opportunity of furthering the progress of all Gaeltacht areas in no uncertain terms.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole called for an expansion of Gaeltacht areas.  I have no doubt that if the Minister could announce an expansion of all Gaeltacht areas today he would do so.  Bearing in mind that he comes from a part of the country, a section of which is in the Gaeltacht and a section of which is not, I am sure nobody more than he would like to make an announcement of such importance to the people there.  I understand that there will be problems in relation to the expansion of Gaeltacht areas, some difficult to overcome.  I have no doubt that the Minister will be investigating these problems to see what action he might take.  Travelling as he does from Gaeltacht to non-Gaeltacht areas he will appreciate that there is very little physical difference between a Gaeltacht area and a non-Gaeltacht one, except that in recent years the standards of physical structures in Gaeltacht areas has improved immensely in comparison with some other non-Gaeltacht ones. Here I am thinking specifically of such matters as roads, bridges, sewerage schemes, lighting systems and so on. Regardless of the titles of Bills or of what words they contain, what people are interested in are the benefits to be derived from their implementation.  In other words the titles of Bills and the words contained in them may not have great significance for people living in Gaeltacht areas.  They do not really mind so long as the benefits accruing to them are for their further progress.</P>
    <P>Many areas outside the Gaeltacht are being discriminated against to some extent in the development of these physical structures.  We have several inhabited islands off the west coast and the Minister would probably have to include these in any planned expansion or extension <Col N="61" /> of the Gaeltacht limits.  The frustrations and physical barriers that people have to contend with in many of these areas have to be experienced at first hand before a definite understanding of what they are all about can be reached. Coming as he does from such an area and having experienced these problems at first hand, the Minister has within his Department the power to take such progressive opportunities as he thinks fit. That is the heart of the Bill and, no doubt, the Minister will have representations and advice at meetings with different groups and organisations and with people from the non-Gaeltacht areas who wish to be included in the benefits that are in evidence for people living within the specific limits.</P>
    <P>It is not stated in the Bill that the areas for election would be breac-Ghaeltachtaí or Gaeltachtaí as in-troduced under specific Acts.  I would like the Minister to clarify that because there will be people and groups who feel that they should be represented and if they are not they may seek to be included under the terms of the Bill.  The core of that point is that the further extension of the Gaeltacht areas is of paramount importance to people living outside them at present.  That is what the údarás should be all about; not alone about development within specific limits but possibly also about extension of those limits and the promotion and use of Irish inside and outside and right across the whole spectrum.</P>
    <P>There has been a tremendous increase in tourism in Gaeltacht areas in recent years mainly because many of those areas contain some of the finest landscapes in our country, and this aspect has been opened up to foreigners only in the relatively recent past.  The local authority powers that should be conferred on the údarás would go a long way towards a decent promotion and furthering of the tourism industry within the Gaeltacht areas which would be to the benefit of everybody and especially to the people directly involved, those living in the areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to the planning aspect of housing, it has become increasingly evident that ribbon development is begining to sprout wings, as it were, and this <Col N="62" /> brings with it an immense number of problems in the provision of water, sewerage, proper lighting, road widen-ing, footpaths and so on.  I find nothing in the Bill that will confer upon the údarás proper powers to develop the Gaeltacht areas to the extent that local authority areas are developed.  Section 10 (4) states:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás shall not provide financial assistance in any particular case where financial assistance has been provided by the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>Where an industry is set up by the IDA in a non-Gaeltacht area which could be on or very close to the border of a Gaeltacht area and people from Gaeltacht areas are trained to work in that IDA factory, does the finance for that training come from the Department of Labour or from the údarás?  It would seem contradictory to the terms of the Bill that no assistance can be provided by the údarás where finance has previously been granted by the IDA.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that before the passage of the Bill has been completed there will be many representations from different groups and organisations stating their point of view that the Bill does not have the authority they would like to see contained in it.  However, being a fellow TD of the Minister and from the same constituency, I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  There are points in it that I will discuss with him later, and I have no doubt that he will bear in mind the essential point of my contribution, that the problems in relation to the expansion of Gaeltacht areas should be looked at intently with a view to making a major announcement that we can provide goodies for living people outside the areas.  If the Minister wishes I shall give him every assistance necessary on that.</P>

      <P>In general, there is no shortage of maintenance staff to meet normal requirements.  Temporary shortages affecting the maintenance of the service can occur from time to time as a result of local conditions such as storm or flood damage, but these are generally met by the working of additional overtime or by diversion of staff from installation work. The staff is, of course, being built up to meet the future needs of the service and since July 1977, over 650 trainees have been recruited, and a further 500 will be recruited over the next few months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>No such promise was given.  Some applicants in the earliest developed parts of the Monalea Estate were given service in 1976-77.  At that stage development of the rest of the estate was not sufficiently advanced to allow cabling of it to be un-dertaken. The local resident's association <Col N="71" /> was informed in November 1977 that the indications at that time were that cabling to serve those sections of the estate which had not yet got service would not be completed before mid-1978. In April this year the association were informed that because of the engineering dispute and the consequent backlog of urgent work it was unlikely that the cabling could be completed for some time but that every effort would be made to do so as soon as possible after restoration of normal working conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The increases were not considered by the National Prices Commission because they relate to charges for a new service namely RTE 2 whereas the National Prices Commission deal with increases in charges for existing services. It would be a matter for the Government to decide on each future occasion whether proposals for increases in licence fees should be referred to that body for their observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not seriously expect the House to accept the excuse he has given for not submitting this issue to the National Prices Commission, namely, that this is a new service?  In relation to an application of this kind which demanded an exorbitant increase of 25 per cent in licence fees, was it not an obvious and appropriate measure to submit it to the National Prices Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure the Deputy that I was absolutely serious.  There is no precedent for the National Prices Commission being asked to recommend a price for the introduction of a new product or service. Since RTE 2 is a new service it is quite appropriate that a charge should be made for its provision and it is not appropriate for the National Prices Commission to recommend any such charge. I am surprised at the Deputy's concern about the levying of exorbitant increases for existing services because in this regard, looking back on the record, the only case I could find occurred in 1974 when an increase of 33? per cent was imposed without any reference to the NPC and without there being provided any change in the service.  Therefore, I suggest that if there is any fault in this area, <Col N="76" /> it rests with the last administration of which the Deputy was a member.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say what examination, if any, was conducted by the Government or by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs into the reasons for the high level of the increases? Did the Government merely rubber stamp the application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that that was not the case.  Information was requested as to the estimated running cost of the new service and the revenue that would be likely to accrue from such sources and additional advertising. Estimates were prepared of the likely budget situation that RTE will face during 1979 and it was on the basis of that information that the figure was agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being precise about the increases in the licence fees but surely he has figures also in respect of advertising.  Would he not agree that the people who advertise can better afford increased charges than can poor people who must pay the licence fees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to what is the point of the Deputy's remarks.  Advertising charges are fixed in relation to cost and so on.  In that area any increase in advertising charges would be a matter to come within the purview of the NPC who examine charges for advertising services generally, not only in respect of television but of the other media too. Therefore, the level of advertising charges is a matter which falls within the operation of the normal price control activities and there cannot by any question <Col N="77" /> of RTE being lax in that area.  Consequently, if there remains a charge to be made, it is appropriate that it should be met by the other main source of revenue, namely, the licence fees paid by the viewers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with the general question of the manner in which advertising charges are fixed. There is a need to relate that to existing charges.  It would not be appropriate for the Government to seek an increase in advertising charges and to advance as a justification for such application the reason that this should be used as a vehicle for paying for a new service.  The NPC would be right in disallowing any such application.</P>

      <P>I have drawn attention already to the fact that I find all of this quite hypocritical coming from the other side because the people over there not only increased the charge by a 33? per cent but on a subsequent occasion in 1976 they added insult to injury when, having received a recommendation from the NPC, they ignored that recommendation and proceeded to increase the licence fee by a greater amount.  Now they talk about imposing charges on poor people.  Where was their concern on the two previous occasions?</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply, since the question of fixing the charge for a new service does not fall within the ambit of the NPC, it was not examined on that basis.  To the best of my knowledge a similar format was followed but I would not like to say categorically how each item was or was not classified because, as the Deputy is probably aware from previous experience, items occur in the accounts of any organisation which are a matter of some discussion or occasional difference of view as to whether or to what extent they are allowable for price increase purposes.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated we sought information on the likely operating costs and on the revenue that would accrue from sources such as advertising.  That was the basis for the formation of an estimate of the additional revenue required by way of licence charges.  The reason for my drawing the distinction between this and the NPC was that I had no way of knowing the precise manner in which the commission operate their rules in any case.  Last week I had occasion to wind up discussing a somewhat similar approach with the Deputy.  It is never any part of my intention to endeavour to look into someone's mind or heart.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned either with the 1974 or the 1978 decisions, but arising from the Minister's reply in which he has indicated that the provision of a new service is the reason for the increases in licence fees, can he say on which basis any such additional charge can be applied to the Northern half of County Donegal where we have neither RTE 1 nor any prospect of receiving RTE 2?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises as a result of the Minister's reply.  What is the position in respect of viewers in those areas of the country where the service will not be available?  Is it not ludicrous to apply an increased charge for a service that will not be provided?  If one looks at the maps of those areas in which the new service will not be available, one finds that the Northern half of County Donegal is included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point that there may not be 100 per cent coverage of the new service, but RTE are endeavouring to provide the service to the maximum number of viewers at the earliest date possible.  I do not have precise details regarding a service for the area to which the Deputy refers, but if he wishes to table a question in that regard I shall endeavour to ascertain the information for him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is neither projected nor promised that the service will be available in that area.  Can there be any pretence either by this administration or by their predecessors that any attempt has been made or is being made to make <Col N="80" /> the service available to the greatest number of people possible considering that the nearest mast is over 100 miles from the northern part of Donegal and that this can only be, at best, freak reception.  We are not getting this freak reception but we are being asked to pay for the rest of the country.</P>

The Minister says we should not have television sets because we cannot get the service the nation is paying for and for which we will have to pay increased fees. No fees if there is no service should be the <i>quid pro quo</i> in this matter.  It is a bloody disgrace.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the only service several hundred thousand viewers will get as a result of RTE 2 being introduced&mdash;I am not speaking of people in North Donegal but those living north of Dublin&mdash;is a partial blacking out of BBC 2 which they are getting for nothing?  How can they be expected to pay this increased fee?  Is the Minister further aware that a prominent <Col N="81" /> member of the RTE staff stated on television recently that the increase was not for the purpose of paying for RTE 2?</P>

      <P>I am making the point that this topic should not be used to score party political points.  The proposal to increase fees to pay for RTE 2 was made by both sides of the House. If I may go on to make what might be construed as a party political point, the actual increase in the licence fees originating from the introduction of RTE 2 is not as great as was expected. Because of such things as the points to which Deputy Corish was referring, advertising, the revenue from that area has been more buoyant thanks to more buoyant economic conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that the increased charge is lower than might otherwise have been expected, and one reason for this is the more buoyant economic situation.  The Deputy's second point was that BBC 2 is being blacked out.  My understanding is that RTE have gone to great lengths not to interfere with existing reception, <Col N="82" /> and to route the new service in such a manner as to minimise interference with existing reception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is important that the television viewer, like any other consumer, should be assured that price increases will be subject to the closest scrutiny, subject to certain criteria which will be laid down.  This being the case, would he agree that an assurance should be given that from now on increases of this nature should be subject to the scrutiny of the prices commission? Would he also agree that the feeling in the multi-channel area is that the viewer is being mulcted?  This indignation has increased since the people realised that there will not be a great choice of programme when RTE 2 is introduced. &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; will be on both channels at the same time.</P>

      <P>As I have already made clear, it is not this Government but the previous Government, who were guilty of not referring proposals for increased charges for existing services to the prices commission.  It has been our general approach to endorse the work of the prices commission and to recognise their value by, in all cases, referring applications for price increases to that commission.  As I have already indicated, the reason why it was not done in this instance was that it did not apply.</P>

There is no shortage of money available for that purpose.  If anything the allocations for this year will be underspent rather than overspent.  As to our intentions for future years, as the Green Paper indicated, it is our intention to press ahead with rapidly increased expenditure in this area and in a number of other important infrastructural areas.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dispute is between the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, representing the assistants at Enfield sub-post office, and the postmaster who employs the assistants.  I understand that discussions have taken place between both parties, under the chairmanship of an officer of the conciliation service of the Labour Court, but that a basis for <Col N="86" /> settling the dispute has not yet been found.  I would urge both parties to redouble their efforts to find a solution to the dispute which, regrettably, is causing great inconvenience and hardship to residents in the Enfield area who have been deprived of telephone and mail services.</P>
    <P>In regard to the amount of money which the Department pay the postmaster, the position is that postmasters are paid for the post office services they provide in accordance with rates of remuneration which are settled nationally under the postmasters' conciliation and arbitration scheme.  The present rates of remuneration were agreed following negotiations with the Postmasters' Union and take account of the various costs involved in the running of sub-post offices.  Any question of increasing the rates of remuneration would be a matter for consideration under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  My understanding is that the main issue in dispute at present is the union's claim for reinstatement of an assistant who was dismissed by the postmaster.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to replace the suboffice in Enfield by an office run by staff employed by the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this dispute is now over five months old? The information he has now given is very similar to that given to me by the Minister responsible in June of this year in this House.  Is he aware that, over a whole wide area, a number of smaller sub-post offices are ineffective as well as the post office in Enfield?  No post or telephone calls are going in or out.  Calls to industrialists and social welfare payments have been stopped over the past number of months.  Does the Minister consider that putting his head in the sand ostrich-like is the way to settle this dispute?</P>

The reply given is absolutely ludicrous. Does the Minister consider the amount of money being given to the sub-post master is sufficient to pay the staff for running the office?  That is the kernal of the trouble.  Reinstatement or anything like that is a side issue.  If the sub-post master is not getting the amount of money required to run the post office he should get more, and if he is getting enough money the State should do something about it and not allow this to hang on for six, seven or eight months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question refers to media reports that a group which had carried out a random survey of public telephone kiosks in certain areas in Dublin claimed that a high proportion of them were out of order and wanted special action to prevent vandalism.</P>
      <P>It is the position, regrettably, that at any one time many public telephones are out of order due primarily to a high incidence of vandalism, particularly over weekends.  The vandalism ranges from blocking the coin shutes or stealing the handset to complete destruction of the kiosks.</P>
      <P>My Department have taken various measures over the years to try to reduce the incidence of damage including reinforcing the coinboxes, replacing glass by special strengthened plastic, improving the lights of the kiosks and more frequent maintenance attention.  Telephone kiosks are examined five times a week at least and the busiest ones more frequently. Last year approximately £115,000 was spent in repairing damaged kiosks. An order has been placed for a new type of coinbox installation which is specially strengthened and includes a number of features designed to prevent theft and vandalism and it is expected to have a substantial number of these in use in Dublin over the next year.</P>

      <P>I am not disputing that the present practice may be the most efficient way of utilising what staff is available but is the Minister aware that the practice is that when a gang, as it is called, moves into a neighbourhood, whether it be urban or provincial, they tend to provide all applicants then on hands with service?  This is contrary to what the Minister has just said about dealing with priority cases on the one hand and working from a waiting list on the other hand.  It is a contrary situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar feadh na blianta, go deimhin ó bunaíodh an Stát, is mó díospóireacht agus tuarascála a tháinig ós cómhair na Dála faoin Ghaeltacht agus faoin teanga.  Is mó scéimeanna agus pleananna agus is mó atá ráite agus scríobhtha ag a lán daoine i rith na blianta faoi leas na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Sa Bhille seo tá an tAire ag iarraidh údarás nua Ghaeltachta a bhunú.  Nuair a foilsíodh an Bille ar an gcéad dul síos, tugadh le tuiscint go mbeadh cumhachtaí ag an údarás, agus bhí gach éinne ag súil agus ag fanacht go dtí an lá seo, go dtí go mbeadh deis ag an Aire ráiteas a thabhairt don Dáil ag miniú go díreach céard atá i gceist aige i dtaobh an údaráis seo.  Bhí gach éinne ag súil, cuir i gcás, go mbeadh níos mó eolais ar fáil ar an ócáid seo ag an Dáil agus ag gach éinne taobh amuigh faoi pholasaí an Rialtais maidir le forbairt na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá imní orm agus ionadh faoin ráiteas beag, ráiteas an-ghairid ar fad, a thug sé anseo inniu&mdash;ceithre leathanach.  Ba cheart go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó le rá ag an Aire, mar, mar a fheicimse an scéal ón ráiteas a thug an tAire, ní mórán athrú a bheidh sa Ghaeltacht tar éis an Bhille seo.  Dáiríre, níl ach athrú amháin ann, sé sin go mbeidh tóghchán chun ionadaí a cheapadh nó a thóghadh don údarás.  Sin é an t-aon athrú.  Bhíos ag léamh sna nuachtáin ráiteasaí ó chainteoirí áirithe, nó cuid acu, nach raibh sa Bhille seo ach teideal nua do Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Bhí mise ag súil nach mar sin a bheadh an scéal, ach ón mbeagáinín a bhí le rá ag an Aire inniu, tá eagla orm.  B'fhéidir nuair a bheidh an tAire ag tabhairt freagra ar an díospóireacht go mbeidh níos mó le rá aige, ach ón eolas atá le fáil i ráiteas an Aire agus sa mBille féin, tá sé fíor a rá nach mbeidh aon athrú ach go mbeidh tóghchán sa Ghaeltacht, go mbeidh <Col N="110" /> cúigear ionadaí tóghtha san tóghchán sin.</P>
    <P>Níl aon mhaitheas le údarás muna bhfuil cumhachtaí forleathan acu.  Sé an brí atá le &ldquo;údarás&rdquo; ná &ldquo;authority&rdquo;, agus ba chóir go mbeadh cumhachtaí forleathan acu.  Ach níl aon rud sa Bhille atá ag tabhairt cumhachtaí níos leithne ná mar atá ag Gaeltarra Éireann faoi láthair.  Maidir leis an tóghchán, deireann an tAire sa chéad leathanach dá ráiteas, ag tagairt don mheitheal oibre a mhol Comhairle na Gaeilge go mbunófaí i 1971:</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil moltaí áirithe a rin-neadh sa tuarascáil sin á gcur i bhfeidhm sa Bhille seo&mdash;mar shampla, seisear comhalta le ceapadh go díreach ag an Aire&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sin é an t-aon moladh atá dá chur i bhfeidhm ag an Aire anseo, méadú ar líon na gcomhaltaí a bhéas ar an mbord nua.  Bhí sé réasúnta bheith ag súil go mbeadh rud nua san údarás seo, go mbeadh cumhachtaí nua, cumhachtaí breise acu i gcomparáid leis na cumhachtaí atá faoi láthair ag Gaeltarra Éireann agus ag an Roinn féin, cumhachtaí breise a bhrostódh forbairt na Gaeltachta.  Ach níl rud ar bith anseo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur air, an bhféadfadh sé a rá linn céard tá ins an Bhille a chabhródh le chomharchumainn Ghaeltachta chun forbairt ceantair áirithe a chur chun cinn?  Céard tá sa Bhille a chabhródh le comharchumainn na n-oileán in iarthar Chonamara chun an obair atá tosnaithe acu, agus atá ag dul chun cinn, a chur chun dea-chríoch? Conas a chabhróidh an Bhille seo leo sin?  Conas a chabhróidh an Bhille an teanga a neartú, go háirithe sna limistéir ar a dtugtar an Bhreac-Ghaeltacht?</P>
    <P>Ach, dar liom, sé an rud is measa leis an Bhille ná nach bhfuil aon eolas againn i dtaobh polasaí an Rialtais i dtaobh forbairt na Gaeltachta.  An bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Aire forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn tré an ghluaiseacht comharaíochta ar bhealach níos eifeachtaí?  Céard tá ins an Bhille seo a cabhróidh le muintir na n-oileán chun forbairt na n-oileán a chur chun cinn, chun caighdeán maith maireachtála a chur ar fáil sna h-oileáin <Col N="111" /> sin?  Tá fadhbanna ar leith ag baint le forbairt na n-oileán agus sílim go mba chóir go dtabharfaí cabhair ar leith do mhuintir na n-oileán go háirithe os rud é go bhfuil comharchumann i mbeagnach gach oileán.  Ba chóir go mbeadh sé mar cheann de na príomh-aidhmeanna ag an údarás leas muintir na n-oileán a chur chun cinn, ach níl aon eolas ar fáil ag an bpointe seo go mbeidh níos mò cabhair le fáil ag muintir na n-oileán.</P>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin, tá imní orm maidir leis an Bhille seo.  Is féidir liom é sin a rá ag an bpointe seo.  Dá mba rud é go mbeadh deis agamsa mar Aire Bille mar seo a thabhairt isteach, ní dheánfainn é mar seo.  In ionad an Bhille seo, sílimse go bhféadfadh an tAire teacht isteach sa Dáil agus leasú amháin a chur isteach i mBille um Thionscail na Gaeltachta maidir le toghachán do Bhord Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Sin mar a fheicimse an scéal.</P>
    <P>It is a simple matter of approaching the matter on a realistic basis.  My interpretation of this Bill is that there is only one major change in this and that is the whole system of election of members to the board of the údarás.  This could have been done by a simple amendment to the Gaeltacht Acts.  The section in the Gaeltacht Industries Bill which deals with the election of members to the board of Gaeltarra Éireann could have been amended to include this system of election.</P>
    <P>Is é an toghachán an t-aon rud suimiúil atá sa Bhille seo.  Maidir leis an toghachán, i leathnach a 2 de oráid an Aire tá eolas faoi chéard atá beartaithe do na liminstéirí oifigiúla Ghaeltachta, agus is mar seo leanas a bheidh na hionadaithe toghtha iontu: beirt do Dhún na nGall, triúr do Ghaillimh, Mhaigh Eo agus Mí le chéile agus beirt do Chiarraí, Chorcaigh agus Port Láirge le chéile.  Ó &ldquo;Gníomh don Ghaeltacht&rdquo; ní raibh na moltaí mar sin.  Bhí sé i gceist i &ldquo;Gníomh don Gaeltacht&rdquo; go mbunófaí bord comharaíochta i ngach cúige agus go mbeadh triúr ar an údarás ó gach cúige.  Níl fhios agamsa cén fáth a rinne an tAire athrú ar na moltaí sin: beirt do Dhún na nGall, triúr do Ghaillimh, Mhaigh Eo agus Mí <Col N="112" /> le chéile, agus beirt do Chiarraí, Chorcaigh agus Port Láirge le chéile.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí mé ag féachaint ar an scéal sin ní raibh mé sásta, go háirithe maidir le Gaillimh, Maigh Eo agus Mí. Rinne mé tagairt cheana do na h-oileáin Ghaeltachta, go bhfuil fadhbanna ar leith ag baint leis na hoileáin amuigh ó chósta na hEireann.  Ach tá fadhbanna ar leith ag baint leis na Gaeltachtai beaga ar a dtugtar na cóilíneachtaí Ghaeltachta orthu.  Níl ciall ar bith, dar liom, na Gaeltachtaí i gContae na Mí, Baile Gib agus Rath Cairn, a chur isteach ins an toghachán chéanna le Gaillimh agus Maigh Eo, agus beidh Oileáin Árainn chomh maith ins an ceantar toghchán sin.  Beidh Gaillimh, na hOileáin Árainn, Maigh Eo agus Gaeltacht na Mí le chéile.  Rinne &ldquo;Ghníomh don Ghaeltacht&rdquo; moladh go mbeadh coiste ann le cabhrú chun comhoibriú agus comh-ordú a dhéanamh ar fhorbairt i ngach cúige, ach ní dóigh liomsa go bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Aire coiste mar sin a bhunú.</P>
    <P>Tá eagla mór ormsa, agus bhí i gconaí, maidir leis na Gaeltachtaí beaga, sé sin Gaeltacht Mhuscraí, Gaeltacht Phoirt Láirge agus Gaeltacht na Mí, cóilíneachtaí beaga Ghaeltachta go bhfuil fadhbanna an-mhór ann, ní amháin ó thaobh forbairt eacnamaíochta agus sóisialachta ach go háirithe maidir le forbairt cúltúrtha, fadhbanna an-mhór ar fad ó thaobh neartú na teanga i gcóilíneach beag, mar tá an Béarla ag brú ó gach taobh.  Tá na pressures an-mhór ar fad agus de bhrí sin tá géarghá le polasaí i leith na gcean-tar mbeag Ghaeltachta sin.  Tá súil agam nuair a bheidh an tAire ag ainmniú na comhaltaí don bhord, seachtar le togha agus seisir le ainmniú ag an Aire, go aithneófaí é seo&mdash;comhalta amháin ó Gaeltacht Mhuscraí, comhalta eile as Ghaeltacht Phoirt Láirge agus comhalta amháin as Ghaeltacht na Mí.  Chomh maith leis sin tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh ar tAire athsmaoineamh ar cheist na n-oileán Ghaeltachta, nó mar a tugtar orthu, oileáin gan fostaíocht, sé sin Oileáin Tóraí, Inis Bofinne agus Clonbur, na hOileáin Árainn agus Oileán Chléire.</P>
    <P>Bhí sé i gceist agamsa agus bhí mé ag <Col N="113" /> súil go mbéadh coiste nó comhairle ar leith ag muintir na n-oileán Ghaeltachta. Is cuimhin liom cúpla bliain ó shoin gur tháinig ionadaí ó gach oileán Ghaeltachta le chéile agus bhí comhairle na n-oileán acu agus phléamar an cheist sin maidir leis an údarás.  B'é mó thuairimse ag an am sin, agus sé mó thuairimse fós, go mba chóir ceantar toghacháin ar leith a thabhairt do na hoileáin Ghaeltachta ionas go mbeidh siad in ann a n-ionadaí a thoghadh agus a chur díreach ar an údarás.  Sé an fhadhb is mó maidir leis an toghachán, go háirithe ins an dara ceantar&mdash;sé sin na hOileáin Árainn, Gaillimh, Muigheo agus Mí&mdash;nach mbeidh seans ar bith ag Gaeltacht na Mí nó ag na hOileáin Árainn mar níl an líon daoine chomh mór ann is atá san mórthír, i nGaillimh agus Muigheo.  San chaoí a bhfuil sé ní bheidh ionadaí ar bith ar an údarás ag Gaeltacht na Mí nó na hOileáin Árainn. Dá bhrí sin nuair a thiocfaidh an tAire isteach sa Dáil leis an chéad Céim eile den Bhille tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh sé athsmaoineamh maidir leis na cóilíneachtaí Ghaeltachta agus na hoileáin Ghaeltachta.  B'fhéidir go mbeadh sé ar a chumas ionadaithe nua as na cóilíneachtaí Ghaeltachta i bPort Láirge agus i nGaeltacht na Mí a ainmniú. Go háirithe tá mé ag rá leis an Aire go mba chóir dó ceantar toghcháin ar leith a thabhairt do na hoileáin Ghaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá gluaiseacht na comharaíochta ag obair go han-mhaith ar feadh cúpla bliain.  Chuir sé áthas agus gliondar croí orm a léamh ins na nuachtáin inniu gur bhuaigh Oileán Inis Meáin an chéad duais Chomórtas Forbartha Pobal na Gaeltachta.  Cruthaíonn sé sin an deá-obair atá déanta ag muintir Inis Meáin agus muintir na n-oileán Ghaeltachta ar fad ar feadh cúpla bliain chun gluaiseacht na comharaíochta a chur chun cinn agus chun forbairt eacnamaíochta agus shóisialach a chur chun cinn.  Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go mbeadh deis ag muintir na n-oileán Gaeltachta faoin údarás nua leanúint ar aghaidh leis an deá-obair sin.</P>
    <P>Admhaím go bhfuil deacracht ann faoin toghchán.  Is é príomh-chuspóir an Bille ná go mbeidh toghchán.  Is cuimhin <Col N="114" /> liom go maith na blianta a bhí mise mar Aire na haragóintí agus na díospóireachtaí a bhíodh ar siúl faoin rud seo.  Bhí sé mar thuairim agam, agus tá sé fós, gurb é an rud is tábhachtaí maidir le forbairt na Gaeltachta go mbeadh seans ag muintir na Gaeltachta páirt iomlán a ghlacadh i bhforbairt a gceantar féin.  Dá bhrí sin, ó 1973 go 1977 rinneamar iarracht gluaiseacht na comharaíochta a chur chun cinn.  Bhí sin mar phríomh-aidhm agam agus tá toradh an pholasaí sin le feiceáil ar fud na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Rinne mé tagairt do na hoileáin Ghaeltachta.  Tá eolas maith agam faoin deá-obair a rinneadh ar feadh na blianta in Oileán Chléire agus Inis Meáin ina bhfuil tionscail nua a thosaigh mé nuair a bhí mé im Aire.  Tá tionscail nua in Inis Mór agus bhí socraithe déanta agus mé im Aire i dtaobh Inis hOir.  Chomh maith, bunaíodh tionscail in Árainn Mhór.  Cé go bhfuil tábhacht ar leith ag baint le tionscail mar sin chun fostaíocht a chur ar fáil, sé an rud is tábhachtaí maidir le forbairt na n-oileán sin go mbeadh páirt ag daoine na n-oileán san obair sin.  Ba é Comharchumann Inis Meáin a thosaigh an athbheochaint san oileán sin agus is comharchumann a rinne an obair chéanna in Oileán Chléire.</P>
    <P>Chomh fada agus is cuimhin liomsa, nuair a d'fág mise Roinn na Gaeltachta bhí comharchumainn ag cúig oileáin, agus níl an Aire anois ag tabhairt aon aitheantas, tré an toghchán atá beart-aithe aige, do mhuintir na n-oileán.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na cumhachtaí atá sa Bhille, i leathanach 2 dá ráiteas déanann an Aire tagairt do na cumhachtaí a bhéas ag an údarás agus deireann sé gur deacair cumhachtaí den chineál sin a shonrú go cruinn roimhré.  Sé alt 9 an t-alt is suimiúla sa Bhille.  Faoin alt sin is féidir na cúmhachtaí a thabhairt le hordú ón Rialtas.  Deireann an t-alt sin freisin go bhféadfar feidhmeanna aitiúla a thabhairt don údarás.  Beidh toghcháin áitiúla ar siúl an bhliain seo chugainn agus cén fáth, má tá sé ar intinn ag an Aire cumhachtaí áitiúla a thabhairt don Údarás, nach bhfuil sé i gceist aige é a dhéanamh anois roimh na toghcháin áitiúla?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> I want to make this point: looking back over the debates that have taken place on the Gaeltacht down the years since this Dáil was established, looking at the various reports, surveys, studies and so on that have been published, one must observe, first, that the future of the Gaeltacht, of our language, the preservation of our distinctive national identity and our rich cultural heritage are matters that should be of concern not merely to those fortunate enough to be able to speak the Irish language but also to every man, woman and child in the country.  I believe therefore that every effort should be made to try to get across bilingually to the people the place of the Gaeltacht in the life of the nation, its role in the national life and its future role particularly in the development of our country.</P>
    <P>It was my experience while I was Minister that the vast majority of our people, irrespective of whether they can speak the language or not, are interested in the welfare of the Gaeltacht people. From the very detailed scientific report known as the &ldquo;Language Attitude Survey&rdquo; carried out some years ago by international experts into the attitude of Irish people towards their language, their culture and their Gaeltacht, three things in particular emerged.  The first was that the vast majority of the Irish people support policies for promoting our language, because it is an integral part of our national cultural heritage, a key part among all the components making up our national identity.  I think it was 80 per cent who supported that view.  An overwhelming majority rejected compulsory methods of language revival.  A third one, which is very relevant to this Bill and which should encourage the Minister very greatly, is that an overwhelming majority of the people support policies for the economic and social development of the Gaeltacht.  The economic and social development of the Gaeltacht has wide support transcending petty party politics, transcending political ideologies or otherwise.  The development of the Gaeltacht should be <Col N="116" /> looked at in a very serious manner.</P>
    <P>During the four years I had the privilege of being Minister for the Gaeltacht I tried to approach the whole question of the revival of our language and the development of the Gaeltacht on a non-party political basis, because I am convinced that one thing more than any other which has bedevilled the language revival movement and has directly and indirectly hampered the proper development of our Gaeltacht regions is the fact that the language and the Gaeltacht were identified in the minds of people with some kind of ultra-nationalism, by implication, were identified with one particular political party.  There have been attempts in recent times by certain &ldquo;ginger&rdquo; groups to abrogate unto themselves the right to put themselves forward as the sole custodians of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Since I went out of office I have had the opportunity of doing a bit of research on this matter, because it is very relevant to where we are going in relation to the language and the Gaeltacht.  The impression has been created, particularly by the Minister's party, that they and they alone are the only party in the State who have any commitment to the revival of our language and to the development of the Gaeltacht.  I want to avail myself of the opportunity of this debate to try to introduce a note of reality into this question of our language and the Gaeltacht. If we do not make it possible by every means in our power for the maximum number of native Irish speakers to live in their own regions in the Gaeltacht the Gaeltacht will die.  If that happens the language will die.  No person and no party in the country have a right to say that they alone are the only party who have a special commitment to the Irish language and to the Gaeltacht.  This has happened.  It is my opinion that it has been the greatest impediment to creating among our people of all shades of opinion, creed and class a basic love for our language because it is an integral part of our heritage and of our national identity.</P>
    <P>We will find, if we look at the record, that before the Minister's party came into the House in the very early years of the State, when there were very difficult <Col N="117" /> times and many problems confronting the Government at that time, the President of the Executive Council, the late W. T. Cosgrave, set up in 1925 Coimisiún na Gaeltachta under the chairmanship of the late General Richard Mulcahy.  That commission travelled extensively throughout the Gaeltacht regions from Donegal to Cork.  They met people on the spot and took copious evidence.  In 1973 I had the privilege of being appointed Minister for the Gaeltacht and I spent almost the first year in office visiting the Gaeltacht areas meeting the people and taking evidence from them.  I found that in 1973 and 1974 the people of the Gaeltacht were telling me almost exactly the same as they told Coimisiún na Gaeltachta in 1925, 50 years earlier.  This does not reflect the problems of Gaeltacht development, economic and social problems, cultural problems, the emigration problem, trying to preserve the language against the pressures of modern life, the media, mass communications and so forth.  All those problems were spelled out very dramatically to the commission in 1926 the same way as they were spelt out to me almost 50 years later.  This does not reflect any great credit on any Government or on any party in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I have detected in recent times an attempt to try and create the impression abroad that the Fianna Fáil Party are the only party in the State who are committed to the Irish language.  I am proud of the fact that our predecessors in this party, the great men who went before us, like the late W.T. Cosgrave and General Richard Mulcahy, thought, as early as 1925, that it was of sufficient importance that a proper Gaeltacht policy should be formulated and implemented. I can go further and say that between 1926 and 1956 the only major step of any significance towards Gaeltacht development was the establishment of Roinn na Gaeltachta in 1956.  The Minister responsible for introducing the Bill setting up Roinn na Gaeltachta was the late General Richard Mulcahy who 30 years earlier was chairman of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> For the greater part of that period between 1926 and 1956 the Minister's party were in power.  I feel it important to defend my party's stand in relation to the language and to the Gaeltacht and to say that it is my conviction, which I tried to give expression to during my period as Minister for the Gaeltacht, that all parties in the House are equally concerned and equally committed to the preservation of our language and to the economic and social development of the Gaeltacht.  I noticed as late as last night on a certain programme on RTE a certain gentleman, who received substantial assistance from the Department of the Gaeltacht when I was Minister, again conveyed this impression.  I will not spell out what he said.  He received assistance beyond what he was probably entitled to and therefore availed of the opportunity to implement a programme to enunciate a certain political ideology conveying the impression that only one party, only one Government, have ever been concerned about the Gaeltacht or the Irish language.  The policy being preached last night brought this whole thing into mind, and if this type of thing goes on it will not facilitate or encourage everybody to take an interest in the Gaeltacht.  We must remember that the development of the Gaeltacht depends on the support of all people.  The financing of Údarás na Gaeltachta will be done by the taxpayer and even to put it on its lowest denominator, a purely material denominator, it is only right that everybody should have an interest in the future of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Gaeltacht I spent a lot of time trying to overcome problems which I am sure the present Minister has been confronted with.  One of the problems was to bring in a Gaeltacht authority which would <i>de facto</i> be a meaningful authority with the necessary powers to accelerate the economic, social and cultural development of the Gaeltacht.  The Minister has probably met with some of the problems I was confronted with, such as other Departments not wanting to give away any power, and so on.  The Minister said that it could well be that some day Údarás na Gaeltachta will have the <Col N="119" /> powers of a local authority.  The Minister knows as well as I that if we were going to give this type of power to the new authority he would have done so in this Bill.  What I am really concerned about is that this authority has no particular relevance nor is what the Minister is doing here a major step forward.  I am concerned to ensure that the fantastic community development movement that was in the Gaeltacht before I took office, which I did my best to promote by means of generous assistance to the co-operatives and to the community development competition of the Gaeltacht, will be enabled to continue to work.  There is nothing in this Bill, and I have searched it from top to bottom, to convince me that this work will continue. I would have been satisfied if the Minister had only said that it would be a major aim of his policy to encourage the co-operative movement and community development in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Another defect in the Bill is that there is no indication as to what functions if any are being transferred from Roinn na Gaeltachta to the new authority.  There is an enormous problem in relation to the division of functions and responsibility between Roinn na Gaeltachta on the one hand and Gaeltarra Éireann or Údarás na Gaeltachta on the other.</P>
    <P>Cuir i gcás, tá Scéim na gComharchumann ann.  Bhí an scéim sin faoi chúram Roinn na Gaeltachta agus tá na comharchumainn ag fáil tacaíocht ó Roinn na Gaeltachta faoi scéimeanna áirithe ar an lámh amháin, agus ar an taobh eile ó Ghaeltarra Éireann i dtaobh scéimeanna eile.  Tá a lán deacrachtaí ag baint le scéimeanna mar sin, agus sílim gur chóir go mbeadh cúram na gcomharchumann faoin údarás nua seo ionas nach mbeadh aon bhaint acu leis an Roinn go díreach&mdash;ionas go mbeadh na comharchumainn in ann pleananna a phlé le húdarás amháin seachas bheith ag dul go Gaeltarra Eireann lá amháin agus ag teacht go Baile Átha Cliath lá eile chun buaileadh le Roinn na Gaeltachta. Sin é ceann de na fadhbanna, mar a fheicimse an scéal anois.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest difficulties I see in relation to understanding what the <Col N="120" /> Minister has in mind in this Bill is the fact that there is this division of responsibilities which makes it very difficult for the co-operatives particularly.  Irrespective of what authority is set up and irrespective of what the Minister does or does not do, the future of the Gaeltacht depends on the development of community co-operation there, the encouragement of people to play their part and to put their hands into their pockets to contribute in some degree to the development of their localities through economic programmes, social programmes, cultural programmes and so on.  I am convinced that the co-operative movement is based on the concept of community development which was preached throughout the length and breadth of the land 40 years ago by that great apostle of rural Ireland, the late Canon Hayes who founded Muintir na Tíre.  It was because the co-operative movement and local community co-operatives had given adequate proof of their capacity virtually to transform their own locality that we decided in 1974 to introduce the comórtas pobail na Gaeltachta, the community development competition.  This has been a fantastically successful scheme for a number of reasons.  The communities which have won the award, which is now in the fifth and final year of its first phase, have shown absolutely fantastic results.</P>
    <P>Is cuimhin liom go maith bheith i dTír Chonail cúpla bliain ó shin.  San lá atá inniu ann níl aon scoil iar-bhunoideachais Ghaeilge ins an cheantair mór sin.  Ait ina bhfuil an teanga beo, ina bhfuil an spoid ceart ann, tá na páistí ag dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht gach lá chun bunoideachas a fháil.  As a result of the community development competition a fascinating new spirit arose in the Gaeltacht in Tir Chonaill and in 1976 or 1977 they won first place in the com-munity development competition.</P>
    <P>Rachaimíd síos go dtí ceantair na n-oileán i gConamara, Leitir Móir, Leitir Mealláin, Gorumna, Tír an Fhia.  O bunaíodh an Stáit ní raibh faic ar bith déanta ann chun fostaíocht a chur ar fáil do na daoine óga, chun caighdeán maith maireachtála a thabhairt do na daoine <Col N="121" /> go dtí gur bunaíodh comharchumann amháin cúpla bliain ó shin.  Is cuma cén taobh den Teach seo ina bhfuilimíd inár suí, tugann sé áthas agus gliondar croí dúinn dul go dtí ceantar Dúiche Sheoigeach agus ceantar na n-oileán agus an sprid atá le feiceáil ann.  Tá comharchumann eile ar fud na Gaeltachta chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Táim ag rá leis an Aire gurb é mo thuairim&mdash;ní tuairim polaitíochta é ar chor ar bith&mdash;maidir le gluaiseacht na comharaíochta, gluaiseacht forbartha pobal, nó community development, go mba cheart gluaiseacht na comharaíochta agus bunú comharchumainn bheith mar príomh-aidhm ag an údarás nua.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the future of the Gaeltacht and, as Canon Hayes said 40 years ago, of many rural parishes, whether they are Gaeltacht or Galltacht, depends on the development of community co-operation.  Father McDyer has proved this beyond yea or nay in Glencolumcille.  It was my ambition, and I hope the Minister has a similar ambition, to see a Glencolumcille in every Gaeltacht parish.  If they can make a success of such ventures in Glencolumcille I do not see why the same cannot be done in other parts of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I do not see what benefit this Bill will be to the many community leaders in Gaeltacht areas who are doing wonderful work in promoting the economic, social and cultural development of their areas.  I do not see how this will help Éamon Ó Caoimh i gceantar Dúiche Sheoigeach, Pól Ó Foighil, nó Mícheál Mac Giobúin, an tAth Mac Duibhir, nó éinne eile, chun an obair a chur chun cinn.  Níl fhios agam an mbeidh Scéim na gComharchumann faoi chúram Roinn na Gaeltachta nó Údarás na Gaeltachta thiar i nGaillimh.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile chomh maith atá anthábhachtach. Ins an tuarascáil sin, um Thaighde ar Leas an Phobail, rinneadh tagairt do na Breac-Ghaeltachtaí.  Is cuimhin liom go maith nuair a bhí mise im Aire na Gaeltachta go raibh daoine á rá nach raibh sé ceart aon ghuth a thabhairt i dtoghchán Ghaeltachta do dhaoine taobh amuigh de na fíor-Ghaeltachtaí. Bhí daoine ann, go <Col N="122" /> háirithe ionadaí Chonradh na Gaeilge, nach raibh sásta vóta ar bith a thabhairt do éinne i nGaeltacht Mhaigh Eo.  Tá áthas orm anois go bhfuil an tAire ag seasamh mar sheas mise agus nach n-aithníonn sé ach Gaeltacht amháin, sé sin an Ghaeltacht oifigiúil atá leagtha síos faoi Achtanna an Oireachtais; ach mar sin féin, tá tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis na breac-Ghaeltachtaí agus na cean-tair ar imeall na Gaeltachtaí' ó thaobh na teanga agus forbairt eacnamaíochta.</P>
    <P>These are vitally important and crucial areas to the future of the Gaeltacht.  Some years ago we had people shouting that we should draw another line around the Gaeltacht and just have the Fíor-Ghaeltachtaí there.  It is important that every effort be made to strengthen the language in what are colloquially termed the Breac-Ghaeltachtaí. In those areas the people know the language but do not speak it.  By taking special measures in those areas we would be adopting the quickest way of extending the use of our national language.  Such measures are also essential from an economic point of view.  The Gaeltacht areas are small and scattered and in many cases are isolated units often on the fringe of large towns where the language is not spoken.  Efforts should be made to revive the language in such Breac-Ghaeltachtaí areas.</P>
    <P>I recall the first year of the awards for community development and the presentation which was made in a Dublin hotel. On that occasion Ardara won first prize and I was heckled and severely criticised, as were Gaeltarra Éireann, for daring to recognise Ardara as a Gaeltacht area, because half of that parish is in the Gaeltacht and the other half outside.  That is the great tragedy of the whole thing.  I found the same thing in Ring where half the parish was in the Gaeltacht and the Seana Pobal was outside. I felt it was only logical to try to unify the parish unit there and we recognised the Seana Pobal as a Gaeltacht area.  It is just as important to try to strengthen the language in the Breac-Ghaeltachtaí as it is in the Fíor-Ghaeltachtaí. The two run parallel.  I do not agree with the people who maintain that we should build a wall around the <Col N="123" /> Gaeltacht.  Our aim should be to extend the influence of the Gaeltacht outside the present boundaries.</P>
    <P>The Minister is confronted with a problem in his county.  Tá a pharóiste féin ag Oileán Acla, cuid den oileán sa Ghaeltacht agus cuid eile taobh amuigh. Tá sé an-deachair ar fad.  I recognise the difficulty of trying to implement a proper comprehensive development programme for a place like Achill.  The Minister is impeded greatly by the situation that ex-ists there.  There must be greater co-operation in the case of such places. That area is a classical example of the problems a Minister for the Gaeltacht is confronted with, where part of the area is inside the Gaeltacht and the other part outside.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating irresponsible extension of Gaeltacht boundaries or giving recognition to areas not entitled to it. I am in favour of encouraging the areas where people still have the language but do not speak it.  Therefore the only answer to a problem like that of Achill&mdash;the same problem will be encountered in other areas also; it is the same in practically all of the Gaeltacht areas, in parishes on the fringe of the Gaeltacht&mdash;is that there be greater coordination between the Gaeltacht Authority and the agencies responsible for development in Galltacht areas.  In other words, to undertake a development programme for Achill one would have to enlist the IDA, Bord Fáilte, the county development teams and the relevant agencies responsible for development in the Galltacht areas to work side by side with Roinn na Gaeltachta and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Special measures should be taken to tackle this problem of encouraging people in the breac-Ghaeltachtaí to improve their knowledge of the language to the point where they can be validly and rightly recognised as official Gaeltachtaí. Since Roinn na Gaeltachta were established recognition has been given to very few areas only such as Baile Gib agus Rath Cairn.  Thug an Teachta Faulkner aitheantas do siúd agus do thug mise aitheantas do Shean Phobal i gContae Phort Láirge agus do cheantar <Col N="124" /> Clochán Braonaigh i gContae Chiarraí. I am not saying at all that we should create mock Gaeltachtaí.  The ideal situation is to be found at Ardara, of which I was always hopeful during my term of office.  I notice that Ardara has figured again in the community development awards this year.  I am hopeful that the situation might develop to the extent that the whole parish of Ardara could be validly and legally recognised as a Gaeltacht, that nobody could point a finger to the Minister and say that this was a mock-up job, done for political reasons or something else.</P>
    <P>I recommend very sincerely to the Minister the importance of community development and of a co-operative movement in the Gaeltacht.  Further I recommend very strongly that special attention be paid to the Breac-Ghaeltachtaí, na ceantair ar imeall na Gaeltachtaí.  The term &ldquo;Breac-Ghaeltachtaí&rdquo; has no official designa-tion. As was often pointed out to me during my period in office, it is a misnomer. There is only the official Gaeltacht and the Galltacht.  What we mean by the breac-Ghaeltachtaí are areas such as part of Ardara.</P>
    <P>What saddened me most during my period as Minister&mdash;and I am sure the present Minister will agree with me in this&mdash;was to go down to a place like Doonbeg in west Clare, or Kilbaha or Carrigaholt and find there old people who can speak Irish still but the language gone completely otherwise. Here was evidence of that wonderful Gaelic tradition on that west Clare coast which, unfortunately, has been allowed to die except among a few old people one might meet there and whom I had the pleasure of meeting.  However, the Gaelic tradition is still alive there through the media of traditional Irish music, dancing and so on.  But what a great tragedy it is that this deteriorating position was allowed to develop.</P>
    <P>There is another area also I want to draw particularly to the Minister's attention, that is Baile Mhic Oda, Gort Rua and Cilla i gContae Corcaí.  A lot of things have been said about the revival movement going on there.  Deputy Hegarty spoke of it here earlier today. <Col N="125" /> The situation there is another classical example like that of Ardara, where the potential exists for doing great things for the language and the Gaeltacht.  In 1973 or 1974, when it was first brought to my attention, I was amazed at the number of old people there, and indeed quite a lot of young people, who were quite fluent in the Irish language.  A revival movement was initiated under the auspices of Conradh na Gaeilge and Ceantar Youghal.</P>
    <P>Following Youghal winning the Glór na nGael competition a strong desire emerged that a special effort be made to restore this wonderfully historic district of Baile Mhic Óda, Gort Rua, Cilla, on the fringe of Youghal to its former status as an Irish-speaking region.  I said &ldquo;Fine, I think this a wonderful thing.&rdquo;  I believe it is the duty of the Minister, the Department of the Gaeltacht and indeed of the Department of Education, who were involved at the time&mdash;they were about to close a school at Cilla&mdash;to encourage the people in this.  But the many misinterpretations, misunderstandings, the flak that was thrown by certain fior Ghaeilgeoírí organisations, mostly Dublin-based, were unbelievable.  It would make anybody become disillusioned and despondent about the future of our language.  These were people who had come together, had organised winter classes, had held cultural functions throughout the summer months.  The local teachers were making their services available free of charge.  I used to make a point of visiting that area once or twice a year and it was fascinating to see the progress made between each visit.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will examine this very carefully.  I am endeavouring to help the Minister in this without being at all critical.  Whatever experience I acquired during the four years I had the privilege of being Minister, or whatever mistakes I may have made, I feel I should speak and go on record with a view to helping the present Minister.  At that time we resisted pressures to declare that area an official Gaeltacht before the people were ready or before they were entitled to that recognition.  I found&mdash;and I am sure the present <Col N="126" /> Minister finds this also&mdash;that when one visits a Gaeltacht area invariably one meets a deputation from a parish just beyond the boundary of that Gaeltacht. They see good development work going on inside the Gaeltacht area and they want to know why the same thing cannot be done outside the Gaeltacht.  They think that if they could get recognition as an official Gaeltacht they would be entitled to all the grants.</P>
    <P>That is something that must be resisted.  In the case of areas like Baile Mhic Óda, Gort Rua, and Cilla, in my time in the Department we carried out surveys when there was undoubtedly clear evidence of substantial progress having been made in improving knowledge of the language, spreading the spoken language there and so on. Therefore I would ask the Minister to look at this area.  I hope he will nurse it along in the way I tried to do when I was Minister.  I am convinced that, if this effort is continued, the Minister some day will be able to declare Baile Mhic Óda and that area a Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill I understand that Gaeltarra Éireann are to be abolished.  I want to put on record my view of the role that Gaeltarra Éireann have played in the development of the Gaeltacht.  My interpretation of this Bill is that <i>de facto</i> what the Minister is doing in this Bill could be done by way of an amendment to the section in the Gaeltacht Act which deals with the appointment of members to the board of Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of criticism from time to time about Gaeltarra Éireann. They were given a job to do which was far more difficult and complicated than the tasks given to any other of the bodies set up in the history of this State.  What have they and the údarás been asked to do?  Gaeltarra Éireann were asked to promote economic development, create and establish industry and generate jobs in the most remote and isolated and least developed of any peripheral regions in western Europe.  They may have made mistakes, as everyone does from time to time, but I am satisfied that they have tackled this problem and discharged their duties on the overall balance, and graphs will show a continuous steady increase <Col N="127" /> in the numbers employed in the Gaeltacht every year.  That is no small achievement.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago I brought an official of the EEC who was at commissioner level on a tour of the Gaeltacht. We were driving through a remote part of Connemara past mountains, rocks and so forth.  We came suddenly upon a place which I wanted to identify.  There was a new factory building, a new industry having being established there.  I said to the driver, &ldquo;Please slow down&rdquo;. The EEC official said, &ldquo;How in God's name did Gaeltarra Éireann succeed in establishing an industry in this remote corner?&rdquo;  Those who criticise Gaeltarra Éireann and who question their efficiency and effectiveness forget that to establish an industry in the Gaeltacht more often than not means literally hewing a site out of rock or laying a foundation on a bog, using access roads not fit to carry heavy traffic, water and power having to be brought in, and there are enormous problems.  I have said to Gaeltarra Éireann, &ldquo;If you continue to make progress and are sure at the end of the year that you can show a reasonable increase in the number of people employed in the Gaeltacht, I will overlook a lot of other things&rdquo;.  That was my attitude.  Even during the economic recession when industries were folding up all over the country and there was a huge increase in unemployment the graph still continued to go up consistently with more numbers employed.  I do not want to talk about this in any egotistical fashion, but their performance was very impressive, taking into account the magnitude of the job they had to do.</P>
    <P>Due to a change in the Government's industrial development strategy it now appears that the same level of grants basically are being offered all over the country and, <i>de facto</i>, an industrialist can locate in Dublin city and get much the same level of grants as he would get in Belmullet or Tourmakeady or even in the Aran Islands.  There might be marginal differences, but the differentials which traditionally existed in relation to industrial grants favoured the Gaeltacht regions.  How can you persuade an industrialist <Col N="128" /> to go to the Gaeltacht areas unless some special incentive is given to him to go there?  The Minister should look at this very carefully.  There is no reference here to the level of grants.  Just before I left office Gaeltarra Éireann were becoming very concerned about the lack of flexibility in their range of grants.  I cannot remember the details now, but what was valid then is no longer valid because it is necessary still to maintain a reasonable and maybe substantial differential in the level of grants in favour of the Gaeltacht areas. There is justification for this, particularly as the Gaeltacht people themselves through co-operatives are tending to establish industry there.  This is the ideal that should be aimed at.  A local community co-operative should have responsibility for every aspect of development in their area, economic, social, cultural, industrial, job creation, water supply&mdash;you name it; it has been done in certain areas very effectively over recent years.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I am satisfied that Gaeltarra Éireann have done an ex-cellent job.  Occasionally there is ill-informed criticism of their work.  One cannot measure the contribution of a semi-State body like Gaeltarra Éireann, charged as they are with very specific responsibility and having a mandate which imposes major responsibility of a cultural nature on them.  On promotion tours abroad I have met people of other countries and I have met people from other countries here who have said, &ldquo;You cannot do this.  You cannot promote economic development and at the same time have responsibility for cultural development&rdquo;.  Other State agencies abroad&mdash;and I am thinking particularly of the Highlands and Islands Development Board in Scotland with whom I became very familiar and who were most helpful and co-operative with us in every way&mdash;have no cultural responsibility.  That argument has been put forward time and time again on two bases.  One is that you will kill the Gaeltacht with building factories and economic development of all kinds; the other is that an agency with economic development responsibility cannot effec-tively discharge that responsibility if <Col N="129" /> they have a cultural dimension in their responsibility as well.  Of course the Minister has met this argument also from tourists.</P>
    <P>Gaeltarra Éireann in the main have proved that it is possible to have economic development and provide a decent standard of living for the people side by side with cultural development. The Minister will agree that we will have no Gaeltacht if we do not keep the people there.  Without the Gaeltacht the future of the language is very dark.  If we are to keep the maximum number of people in the Gaeltacht areas we must create employment opportunities and stem the awful haemorrhage of emigration which has bled these regions of the cream of their young people.  How can we expect the young people in the Gaeltacht areas to stay there if we do not provide employment for them?  The job the new údarás have to do is to provide employment opportunities of a range and a variety which will satisfy the aspirations of the young people in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister saw the report of a survey carried out in 1974-75.  It was an EEC assisted survey into the job aspirations of young people attending post-primary schools in the Gaeltacht at that time.  I was shocked into reality by one of the findings in that report.  It was that a small number of those young people in the junior and senior post-primary schools&mdash;8 per cent&mdash;gave as their first choice a job on a factory floor.  Most of them opted for traditional jobs such as teaching, nursing and so on.</P>
    <P>We must create job opportunities and provide the same standard of living in the remote off-shore Gaeltacht islands for the young people as they can find here or abroad.  This is a difficult thing to achieve and I want to pay a sincere tribute to Gaeltarra Éireann, who are now being abolished.  If I wanted to be nasty and political I would say their name has been changed, as some outside commentators have said.  I pay tribute to the board and staff of Gaeltarra Éireann for their dedication to the difficult assignment of creating employment in areas which are, by their nature, least <Col N="130" /> suited to development.  The new Udarás na Gaeltachta will have 13 members compared with seven at present.  I am not too worried about the numbers but I would have increased it to 20.  The important thing is that the electoral system has now been established and I have expressed my views on it.  I have asked the Minister to look at the Gaeltacht islands and the small Gaeltacht colonies in Meath, Waterford and Cork.  I have a few suggestions to make to the Minister in relation to the people that he is going to appoint.  Deirtear go mbeidh 25 ag teacht díreach ag an Aire.  The Minister has a number of options open to him in relation to this matter.  In view of the fact that small Gaeltacht areas such as Meath, Waterford and Cork are being put in with larger areas and there appears to be no provision for the coiste mar a bhí san tuarascáil &ldquo;Gníomh don Ghaeltacht&rdquo;, he should nominate to the údarás representatives from Meath, Waterford and the Gaeltacht Muskerry in Contae Corcaigh.  He should also rethink the question of the seven off-shore Gaeltacht islands.  They should have a special election area of their own and should be entitled to elect their representatives to the board of the údarás.</P>
    <P>As I saw it, the big problem in relation to Gaeltacht development was duplication between Roinn na Gaeltachta and Gaeltarra Éireann.  Certain schemes are administered by Roinn na Gaeltachta and certain schemes are administered by Gaeltarra Éireann.  The unfortunate coops in the Gaeltacht have to go from one to the other and it is very hard to formulate a cohesive programme.  What is important is the question of coordination and development.  Will the údarás have cumhacht chun chomhordú a dhéanamh idir Aire Stáit agus na cumhachtaí Stáit agus an Rialtas?</P>

      <P>Deputy Horgan has received permission to raise on the Adjournment the decision of the Minister for Education to certify the <Col N="131" /> school at Loughan House under section 45 of the Children Act, 1908.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the chair for permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I am particularly grateful for the opportunity to raise it now because I have been attempting for quite some time, without success, to find out the extent to which the Minister for Education and his Department have been involved in the preparation and in the oversight of the establishment known as Loughan House.  The Minister is rarely backward in coming forward with information when he believes it to be to his own advantage and there has been something strange, to say the least, about his silence to date on this matter. The certification of Loughan House, as I hope to argue, gives him a major role and poses a number of important questions which I should like answered.  The notice that I refer to appeared in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on Friday, 13 October 1978 and was as follows:</P>
      <P>Certification of School under Section 45 (2) of the Children Act, 1908.</P>
      <P>I, John P. Wilson, Minister for Education, under and in accordance with the provisions of Section 45 of the Children Act, 1908, and any and every other power me to enabling, do hereby certify that the school for the industrial training of youthful offenders in which youthful offenders are lodged, clothed and fed, as well as taught, known as Loughan House, and situated at Loughan in the County of Cavan, is fit for the reception of youthful offenders sent there in pursuance of Part IV of the Children Act, 1908.</P>
      <P Just="Right">Given under my official Seal this 4th day of October, 1978,</P>
      <P Just="Right">John P. Wilson,</P>
      <P Just="Right">Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The administrative consequences of this certification are very substantial and I hope to pose a number of concrete questions to the Minister.  I accept fully that <Col N="132" /> he may not be able to answer some of them immediately.  I accept also that he may not have all the information immediately at his disposal and I should like to signify to him that I would be perfectly willing to accept from his Department in letter form at a later stage the answers to specific questions for which he may not have the information available immediately.</P>
    <P>I shall refer to section 45 of the Children Act, 1908.  In passing, I would add that it is nothing short of extraordinary that we should be dealing with an Act that is half a century old and which is long overdue for revision.  The section states:</P>
    <P>(1)  The Secretary of State may upon the application of the managers of any reformatory or industrial school direct the chief inspector of reformatory and industrial schools hereinafter mentioned to examine into the condition and regulations of the school and its fitness for the reception of youthful offenders or children to be sent there under this Part of this Act, and to report to him thereon.</P>
    <P>(2) The Secretary of State, if satisfied with the report of the inspector, may certify that the school is fit for the reception of youthful offenders or children to be sent there in pursuance of this Part of this Act.</P>
    <P>One point that immediately occurs is that under another section of the same Act it is laid down that the minimum period for which any child or young person may be committed to such a school is two years, despite the recommendation in the Kennedy Report which suggested that the two-year period should be made a more flexible one.</P>
    <P>The first question I should like to ask the Minister is, have the premises at Loughan House been inspected by his chief inspector?  When did the inspection take place and when did the Minister decide on the basis of the report that the premises were suitable?  I should also be interested to know what comparative standards were adopted by the inspector. We are dealing here with the first secure unit in this State and I hope that the Minister will be able to tell me that <Col N="133" /> the standards the inspector found at Loughan House were, at the very least, the equivalent of standards to be found in a comparable institution in any neighbouring country.</P>
    <P>The certification by the Minister is one of his functions under the various Acts dealing with children which started in 1908 and which go on at least as far as 1957.  In particular, I would point to some of those functions as described in Appendix A of the Kennedy Report. Regulation Number 5 points out that the functions of the Minister include:</P>
    <P>Making of regulations for the conduct of certified schools, in particular regulations making provision in relation to the education and training to be given to children there and the safeguarding of their health.  These regulations may be framed so as to apply to one or more certified schools or any class or classes of schools.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if such regulations have been made in regard to Loughan House and, if so, is the Minister prepared to make available in the Library a copy of the regulations. Number 11 of Appendix A points out that the functions of the Minister under the Children Act, 1908 include:</P>
    <P>Transfer of a child from one Industrial School to another, or from a Reformatory to an Industrial School or from an Industrial to a Reformatory School.</P>
    <P>Does this mean that a child or young person may be transferred to Loughan House from another institution without coming before the courts simply by order of the Department of Education?  I should also like to refer the Minister to Appendix L of the Kennedy Report which is a transcript of the certificate of approval of an industrial school which was originally issued by the Chief Secretary of State but which is now issued by the Minister for Education or a duly authorised officer of his Department. There are particular aspects of the rules and regulations for the certified industrial schools on which I should like to ask some specific questions.  The rules and regulations read:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> 1.  Name and Object of School. Date of Certificate.  Number for which Certified.&mdash;Accommodation is provided in this School for only ... children.  This number shall not be exceeded at any one time.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us the number of children for whom Loughan House has been certified and can we have an assurance that this number will not be exceeded at any one time?</P>
    <P>On the question of education, a number of provisions in these regulations have been made by the Minister for Education as a result of certification, in particular, numbers 7, 8 and 9.  Some of them have a rather charming period flavour.  For example, one provision states that the training of girls&mdash;this is not in question at Loughan House&mdash;&ldquo;shall in all cases be in accordance with the Domestic Economy Syllabus, and shall also include, where practicable, the milking of cows&rdquo;.  This dates the regulations somewhat and I wonder if the Minister has thought of updating them.</P>
    <P>On the education side I should like to ask him the extent to which the educational provision in Loughan House matches or exceeds the minimum laid down in numbers 7, 8 and 9 of the regulations.  In particular I should like to know if there is any provision for the continuance of the educational service in that establishment at times outside the normal school term.</P>
    <P>Number 10 states:</P>
    <P>The progress of the children in the Literary Classes of the Schools and their proficiency in Industrial Training will be tested from time to time by Examination and Inspection.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister state what arrangements he is making for examinations and inspections in accordance with those rules?  Regulation No. 12 refers to discipline and here I must draw the attention of the House to the fact that when I put down a question to the Minister for Education asking if corporal punishment would be permitted in Loughan House the question was transferred to the Minister for Justice who answered &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I was delighted to hear that but I <Col N="135" /> find it strange that the question should have been answered by the Minister for Justice because Regulation No. 12 states:</P>
    <P>The Manager or his Deputy shall be authorised to punish the children detained in the School in case of misconduct.</P>
    <P>My plain reading of that section is that authorisation is given by the Department of Education and that, consequently, they have the right to refuse to authorise any scheme of discipline with which they do not agree.  I urge the Minister for Education to extend the logic of the situation at Loughan House to other industrial and reformatory schools and, indeed, to the education system as a whole.</P>
    <P>In relation to these rules I would ask him to address himself to rule 26 and to give the House, if possible, the benefit of his view in that regard and to tell us what is this rule's possible effect in relation to Loughan House.  Regulation 26 suggests that:</P>
    <P>In order to ensure a strict and effectual observance of the provisions of the 66th Section of the Children Act of 1908, in every case in which a child shall be ordered to be detained in a School managed by persons of a different religious persuasion from that professed by the parents, or surviving parent, or (should that be unknown), by the guardians or guardian of such child ... the Manager or teachers of such School shall ... give notice in writing, without delay, to the Inspector who will thereupon immediately take any necessary steps in the matter.</P>
    <P>That section was headed &ldquo;Child not Professing Religious Persuasion of the Manager to be Removed from the School&rdquo;.  In the event of such a situation arising, where is the child concerned to go?  This is a very concrete point on which I should like the benefit of the Minister's experience.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister already what will be the situation in relation to the educational provision outside the <Col N="136" /> normal term time but there are two other questions also.  One relates to the training of the non-academic teaching staff in the institution, a matter in which apparently the Minister has some role also and the other question relates to finance. The principal of Aycliffe School which is a secure unit in Britain, in an excellent article in the <i>Children First Newsletter</i> for summer and autumn 1978 goes into considerable detail about the critical importance of the training of staff of secure establishments.  He says, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The crucial prerequisite is the selection of the staff to ensure that they have the necessary characteristics of intelligence, compassion, maturity, tolerance, durability sensitivity and self-criticalness.  Appropriate training would help to shape these.  In the context of a publicly demonstrable empirical and operational model, these characteristics may then ensure that the children do not become the vehicles and the victims of staff defects.</P>
    <P>Part of the rationale for the opening of Loughan House was that special attention would be given to the recruitment and training of staff other than the academic staff and that a 12-week course would be provided at the Sligo Regional Technical College which, indirectly, is under the control of the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us first whether he believes that 12-weeks is long enough and also whether he is satisfied with the method of recruitment of additional staff.  If these are to be part of a correctional institution with an academic background should not the Department of Education be involved more directly in the recruitment rather than simply having to train those recruited by the Department of Justice? Also, I should like to hear how the Minister proposes to rationalise the apparently widely differing provisions for the training of staff that exist at the moment. So far as I know there is, in addition to the proposed course at the Sligo Regional Technical College, a course in the School of Education at Kilkenny, which is also in receipt of public funds through the Department of Education. <Col N="137" /> That is a good course.  In addition there is a course at Cathal Brugha Street which is within the sphere of the City of Dublin VEC and which I understand is seriously in need of funding.  Is the Minister prepared to think in terms of rationalising the situation and putting whatever scant resources are at his disposal to something worthwhile which will last for longer and which will be for the benefit of people who hopefully he, rather than the Department of Justice, will have chosen?</P>
    <P>My final question concerns a matter that is referred to at page 84 of the Kennedy Report, where the section relating to the function of the Minister suggests that:</P>
    <P>they include, subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance, fixing the amount of direct Government contribution towards the maintenance and education of children detained in these schools and with the consent also of the Minister for Local Government fixing the amounts payable by local authorities for children for whom they are liable.</P>
    <P>What, then, are the financial implications for the Minister for Education in respect of his certification of this school? Will he be in a position of having to pay for a very vital and controversial establishment over which not he, but the Department of Justice, will have effective control and if that is the situation, should it not be changed also?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Tunney) Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Tunney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity of placing before the House information which will be by way of reply to the questions raised by Deputy Horgan.  This information will deal in general with accommodation, with the history of the situation and with the circumstances leading to the opening of Loughan House.  It will treat also of the question of the suitability of the educational programme which is being provided for those children who will be in temporary residence at that establishment for the coming two years or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements for the certification and management of what are known <Col N="138" /> legally as reformatory schools are laid down in the Children Acts, 1908 to 1957.  Under these Acts a reformatory school is defined as a school for the industrial training of youthful offenders, in which youthful offenders are lodged, clothed and fed as well as taught.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the 1908 Act prescribes that the persons for the time being having the management or control of the school shall be deemed the managers thereof for the purpose of the Act.</P>
    <P>Under section 45 of the Act, certification and inspection of the schools are functions of the Minister for Education. In accordance with that section the Minister may, on the application of the manager of any reformatory school, direct the Inspector of Reformatory and Industrial Schools to examine into the condition and regulations of the school and its fitness for the reception of youthful offenders to be sent there under that part of the Act and to report to him thereon.  The Minister, if satisfied with the report of the inspector, may certify that the school is fit for the reception of youthful offenders to be sent there in pursuance of that part of the Act.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if the nature of my language is such as to be in accordance with the presentation of Deputy Horgan's case but of its nature the language must be legalistic.</P>
    <P>The procedures laid down in this section of the Act having been duly carried out, the Minister, on 4 October 1978, certified that the school known as Loughan House and situated at Loughan in the County of Cavan, is fit for the reception of youthful offenders sent there in pursuance of Part IV of the Act.  By order of the Minister, a notice of the grant of a certificate to the school was published in the issue of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> dated Friday, 13 October 1978.</P>
    <P>The opening of Loughan House as a reformatory school is a temporary expedient which will operate only until a new purpose-built secure school for young offenders is available at Lusk, County Dublin, in about two years' time.  The task force on child care services in their interim report of September <Col N="139" /> 1975 recommended the establishment under the Department of Education of a secure special school for 25 to 30 young offenders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;who were too unmanageable for the existing &ldquo;open&rdquo; residential schools.  A similar recommendation had earlier been made by the interdepartmental committee on mentally ill and maladjusted persons, known as the Henchy Committee.</P>
      <P>On assuming office last year, the Government decided that it was appropriate to implement these recommendations and a project team was set up in my Department to plan the new school. It became clear at an early stage that it would be a task of some complexity to design a building which would cater for the special educational and social needs of these young persons while at the same time satisfying the requirements of security.  Public concern about juvenile crime and its consequences was such however that an interim emergency solution was deemed necessary to meet what we considered the crisis situation that had arisen in a number of areas.  A search for suitable temporary premises in the Dublin area was carried out.  In that search, in which I took a particular interest, all the buildings suitable for this purpose were examined.  We consulted with the corporation, but unfortunately we were unable to find a suitable building.  Accordingly, the Minister for Justice was approached.  He arranged for the closing of a centre for offenders in the 16 to 21 age group at Loughan, County Cavan, and made the premises available as a temporary school for the purposes of Part IV of the Children Act, 1908.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about Loughan House.  I visited Loughan House and it is appropriate that I should say that it is a fine modern building.  Standards of furnishing, equipment, decoration and repair have been maintained at a high level.  An extensive scheme of adaptation <Col N="140" /> and improvement has been carried out to render the premises suitable as a school for young persons in the 12 to 16 age group.  It has 46 furnished and centrally heated spacious study-bedrooms with hot and cold water instal-led in every room.  There is a chapel, dining-room, gymnasium-cum-cinema plus theatre, together with games rooms and a range of classrooms.  There are also facilities for a wide range of outdoor recreational pursuits.</P>
    <P>The County Cavan Vocational Education Committee have assigned eight teachers to Loughan House.  The education programme will include remedial education to meet the boys' deficiencies in basic education, social education, general education at post-primary level, physical education and training in practical subjects such as woodwork, art and crafts and home economics.</P>
    <P>There will also be an out-of-school programme for the boys, supervised by a care staff which at present numbers 40, half of them being women.  All these staff have undergone an induction course in child care which included placement in one of the open special schools for offenders or in a school for the mentally handicapped or other institution for the care of young persons.  These courses were planned and conducted in co-operation with the special education section of my Department and with the Department's child care adviser, who is also the inspector of reformatory and industrial schools.  Further in-service training in child care will be given.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Sligo Regional Technical College has made arrangements for a diploma course in child care to commence in January 1979 and the staff of Loughan House will be afforded facilities to attend this course.  In addition to the care staff, two welfare officers are assigned full-time to Loughan and will work both with the boys themselves and with their parents.  A full-time psychologist will also be employed and adequate medical, psychiatric and nursing services will be available.</P>
    <P>In the light of the facts as I have given them, the Minister was quite satisfied <Col N="141" /> that the school was fit for the reception of youthful offenders.  As I have already explained however, Loughan House is only a short-term solution to one of the most difficult problems that at present confront our society.  These young people unfortunately are unmanageable either within the community or in open schools.  They disrupt the treatment of other children and are capable of acts of vandalism and violence normally associated with children of an older age. Since their parents have failed to control them, the State as the guardian of the common good has the constitutional obligation to supply the place of the parents by appropriate means.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the planning of the proposed new school at Lusk is on <Col N="142" /> schedule and will be available in two years' time.  I would ask Deputy Horgan and any other Deputy who has an interest in this vital area not to accept that what has been done here needed a headline from any other country.  What we are doing in this area will be a headline for other countries.  We need not make apologies to anybody for the interest and care we are showing in this area and in our efforts to try to compensate for the care, love and affection which has been denied these children by their parents.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 7 November 1978.</P>
