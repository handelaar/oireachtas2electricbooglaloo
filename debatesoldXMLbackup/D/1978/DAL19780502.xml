      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to a recent report (details supplied) concerning serious disorder in Clonmel, County Tipperary; the Garda strength in the town and how this compares with towns of similar populations; the number of gardaí on duty in the town when this incident broke out and how they were deployed, and whether any of them suffered personal injury in their endeavours to restore order; the steps he now proposes to take to prevent similar incidents in the future; whether he will allocate additional Garda personnel to Clonmel town; and if, in order to allay fears and public apprehension, he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the newspaper report referred to and I have had a report in the matter from the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>While I do not wish to minimise what took place on the occasion in question it is clear that the particular newspaper report referred to, in contrast to local newspaper reports, was an exaggeration.  The Garda account is that there were scuffles involving a number of youths who were refused admission to a dance, that a large crowd gathered and that this made the fracas appear more widespread than it was.  The actual brawling lasted about half an hour, although it was another hour and a half before the crowd fully dispersed.  I am glad to say that no member of the Garda Síochána received personal injuries during the incident.  Five civilians received minor injuries.</P>
      <P>It would be contrary to established practice to give details of the number of gardaí that were on duty on the occasion or how they were deployed.</P>
      <P>The present strength of the station party in Clonmel is 31, an extra garda having been assigned there on 6 January last, and I understand that the strength will be further increased during the coming weeks.  The ratio of gardaí to population in the Clonmel sub-district is roughly in line with the ratio obtaining in other sub-districts in which a town of similar population to Clonmel is located.</P>
      <P>I am informed that, except for the weekend during which the incident mentioned occurred, extra foot patrols have been operating at weekends in Clonmel over the past few months and that it is intended that these will continue.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Garda will continue to give as much attention as practicable to the Clonmel area having regard to other demands on Garda resources and that the policing situation there will be kept under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he intends to introduce a <Col N="5" /> Bill on the liability of builders and vendors as recommended in the First Report of the Law Reform Commission; if so, when; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not correct in referring to the Law Reform Commission's document on builders' liability as a report and in stating that the commission have recommended the introduction of a Bill.  The document is a working paper and expressly states that it is circulated for comment and criticism and does not represent the final views of the commission.</P>
      <P>That aspect apart, I would refer the Deputy to my answer to Question No. 31 on 27 April 1978 in which I dealt generally with the question of the announcement of legislative proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply and accepting the correction that it is a working paper rather than a report, do I take it that the attitude of the Minister in relation to the working paper in question is to do nothing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the answer which I have given, that is, that the document in question is a working paper.  It was expressly stated that it was circulated for comment and criticism and that that working document does not represent the final views of the commission.  It is a document inviting comment and criticism.  When the commission have these comments and criticisms they will present a final paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the name and date of assignment of the senior Garda officer which he stated in October 1977 he would arrange to have assigned to the investigation of specific complaints against members of the Garda Síochána.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the reason for the delay in the appointment of a senior Garda officer to afford priority to the investigation of complaints of Garda ill-treatment of suspects, as stated by him in October 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>The undertaking that I gave in regard to the assignment of a senior Garda officer to investigate specific complaints was an undertaking limited to those complaints that had been made to Amnesty International and that were referred to in a report produced by that organisation.  It had nothing to do with the investigation of any future complaints.  That is quite clear not only from the context of the relevant sentence in my statement but also from the fact that the portion of my statement in which the relevant sentence appeared was clearly headed: &ldquo;Investigation of past incidents&rdquo;.  The statement dealt separately with the matter of safeguards for the future.</P>
      <P>If either Deputy would like to have a copy of my statement, I shall be happy to send him one on request.</P>
      <P>In the event, none of the allegations that had been mentioned by Amnesty International was subsequently made the subject of a specific complaint and accordingly the question of the assignment of an officer to investigate such a complaint has not arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to taking up the Minister's offer of studying the fine print of his statement and making the <Col N="7" /> comment that not alone have I been misled but that the public were misled, am I to take it that no Garda officer was assigned to investigate any complaint either prior to October or subsequent to October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's charge that the public were misled by my statement.  If the Deputy waits until he sees the statement he will not have to study it for fine print but will see that what I have said today is clearly spelt out and that there was no question of misleading anybody at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister to deal with the balance of the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to misleading the public, that is a matter of comment and I will not pursue it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it clear that the senior Garda officer has never been appointed to do the work it was suggested he would do in October 1977?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly the Deputy is misinformed because of the fact that he has not read the statement.  The statement issued by me last October ran to over four pages and related to a report by Amnesty International in which it was alleged that some members or groups of members of the Garda Síochána had engaged in systematic ill-treatment of suspects in cases which were known to Amnesty but were not identified by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement on page one said the Government had decided to deal with the matter in two ways.  First, the statement said, as regards the future it had been decided to appoint a special committee.  Secondly, as regards past events&mdash;and I emphasise the words &ldquo;past events&rdquo; which are a direct quotation from my statement&mdash;the statement said it had been decided to <Col N="8" /> make special arrangements whereby such allegations from identifiable people would be speedily investigated and submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The statement then went on to expand these two points in turn.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 dealt with the first point, namely the setting up of the committee and, for additional clarity was headed &ldquo;Questions of Safeguards for the Future&rdquo;.  Paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 dealt with the second point, namely, the particular allegations which had been made by Amnesty and, for additional clarity, those paragraphs were headed &ldquo;Investigation of Past Incidents&rdquo;. Again I emphasise the words &ldquo;past incidents&rdquo;.  Right in the middle of that section of the statement the reference to the assignment of a senior officer appears.</P>
    <P>What goes before it and what comes after it show beyond any question that it related only to Amnesty's allegations and, if there were any doubt, which there is not, the heading alone would show it could not be meant to apply to future complaints.  Anybody who wants to tear the words &ldquo;specific complaints&rdquo; from the context of the remarks before and after them, should logically claim they mean any specific complaint, irrespective of its subject matter, such as a complaint by somebody that his house was broken into, or even a complaint about, say, the colour scheme in a local Garda station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 31 on 27 April in which I dealt generally with the question of legislative proposals and also my reply to Question No. 30 on 14 February in which I indicated that an examination of areas of the criminal code relative to the investigation of crime and the law of evidence is being carried out with a view to seeing whether&mdash;and if so what &mdash;changes can and ought to be made, consistent with the preservation of the legitimate rights of all concerned.  The examination referred to is still in progress and will of course take account of the recommendations of the committee chaired by Judge Barra Ó Brian whose report was made to the Government on 13 April.  With regard to that report I may say that, while the preliminary comments of the Garda authorities have been received, more detailed observations are awaited from them and will need to be carefully studied before I, and in due course the Government, can form any conclusions in the matter.</P>

      <P>Since taking office I have had no occasion to consider whether any change in the legislation in this regard might be desirable.  An important factor is that in recent years the receipts from sweepstakes have been declining&mdash;from an average of over £4.5 million per sweepstake in 1967 to an average of less than £2.5 million per sweepstake in 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply which I consider most unsatisfactory, is the Minister aware that the main function of the private company which runs the sweepstakes now appears to be not so much raising money for the hospitals as disposing of redundant workers including, in the last purge, a handicapped worker? Would he not further agree that the operation of the sweepstakes, as presently constituted under the existing legislation, is no more than a licence to print money for the company concerned? Finally, given the dwindling receipts to the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes, would he not consider that the operation of this outfit has become a national and an international disgrace <Col N="12" /> and that he ought to do something about it?</P>

I do not at all accept the Deputy's statement that the operation of the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes is a licence to print money.  I refer the Deputy to the part of my original answer where I said that in recent years receipts from sweepstakes have been declining from an average of £4.5 million per sweepstake in 1967 to an average of less than £2.5 million per sweepstake in 1977.

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to a letter which was sent to me with a copy of a statement that had been released to the media before the letter was delivered. Beyond referring to the statement the letter contained only one sentence, which is as follows: &ldquo;The Council welcomes your concern in visiting prisons and would welcome a future meeting with you on this issue.&rdquo;  The statement did not refer to legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the call for an inquiry into prison administration, I have already replied at length to a parliamentary question by the Deputy (Dáil Debates Volume 302, column 1192).  However, the statement mainly related to <Col N="14" /> certain disturbances that had occurred in Mountjoy Prison and to a statement which I had issued on that matter.  I reject the criticisms made of my statement. However, I do not wish to comment further as I understand that a recent High Court judgment rejecting a <i>habeas corpus</i> application related to the disturbance may be the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice (a) the number of prisoners given daily conditional release in each of the prisons in 1977 (b) the average number of persons on such release on any given day in each prison (c) the average length of release for each prisoner so privileged, and (d) the main purposes for which such release was granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of persons granted daily temporary release during 1977 from each of the institutions and the number on such release on the first day of March, June, September and December are in the form of a tabular statement, which with the permission of the Cheann Comhairle, will be circulated with the Official Report.  The length of the period of daily temporary release varies.  It seldom exceeds three months and the usual period is about a month. Daily temporary release is almost always for the purpose of permitting the person concerned to take up a job.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that other forms of temporary release are also allowed.  Thus in 1977, 516 persons were allowed full temporary release, which means that they were released some time before their sentences expired under the supervision of the welfare service, subject to their being liable to be recalled for misbehaviour. In addition, 163 persons were allowed to spend Christmas at home and persons were released for weekends and other short periods on over 1,600 occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The immediate cause of the prohibition was the clear evidence that parcels had been used as a means of smuggling contraband.  It had, however, come to be recognised not only that there was no real need for food parcels because of the quantity, quality and variety of the food supplied but that the pressure on the families of some prisoners to send in parcels was a heavy strain.  Prisoners may buy a limited range of goods including chocolate, sweets and biscuits from the prison shops, which are run on a non-profit making basis.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 14 together. In regard to the general question of proposals for new legislation, I would refer the Deputies to the answer I gave to Question No. 31 on 27 April 1978.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Finance in the statement referred to did not mean to suggest that new laws in relation to young offenders would be introduced later this year. What he said was that later this year the courts will have real control over these offenders, meaning, as was to be inferred from the context, that the courts will be able to send to Loughan House offenders who cannot be contained in other schools.</P>
      <P>As regards the final part of Deputy Desmond's question, I pointed out on 8 December 1977 in reply to a parliamentary question, that the law relating to the taking of children into care is not primarily a matter for me and that at least two other Ministers are concerned with aspects of child care.  I would also draw attention to the reply given by the Taoiseach to Questions Nos. 3 and 4 on 25 April 1978.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am not aware that there is widespread public concern in relation to the present structuring of the legal profession, this is one aspect of the general question of the provision of legal services which I have under continuous review.

The pros and cons of changes in the structure of the legal profession are perhaps too complex to be usefully commented on at Question Time, but I am not suggesting that there is no need to question the present structures.  The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure have in the past been requested to examine the present position but they have not as yet submitted a report.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to answer questions numbers 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to provide secure accommodation for the 12 to 16 age group was taken shortly after the Government took office.  The decision to provide the accommodation at Loughan House was taken after a review of the options and it was not influenced by any pressure from anybody. I am not prepared to reconsider the decision.  Incidentally some critics of the Loughan House project blame me for disregarding, as they put it, recommendations made in their reports by three Government-sponsored Committees, the Kennedy Report of 1970, the Henchy Report of 1974 and the Interim Report of the Task Force of 1975.  This criticism, of course, ignores the fact that my decision does not in itself necessarily involve the acceptance or the rejection of any of those recommendations. <Col N="24" /> Implementation or rejection of any of the relevant recommendations in the reports would not be a matter for me.  Loughan House is an interim measure.  In any case, these reports are not <i>ad idem</i> in regard to the type of accommodation needed for unruly boys so that acceptance of the recommendation in one report would preclude acceptance of that in another.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that it would be right for me to disclose the identity of persons or organisations consulted by me in relation to the Loughan House project.  Were I to do so, I would be exposing those concerned to pressure and annoyance from the people and the groups who are trying to impede the project.  I am satisfied that I had appropriate and adequate advice.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress the following points:</P>
    <P>(i)  Loughan House will be used for the 12 to 16 age group until such time as the new school now being planned by the Department of Education for Lusk, County Dublin, is brought into service and no longer than that.  It is estimated that this will take about three years.  Loughan House is in excellent condition and a wide range of amenities will be available in it and in the extensive grounds.  I might add that there has been some misunderstanding in some people's minds in regard to the cost of converting Loughan House into a secure centre.  The cost of those changes will be of the order of £135,000.  The figure of £600,000 which has been the subject of criticism is made up of that £135,000 plus the cost of improvements and extensions to buildings and services which would have been needed in any case for the continued use of Loughan House as an open centre for the 16-to 21-year-olds.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Some critics of the Loughan House project appear to think that they have a compelling argument when they high-light the fact that the main staff body in Loughan will be prison officers.  This is calculated to create the impression that Loughan will be a primitive fortress run on excessively severe lines.  The reality, of course, is far different.  The prison officers <Col N="25" /> selected for Loughan House will have been specially trained in child care before they take up their jobs.  The vast majority of child care workers, including most of those in the existing &ldquo;special schools&rdquo; at Finglas, Clonmel and Lusk, on work similar to that which the Loughan House staff will be undertaking, had no training whatsoever when they were appointed to their jobs.  The Loughan House staff will continue to receive training after they take up their jobs.  The staff-to-inmate ratio will be high enough to enable a full programme of constructive activities to be implemented.  The discipline of the prison service is likely to be an advantage rather than a disadvantage for men and women who have to deal with difficult boys.</P>
    <P>(iii)  A full range of specialist services will be provided at Loughan by teachers, welfare officers, nurses, a psychologist and by visiting doctors and psychiatrists.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Help will be provided where relatives have difficulty in visiting boys in Loughan.</P>
    <P>(v)  Neither Loughan nor the planned school at Lusk nor any of the three existing &ldquo;special schools&rdquo; is intended for boys who have serious psychiatric problems.  The Eastern Health Board is planning a home for them.</P>
    <P>As regards what is called in one question the &ldquo;overall responsibility&rdquo; for the training of staff the position is, of course, that final responsibility for all aspects of the organisation rests on me as Minister for Justice.  That apart, it would be a misconception to think of the training required for work in Loughan House as undifferentiated. The prison officers who will serve there will have received training courses devised with the help of various persons and bodies some within and some outside my Department, officers of which have, of course, considerable experience in relation to the custody of young persons from 15 years of age who are committed to custody by the courts.  The training of the specialised staff, teachers, welfare officers, nurses, psychologist, chaplain and so on, will be that of their own professions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> The prison officers who will work in Loughan House will have had, in addition to their normal training course, a 12 weeks full-time, intensive course in child care&mdash;made up of six weeks of lectures, discussions, films, visits, project work tutorials and so on, and six weeks full-time placement in residential homes and special schools.</P>
    <P>The course is designed to give the 95 participants an insight into the environment, the normal psychological development of children and some of the problems associated with deviant behaviour.  The course also deals with the management of delinquent boys likely to be placed in residence in Loughan House.  I believe that it can provide those who undergo it with a good preparation for the work they will be undertaking.  Contributors include experts and practitioners in child care; educationalists in specialist fields; a range of experienced social workers; psychologists; psychiatrists&mdash;a total of 26 contributors including three experienced child-care workers who act as tutors.</P>
    <P>Many countries have facilities for the secure custodial accommodation of boys under 16.  I could not undertake to specify which ones are similar to Loughan House since, for one thing, that would be a matter of opinion depending on the individual features thought by an inquirer to be relevant. In any case I think it would be presumptuous of me to comment on institutions in other countries. For some time after the second World War it was fashionable among criminologists and penologists to explore the possibilities of rehabilitating offenders by means of regimes in custodial institutions which were treatment-orientated. Unfortunately that approach has not yielded any worth-while result and has been almost universally abandoned as, indeed, appears to be recognised now even by some organisations who a few years ago were very critical of what they alleged was the failure of our custodial institutions to rehabilitate offenders.</P>
    <P>As to correspondence from organisations, on 14 April I received from the Taoiseach's office a letter dated 7 April 1978 addressed to the <Col N="27" /> Taoiseach and which had as an enclosure a copy of a letter dated 7 March 1978 addressed to me on behalf of eleven organisations.  The original of the letter of 7 March 1978 did not reach me or my Department. A reply has been issued.  The suggestion that I have been unwilling to discuss the Loughan House project with interested bodies is without foundation.  Discussions have taken place between a number of organisations and my Department.  Some organisations, however, have chosen to attack my proposals first before seeking to discuss them.  I have agreed to discussions even with some of those organisations.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to circulate with the Official Report a statement which was prepared in January and issued to persons who inquired about the Loughan House project.  Following is the statement:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Interim residential accommodation for boys under 16 years of age at Loughan House, Blacklion, County Cavan.</P>
    <P>In recent years the special schools under the aegis of the Department of Education have not been accepting juveniles who are behaviourally difficult.  The continuing delinquency of juveniles in this category has contributed significantly to the rising incidence of crime and vandalism.</P>
    <P>For some months past, a project team in the Department of Education has been planning for residential schools to accommodate boys and girls under 16 years of age whom the courts may find to need residential placement and who are not acceptable in the existing schools.  The Department of Justice is represented on this project team, as is the Department of Health, and there is close liaison between the Departments in this matter.  A site at Lusk, adjacent to the existing special school, has been obtained for a school for boys, details of the <Col N="28" /> accommodation to be provided have been worked out and architects are now designing the buildings.  The project team has taken into consideration the recommendations of the Interdepartmental Committee on Mentally Ill and Maladjusted Persons and of the Task Force on Child Care Services.  The project team is also aware of accommodation and facilities being provided under the aegis of the Department of Health for emotionally and psychiatrically disturbed juveniles and of the range of non-residential services for juveniles at risk being provided under the auspices of each of the three Departments.</P>
    <P>For the next two or three years and purely as a temporary arrangement until the Department of Education has provided adequate accommodation for boys who need residential placement, the Department of Justice will make Loughan House, Blacklion, Co. Cavan available to accommodate boys between the ages of 12 and 16 years, who because of their behavioural problems or their tendency to abscond are not currently acceptable in the existing special schools.  Necessary adaptations are in hand and it is hoped to have Loughan House ready to accept boys of this category early this year.</P>
    <P>Loughan House is a particularly fine modern building.  Standards of furnishing, equipment, decoration and repair have been maintained at an extremely high level.  It is scenically situated on over 40 acres of landscaped grounds.  It has 46 furnished and centrally heated and spacious study-bedrooms, with hot and cold water installed in every room.  They are designed for single occupancy but the rooms are sufficiently spacious to enable them to be used on a basis of multiple occupancy, if this is considered to be in the best interests of the boys. Apart from a chapel, dining-room, gymnasium and an equipped cinema/theatre, the building has games rooms and a range of classrooms. The grounds provide football pitches, a volley-ball court, a <Col N="29" /> full scale pitch and putt course, and there are facilities for swimming, boating and fishing on the lake.</P>
    <P>Because a propensity to abscond is one of the more recurring factors to be expected from the boys concerned and is indeed one of the more important considerations which contributed to their not being acceptable in the existing special schools, provision will need to be made for a closed perimeter.  This perimetering will, however, leave extensive grounds readily accessible to the boys in residence and moreover it is being laid out in a way that will not interrupt the open prospect of the surrounding environment.  The element of closure envisaged is the minimum necessary to ensure that the residential placement decided by the courts can be effected and availed of to enable the boys to benefit from a programme of personal development and resocialisation.  In circumstances where residential placement is found to be the only course which holds out a prospect of control and reorientation, the presence of the boys concerned is a prerequisite to any attempt to achieve a desired improvement. It does not follow that because there is perimetering, a place is &ldquo;closed&rdquo; to an oppressive degree.</P>
    <P>It is not possible, for a number of reasons, to forecast accurately the number of boys who will be accommodated at Loughan House.  It is envisaged that at the appropriate stage of court proceedings, each boy will be assessed at the Finglas Children's Centre.  That assessment will help the courts to decide whether any particular boy is to be residentially placed or not.  If he is, it will need to be decided whether placement should be to one of the three existing special schools in Finglas, in Clonmel, or in Lusk, or whether placement is to be in Loughan House.  The extent to which the existing special schools may exercise their option not to accept boys whom they consider to be problematic in terms of control and absconding could also affect the intake in Loughan House.  Intake <Col N="30" /> would also be influenced by the availability or otherwise of specialised, primarily health-orientated places under Department of Health auspices.  The arrangements will be such as to enable boys who progress to a sufficient extent, to be transferred from Loughan House to the other special schools.</P>
    <P>The majority of the staff for Loughan House will be officers of the prison service.  They are recruited through open competitive examination conducted by the Civil Service Commission and the recruitment is by Selection Board procedure.  The candidates who qualify receive several weeks full-time induction training on their duties.  Among those duties, for several years past, has been the staffing of open and specialised places of custody.  The service has had a very rewarding experience in this field and is encouraged by that experience to be confident about its efforts on behalf of the under-16 age group during the next few years.</P>
    <P>In addition to the conventional training, the officers selected to staff Loughan House will receive a full-time course of twelve weeks' duration related to the development, problems, needs, care and control of the juveniles for whom they will have responsibility.  This training has already commenced.  Furthermore, arrangements are under discussion for ongoing training of staff to extend over the next two or three years.</P>
    <P>The plan is that the juveniles in Loughan House will receive full-time education.  The programme is being designed to meet general, compensatory and remedial needs as well as practical subjects, social skills and leisure-time activities.  This Department is liaising with the Department of Education and other educational authorities both in regard to the design of a suitable educational programme and in regard to the educational staff which such a programme will require.</P>
    <P>In addition to the staff already mentioned, there will be provision for chaplaincy, medical and nursing <Col N="31" /> care, a social work input by the welfare service of the Department of Justice and a psychological and psychiatric service, which is currently being discussed with the appropriate health authorities.  Every endeavour will also be made to ensure that there is an adequate feminine presence on the staff.  There will be a very generous ratio of staff to boys.  There will also be financially assisted travelling arrangements for visitors.</P>

      <P>I should like to challenge the Minister's statement that those who sought to discuss the question of Loughan House with him and those who criticised him did not offer themselves to discuss the matter.  What is the purpose of a meeting of which we read in today's papers of selected groups, selected by him, to meet him next Thursday if he has already made up his mind on all aspects of this matter?  Would it not be proper for him to cease any further work on the preparation of Loughan House until he has had a discussion with the interested groups, people who have put so much work into this kind of activity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the House that the decision is not to be reversed.  I said that I did meet a number of people prior to this project going ahead.  There are a number of others that I propose to meet and there are some that I do not propose to meet.  I think the House and the Deputy will know that it has always been the practice that Ministers can determine whom they want to meet and will meet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the attitude the Minister has now taken I would ask him a few questions about this.  In view of the emphasis on the role of the family and close relationship with the family, and in view of the emphasis laid on community involvement by all organisations who have reported on this subject and in view of his own statement that social workers and the welfare service of his Department will work with these children <Col N="32" /> and their families, how does he propose that a satisfactory system can be arranged with 100 miles dividing parents and children?  How will he bring about a situation in which to rebuild a relationship between parents and child or even build such a relationship for the first time where none existed, when parent and child are 100 miles apart?  How can this be done and what rehabilitative purpose will Loughan House serve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that I have never at any stage said that Loughan House is being put forward as a complete solution to a particular problem or as anything more than a necessary immediate response to an emergency situation.  I believe a situation exists, that something must be done about it and I think I am trying to do the best that can be done about it, even though I know it is not the answer and is not a complete solution to a very serious problem.  There is a certain strong streak of Utopianism running through many of the criticisms being made of Loughan House.  If we had unlimited resources and had begun 50 years ago I have no doubt the present situation would be better, but unfortunately the harsh reality now is that no country, not even the most wealthy, has been able to solve the problem which we have, as the Deputy knows, by the methods advocated by some of those critics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate that Loughan House is of a temporary nature, could the Minister give a clear indication as to when Lusk will be opened?  Further, could he indicate what recommendations of the Henchy Report or the Kennedy Report or the Child Care Task Force have been accepted by the Government?  Does he intend to implement these recommendations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On every occasion offered to me I have said that Loughan House is an interim measure and that as a particular type of school for these young offenders it will cease to be such a school when the new centre at Lusk is available.  I have also said that the Department of Education commissioned <Col N="33" /> architects to submit plans and I understand plans have already been submitted.  It is thought that the new centre at Lusk will be in operation after three years&mdash;that is an estimate from the Office of Public Works.  I should like to assure the House and the Deputies that Loughan House will not be used when the new centre is ready.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that difficulty may be experienced by parents who want to visit their children in Loughan House.

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that there is almost total agreement among all organisations dealing with child care and with social work among children that the concept of Loughan House is totally detrimental to the best interests of the children? The Minister has said that it will be at least three years before any alternative to Loughan House can be provided and irreparable harm can be done to up to 90 children in that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there is agreement between the objectors to Loughan House who say that the concept is wrong.  I have heard their spokesmen over a period of weeks offering differing views. There is an extremely serious problem in existence with regard to these young people.  If that problem did not exist perhaps we could afford the luxury&mdash;and it would be a luxury&mdash;of waiting for a while.  One need only refer to the recent accident involving young Dublin people in County Galway.  I do not want to add further injury or pain to the families of the young people but quite a number of young people&mdash;all of them under 16 years and some of whom had been to Lusk but who could not be kept there &mdash;were involved in the escapade that ended in death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that all the organisations involved in the protest regarding Loughan House agree that there is a <Col N="35" /> very serious problem among a small number of young people?  Does he not accept that they agree that some preventive measures must be taken to protect society against their operations at the moment but that Loughan House is totally against the best interests of the children and ultimately against the best interests of our society?  Further, does he not agree that in the interim report of the task force there is an alternative way of dealing with this problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

I should like the Deputy to clarify for me now whether I am to interpret from what he said that people have told him or led him to believe that there is no need for a custodial centre.  Is that the position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I never suggested that. I said that the vast majority of people and organisations who have specialised for many years in child care agree that there is a problem with regard to a small number of young people.  Perhaps it would be more beneficial if the Minister, instead of being selective about whom he meets with regard to the objections to Loughan House, would meet all the organisations who have banded together to protest against his proceeding with this project.</P>

    <P>The phrase &ldquo;I hope&rdquo; epitomises the Bill.  It is just a little bit of hope. <Col N="76" /> Surely, when we are talking about the safety of people, we should talk in a positive way.  I am disappointed that hope is the opening gambit.</P>

    <P>I have considered the question of the replacement of the Factories Act, 1955 but I have decided that the balance of advantage, at present, lies in the improvement of the existing law.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not very happy with this Bill apparently.  The Principal Act was introduced in 1955 and we should not have to wait a further 23 years to have sufficient changes in the law to protect workers.  What had the Minister in mind when he made that statement?</P>
    <P>I am happy about the statutory obligation on the suppliers of plant to provide the necessary safeguards. That was neglected in the old Act. It is a positive approach that the onus should be placed on the suppliers.  It is necessary to look at how one places the onus of safety on the suppliers. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am proposing that, with the assent of both Houses, the safety Acts may be amended by order so as to comply with any international obligations relating to safety, health and welfare of workers covered by these Acts which we may decide to assume.</P>
    <P>I agree that when we are involved with the EEC and regulation come before the House, Bills may be amended by order, but I would not like this to become a habit.  I believe we would end up with a fragmented type of legislation which would not have much direction.  While I agree it is necessary to amend legislation by order from time to time and that we will be signatories to certain international agreements which will possibly bind us to make changes I believe that after a number of changes are made the legislation should be comprehensively reviewed and brought before the House to have <Col N="77" /> another look at it.  This would ensure that it is going in the right direction. It would not then be fragmented to such an extent that it would be impossible to follow.  It might be a nice cosy way to change legislation by orders.  Orders could be slipped through on certain days of the week when very little might be happening. This could have a severe effect on industrial safety and health.  The Minister pointed out:</P>
    <P>Safety is one area where the interests of employer and worker should coincide.  Workers have an obvious interest in it, and employers have an interest both from the humanitarian and efficiency points of view.</P>
    <P>That is very true.  Workers have a vested interest in their own safety and it is important that they are consulted on any changes intended in legislation.</P>
    <P>Last week Members on this side of the House clearly indicated that there was a complete lack of consultation with representatives of the workers, the trade unions and the ICTU.  I do not think the views of the National Industrial Safety Organisation were given much thought.  It is not good enough to talk about workers' interests if we are not going to consult them or their interests when preparing such legislation.  If legislation like this is to operate effectively it must be with the consent of the workers.  It is regrettable that there was not full consultation in this area because, in the long term, that may have repercussions.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>A disappointing feature of the 1955 Act in operation has been the limited extent to which workers have availed of their rights to set up safety committees.  At present there are just over 250 safety committees operating in a total of 18,000 premises on the Factories Register.</P>
    <P>If we introduce legislation and leave it at that workers will be slow, because of lack of information and communication, to take the initiative.  If workers were given adequate information about the safety committees I do <Col N="78" /> not think they would be slow to establish them.  Had that been done earlier we would have many more such sommittees in operation.  I do not think anybody can express disappointment with the workers when they were not consulted.  Because they were not consulted the workers possibly felt that the question of safety was a matter for management.</P>
    <P>I am not objecting to the system being imposed if it is not possible to get consent but I am objecting to the lack of consultation by the Minister. Had the matter been handled properly in the beginning it would not have been necessary to introduce legislation. Because of this the Minister said he was introducing a radical new approach to this question.  I do not see anything radical about introducing legislation if something does not work by consent.  That is a normal situation. The Bill may be considered to be a reasonably radical approach but it is not radical in the sense the Minister has stated.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that the hazards of fire, especially in relation to modern materials and processes, are highlighted occasionally by tragic accidents and the provisions relating to fire safety, in particular those relating to fire alarms and fire drills, will be improved considerably. It is important that we examine the whole concept of fire safety.  I read recently where a factory in Dublin which went on fire was similar to Spandau because of the number of grids and so on located throughout the premises.  I accept that management in that case could argue that because of the law and order situation and vandalism in that district it was necessary to grid up, but there could have been serious loss of life.  However, the primary concern must be the safety of the work force.  Workers should not be put at risk because of certain security problems.  It is obvious that the safety of our workers must come first in this regard.  I wonder how many firms have introduced this type of security which could lead to serious accidents in the event of fire.  We must ensure that fire regulations are rigidly adhered to.  It is obvious that in the case.  I have mentioned there was a <Col N="79" /> breakdown in inspection.  I am not accusing the inspectors of not doing their work because it is possible that there were not enough inspectors to inspect all premises.</P>
    <P>The safety and health of our workers should be covered in a comprehensive Bill which should embrace all areas of activity, industry, agriculture, places of amusement and all places where workers are employed.  A Minister may claim that this is not his area but we should be concerned about protecting all workers.  It is only when we hear of tragedies that we realise how serious the problem is.  It is important that all this legislation be reviewed.  If an accident by way of fire took place what loss of life would there be?  It is important that all this legislation be reviewed with the intention of getting it into one solid piece that will protect everybody and not just industry.  The fire that I am speaking of was in industry and so it is relevant.  The inevitable will happen if we do not take action.  I ask the Minister to look at that aspect again.</P>
    <P>Over the last ten years there has been an increase of over 50 per cent in the total of industrial accidents.  Since 1971 we have had roughly 28 fatalities a year.  When we have a fatality what type of investigation goes on?  Is it merely that the coroner makes a report and somebody walks in and looks at where the accident happened?  There should be an open inquiry into every industrial accident, and particularly where a fatality occurs.  In the mines, which I believe are not covered in this Bill, we have had about six fatalities over the last few years.  It is not enough that a life is lost and we have a report and everything is filed away.  When a fatality occurs there should be a fullscale  public inquiry with the facts coming out and the blame laid where it should be, and if defects are there they must be put right and seen to be put right.  The matter must be publicised, otherwise the effect of a fatality like that will go unnoticed and no lessons will be learned from it.  Therefore, it is important that we examine that aspect of it.</P>
    <P>What is the cost to the economy <Col N="80" /> every year?  Certainly millions of £s. We have fatalities, we have serious and minor accidents, and apart from the humanitarian aspect of the tragedy in the homes because of death or longterm injury, there is the loss to the economy.  We have been too complacent, and this Bill is not firm enough nor has it the commitment to do the job it should be doing.  From 1955 to 1978 there have been tremendous changes in technology and in industrial development in this country.  We have the prospect of gas finds and a nuclear generating station.  There is no reason why we should not be copper-fastening into our legislation now provisions to deal with the problems that may arise as a result.  We should not be waiting until something happens before looking at the type of legislation we will be introducing.  It is easy to learn from others what type of provisions to incorporate in it.  I foresee a lack of the right type of legislation and that is why I am not happy with what is with us today. Our present legislation is, to say the least of it, fragmented.  We have the Factories Act, the Office Premises Act and miscellaneous statutes such as the Conditions of Employment Act, the Dangerous Substances Act, the Employment Agencies Act and so forth.  With that diversity of legislation it is hard to inform people of their rights and indeed it is not easy to define those rights.  Therefore, I say the whole area is so fragmented that it is understandable that workers have not been participating in safety committees. They were not sure of their ground, and I do not think they will be until we bring in comprehensive legislation, have proper discussions with them and make a comprehensive, practical handbook available to them, annually or bi-annually depending upon what is being up-dated from time to time, to highlight their rights and their responsibilities to themselves and to their colleagues.  Carelessness on the part of workers too often leads to death and serious injury to their fellows.  That is why it is necessary that from time to time they be kept up to date with what is happening; otherwise they will drift into situations where safety committees will not be <Col N="81" /> effective.  A safety committee can be effective only to the extent that the work force are educated.  If the work force are not educated the safety committees might as well be hammering their heads against the proverbial wall, and that is not what we want.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned about safety and health within the workplace.  We must specify the workplace rather than, necessarily, industry.  Too many people are left outside the scope of this legislation.  Shops, hospitals, schools, colleges of technology where there are degrees of industry&mdash;are they covered?  What about the offshore oil rigs and agricultural workers?  Over the last number of years a tremendous amount of technology has come into the farm and with the amount of farm machinery now in use an agricultural worker would nearly need a degree in mechanical engineering as well as the experience necessary to run a farm. That will give an idea of the dangers that lie there.  Why are we excluding these categories?  Is it because of pressure? I do not know.  Maybe this is the reason we have not got comprehensive legislation, because no matter what legislation is brought into the House now, the complaint is that it costs money to implement.  That seems to be the criterion, and it is disappointing and also immoral.  You do not put a price on life or limb; these things cannot be justified.  Our concern should be that disasters will not happen, and we live in a fool's paradise if we think it is not going to cost money.</P>
    <P>When I talk about efficiency I am talking in the context of the overall operation of a concern rather than the element of productivity but if one visits a concern in which there is safety consciousness, one finds invariably that that firm are in a profit-making situation because of their efficiency in every aspect of their operations.  Such a concern are concerned also about the man-hours that could be lost as a result of accidents or fatalities.  Therefore, even for no more than selfish reasons if people wish to use the argument that this legislation is costing money, they are being less than honest and one would be likely to <Col N="82" /> find that a concern in which there was such an attitude was also inefficient. That argument, then, should not be used in any circumstances.  It is wrong that people in the agricultural sector should not be included in the legislation.  To exclude them seems to leave us in a sort of vacuum.  Consequently, I would ask the Minister to reconsider this whole question.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the reason for being slow in bringing in comprehensive legislation in this area is that we have not given the question enough thought.  I cannot foresee us having comprehensive legislation in this sphere unless we reach a stage where we have an independent body operating on their own but under the control of the Minister for Labour.  This is important because within the Department the Minister can be involved with many matters about which there is considerable pressure with the result that those areas in which there is the least pressure may be left on the long finger.</P>
    <P>The type of independent body that I have in mind would be free to control the type of legislation considered necessary but obviously they would operate in consultation with the Minister.  They would supervise the legislation and examine it.  Failure to move in this direction would mean our falling down badly in terms of safety and health.  Certain boards would need to be comprised so as to include independent members.  In that way both sides of industry would be consulted and would in turn make annual reports to the Minister on the safety aspect through the type of independent board I have in mind.  The Minister could then have the reports laid down before the House.  If we do this we shall be moving towards greater safety.  There is no point in paying lip service to the question as has been more or less the situation up to now.  The type of board I have in mind is not novel.  There is such a body in France.  They are a consultative council and operate directly under the Minister for Labour.  That situation is quite new in France but it is a positive approach, the type of approach that we need here also.</P>
    <P>Unless we make similar provisions <Col N="83" /> here we shall find ourselves having to make changes every few years.  It may be that we have not a sufficient inspectorate but the problem is not merely one of going from factory to factory to see if everything is all right. That situation is fine to an extent but it is a rather negative approach.  What we require is a whole attitude to this question on the part of management and workers.  This would involve the employing of a person who would operate in the role of a safety officer. That would bring us to the whole area of personnel.  Most of the inspectorate personnel concerned are engineers.  It is right that that be the case because in the context of what we have in industry the inspectors need the sort of training undertaken by an engineer. However, the time has come for us to have comprehensive training for our industrial inspectorate.  I am thinking of the setting up perhaps of a Chair in one of the colleges of technology for the specific purpose of training personnel who would become engaged in inspection work.  Their role would not be negative in any way.  For instance, it would not be merely a role of ensuring that the law was adhered to but of going into the work places for the purpose of consultation, education and communication and of making people aware of the dangers that should be avoided.</P>
    <P>To implement such measures would put us well on the road to preventing accidents at work, at least in so far as they can be prevented having regard to the human element involved.  If we are serious about the matter&mdash;and I think all of us here are serious about it&mdash;we must ensure that the personnel involved are given the right type of training, that there is the right educational commitment and we must be able to go into the work place not only to meet the safety committee but to talk with the workers generally.  The inspectors could talk in detail with the safety committee who in turn would communicate the views expressed to the work force.  Refresher courses could be provided to remind them of the problems, how they can be overcome and how accidents happen.  The accidents <Col N="84" /> should be detailed, reported and referred back to the independent board so that at all times there is a complete monitoring of every accident no matter how small.  We should ask ourselves the following questions: why, how and what can we do to prevent it?  Was it due to excessive hours worked by the employee?  Was the machinery defective? Prevention is the important thing and we can only have prevention by monitoring.</P>
    <P>The number of accidents which happen and the number reported do not relate.  We will have to concern ourselves with that problem.  When an accident happens it must be reported to the smallest detail.  The safety board will look at that accident and make their recommendations to the safety committee in the industry and to the management to ensure it will not happen again.  This can also be reported in a handbook which may be passed from one industry to another because if an accident happens in one industry it may also happen in another.</P>
    <P>Safety officers should frequent places of employment as often as possible, at least once a year, and carry out what is known as a safety audit.  Stock is checked and cash is audited but are work places audited for safety?  I do not think so.  Why not?  This is an example of our reluctance to take this area very seriously.  It is very important that we carry out safety audits and report to the management and safety committees the areas that may require attention.  From year to year industry may expand and new machinery may be brought in.  It is important that the audit be done on a regular basis because of the changing circumstances. The Minister should look into this matter.</P>
    <P>I am always worried about plant isolation, particularly automated plants.  If there is manual control the operator can throw a switch but in automated plants quite often the control centre is some distance from the plant and can be handled carelessly. We must write into our legislation very stringent provisions to ensure that plant isolation is comprehensively taken care of.  It is not very easy to get a set of rules but we must get them <Col N="85" /> because circumstances change almost daily and plants are being switched on by remote control far from the actual plant.  When a maintenance man switches on the machinery that is the end of his job so far as he is concerned. The Minister must also look at this.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not talk about health nor does the title mention health. When most countries are discussing industrial safety they usually mention industrial safety and health.  That is the way it should be, because both are relevant.  If the atmosphere is polluted this can adversely affect the people's health.</P>
    <P>We have always had a certain amount of mining but from the point of view of the industrial content we are now moving into mining in a very big way.  Unless stringent controls are enforced as regards working conditions in this industry, the health of the people involved will deteriorate rapidly.  Various diseases can be contracted and we should learn from other countries, such as Canada, America and so on, which have been in the mining business for years.  We now have active legislation to ensure that there is no danger for our workers. There can be a problem in asbestos plants because it has been proved that asbestos can cause some forms of cancer and this creates great fear.  Are we passing the right kind of legislation to meet that kind of situation? Let us not wait until the inevitable happens.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that our industrial standards are the highest and we must not settle for second place because it might win us a little more industry than other countries which might demand higher standards.  Our workers are entitled to have the highest standards of safety and health.  We must concern ourselves with the overall aspect of health as well as the body, the limb, the life.</P>
    <P>Our legislation does not cover the whole area of nuclear power and there is a justifiable fear here.  It is only normal for the people involved in that industry to allay the fears of others by telling them there is no real danger but there are positive dangers, such as radiation.  We must ensure that any danger to health is protected strenuously. <Col N="86" /> We must be very strict and rigid in the rules we lay down for any development in the nuclear field.  We are only talking about a generating station at the moment but there may be further offshoots of nuclear operations for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>Once we enter the nuclear sphere of activity it is essential that we should be ahead in technological safety.  We are not groping in the dark here because nuclear development has been with us for the last 20 or 30 years and we can learn from the experience in other countries and improve on their techniques.  They may have been inhibited because of cost.  We should suffer no such inhibition because we can incorporate all the technological development over that period.</P>
    <P>We should have comprehensive legislation encompassing all work forces.  It is wrong to exclude any work force and such exclusion does a disservice to our community.  All are entitled to protection.  We have a duty here to provide maximum safety for all sections.  The service industry is growing very big and requires special assessment.  This Bill leaves much to be desired.  It is a makeshift effort.  The Minister may amend it by order.  That could have adverse effects. Piecemeal legislation is never satisfactory because it only confuses people.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work in rural areas can be done in the home.  Work is farmed out to people.  There are no proposals here to cover these people. This is an area in which there could be substantial development and we should write into our legislation safeguards to protect the people who take work into their own homes.  In the United States of America a handbook for women in industry has been published. This is an excellent idea. Women are now moving into industry and they should be aware of the hazards and the dangers.  I am thinking mainly now of women of childbearing age.</P>
    <P>There could be problems particularly in chemical industries.  We are striving to attract such industries.  Dangers in such industries should be publicised or eliminated altogether.  Periodic review is absolutely vital and there should be <Col N="87" /> an independent body competent to inform and advise the Minister.  The reports of such a body should be laid before both Houses so that Members would be aware of the problems and the changes required.  Right through every facet of our work force there should be an awareness of health hazards or dangers.  If that were the case there would not be need for scrutiny or more legislation because the people themselves would respond. That is the only way in which to achieve a proper code of safety for those in employment.</P>
    <P>I welcome any legislation designed to improve health and safety.  I am unhappy because this Bill has excluded so many.  It is propping up outdated legislation.  It may be only 23 years in existence but, in the context of industrial development and technology, it is outmoded.  The law needs to be rewritten.  I would welcome a comprehensive Bill.  It does not give me any pleasure to come in here and be critical of any Bill designed to improve safety. This Bill is totally inadequate.  I had been hoping for something far more comprehensive.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the quality of this legislation is the result of lack of consultation. Were the farmers and their organisations consulted?  Were the service industries consulted?  Were the vocational bodies who are involved in employment consulted?  If not, one can understand the inadequacy of this measure.  Legislation of this kind which affects so many workers can be introduced only after much consultation both with management and the unions.  At the moment the Minister seems to be more involved in lecturing the unions than in consulting them, in telling them how to discipline their boys.  In matters of this kind one does not talk down to people or have a weekend indulging in union bashing and then hope to get their co-operation.  If we want unions and management to co-operate and to involve themselves in matters of this kind we must encourage them instead of discouraging them: we must ensure that the measure which comes before the House will be a reflection of their voices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" /> When we see a Bill of this sort before the House it is not hard to appreciate that out of 18,000 firms, only 250 have taken the time to set up works committees.  Talking down to people, handing down the law in an arbitrary fashion, will not achieve any co-operation from either management or unions.  Therefore, before this Bill goes any further I suggest that the Minister engages in fuller consultation with every area involved, industry, agriculture, horticulture and service and vocational organisations. This Bill and other matters appertaining to industrial safety and health should be discussed fully with them.</P>
    <P>This seems to be an inadequate interim measure and I hope we will not wait for directives from the EEC before we draft and present proper industrial health and safety measures. We should try to be ahead of other countries instead of waiting for directives from the other eight.  We should be writing legislation now to take account of advances in the technological and agricultural fields.  We are in changing times and we will have to take account in the immediate future of our involvement in mining, petrochemicals, natural gas and a number of other fields.  All these should be sewn into this legislation.  We should not be wondering what will come from the EEC.  We should not be dragging our feet.  If we get into that habit this House will become an EEC rubber stamp and this Parliament will become the Greater Ireland County Council.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I repeat my call to the Minister to look into this Bill fully and if necessary to drop it and rewrite it to cover every aspect of industrial safety and health.  I do not care if it takes six months to do it.  Ultimately it will have to be done.  I would agree to passing this legislation quickly as an interim arrangement if I could get an undertaking from the Minister that comprehensive legislation will be forthcoming.  In his opening remarks the Minister told us he had decided that the balance of advantage at present lies in improving existing law. I ask him to indicate when he is replying what he meant by those words.  I hope he will indicate that he <Col N="89" /> will present a comprehensive safety and health Bill soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening remarks the Minister said the Bill will improve existing law and reduce the number of industrial accidents.  That sentence answers most of the Opposition criticism of the Bill.  It would take a number of years to draft such a Bill and in the meantime some of the excellent new regulations in this Bill will be implemented.  Therefore it is in the interests of workers that the Bill should be enacted and the improvements implemented quickly.  In no way would this prevent the Minister from introducing new legislation in the future.  The criticism because we do not have such a Bill now is unjustified. We all agree that we look too much to legislation across the water where agriculture is only a small part of their industrial fabric.  It could take a long time to introduce sufficient legislation in relation to agriculture. Many of the regulations governing agriculture are the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and not the Department of Labour.</P>
      <P>In relation to consultation, the Minister did answer questions in the Dáil on 19 April.  He said that, on the publication on 29 June 1977 of a discussion document, people were publicly invited to send in submissions on the proposed legislation. In answer to a further question the Minister said that submissions were sought and received from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Employers Confederation and the Factories Advisory Council.</P>
      <P>The workers should not have to wait for a new Bill as this one is adequate. If at any time the Minister thinks he has something worth while to introduce for the benefit of the workers he should introduce it without delay instead of waiting for a comprehensive Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the more interesting provisions in the Bill relates to dangerous activities.  The Bill provides for the stopping of dangerous activities immediately they come to light.  This provision was not in the 1955 Act.  Until now a dangerous activity was allowed to continue until the matter was <Col N="90" /> brought to court and a decision given on it.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains important provisions for the suppliers of plant and it is right that they should provide safety harnesses on industrial equipment. Obviously the interests of employers and workers should coincide. Between 1924 and 1927 Elton Mayo of the Western Electric Company of Chicago carried out a survey.  He discovered that productivity increased in industries in which employers showed an interest in the health, welfare and safety of the workers.  It is certainly in the interests of employers to maintain standards of safety and welfare for their workers.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, the incidence of industrial accidents and disease has decreased down through the years.  It was probably at its height at the beginning of the 19th century.  In 1802 an Act was introduced to prevent orphanages from selling children to mills in the North of England.  So far as I know, that was the first legislation in relation to safety, health and welfare in industry. We are all aware of the phrases that have been handed down and which remind us of the serious hazards that existed in industry.  For example, &ldquo;as mad as a hatter&rdquo; relates to the mercury that was used in making felt hats, which caused insanity.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the number of fatalities in industry in 1976, which was 15, and in 1977 there were 22 fatalities.  These are intolerable figures.  The main causes appear to have been falls at work, electrocution and transport accidents. Most of these accidents could have been avoided.  The construction industry is a particularly hazardous one for workers and many of the accidents in that industry could be avoided by the use of proper scaffolding, handrails, covers on manholes and the wearing of protective helmets.  Another interesting point in the Minister's speech relates to the notification of accidents. There were 36 per 1,000 in the UK and 19 per 1,000 here.  Our figure appears to be a low one.</P>
    <P>A number of hazards are referred to in the Bill, including the hazard of noise.  Noise was considered a major <Col N="91" /> hazard among coppersmiths in 1713. In Glasgow in 1886 there was the hazard of boilermakers' deafness, a phrase which has been handed down to us and which reminds us of the problem of noise in industry.  The British Occupational Hygiene Society laid down a level of 90 decibels as the upper tolerable limit of noise in industry. This allows for an eight-hour day, a 40-hour week and a 48-week year.  With an upper limit of 90 decibels less than 1 per cent of workers suffer a social loss of hearing.  It is interesting to compare different levels of noise.  If one takes the hearing threshold as nought, the level in a broadcasting studio as 20, a library as 35, conversational speech as 70, the average street corner as 80, heavy street traffic as 90, this is the level that is considered acceptable for workers. The noise of thunder is classified as 110 and a jet taking off at 200 feet is 130.  At 141 decibels one gets a pain in the ear and cannot tolerate any further noise.</P>
    <P>In relation to hazardous chemicals, it is encouraging to note in the report of the inspector for factories that 30 samples of PVC taken in 1975 were negative for vynil chloride monomer, from which PVC is made.</P>
    <P>There is a reference to fire hazards in the Bill, which improves the existing regulations.  The Department of the Environment have an important part in this legislation in so far as they will be responsible for certificates.  The 1955 Act limited certain categories of factories where the Minister had responsibility. In this Bill there is a marked improvement in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is an improvement in the section dealing with protection of the eyes. Workers have an obligation not only to take care of their own eyes, to wear protective goggles, but also the eyes of those working with them.  I believe others in the vicinity are also entitled to protection.  In my experience, the worst injuries to eyes were caused by oxyacetylene burns suffered by people without goggles watching somebody doing a job in a garage or a factory. They may not be employed in the industry, but I believe they are entitled <Col N="92" /> to protection in their own interests.  If you watch somebody using an oxyacetylene torch, you do not feel anything at the time.  It may be six or eight hours later that you appear with really bad burns to the important lining that covers the eye.  Anybody in the vicinity, whether working or not, should be entitled to some form of protection.</P>
    <P>There are important changes in relation to the provision of places for eating at work, for the supply of hot and cold water, for an improvement in the place of work, the eradication of leaks from roofs, dampness and so on. Here it is important to mention education. While one can legislate for all these matters, unless the workers know the value of using the new facilities, legislation is in vain.</P>
    <P>Cleanliness was mentioned and I was particularly disappointed to read Deputy Mitchell's contribution.  As reported at column 1316, Volume 305 of the Official Report he said:</P>
    <P>The part cleanliness and tidiness of a whole factory plays in maintaining safety procedures and discipline is not even referred to. Cleanliness is referred to in the Principal Act and as far as I can gather it covers only where work is supposed to be going on.  It does not cover areas between where work is going on.  The Principal Act is vague and restrictive in this regard.</P>
    <P>I take particular exception to this:</P>
    <P>I regret to say that we are a filthy nation with filthy habits which are a cause of accidents, ill-health and a diminished production.  I am deeply ashamed of this trait in the Irish character and I am deeply sorry that no attempt is made by this Bill to improve things.</P>
    <P>I could not agree with that.  I do not think it is true of any of the factories I have ever visited.  On the question of cleanliness generally, we compare favourably with other countries.  There is always room for improvement, but that criticism was harsh and unjustified.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the 1955 Act lays down very clearly the provisions relating to cleanliness.  It says that every factory <Col N="93" /> must be kept in a clean state.  Dirt, waste and refuse must be removed daily from floors, benches and passageways. Workroom floors must be cleaned at least once in every week. Inside walls and ceiling must&mdash;(a) if of a smooth impervious substance, be washed down every 14 months; (b) if painted or varnished, be washed down every 14 months, and be repainted or revarnished every 7 years; (c) in other cases be white-washed or colour washed every 14 months.  Entries must be made in the General Register relating to the cleaning, etc. of the walls.  From that it appears to me that every part of the factory must be kept clean, not just the part where people are working.</P>
    <P>There is also provision in the Bill that the occupier must post a notice setting out the safety precautions in relation to certain regulative substances. One of my concerns would be where he would get this information. Obviously he would be depending on the manufacturer's information.  I am not satisfied that he would get sufficient information.  When a manufacturer is selling his produce, he will not emphasise the hazardous effects of it.</P>
    <P>The advisory nature of the inspectorate of factories needs to be emphasised. The general feeling is that the inspectorate are there to go into the factory and see what is wrong and perhaps prosecute if there is a contravention. I gather the service is there mainly as an advisory service and will advise any employer, or occupier, or workers, about safety, welfare and health in the industry.  It is important that this point should be emphasised because more use should be made of the advisory nature of that service.  In relation to the duty of the occupier to post a notice, the Bill encourages him to look to the advisory service for more up to date knowledge about the regulated substance about which he has to post the notice.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed that the Minister will be notified of an industrial injury where there is an absence from work rather than a loss of wages.  In the past there could have been an injury involving no loss of wages and it was not necessary to notify the Minister's <Col N="94" /> Department.  The question of absenteeism from work needs a great deal of further study.  The psychology of why people absent themselves from work has not been studied sufficiently.  The medical profession have often been criticised and it has been said they are lenient in the issuing of medical certificates. This is put forward as one of the reasons why people are absent from work.</P>
    <P>While I have not come in here to defend the medical profession, as Doctor Taylor from the British Post Office said in Dublin on Saturday, it is not the medical profession who certify people as unfit for work, it is the doctor's patient who certifies him as unfit.  This area should be looked at to find out why workers want to be absent from work.  We know some of the reasons.  Obviously, if there is a genuine illness they want to be absent. Some of them may have a problem. We get Monday morning absenteeism on the part of those who have had a hazardous weekend.  Dr. Taylor also pointed out that two-thirds of those who stay away from work are frustrated in their jobs.  This is an area that needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that while there are 18,000 industrial premises there are only 250 safety committees. This is a small figure but perhaps many industries are so small that they employ fewer than ten people and it may not be necessary to have a safety committee.  The figure may not be as bad as it appears.  I fully support the setting up of safety committees, but education and common sense are of the utmost importance in relation to the prevention of accidents and the improvement of the health and welfare of workers.  I am glad that the Department have a medical adviser.  This is well worth while because of the major technological advances.  This is an area which should be developed.  A medical officer within the Department of Labour has much to contribute to those working in industry.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to say exactly how much accidents cost.  In humanitarian terms one can never put a value on the loss of a limb or any other injury, <Col N="95" /> no matter how small.  It can never be costed in financial terms.  It is interesting to note that the Robens Report of 1972 pointed out that a trivial injury to a worker which necessitated two hours off work cost the firm over 50 times as much in terms of loss of income as it cost the injured worker. The example is given of a forklifter going around a corner too fast.  Six workers lost 20 minutes helping the injured man and three other workers lost an hour because they are depending on the injured man to supply them with materials.  There was also the cost of the damage to the forklift, the superviser's time, the medical costs and the investigation by the factory inspectorate, as well as the two hours lost by the injured worker.  Even very minor accidents can be very expensive in economic terms.</P>
    <P>I believe that this new Bill is sufficient for the present.  The emphasis should be on self-regulating systems on agreed voluntary standards between employers and workers.  There should be further development of the advisory services and industry should know that advice is freely available. There should be education of both employers and workers so that they will make the best use of the regulations in this Bill.  It is likely that when this legislation is introduced employers and employees will study the problems.  A spirit of co-operation is absolutely essential and they should be educated to ensure in their own interests and in the interests of the economy as a whole that they implement anything that will improve the safety, health and welfare of those working in industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to detain the House very long.  This Bill is of greater significance than may be generally appreciated.  While it is highly technical in its provisions, it focuses attention on an aspect of our industrialisation that is very often overlooked or not fully appreciated.  The Bill also reflects the rapid pace of industrialisation here during the past 15 years or so which entailed to a large extent a translation of workers from a rural environment to an industrial <Col N="96" /> one with the consequent health and psychological problems.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that there is great need to update our legislation in relation to the whole question of the health and safety of workers.  I cannot claim any expert knowledge of this other than the average layman's interest, but I am sorry to say that the general reaction to the Bill has been one of disappointment. Whether that is fair or unfair to the Minister I am not competent to judge, but disappointment has been expressed by interested parties who are in a position to know the implications of the Bill.  Reading the debate last week and some other documentation, I must confess that I feel inclined to add my voice to this criticism. While I recognise the need for updating our legislation on safety in industry and bringing it into line with that in most other industrial countries, the Minister was unwise to put before the House this rushed legislation.  In the light of the highly complex nature of the Bill, the technical implications and complex provisions, the Minister would have been better advised to have taken his time and to have completed a full and comprehensive review of this important and complex area.  Over the week-end I read some documentation from other countries about this question and it appears that there is more emphasis nowadays on the broader concept of this matter, the health, safety and welfare of workers. That covers a wide field, something which is not covered very well in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's approach is a pragmatic one.  One cannot disagree with the provisions but we are concerned about the need for a much more in-depth study of this area which would lead to the introduction of more comprehensive legislation.  If I wanted to be political I could try to attribute to the Minister motives as to why he rushed in with the Bill but I will resist that temptation because I regard this as a serious subject.  While I was Minister for the Gaeltacht I had a personal involvement with industrial development and with industry and for that reason I consider the Bill a disappointing measure.  The Minister <Col N="97" /> should indicate why he felt it necessary to rush in with this <i>ad hoc</i> type of legislation.  He should tell the House if he proposes to undertake a review of this broad field.  The Minister will have to set up a special review body or study group representative of professional people, experts in the various areas and representatives of employers and employees, to carry out a comprehensive examination of the whole question of the health, safety and welfare of workers.</P>
    <P>The Bill, by its title, is restrictive in the sense that it is confined to industry.  I understand, for instance, that it does not cover transport, agriculture, horticulture or fishing.  One tends to apply the term &ldquo;industry&rdquo; to those areas.  For that reason the Minister should have included them in the Bill.  The Minister should have taken his time and prepared proper comprehensive legislation.  I regret the Minister did not set up the study group.  With the pile-up of legislation that is likely to occur over the next few years it is likely that the Minister will not get back before the House with another Bill to deal with the problem I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Minister told the House, in indicating the seriousness of this problem, that between 1969 and 1975, 164 workers died.  He also gave comparative figures for Northern Ireland and the UK.  I suppose that is an inevitable result of the growth of industrialisation, a growth of a much more complex and sophisticated type of industrialisation with highly complicated machinery and technology.  However, the fact that such a large number of workers died during that period is something we must endeavour to rectify. It is also worth noting that during that period there were 1,300 industrial accidents which runs out at an average of 250 per year.  Some of those were serious accidents.</P>
    <P>As well as the human side of the story we must also consider the economic implications of industrial accidents which are obvious although difficult to quantify.  We have been told that such accidents represent a loss of £10 million in that period.  For all those reasons it is obvious that we need new legislation.  From my experience <Col N="98" /> over the years since I became a Member of this House in 1961 there has been a fantastic change in the technology of industry.  I was involved in the commencement of the Shannon scheme and I witnessed that.  The Minister has recognised that factor in some of the provisions in relation to toxic substances and certain types of plant and machinery.</P>
    <P>In a country such as ours which proceeds rapidly to industrialise there is a rapid change from a rural environment to industrial environment.  We experienced this in the Shannon region. There was no tradition of industry there, like the Gaeltacht, and some of those who had worked on little plots of land joined a modern sophisticated industrial environment.  This imposes discipline and can create great psychological shock.  Very often a period of adjustment is necessary.  I am personally very interested in this aspect of industrialisation because I believe it is very important.  There were growing pains in the Shannon Industrial Estate in relation to that and we also had problems in the Gaeltacht regions. There are physical hazards in regard to modern industry.  The Minister referred particularly to the effects on the vital senses, sight, hearing and so on.  Noise and sound levels are very important. I have seen industries which are very successful and highly organised, with modern plant and machinery, and I am sure the Minister will agree that in many cases the noise level, to people who perhaps are not accustomed to it, is difficult to become accustomed to. I am aware of workers having problems not only in regard to hearing or induced deafness that might be brought about by an environment of very high level sound, but the nervous system of the worker can also be affected and a variety of nervous conditions can result.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recognised this in the Bill.  I welcome this because there was one well-known industry in my region which was the subject of much publicity and which will remain nameless at this stage, where the question of the noise level was mentioned by many workers during the height of the controversy <Col N="99" /> about it.  I think section 13 covers the matter pretty well in that there is a new provision which would lay specific duties on occupiers to reduce the level or duration of sound where it might result in injury to the employees.  I understand most industries of that kind&mdash;mostly heavy engineering.  I suppose&mdash;have very strict and rigid medical examinations and particularly so in the case of applicants' hearing and so on.  Steps are taken to ensure that a person with a tendency to hearing defects would not be employed in such an industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon made an interesting reference to the matter of visitors to factories, a very original observation. I remember visiting a number of AnCO centres where oxy-acetylene welding was done and if unawares, and without the normal cover, shade or helmet worn for these operations, one happens to look and is blinded, it has a very serious effect.  The point raised by Deputy O'Hanlon is certainly valid and represents a new angle on this matter.  This type of equipment is used commonly even in garages and small engineering works and so on.  As regards the medical aspect, my attention was drawn to section 52 which proposes to permit the Minister to allow registered medical practitioners other than those appointed as certifying doctors under the Principal Act to medically examine young persons and certify them as fit for a particular type of work.  I am quoting from the Official Report of Tuesday, 25 April, the Minister's speech.  As I understand it&mdash;perhaps I am wrong&mdash;in addition to the factory inspectorate the Minister has a panel of doctors in various areas who are certified by his Department as examiners of persons, young people in particular, who are going into industry for the first time.  It specifically applies to the food processing industry.  Is the Minister now making it possible for any registered medical practitioner to carry out this examination or is a new scheme of examination being introduced? I assume this is under the Minister's Department but perhaps it may be the Minister for Industry, Commerce <Col N="100" /> and Energy who is responsible. I should like the Minister to elaborate on this matter.</P>
    <P>Nobody will question the wisdom of having a rigorous medical examination of young persons seeking work in the food processing industries.  I suppose that as in the case of road safety or anything of this kind, in the final analysis the important thing is to create awareness among both employers and employees, a consciousness of the need for safety.  Road safety organisations in another sphere have as their main <i>modus operandi</i> an educational process to create awareness of the risks and the possibility of accidents being ever present.  I do not know whether in the normal AnCO training schemes lectures or instruction on the question of safety are built into the courses.  I should be greatly surprised if they were not.  But it is important that when the young trainee is doing a course there is a great opportunity by proper educational methods of creating awareness among potential industrial workers of the importance of safety.  I sincerely hope AnCO provide for this in all their courses.</P>
    <P>The Minister also proposes to introduce new regulations and provisions in relation to safety committees in factories. He has fixed a figure of 20; in other countries the minimum figure is 50 but I would agree, taking the overall average in industry here that 20 is a reasonable figure and, where there are fewer than 20, there is provision to have a safety representative or small committee. The concept of having a safety committee is very important and probably the key to the whole thing.  Legislation can be introduced, debated and finally passed into law in the best form we can devise but the implementation of legislation of this kind is vitally dependent on the co-operation of all the interested bodies.  A company will be obliged by law to enforce certain regulations but a degree of co-operation and commitment is required from the workers.  The idea of a safety committee is a good one and is in accordance with normal practice in other countries.  I understand that quite <Col N="101" /> a few industries in this country have safety committees.</P>
    <P>Section 28 of the Bill is most important because it relates to toxic, highly flammable or corrosive substances.  The section will make provision for an alarm system.  Many modern industries, particularly textile plants, use enormous quantities of highly flammable substances.  I had the opportunity some years ago of doing an extensive tour of Germany and I saw there that modern industries, particularly textile firms, used vast quantities of highly toxic and flammable chemicals.  It is essential that every possible step be taken to safeguard employees, plant and the companies themselves.</P>
    <P>At the moment I am spokesman for my party on transport matters.  From a safety point of view the transport and storage of chemicals and other materials is most important.  Liquid chemicals are used in major textile processes and some industries use a substantial quantity of explosive materials. The transport and storage of such materials are vital matters.  Section 28 (2) provides that the occupier of a premises where such a dangerous substance is present will be required to post a notice setting out the safety precautions to be taken in using the substance and the arrangements in case of injury or fire.</P>
    <P>I realise that on Second Stage the complete details of a Bill are not spelled out but I am anxious to ensure that section 28 covers the actual storage, transport and the utilisation of the materials in the manufacturing process. This should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Níl mórán eile le rá agam.  Tá súil agam go néireoidh leis an mBille seo. Go háirithe, tá súil agam go rachaidh an tAire leis na moltaí atá tugtha uaimse agus ó na Teachtaí eile a labhair san díospóireacht seo faoin géar-ghá atá ann chun staidéar iomlán a dhéanamh den ábhar an-thábhachtach  seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I appreciate what the Minister has done in this case in introducing many innovations as compared with previous legislation.  Some of the Opposition speakers seem to have an insatiable <Col N="102" /> appetite for new legislation.  They have failed to recognise the extent to which technology has advanced and the tremendous changes that have taken place in the industrial scene.  We can introduce as much legislation as we like but unless we get the co-operation of employers and employees we will be wasting our time.</P>
      <P>The owners of factories and the workers should be educated regarding safety in industry.  We have a lot of trouble in industrial relations today but we must recognise that this trouble is not always for increased pay.  Very often a strike is called because of inadequate safety measures or bad working conditions.  This Bill will be a big improvement and it will make a worth-while contribution to industrial relations. In the future a Minister will have to introduce legislation quite frequently to meet ever-changing conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the industrial revolution legislation of a rather primitive type was introduced but subsequently it became more sophisticated.  Today legislation must reflect present-day needs and consideration must be given to the question of education.  When legislation is enacted it should be followed up on the factory floor, where the people whom it concerns should be well versed in what it seeks to do.  The unions and the people on the factory floor should demand that employers maintain high standards.  We must educate employers to show them that by neglecting to spend money on safety measures they are not being good economists or good employers. They must be shown that if they want good industrial units, accidents must be prevented or at least reduced.  In other countries employers are aware of this fact and they ensure that plant is maintained at a very high standard. The Japanese have brought in rules to ensure that after a very short period plant is deemed to be obsolete.  The Japanese&mdash;and Japan is one of the most industrialised nations in the world&mdash;are ensuring that the equipment in their factories is up-to-date and very efficient.  The Minister in this Bill is following the same lines on a smaller rate.  He is ensuring that plant <Col N="103" /> brought into factories will have inbuilt protection.  We will not then have to see a man's arm mangled or another man blinded because of faulty equipment.  The Minister is taking the necessary steps to prevent accidents.</P>
    <P>We are coming nearer to the push button operation of factories.  Workers must be educated to this.  There should be aptitude tests for people going into industry to see if they are suitable for the particular industry.  We could do this by having aptitude tests in the vocational schools before those people enter the factories.  This is in the interests of the men and women working in factories and in the interests also of the economy.  If we are to meet the challenge of our colleagues in the EEC we have to be as proficient as they are.  This Bill lays the basis for this proficiency.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us the most important statistics for the number of accidents caused in industry.  In 1976, 15 people were killed and in 1977, 22 people were killed.  Were those instantaneous deaths?  Do we take into consideration the people who may have contracted some industrial disease and eventually died, or the man who becomes deaf in industry and dies eventually?  I know of a very good craftsman who worked all his life in industry and became totally deaf because in his time we did not take enough steps to ensure that that excellent craftsman would not pay for his excellence by becoming deaf.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to noise pollution and the prevention of it.  This causes a lot of stress in modern life. A man working in a factory where the noise level is very high could be a more efficient worker if he did not have to put up with that noise.  We have to emphasise education in the field of industrial safety.  It is impossible to legislate for the human element, which plays a big part on the factory floor.  I worked on a factory floor.  I now admit that I often took goggles off because they were a bit cumbersome or that I would not wear a protective helmet or gloves sometimes because they were cumbersome. Perhaps I was one of the lucky people <Col N="104" /> who did not suffer damage.  There are many others who have suffered permanent damage because they took off protective goggles or gloves.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that there is education in industrial safety as well as this Bill.  The trade unions, the employers' organisations and the State should help in this matter.  We can enact all the legislation we like but unless we can make sure it is applied we are not doing the job we are here to do.</P>
    <P>When a man in a factory has to wear a mask it can become annoying at times.  If that man has a chest complaint which makes breathing difficult he will often feel like tearing that mask off his mouth.  He may then inhale deadly fumes and in a few years' time, or even a few months' time, he could be a victim of pollution. We are often very critical of absenteeism in industry and the result of hangovers, but this is only a very small part of absenteeism.  This is called industrial morbidity nowadays. It still means there is something wrong with the person who is absent from work.</P>
    <P>We are ensuring in this Bill that a roof is on the factory and that the walls are not damp.  Up to this there was no provision like that.  A man who is not feeling too well and who knows that he will have to face six, seven or eight hours a day in a factory, which is damp and unheated, may decide he will not put up with that.  We will not have an efficient industrial arm in the country if those are the conditions workers have to put up with.  If an employer cannot afford to have a reasonably well kept premises, should he be in industry?  It will not be an efficient unit and the people employed in that industry will not be very happy.  Many of those things lead to industrial unrest.</P>
    <P>We often blame workers who go on strike, but sometimes the strike is not their fault.  If we had an educated employer body and if the worker on the factory floor was educated to realise that legislation was passed in his interest and that we want to ensure that people working in factories do not become the victims of some <Col N="105" /> disease, I believe we would have less unrest in industry.  The Minister under this Bill can legislate by order.  Change in the industrial scene takes place so often that if every time we wanted to change something we had to have a Bill passed through the Dáil and the Seanad it would take a long time.  We should welcome the Minister's determination to act quickly because this will prevent accidents.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised at the Minister's figures regarding safety committees.  I served on one and I do not believe anybody takes them seriously.  There are many reasons why people do not take them seriously.  Safety committees have to meet fairly regularly.  Most people who work in factories work very hard and are interested in their work.  They do not like breaking off work to attend safety committee meetings. They may also feel that the safety committee is not an effective body, that they can make recommendations but find they are not accepted.  I have seen many gruesome accidents in industry.  I do not know if the safety committee would have prevented any of them.  The human element must be taken into consideration in all such accidents.  There is always the person who will take a chance.  In politics we call it brinkmanship and in the industrial scene one may be called chicken if one takes too many precautions.  One must be thought brave and not take precautions. I emphasise the great need for education.  It must be driven home that when we legislate for industrial safety we are legislating for the worker.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the introduction of the aptitude test on a much broader scale in vocational schools and so on to ensure that people end up in the jobs most suited to them. In the past a son had to follow his father's trade whether he liked it or not.  If people are happy in their work there will be less industrial unrest and human tragedy.  If people dislike their employment they tend to become accident-prone because of their frustrations, and are less efficient.  When this legislation has been passed people will have to be educated so that they will <Col N="106" /> know how to use the legislation properly. If people know what it is about they will co-operate in making it work.</P>
    <P>Under section 24 the Minister deals with docks, wharfs and so on.  In the last 20 years or so the whole docks scene was changed, the mode of transport, the mode of importation and exportation has changed.  There are roll-on roll-off services whereby trucks can be driven on to a ship at Le Havre or some such place and driven off at Dublin or Rosslare.  Our regulations in relation to the changing docks scene must be updated to ensure the efficient running of the docks.  On the docks there is road traffic, ships are tied up and the water is nearby and people are killed not only by industrial accidents but by road accidents and by accidental drowning.  I am glad the Minister is insisting on greater stringency in relation to safety on the docks.  There was a frightful accident in America the other day where people were killed because of faulty scaffolding.  Such grave accidents could occur here if we use faulty equipment.</P>
    <P>Because of the rapidly changing times we need interim legislation such as this.  The Minister is empowered under this Bill to make orders on certain things and this will help a lot. We cannot sit by and decide to introduce legislation that must go before the Parliamentary Draftsman, the Houses of the Oireachtas, the President, and after a certain amount of delay it will be in force, because technology is moving too fast.  About 30 years or so ago a film called &ldquo;Modern Times&rdquo; was made by Charlie Chaplin which was a satire on industrial expansion and in this film are portrayed the dangers which beset industrial workers and the pathetic attempts of the employers to speed up production at the cost of lives and a decent way of living.  I hope that the Minister, in co-operation with AnCO, the vocational schools, the trade union and employer organisations, will bring home to people that we wish to uphold the dignity of man on the industrial scene.</P>
    <P>We escaped the worst horrors of the industrial revolution when, in the time of Charles Dickens, child labour <Col N="107" /> was employed, and we have come a long way towards having acceptable industrial standards, but we must face the rapidly changing industrial scene. We are now into what could be called a technological revolution.  In a few years' time if we are to solve the unemployment problem people will be working only two or three days a week and will have to be educated in the proper use of leisure time, but there will always be factories to manufacture the things we want to use.  There are very few unskilled labourers in factories now, they are all at least semi-skilled. As we move on into the computer age the highest paid workers will be people who will do the most menial tasks which cannot be done by automation and we must ensure the safety of these people.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we must ensure that any legislation put forward is the best we can come up with; it must be effective, it must be acceptable to those working on the factory floors, and these people must be educated as to how to use the legislation.  Each worker must know that his rights and claims are backed by the State through legislation.  The employers must apply this legislation to ensure industrial safety, the dignity of men and women and the efficiency of industry. Unless we have a very good code of safety, workers will be in danger, and industry will be inefficient, because people will revolt against dangerous conditions at work and there will be strikes.  When we hear of strikes in factories let us not be too quick to blame the strikers.  The situation should be examined to see how much irritation has been caused to the people there by the fact that there were not proper safety measures.  I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill and look forward to hearing his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of commenting on this Safety in Industry Bill, 1978.  While all legislation, especially legislation to enforce safety, is very welcome and to be commended, one would hope and wish <Col N="108" /> for a little more in this case.  Deputy Moore put his finger on it when he said that the necessity for a comprehensive charter in this area was sticking out a mile but made the point that interim measures were necessary to meet day-to-day demands in industry and other spheres of activity.  That is accepted by all.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill, as is stated in the explanatory memorandum, is to update and amend the Factories Act, 1955 which is the main Act providing for the safety, health and welfare of workers in industry.  The Bill is also an enabling measure to implement certain regulations and to tighten up generally on existing regulations.  I am sure the Minister would agree that a more comprehensive type of Bill consolidating all existing legislation would be preferable to what is now before us, but I appreciate the reason for not having that.  I assume that it would take much longer to produce, and the Minister in his enthusiasm to plug holes in the existing legislation and to improve on existing regulations has sought to introduce this.  I would hope that when he has had experience of his Bill being implemented in the overall context of existing legislation he will produce what the last speaker referred to as a comprehensive charter.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that the Minister has taken note of the fact that the European Parliament are very interested in this area and working documents are in existence which will, hopefully, lay the basis for a comprehensive international charter on safety at work in the not too distant future.  I hope that when this is adopted in Brussels the Minister will have it enshrined in domestic comprehensive legislation here consolidating all existing Acts, regulations, orders and so on.  One is struck by the number of regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the activities of successive Governments in this area as &ldquo;<i>ad hoc-ery</i>&rdquo;, and that expression probably gets the message across.  The industrial revolution as we know it never affected this country as it affected England in the last century and our industrial development has been sluggish and slow.  For that reason, we as a nation and a people <Col N="109" /> were not forced into action in this area except on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis as demands were made.  In other words, we did not have to sit down, look at the situation and say to ourselves &ldquo;We are now in the middle of a massive industrial expansion; we will have to lay down some ground rules for the safety of workers and so on and introduce legislation on a broad basis for that purpose&rdquo;.  We were not in that position, and I suppose these historical reasons have resulted in this kind of approach to legislation in this area. But now it is time for us to take an in-depth look at what is happening in this sphere of activity as we are now embarked on a policy of industrial expansion and revolution, albeit in the 20th century.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which is new to our people&mdash;and on which I speak with some first-hand experience&mdash;is that our rural community are being given a major industrial centre and suddenly they are drawn into a new way of life, into something of which they have no experience before.  They are now in highly industrial work and that calls for very serious consideration by the Minister and the Government if we are serious in our attempts to bring major industrial expansion into rural Ireland.  In this context of industrial expansion there is a revolution taking place all over the world in technology. This is happening in a very sensitive, subtle manner and in many cases we do not realise that it is taking place. We have examples of it in this country where, through the efforts of the IDA under successive Ministers and Governments, we have industries brought in using what could be regarded as space technology in the form of processing. They are using substances which were never heard of up to now and which may normally come from very advanced industrial countries.  I am speaking of places like West Germany, the USA, Japan, the UK and so on.  Suddenly we find this monster in our midst and in our innocence in many cases we do not realise the dangers which we face through close proximity to different types of processing with different substances, liquid chemicals and so on.  Because we have no experience of these and they have <Col N="110" /> been thrown into our midst I am not saying that we should reject this kind of industrial expansion.  We should not, but we should prepare for it.  We should know what it is all about in so far as that is possible.  Education is one aspect of industrial safety that has been neglected in the past.  There is no point in putting a &ldquo;danger&rdquo; notice on a factory wall if the employee is not <i>au fait</i> with the dangers that are involved.  In other words, he must be advised and told in detail what the process involved is, for instance, how dangerous is a chemical used in the factory or what degree of heat is considered to be safe.  Armed with this knowledge the logical reaction of the average man or woman on the factory floor would be to comply with the safety regulations laid down.  Therefore, this question of a ministerial order providing for the placing of a notice on a machine or on a factory wall is not in itself sufficient. We must try to go much further to provide information whether by way of seminars or through the media generally.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the Bill that I find very strange.  It has been referred to already and it is the fact that the trade unions seem to be ignored. I do not suppose that the Minister has tried deliberately in any way to squeeze out the trade unions in so far as this legislation is concerned because he knows, as we all know, that without the co-operation of the organised labour force we cannot hope to have regulations in the safety sphere implemented to any degree of satisfaction. Therefore, the co-operation of the unions in regard to this legislation or indeed in regard to any legislation concerning safety in the work place is of paramount importance.  Paragraph 7 of document 480/77 points out that this effort requires not only a strengthening of the collaboration between member states and the Commission but also the increasing participation of management and labour in decisions and actions in the field of safety, hygiene and protection at work at all levels particularly at the level of implementing comprehensive legislation.</P>
    <P>When I talk of the labour force here <Col N="111" /> I mean the organised labour force.  In this context it is strange and disappointing that there is no mention of the part that might be played by unions in regard to the legislation.  I trust that the Minister will explain this to us.  Presumably, the Minister is anxious that there be full participation on the part of the unions in ensuring that whatever measures are introduced are both workable and are made to work through co-operation, participation and collaboration.</P>
    <P>Another point that I find intriguing relates to paragraph (c) of the explanatory memorandum which refers to the servicing and maintaining of plant and machinery being undertaken by male adults.  I am pointing to this because the Minister might find himself in some difficulty in relation to it.  I note that in other instances females are being excluded, for obvious reasons, from certain processes but at a time when we are talking of equality, I should like the Minister to explain the reference in this instance to male adults.  It does not bother me but there are people who will be anxious to know why in this case, and for no obvious reason, the reference is to male adults.</P>
    <P>The other omission from the Bill that I regard as being significant is the exclusion of agriculture.  I have mentioned the question of high technology.  In agriculture, thankfully, we are entering a phase of high technology.  While I am not in possession of the figures for accidents in this our biggest industry I would assume that the number of accidents arising from agricultural pursuits and resulting in serious injuries or sometimes in death is quite high in comparison with the number of accidents in the accepted form of industrial work, that is, in factories.  When one considers the kind of machinery that is used in agriculture and the types of substances in the form of weed killers and so on that are used, the omission of agriculture from the proposed regulations is both significant and disappointing.</P>
    <P>Reading through some documentation <Col N="112" /> in this whole field one is struck by the small number of factory inspectors who are asked to ensure the implementation of the existing regulations. I am sure the Minister will agree that the present level of 45 inspectors is not sufficient to ensure that the regulations under current legislation can be implemented to the satisfaction of all concerned.  One can only assume that these inspectors are overworked. On this question of inspection there are a few points on which I should like clarification.  First, there is the question of fire regulations, fire escapes and so on.  These matters concern the Department of the Environment because at planning permission stage when a person proposing to build a factory applies to the local authority for the necessary permission, the local fire chief is the person who lays down the regulations concerning the provision of fire escapes and so on.  However, the problem here is that the capitalist approach is always present as is the profit motive.  There is a danger of a situation coming about in which in a factory for which planning permission has been obtained in compliance with planning regulations, it is found at a later stage and after the factory has been built that some of the conditions are not adhered to because of pressure of production and so on.  Fire exits might be blocked up, not permanently but there may not be clear access to them, and so on.  This is a clear breach of both planning conditions and regulations under the Factories Acts or other regulations concerning fire hazards.  Who would be responsible in that case for having the matter rectified?</P>
    <P>Transport seems to have suffered the same fate as agriculture.  As we all know transport is one area which is causing grave concern because of the revolution which has occurred from the sheer volume of transport and the tonnage of units of transport being used on roads which were never meant to carry this kind of transport.  This necessitates a rethinking of our approach to safety in this area of activity.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in this case because he is dealing with the environment, probably <Col N="113" /> the Department of Justice and a plethora of regulations from the EEC concerning transport.  It is time the Minister looked at this area to see where his responsibility lies.  Having done that he should then take action to ensure that employees are given every protection possible.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made in the Bill and in the explanatory memorandum of substances which are toxic, asphyxiant and so on.  The transport of these substances falls under the heading of the safety of people.  In my area there is a very large industry, for which we are very grateful, using what has been accepted as being a very dangerous substance.  This substance is transported from Dublin to the west by rail.  Every precaution has been taken and the management who are concerned primarily with planning conditions have adhered to the letter of the law.  I understand CIE have also taken every precaution and realise their responsibility in the transporting of this substance.  Every precaution must be taken when this substance is being transported by road.  Has the Minister any regulations or conditions in mind which he feels would be necessary to ensure this safety?</P>
    <P>CIE's regulations are very strict but are they self-imposed or have they been imposed by any specific regulation? If they are not so imposed I suggest that legislation be introduced covering that area because if we are to expand industrially we would, hopefully, see many more high technology industries coming here using dangerous substances which can be handled safely and for which definitive and strict arrangements would be laid down, applied and adhered to.</P>
    <P>Education in the sphere of safety at work has been mentioned by many people.  I am glad the Minister introduced a section concerning the appointment of a safety officer for places of employment which have under 20 employees and committees for factories and workshops which are in excess of 20 employees.  This is a welcome innovation. Unless management are briefed on what these committees do&mdash; they are not there to cause trouble, they are not there to hold up production <Col N="114" /> but they are there for the safety of people&mdash;they will not have any more success than other individuals and committees which are on factory floors for certain purposes because management have the wrong impression of what their work is.</P>
    <P>The abolition of risks at work, anything that leads to the diminution in the number or causes of accidents, is in the long run in the interests of management.  Although hygiene and safety measures cost money, the safety of employees will pay off both for the employee and the employer.  It is not a question of employer versus employee although that idea is deeply ingrained in our society, probably for historical reasons more than anything else.  It is a wrong approach.  Unless we can get away from that approach this legislation will not work to the satisfaction of either the Minister or anybody else.</P>
    <P>Finally, I reiterate the hope that we will be here in the not-too-distant future discussing a comprehensive Bill designed to consolidate all the Acts, orders and regulations already covering this area.  We need a comprehensive measure embracing all kinds of workers in every sphere of activity. Industrial training has actually been brought in under the umbrella of this Bill.  That is something for which we should be grateful.  When we pass a comprehensive Bill we will have done a good day's work and I hope that when the Minister gets the opportunity, having consulted with his partners in Brussels to find out what they intend doing, he will introduce a comprehensive Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>We all hope this Bill will help to promote greater safety in industry and reduce the incidence of accidents among industrial workers. Over the years fatality figures have been rather low.  The Minister referred to an increase from 15 deaths in 1976 to 22 deaths in 1977.  We all share his concern about this statistic and any measure taken to prevent fatalities or, at least, reduce the number is certainly appreciated and will, we hope, be helpful to all involved.  The figures I have mentioned represent an increase of 50 per cent over 1975.  That is a cause for serious concern and the <Col N="115" /> whole question of industrial safety must be considered as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>How safety conscious are we as a nation?  How safety conscious is the average industrial worker?  From my own experience and that of others with whom I have discussed this aspect the average Irish worker is very lax in his approach to safety in the execution of his job.  He lags behind our European counterparts in this respect.  I have visited a number of factories in European countries, some large, some not so large, and some very similar to what we have here.  Many employ fewer than 100 workers.  There was one area that stood out.  I refer to the various safety measures taken to protect workers physically and mentally. Safety committees are strong and representative.  There is a strict monitoring of systems and procedures. If it is necessary to introduce some new measures this is done without any waste of time with the full co-operation of all concerned.</P>
      <P>Here, unfortunately, the attitude of many firms is to do very little or nothing at all until something serious happens&mdash;someone is killed or maimed for life.  The first objective is to get it over to everyone&mdash;management, employer, worker&mdash;that they should be forever conscious of their obligations to observe safety standards. Insurance companies could play a very important role here.  I know there are certain legislative provisions and I know insurance companies carry out very thorough inspections of premises and equipment initially.  Subsequent inspections are less frequent and less thorough.  Factory inspectors could have a greater liaison with insurance companies.  That would be worth while and very beneficial in the maintenance of proper safety standards. Factory safety committees should be able to work out with management mutual arrangements. Trade unions could also play their part in ensuring better safety standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsibility on employers and management to take all the requisite measures to guarantee the safety of <Col N="116" /> their workers is very clear.  Every worker is entitled to maximum protection and maximum conditions of safety.  But this is a two-fold exercise. It may be suggested that the greater onus should be on the worker to see that his safety is ensured and to see that every reasonable step is taken to guarantee his safety.  Section 8 sets out in detail the obligation on workers to protect their own and other workers' safety, health and general welfare.  The penalty for an offence is being increased.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that enforcing regulations like these can be difficult unless there is a clear understanding, a good working agreement and liaison, between management and workers. Unfortunately fear of being caught out by departmental officials is still the most effective deterrent of all.  The Minister said in his opening speech that of a total of 18,000 premises there are only 250 safety committees on the factories register.  The Bill provides for the appointment by workers of safety committees, and that failure on the part of the workers to look after their own interests puts the onus back on employers.  I hope we will be able to get better co-operation from the workers themselves.  We must remember they are the people whom an industrial safety Bill is all about.</P>
    <P>For a number of reasons I would not consider it satisfactory to put complete responsibility on management.  The average small employer in modern times feels the heavy burden of too many departmental rules and regulations. They are responsible by statute for a number of things such as social welfare, PAYE, VAT and so on.  These things take up a lot of time and they have become a costly undertaking for small employers.  What can such employers do if employees fail to co-operate in the matter of safety measures, which are in their own interests, and if at the same time they are to maintain a satisfactory working relationship?</P>
    <P>On the other side there are several managements who are always putting aside a task to another day and indeed some of them who never do them <Col N="117" /> at all.  In some cases it is due to mere carelessness and in others to deliberate attempts to avoid investing in measures necessary to comply with regulations.  Therefore, I suggest that many more inspectors will be needed if this Bill is to be implemented with the degree of satisfaction we would all hope for.  The Department's inspectorate, first of all, must take the initiative, because the inspectors will be responsible to ensure that committees will be set up, that they will be fully briefed in regard to their responsibilities, that they will be composed of responsible people, and that a good working liaison will be maintained between the factories and the works committees on a mandatory regular basis.  Regular meetings of workers, a series of lectures and suitable films on safety, are things that will be helpful to instil in the minds of all concerned the importance and urgency of the safety precautions for workers.  In this debate we are not just talking about workers but we must think of their families, their children.</P>
    <P>There are also many responsibilities on employers in this context, and unfortunately it is true to say that too many employers do not accept such responsibilities.  The average Irishman is rather embarrassed when it comes to taking precautionary measures for safety at work.  For instance, he is reluctant to wear safe clothing, a helmet, gloves, protective boots and so on.  This is a problem that must be overcome psychologically.  It can be done only by example and leadership from the top.</P>
    <P>We have been putting a lot of emphasis on the factory and workshop floor.  In my opinion building sites must be specifically mentioned&mdash; the extent of the carelessness at some building sites is unbelievable.  There is shoddy equipment such as inadequate scaffolding, inadequate ladders with loose rungs or rungs missing, among other things.  The conditions at some sites are so extremely dangerous that workers take their lives in their hands.  It is, however, fair to say that bigger building contractors do not fit into that category, but far too many of our small building concerns <Col N="118" /> do.  Unfortunately it is difficult to keep track of the movements of such builders, who frequently move from site to site and, as we all know, change their work force very often.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances one must ask how a safety committee or an official could operate, or whether it would be possible at all to appoint a committee in such situations.  This brings us back to the number of inspectors.  As I said earlier, the deterrents against taking risks with workers' lives must be severe.  If necessary, careless operators should be forced out of business if they are not prepared to invest in safety measures. There are inadequate fire precautions in many buildings today.  There are firms on whose premises escapes such as emergency doors and windows have been blocked up in the daily battle against vandalism.  I understand that we had an example of vandalism in the city last week and it was a miracle that the consequences of that experience were not more serious and that lives were not lost.  I sympathise with the owners of businesses who find it necessary to take such strict precautions against vandals, but we must get our priorities right.  The safety and the lives of our workers must be our priority.</P>
    <P>Fire drill is another neglected area, because only a few firms carry out fire drill.  Noticing the condition of fire extinguishers in many places, I often wonder whether they would work if required.</P>
    <P>The educational aspect of this matter has been stressed by many speakers.  The vocational schools and AnCO should impress on youngsters the importance of safety and care in any job.  Schools and training groups can do a great deal of good work in guiding young people into suitable areas of employment.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that this is an important Bill and I am sure that every Member of the House will agree with him.  The Minister has been criticised for not introducing a new Bill.  It has been suggested that we are merely debating additions to the 1955 Act.  This may well be, but if <Col N="119" /> the additions set out in this Bill are properly enforced they should be of considerable assistance to those who are seriously concerned with the safety of workers in industry.  My view is that, even if we are discussing a number of additions, it is better to get on with the job and put this Bill through the House as quickly as possible and to contribute in our own way to the removal of the serious risks to workers in industry.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the Minister intends to get this Bill through as soon as possible and that the provisions in section 1, which are normal provisions, will allow him to introduce different provisions at different times, if necessary.  I wish the Minister success in putting this Bill through the House.  I am sure that every Deputy will echo my view in regard to changing the attitude of people in industry towards safety.  I hope that employers and employees will be more conscious of the way in which they perform their jobs and more conscious of the conditions to which they are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point I should like to make in relation to the Bill is that it mainly consists of a revision of some of the measures in the 1955 Act.  It is my contention that something more is required than a simple revision of the terms of the 1955 Act, which was a revision of an earlier British Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain that the conditions in and pattern of our industry have changed profoundly since 1955 and we require a more comprehensive instrument than the one before us, and I felt this last June when I circulated proposals that I described as a discussion document on legislation for the safety and health of industrial workers.  These proposals were circulated for public information and for discussion by employers and trade unions.  I am somewhat surprised to find the main features of that discussion document duplicated in this Bill.  Of course, time was running out for that administration when the proposals were circulated to the social partners on 29 June and some days <Col N="120" /> later the Government changed.  The intention I had in sending out those proposals was that a public debate would commence between employers and unions; that at the end of that public debate the Department officials and the Minister concerned would set about the drafting of a comprehensive new measure in tune with modern circumstances. Whether the Minister, with commendable haste, wishes to get an instrument out rapidly or not, I do not know, but whatever his reason I find the discussion proposals of June incorporated in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann expresses alarm at the unreasonable increase in the cost of house building and deplores the Government's failure to take remedial action.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Minister for the Environment has tabled an amendment to this motion in rather peculiar terms. He proposes to delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;expresses confidence in the steps taken by the Government to regulate house building costs&rdquo;.  I am sure there was a long and learned discussion about the word &ldquo;regulate&rdquo; and I am sure that other words were put in and struck out.  Eventually the word &ldquo;regulate&rdquo; was agreed upon. It is noticeable that the Minister does not take credit for reducing, moderating, or controlling house prices.  He picks on this peculiar word &ldquo;regulate&rdquo;.  I await with interest the Minister's explanation of what he means by &ldquo;regulate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The recent dramatic increase in the cost of houses and house building has far outpaced inflation, wages and salaries, and has already devoured the £1,000 new house grant introduced by the Government.  It has made the increase in the small dwellings acquisition loan from £4,500 to £7,500, which many people thought would solve their difficulties, quite useless and ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> In reply to questions which I put down recently to the Minister for the Environment, I got some very interesting information which I submit requires an explanation from the Minister.</P>
    <P>In reply to those questions I learned that the price of the average grant house increased from £12,870 in the quarter ending March 1977 to £15,345 in the quarter ending March 1978.  That represents an average increase of £2,475 or 19.2 per cent compared with the previous 12 months.  It is certainly an increase of 13.7 per cent in the previous 12 months.  It is certainly good-bye to the £1,000 new house grant, as it was called.  Even at this stage the increase in the small dwellings loan from £4,500 to £7,500 has been eroded almost out of existence.</P>
    <P>These increases are all the more alarming and certainly require an explanation when we take into consideration the fact that, during the same 12 months during which these increases took place, inflation was running at 9 per cent, and the Minister boasts about that.  Over the very same period the average percentage increase in the house building index was 11.6 per cent.  According to any reasonable yardstick, or any yardstick available to me, these prices are quite unreasonable and are far too high.</P>
    <P>For example, the national wage agreement provides for an increase of 8 per cent approximately in wages and incomes.  That is regarded as a reasonable increase in incomes.  We understand the Minister for Agriculture has some sort of a similar increase in mind for the farmers.  Furthermore, the Minister for the Environment, when dealing with the local authorities and estimating what their budget should be for the current year, decided that an increase in rates of 11 per cent would be reasonable.  Apparently he satisfied himself that an increase of 11 per cent would be sufficient for the local authorities to carry on their services for the current 12 months.</P>
    <P>Yet we find the price of houses in the past 12 months gone up by almost 20 per cent.  The Minister was elected on a programme to control prices. There is an entire page on price control <Col N="122" /> in the Fianna Fáil manifesto and, in the section of the manifesto dealing with local government, the Minister pledged he would make it easier to buy a house.  He has done absolutely nothing about that.  In fact, it is far more difficult to buy a house now than when the Minister assumed office because the cost of a house has far outpaced any increase in the house builders' wages or income.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised this matter during the concluding stages of the debate on the Estimate for the Department of the Environment last week. In his reply the Minister referred to Deputy O'Donnell's contribution.  I will read what the Minister said because I am not clear on exactly what he means.  As reported at column 1639 of the Official Report of 27 April 1978 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>This morning Deputy O'Donnell referred to the increase in the average price of houses in the first quarter of 1977 and the first quarter of 1978.  The Deputy should refresh his memory on this matter.  On 3 March 1978 my Department published a quarterly bulletin of housing statistics for the quarter ended 31 December 1977.  The Press release that accompanied the bulletin indicated that the average gross price of new houses for which loans were approved by the main lending agencies increased by 20 per cent last year compared with 1976.  The corresponding increase of 19 per cent in prices in the building and construction industry generally should also be mentioned.  Since April 1973 house prices, house costs and earnings have fluctuated considerably but the stage has now been reached where increases in house prices, house costs and average earnings have been broadly in line with each other.  There is nothing new in the written reply to Deputy Fitzpatrick to which Deputy O'Donnell referred this morning.  The increase is slightly under 20 per cent.  It was 20 per cent for the whole of 1977 and it has averaged 19 per cent since 1973. It is not suddenly an unusual occurrence.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to know what point the <Col N="123" /> Minister is making or what he is boasting about, if he is boasting.  The only reasonable construction I can put on it is that the Minister is satisfied with an increase of 20 per cent in the price of house building for the quarter ending in March last as compared with the quarter ending in March 1977.  If that is so, I am amazed.  He goes on to say price increases have kept in line with the increase in salaries and wages.  That is not so.  There has been a 20 per cent increase in houses and an 8 per cent increase in wages. According to information in reply to a question on 26 April, the cost of building a house increased by 11.6 per cent.  I fully appreciate that this does not include the cost of land but it includes everything else, although a footnote states that it does not take into account overheads, profits, and so on.  Of course it does; they are built into the previous price and this percentage is put on.</P>
    <P>That statement by the Minister seems to be an abdication of the task he undertook and a throwing in of the towel.  We may talk about percentage points but the figures given by the Minister show clearly that the average price of a grant house increased by £2,475 between March 1977 and March 1978.  That needs an explanation.  The sum of £2,475 is, in round figures, two-and-a-half times the £1,000 grant and it very nearly closes the gap between the increase in local authority loans from £4,500 to £7,500.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the percentage increase in house building costs since Fianna Fáil came into office.  From 1 April 1977 to 1 July 1977 the housebuilding cost index increased by 1.44 per cent.  From 1 July 1977 to 1 October 1977 the increase had jumped to 2.98 per cent and between 1 October 1977 and 1 January 1978 the increase had rocketed to 3.42 per cent&mdash;nearly three times what it was when Fianna Fáil came into office.  They assumed office for the purpose of controlling prices and making it easier to buy a house.  If the Minister is satisfied with these figures then he is easily pleased, <Col N="124" /> and God help young people who want to make a home and buy a house.</P>
    <P>When we find the average increase in the house building cost index during the 12 months ending March last running at 11.6 per cent and the average increase in the cost of a house during the same period running at 19.2 per cent, we must look for an explanation.  I will give one explanation. The cost of the site is included in the price of the house, which has increased by 19.2 per cent, but the cost of the site is not included in the house building cost index, which has increased by only 11.6 per cent.  It is obvious that there are land barons who are speculating in building land in a most disgraceful way and they are getting away with it.  These site brokers particularly around Dublin, bought sites some years ago and have watched them appreciating in value. They found that if they wanted to build grant-type houses on these sites and applied for a certificate of reasonable value, the certificate would be based on the price that these gentlemen had paid for the land, plus holding charges.  Therefore, they would not regard it as profitable enough to pass on the sites to the house purchasers at the price which they paid, plus reasonable interest charges.  They are selling these sites to small builders at inflated prices and when the small builders apply for certificates of reasonable value the certificates are based on the price that the small builders have to pay.</P>
    <P>I understand that these site barons are really ceasing to be building contractors or are building only luxury dwellings on part of the land acquired and selling the remainder to small builders at these inflated prices.  I want to know why the Minister is not doing something about that.  It is one explanation of why the index shows an increase of 11.6 per cent and the price of a house over the same period shows an increase of 19.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>The certificate of reasonable value was introduced in an effort to control house prices.  In fact it is being used to delay grant approval and to subject the purchasers of houses to stamp duty at 3 per cent.  I am told that in some <Col N="125" /> cases the delay in issuing these certificates is quite unreasonable.  There has been an improvement since the new year.  For the first six months of the Fianna Fáil administration there was quite a go slow in this.  It has been said that the purchase of a house is by far the biggest single purchase that most people will ever make.  Many people enter into a contract to buy a house on the understanding that the £1,000 is available and then find that because the house does not qualify for a certificate of reasonable value the grant is not payable, and the conveyance of the house becomes liable to stamp duty at 3 or 4 per cent often involving a payment of £400 or £500. The law should be changed and people should be relieved from such contracts even contracts which do not specifically guarantee the £1,000 grant but where people were led to believe that the grant was available.  It is unreasonable to charge stamp duty on new houses because all new houses are adding to the national stock of houses and they should be free of stamp duty.</P>
    <P>The Minister applied the system of the certificate of reasonable value to flats.  I admit that prior to the change of Government no grants were payable in respect of flats but it was possible to get a certificate exempting flats from stamp duty.  Since the Minister changed the system, certificates of reasonable value are required if flats are to be exempt from stamp duty. We find that since the Minister came to office certificates of reasonable value were issued in respect of only 55 flats.  We know that flats are being built all over the city and that flats are becoming a way of life for many people.  Only 55 flats have qualified for the certificate because the Minister refuses to recognise a sales policy in respect of flats.  It is obvious that some flats in a scheme would sell for much more than others because of location and so on, but the Minister insists on averaging the entire scheme and dividing it by the number of flats in it and the result in most cases is that none of the flats qualifies for a certificate. The further result is that all new flats purchased there are subject to stamp duty of 3 or 4 per cent.  I suggest that the Minister take each flat on its <Col N="126" /> merits and value it according to its location and issue a certificate where flats qualify for a certificate.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the £1,000 grant has disappeared, it has been gobbled up by the builders and the site barons but at best it is a restricted scheme.  It should but does not apply to people who bought secondhand houses a few years ago and who want to improve their accommodation by building a new house.  During the election campaign it was stated that this grant would provide a deposit, and great play was made about the fact that no longer would young married couples have to hunt for a deposit, that they would get it from Fianna Fáil in the shape of this grant.  We find now that it does not provide a deposit because it is not payable until the person is living in the house.  By that time people would have had to pay the full cost of the house.</P>
    <P>Whether the Minister realises it or not, the most recent power of investigation which he is seeking in regard to the £1,000 grant will discourage people from applying for it altogether. In this year's Finance Bill which has just been circulated the Revenue Commissioners are being authorised to supply confidential information regarding applicants for the housing grant to the Minister for the Environment.  Information given by the tax payer to the inspector of taxes is to be given by the Revenue Commissioners to the Minister for the Environment so that it may be checked and, no doubt, cross-checked.  This is a completely new departure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It looks like a device for cutting down on applications for housing grants.  There is no doubt that the Government are cutting down drastically on local authority building and this will force people to buy houses at exorbitant prices.  The record shows that whereas a sum of £28,601,000 was requested and £22,678,000 was granted in respect of work in progress on local authority <Col N="128" /> houses at the beginning of this year only £13,914,000 was requested and only a paltry £4,665,000 was granted for new houses during the current year.  The largest sum was requested and allocated for work in progress, work that was sanctioned by the last Government.</P>
      <P>When we come to the second half of this year we find that the amount of finance requested by local authorities for houses is cut by nearly one-fifth. The Government are certainly living up to their White Paper which I have here, but which I have not time to read out.  In that document&mdash;and it is on the records of the House&mdash;the Government promised to put local authority housing low down on the priority list and they have done just that.  I am further told that the effect of this&mdash;I can see that the Chair is a bit uneasy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to get the Deputy back to the motion.  Local authority housing is really not relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): If the Chair will wait a moment&mdash;I think I have shown beyond yea or nay that the price of houses has jumped dramatically by nearly £2,500 per house.  The effect will be to put these houses out of reach of many people who would ordinarily be expected as a result to be accommodated by local authorities. On the other side, the supply of local authority houses will be contracted; the money will be withdrawn and the number of local authority houses will be reduced dramatically.  That means that because of the failure of the Minister to control the price of houses and his failure to give local authorities sufficient money to build houses these unfortunate people will be left without houses.  Nothing could be more relevant to a motion which is expressing alarm at the dramatic increase in the price of houses and which deplores the failure of the Government to take remedial action.  The Government could take remedial action by building more local authority houses; they are doing the very opposite, closing down on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> There is another serious matter in regard to the housing situation and the alarming increase in prices. Building societies are experiencing a substantial cutback in investment income. Last week the Minister denied that in this House but I want to put on record again that there is no doubt about it.  The chief executive of one of the principal building societies went on the radio since and confirmed that they were experiencing a cutback in investment income.  From inquiries I made since last week from another one of the big five I am satisfied that investment income is not only slowing down but drying up.</P>
    <P>One building society which was lending money up to about a month ago to members who had £1,000 on deposit for six months has changed its policy and it will now only lend money to members who have money invested with them for 12 months or more.  Is that not evidence that they have not the money to lend?  Otherwise, they would not be taking steps to slow down applications first, by making it a condition that applicants have money invested with them for six months and now by stipulating that applications will not be entertained unless the applicants have money invested with the society for 12 months.  How in the face of that can the Minister say that there is no change&mdash;in the wrong direction&mdash;in the building societies?  Of course there is.</P>
    <P>The position is that the price of grant houses has increased by 20 per cent in round figures or by £2,445. The Minister seems to be satisfied. The second point is that the Government are cutting back&mdash;savagely, I must say&mdash;in the building of local authority houses in accordance with their policy as outlined in the White Paper.  Thirdly, finance for building societies is slowing up and applications are being put on the long finger by these societies.  I await with interest to hear the steps the Government have taken to regulate house building costs. Flowing from all this I can see some very anti-social effects.  As I see it, there is no way in which a young married man on his own income can afford to finance the building of a <Col N="130" /> house that is increasing at a rate of £2,500 approximately.  Apparently, the Minister is quite prepared to let it go on at that rate and accept it as a normal increase.  The inevitable event is that his wife must go out to work whether she likes it or not.  I believe married women have the right to work if they want to do so and the Government of which I was a member saw that, but I do not believe that young married women should be driven out against their will to work to provide a house or help their husbands provide it.  That is anti-social and a move in the wrong direction.  It also adds to our unemployment problem because many young women are quite prepared to stay at home when married and look after the house and babies when they arrive.  In many cases the one thing that ensures wives will neglect the home or at least absent themselves from it and put themselves on the labour market is an unreasonable house mortgage.  I call on the Minister here and now to tell us what steps he has taken to regulate and reduce building costs&mdash;that is what the manifesto says.</P>
    <P>I was going to spend a few hours going through debates about housing that took place here last year and in previous years but I decided that it was no use; I knew what they were all about.  There was a cry from Fianna Fáil when in Opposition that housing prices were ridiculous, that they would have to be reduced because people could not pay the cost of houses.  Now Fianna Fáil are in office. We have heard the promises and have seen the performance and the performance to date is a pretty miserable one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment.</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;expresses confidence in the steps taken by the Government to regulate house building costs&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody welcomes increases in costs particularly when they affect something of such basic importance to most people as housing and the provision <Col N="131" /> of houses for young people in particular. I am no different.  I share the concern with the trend in housing costs and if I were in Opposition I would consider it my duty to show my concern also and raise a matter such as this.  But at least I should attempt to be constructive in what I would say and not just be critical as Deputy Fitzpatrick was.</P>
    <P>The motion in Deputy Fitzpatrick's name describes as unreasonable the level of increase in house building costs over the past year.  It lays the blame for this on the failure of the Government to take remedial action.</P>
    <P>During the period from 30 June to 31 December 1977, the average gross prices of new houses for which loans were advanced by all the major mortgage finance agencies increased from £14,306 to £15,784, or by 10.4 per cent. This was a substantial increase but it becomes very insignificant when compared with the 113.5 per cent increase in the average costs during the four-year term of office of the Coalition. How effective were the Government controls being exercised at that time?</P>
    <P>The National Coalition Government took office in March 1973.  For the year ended 31 March 1974 the cost of house building increased by a staggering 36 per cent.  Even in the 12-month period ended March 1977 when world inflationary trends generally had been curbed, costs of house building were increased by 22.2 per cent.  Let is contrast this with the position in the corresponding period ended 31 March last when the house building cost index went up from 145.5 to 160.4&mdash;representing an increase of only 10.2 per cent.  The rate of house building cost increases has, therefore, been halved a less than a year since our coming to office and I expect the rate to moderate further as this year progresses since the March index provides for the 8 per cent increase in labour costs under the first phase of the current national pay agreement.</P>
    <P>Inflationary trends in prices will in future be associated with the last Coalition Government.  Not alone house prices but the cost of practically <Col N="132" /> every other commodity also increased at an unprecedented rate during their term of office.</P>
    <P>House building costs cannot, of course, be considered in isolation. During the period since April 1973 these costs, new house prices and earnings fluctuated considerably. There were times when cost increases exceeded price increases because of the lack of mortgage finance and the dampening of demand during the recession.  The stage has now been reached where percentage increases since April 1973 in house building costs, new house prices and earnings are broadly in line.</P>
    <P>The average gross price of new houses for which loans were approved by the main lending agencies increased by 20 per cent last year, compared with 1976.  There was a corresponding increase of 19.2 per cent in prices in the building and construction industry generally.  In Northern Ireland, house prices increased last year by 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Increases in new house prices, house building costs, earnings and prices generally in the building and construction industry have outstripped increases in the consumer price index over the past few years.  One of the main reasons is that the consumer price index reflected such factors as the introduction of food subsidies, the abolition of domestic rates, tax on most cars and the general decline in mortgage interest rates.  For obvious reasons, the prices of all commodities do not increase at a uniform rate. Increases in house prices in recent months have received widespread publicity here.  There has been less publicity about the declining trends in electricity charges and the price of petrol and, indeed, the drop in house mortgage interest rates during this period.</P>
    <P>The plain facts of the matter are that any real effective controls introduced over the levels of house building costs have been introduced by Fianna Fáil administrations.  The basic statutory control over the cost of grant-type houses is provided by section 35 of the Housing Act, 1966&mdash;a Fianna Fáil measure.  The system of house <Col N="133" /> price control using the certificate of reasonable value, was first introduced in 1973 by Deputy Molloy, now Minister for Defence, who was then Minister for Local Government.  That system was extended by me last July to practically all new grant-type houses and flats as one of my first moves as incoming Minister.</P>
    <P>That control provides an effective guarantee to a person buying a grant-type dwelling that the price he is being asked to pay is a fair one.  My Department's intervention has resulted in quite a number of cases in builders conceding appreciable reductions in the prices they originally intended to charge.  The resultant savings to purchasers of these houses is estimated to have totalled about £700,000 since the Government took office less than a year ago.  There is no evidence whatever to suggest that the controls are either forcing builders out of business altogether or obliging them to switch to the building of so-called luxury houses or non-grant type dwellings. The continuing flow of applications to the Department for new house grants effectively counters the validity of that suggestion.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the £1,000 grant contributed to the inflation of house prices.  When I introduced the grant in July last, I extended the system of house price control to all State-aided private new houses and flats.  Previously the system had been confined to houses of four or more which qualified for assistance from public funds.  The £1,000 grant is paid directly to the person purchasing or building a house so that the builder does not pocket the grant.  The grant is obviously very popular with house purchasers and builders.  More than 11,500 applications for this grant were received in my Department between 6 July 1977 and the end of April 1978. As houses are completed and occupied the grant becomes payable and will be paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Will the Minister state how many grants have been approved subject to occupation and completion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 50 per <Col N="134" /> cent to date have reached that stage. It is obvious that at the beginning the payments were slow because according to the regulations governing the grant a house had to be started after 26 May 1977 and, therefore, one could not expect the grants to be paid last September or October.  Only now are the houses coming in line for payment and the pace of payment is increasing. Deputy Fitzpatrick said that the grant was gobbled up by the increased prices and by the builders, but during the period of office of the Coalition the increase was of the order of 113.5 per cent.  I wonder what happened to the grant of £325 which the Coalition did not see fit to increase during their four-and-a-half years in office?  How effective was that with regard to the purchase of new houses or helping people to acquire their own houses?</P>
      <P>The Deputy should not forget that in 1976 the then Minister introduced very strict controls over who would qualify for the £325 grant at that time by putting income limits on the people who would qualify.  This resulted in the first six months of 1977 in only 2,500 grants being approved by the Department of Local Government whereas now between 6 July 1977 to 28 April of this year over 11,500 applications have been received of which 50 per cent have been approved.  This is surely the most effective answer to those who criticise the availability of the £1,000 grant.  It seems to me some of the Opposition are very perturbed that this £1,000 grant was made available at all.  When we compare the trend in prices approved under the CRV system it should be borne in mind also that the system was extended last July to take in the grant type houses I have already mentioned. This is a very important feature of the CRV system which was introduced in 1973 which was not there before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the recent debate on my Department's Estimate the proposition was put forward that power should be given to the Prices Commission with regard to the control of house prices. I explained in my reply that this was not a feasible proposition.  Hardly any two houses are identical in every respect, <Col N="135" /> as is normally the case with the type of commodities over which the Prices Commission have control.  Site values vary and conditions can vary from site to site.  The cost of roads, water, sewerage, electricity services, extensions of the ESB supply vary from scheme to scheme.  The quality and extent of the fittings to houses also differ widely from scheme to scheme.  The present arrangement using the expertise of professional officers of my Department, which include a quantity surveyor, architects and engineers, all with their own particular experience of houses, has worked well.  During the past three years it has secured savings exceeding £1.5 million for house purchases. The only way the Prices Commission could have a function such as this would be by duplicating all those services and staff.</P>
    <P>When a Prices and Incomes Bill was being prepared in 1970 the Fianna Fáil Government at the time gave serious thought to the question of including house prices within the scope of control by the commission but, largely because of the reasons I have already mentioned, it was decided that this would not be appropriate or would not be workable.  However, Deputies will be aware that the prices of building materials and the rates of professional costs affecting house building are subject to control by the commission. Whatever the merits might be of requiring the commission to control the price of new houses, it would be altogether out of the question to charge them with the responsibility of overseeing the level of prices for previously occupied houses.  The commission have no function in relation to second-hand houses no more than they have in relation to second-hand cars. It is not a realistic proposition to engage the Prices Commission in.</P>
    <P>Steps were taken early in the present year by the Department of the Environment in the United Kingdom to restrict the amount of money to be advanced by building societies in that country for new house mortgages, but it has not proved effective there.  The scale of investment from time to time with our building societies and their <Col N="136" /> intended level of advances is a highly important factor in the Government's national housing programme.  The position is kept constantly under review by my Department and if action were required it would be taken without delay.  However, as matters stand, there appears to be little call for following the action taken by the United Kingdom Government with regard to restricting these loans.</P>
    <P>The approach of our major building societies, the big five, who are responsible for 98 per cent of all society loans, to the commitment of funds for new mortgages has always been responsible. I would be reluctant to intervene in their day to day operations unless the justification for this was clearly established.  The results of the heavy-handed approach of the previous Government to the societies in 1973 and 1974, when limits were placed on the maximum amount of the mortgage which could be advanced in any case and the issue of loans for previously occupied houses was prohibited, provides a most effective warning against undue bureaucratic intervention in the workings of responsible commercial undertakings such as the building societies.</P>
    <P>Loan approvals by the societies fell from 12,383 valued at over £67 million in 1972 to 7,350 valued at £39 million in 1973, largely as a result of the Government intervention at that time.  Considerable hardship was caused to owners of existing houses who wished to sell their dwellings and particularly to persons who were liable to be transferred to different centres, such as gardaí, ESB officials and other such people.  While we are talking about the availability of mortgage finance I would like to confirm the estimate of 26,500 new house completions this year is still a valid estimate. It takes into account the fact that the Government have increased the provision for SDA loans from £17 million in 1977 to £39 million this year.  The associated banks expect to advance loans totalling £30 million.</P>
    <P>Expenditure by the building societies on loans may reach £150 million this year compared with £120 million in 1977.  While there has been a drop in the net inflow of funds to building <Col N="137" /> societies in recent months the target of £150 million for this year is still achievable when we take into account the particularly high inflow at the end of 1977 and the liquidity position of the societies at that time.  The position in this respect is being kept closely under review.  Some people have very short memories.  The net inflow of funds to the societies dropped to less than £18 million in 1974.  The net inflow for the first three months of this year was £21.3 million.  This is a vast improvement.</P>
    <P>The view has also been expressed that the supply of mortgage finance should be increased.  This step might cause trouble in the housing market, overheat the market and cause further increases in house prices.</P>
    <P>Some Opposition Deputies conveniently forget that house prices this year will be about £2,000 up on last year and some £2,500 up on 1976.  It has been suggested that half of the contribution to the increase in house prices lies in the control of land prices.  As far back as January 1974, at a time when housing costs were escalating much more rapidly than they recently have been, the previous Government announced that the high cost of building land was caused by complex elements and that an effective solution to it involved far-reaching remedies.  The then Government announced their acceptance in principle of the approach put forward by the majority of the members who sat on the Kenny Inquiry.  That report was still gathering dust when they left office in July 1977.  When I became Minister at that time my first priority was the implementation of job creation proposals and urgent measures promised in our election manifesto.  It is now my intention to have the Kenny Report re-examined and to have a further look at its recommendations.  I hope to present my considered recommendations on the subject to the Government in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>A few years ago land prices remained static for some time and even dropped in some instances.  In recent months land prices have tended to increase, <Col N="138" /> but this partly reflects the increasing costs of agricultural land associated with the growing prosperity of the farming community.  Undoubtedly also the increasing costs of sites for new housing development are a consequence of the scarcity of serviced land.  Since July last I have increased very substantially the capital available for sanitary services.  This is the most effective way in which we can increase the supply of serviced land.  The capital allocated for the purpose in this year's budget totalled £33.72 million, an increase of practically 30 per cent on the £26.23 million allocated in 1977.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are primarily responsible for the provision of sanitary services in their areas and, with the more generous supply of finance provided by the present Government, they have been making comment about headway in dealing with the backlog of serviced sites.  There is another way in which they can make a useful contribution towards combating excessively high prices for sites for the more modest type of private houses. They have power to develop and make available sites for such private houses and these are qualified for a subsidy from my Department.</P>
    <P>At 31 January last local authorities had in their possession, building land including lands on which development had then commenced or was pending, sufficient to accommodate an estimated total of nearly 90,000 dwellings.  Even on the basis of an annual building programme averaging 7,000 dwellings, this would represent a sufficient reserve for more than 12 years output.  I would like to see local authorities developing some of this land, particularly in areas where serviced sites are scarce, with a view to making it available for private housing.</P>
    <P>In recent months the increase in house prices has received considerable publicity in the Press and the effect has been to create a situation where potential house purchasers tended to suffer from a certain amount of panic. This does not help the situation in any way.  There is no doubt that the number of new houses which will be built <Col N="139" /> by the private sector in the coming year, some of which are now under construction, will be increased considerably. Deputy Fitzpatrick said it was set out in the White Paper that we would cut back drastically on local authority housing.  That was not stated in the White Paper, which conveyed that a critical appraisal of the cost of local authority houses would be undertaken.  This is happening.</P>
    <P>The motion seems to give the impression that house prices did not increase in the past four-and-a-half years.  During that period they increased 113.3 per cent and no steps whatsoever were taken by the Government to control or regulate these prices in any way.  When we came into power we extended the CRV system to all grant-aided houses.  Any person purchasing a house expecting to get £1,000 grant should first ask the builder to show the CRV or apply to the Department where they will be immediately informed that a CRV is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said people are rushing in, paying their deposits, solicitors and so forth, and that they are being led to believe the CRV is available.  If any builder leads anyone to believe that a CRV is available if he has not got one or applied for one, he is conning the would-be purchasers, and if Deputy Fitzpatrick knows of any such case I would be delighted if he would bring it to my attention.</P>

      <P>The Minister, while making a valiant effort to redeem his party's pledge in the manifesto, was unable to deny the incontrovertible evidence before the House that the overriding and most obvious fact, despite all the verbiage about the last four years, is that for the first time in the last year the price of new houses has soared at a rate which is unprecedented and which shows signs not of escalation but of a spiralling.  As late as this week we had a spokesman for a major building society admitting that in a period of 18 months he anticipates that the price of new houses will increase by a total of 40 per cent.  I am sure he is not in any way opposed to <Col N="140" /> the interests of Fianna Fáil in promising right, left and centre to everybody who is there to listen that now the IOUs are being picked up and they are not delivered.  The reason is simple when we come to the question of the price of new houses.  This party would believe that a house or a home of one's own is not something that can be dealt with as another commercial commodity by people allowed to operate unchecked without some scrutiny in the free market which exists in our society.  A home of one's own is a fundamental right which should be guaranteed by the State and which that State should enable people to acquire.  The Fianna Fáil Party, because of their roots and their clear ideological bias&mdash;if I may glorify chasing after money as being an ideology&mdash;are by their nature unable to comprehend in a housing policy the basic ideal of this social justice of which I speak.  That party have sold their souls to people who are oiling the party machine.  Fianna Fáil have sold out, and the more one hears from them and the more one sees of their activities the stronger is the impression that in Fianna Fáil the people who are strongest triumph and there is no basic concern for the weaker section in our community.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to take one sentence from the body of material published and the speeches we have heard on such things as the price of new houses and say &ldquo;This is the evidence&rdquo;.  Anybody who would systematically put together and integrate the variety of documents which have been published by Fianna Fáil will see the evidence. It is clear in the White Paper and in the policies&mdash;or lack of policies&mdash;which we have seen so far and in the alacrity with which certain proposals which have a mass gut popular reaction have been embraced while the party have at the same time refused to tackle those areas which are obviously socially necessary but which would involve treading on the toes of their party supporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a home as a fundamental right is the basis of the great concern that we have in putting down this motion the purpose of which is <Col N="141" /> to highlight the inadequacy of the Government's response on the question of soaring house prices.  The truth, down in black and white, is that the party now in Government promised to make it easier and cheaper for people to buy a home. It is not easier, and anybody who has been trying to get either the £1,000 grant from the Minister or a certificate of reasonable value out of the Government will say that it is not easier. The Construction Industry Federation have already clearly said that it has become so difficult to deal with the new scheme of grants that builders are actively being encouraged into the £30,000 plus house, and I will quote chapter and verse for that later.  In no way is it cheaper either and I defy anybody in the benches opposite to pretend that it is.  The price of new houses has gone up in the order of 20 per cent in the last seven or eight months and all the indications are that they are going to go even higher. All the Government are willing to do is to ask their backbenchers, every one of whom knows the truth of what I am saying, to fall in behind them like sheep and bleat confidence in the Government who promised to make them cheaper and are failing in their objective.</P>
    <P>The primary concern of the Fianna Fáil Party is not to ensure that the resources of the nation are distributed fairly and justly or that people get homes.  Their primary concern and thrust is to ensure that those who support them are paid off.  The Minister told this Dáil some months ago in reply to a question that the average length of time it takes to pay a £1,000 grant is seven weeks.  The word &ldquo;lie&rdquo; is one we are not allowed to use here, but whatever acceptable substitute is appropriate I will use.  It is not true; it is not in accordance with the facts.  I am sorry that the Minister is not here to tell me that himself.  At one time we were told that the £1,000 grant might be used as a deposit.  Since that time I have met a number of anguished young couples who were misled completely by that promise, which was in the fullpage advertisement which the Fianna Fáil Party took prior to the elections; <Col N="142" /> a £1,000 grant for first-time house purchasers.  I defy the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment or anybody else to contradict that.  If there was a code of advertising standards in this country the Government would be held in contempt of that.  They promised a £1,000 grant to all first-time purchasers of houses; not new houses.  Do not mind what was in the manifesto.  I wonder how many copies of that were printed.  It is the advertisements, the canvassing and statements made prior to an election which count.</P>
    <P>Nobody will tell me that the average young couple about to embark on buying a house believed anything but that if they were involved in getting a house, new or secondhand, they would be entitled to that grant.  That grant, by virtue of the way in which it was implemented, was one of the most inflationary elements in the house price boom since then.  We have been awaiting some measure of concern of active interest on the part of the Government which has not been forthcoming. They are not concerned about the price of housing.  Why should they be?  The Estimate for the Department of the Environment in respect of the £1,000 grants is of the order of £11 million. Yet within three months of Fianna Fáil coming into Government the average cost of new houses had increased by a national average in excess of £1,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>They are charging 25 per cent extra for getting the country moving since last week also.  The point is that about £11 million is going into somebody's pocket.  I would like to make it clear that I do not suspect that it is the average genuine builder, the man with two or three people employed who is trying to eke out a living.  There is a Fianna Fáil supporter of a certain calibre who is doing well out of this public money.  The way in which the £1,000 grant has been implemented is a scandal.  It has discriminated against the city of Dublin and it has had the effect of increasing the price of new houses.  It has discriminated against the city centres of <Col N="143" /> Cork, Limerick and Galway.  Not one penny of public funds will be spent in these areas because no new housebuilding is going on there.  If by some chance there is a new house on a corner in a city centre it is certainly not a first-time purchaser house.  It is a very expensive house and will accordingly not benefit from this scheme.  The effect of this is to slow down housing mobility and therefore to put up prices of new homes.  One is now effectively inhibited from going into the second-hand house market. After all, if a young couple have an opportunity of buying a house how can we expect them to choose an innercity house with its problem environment already there, as opposed to a house in the so-called attractive suburbs where they will get the £1,000 grant?  The Government and the Minister do not give one goddamn about these new suburbs.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister on more than one occasion in the Dáil whether he believed that it was desirable to have some idea of the impact of this grant scheme, not only in relation to the price of the house but in relation to the social implications which are at the root of our concern.  He said no, there was not any such scheme and there would not be any such scheme.  I am putting it to the Minister that the policy of the £1,000 grant has not been merely inflationary; it has been socially harmful. It is creating expectations in the suburban areas which are not going to be fulfilled.  It is leaving behind a residue of perfectly valuable second-hand houses which are now no longer saleable at prices that are reasonable for couples.  The result is that fewer people rather than more are owning their own homes.</P>
      <P>The truth of what I am saying is borne out in the pitiful number of grants paid out under this scheme.  Last week the Minister told us that 11,000 applications for the grant had been received.  Indeed, each time he is asked a question about the scheme he talks about applications.  Up to a couple of months ago the number of these grants that had been paid out for the six-month period was 400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> Taking the various strands of Government policy and the factors that contribute to the attitude that a house is essentially a commercial pawn and not a fundamental right with which the State should be very concerned, we can look at a number of documents. The Minister has referred to the White Paper on National Development.  Despite his denial we find in that document not the bald assertion that there will be a cutback in the area of local authority housing&mdash;we do not take him for a complete fool&mdash;but a very clear bias against the tenant, against the weak and generally against those whose resources are limited: in other words against people who are not in a certain class in society.  Apart from the provocative phrases such as &ldquo;a lessening in the degree of relative urgency&rdquo;, which I as a member of Dublin Corporation find laughable, we find such phrases as that which says that &ldquo;the local authorities will be requested to examine the circumstances of housing applicants in more detail to determine priority needs&rdquo;.  Why is there not the same concern about the application of resources in the private sector?  Why do we find that the local authorities are straining at the leash in trying to cope with distributing the paltry number of homes available in Dublin city in the fairest way possible?  Why should these come under greater scrutiny?  Is it the implication that these houses are not being allotted fairly?  The answer is that it is fair game because if you discourage local authorities, the private building sector is encouraged.  That latter sector should be encouraged but not at the expense of the local authority sector.  On the other hand, if the private sector are encouraged there will be automatically bigger profits for Fianna Fáil supporters.  That is what the question is all about.  Since the change of Government £11 million worth of public money has gone into somebody's pocket but definitely not into the pockets of those people who have bought houses.</P>
    <P>Various sets of figures were given in reply to questions put to the Minister by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  These figures are worthy of some attention. Although I am a relatively newcomer to the House I find extraordinary the <Col N="145" /> situation in which a Minister may ask the Dáil to vote confidence in a position in which house prices have soared by 20 per cent when he is one of a Cabinet who asked the people to accept a 5 per cent wage increase this year and in the full knowledge that house prices would escalate to the extent of another 20 per cent during the next 12 months.  I have no confidence in the Minister's handling of the situation.  Neither are the Construction Industry Federation satisfied with it.  In the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 21 March there appeared an article headed &ldquo;The £1,000 Grant Scheme is not Working&rdquo; and the relative article went on to quote a CIF spokesman, Mr. Michael Greene, as saying that the builders who are involved in private house building are regularly being rejected for the certificate needed before a house qualifies for the £1,000 grant and are being given no reason for the rejection by the Department of the Environment.  Would there be any possibility of the Department being engaged in a cutback in that area while benefiting from the rich political harvest of the promise they made?  However, Mr. Greene is quoted as going on to say that the CIF find that there are major problems involved in the administration of the scheme and that they are unhappy with the way it has worked so far.  That comment is not unduly strong but Mr. Greene is quoted as having gone on to say that this situation is having the effect of driving builders out of the medium-priced house and into the £30,000 class where they are not looking for the first-time buyer.  Mr. Greene is quoted further as having said that, ironically, the system intended to help first-time buyers has turned around to act against them.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil bowed regularly to the wisdom and collective knowledge of the CIF during the years of Coalition rule.  Therefore, I see no reason for their taking too much issue with the same CIF now.  Are the Government denying what the CIF have to say? They cannot deny it because they know it to be true.  It is merely another piece of evidence to indicate that there <Col N="146" /> is a boom, not in house building, not in Government concern for young couples, but in the profits of some builders.  I stress the word &ldquo;some&rdquo; to distinguish them from the small builder, the man whom we should be encouraging.  Rather, the boom in profits is going to the major builders, those who contribute substantially to Fianna Fáil funds.  These are the chequebook cowboys who grease the wheels of that party machine.</P>

      <P>In taking nine questions together today the Minister responded with a rather lengthy statement, a statement that did nothing to dispel the fears of those who are opposed to his plan for the containment of children at Loughan House. In taking those nine questions together he rendered it more difficult for Deputies to get clear answers to the questions they wished to put.  I was disheartened by the intransigence shown by the Minister in his attitude to this matter since the opening of the debate on it.  The Minister set his face today against answering many of the specific questions and doubts relating to Loughan House, the staffing of Loughan House and the links of children with their parents.  He gave the impression that all who opposed his plan for Loughan House were in some way opposed to any response he might come up with.  This is not so.  It is <Col N="148" /> therefore necessary for us to restate our position.</P>
      <P>The position of our party and of all caring associations on this issue is that we support the report of the task force. They admitted that there were a small number of children who, for their own good and the good of society, need to be contained in a secure unit.  The task force are of the view that this special school should be provided in the Dublin area and should have three units, secured, intermediate and open, and should be staffed by child care workers.  We were also concerned that a sum of £600,000&mdash;from the Minister's statement today that seems to have been reduced to £135,000&mdash;was to have been spent on an approach which has failed dismally in other countries and has tended to lead to more hardened anti-social attitudes among the boys concerned.</P>
      <P>There are very few people who have studied the question of child care who do not believe that locking up substantial numbers of children in locations far removed from their natural habitat and environment and placing them under the supervision of persons who, with the best will in the world, are not trained for that purpose, is highly dangerous for the children whom the Minister in his proposal claims to want to rehabilitate.  The question before us is not whether there should be a secure provision for a limited number of young offenders but rather what kind of provision should there be and what kind of training is necessary for those who will staff it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of replies to questions today and last week the Minister tended to be very vague.  On 25 April I put down a number of questions for written reply.  The Minister's replies were, to say the least evasive and demonstrated a serious lack of understanding of the complexity of the problem of meeting the needs of young offenders.  On that occasion also he made no attempt to give an estimate of the number of boys who, in his opinion, would require accommodation at Loughan House or elsewhere.  His failure to do so raises the question of whether there is not a danger that <Col N="149" /> Loughan House will become a holdall for difficult boys.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said nothing so far to lead me to believe that he has any conception of the crucial importance of ensuring that any secure provision does not lead to a dumping ground for young offenders for whom there is no alternative service available but who would benefit greatly from services such as youth projects, hostels of a more specialised range with residential facilities, than are or ever have been available here.</P>
    <P>On the same day the Minister avoided answering a question relating to the detailed nature of the training being given to prison officers who will staff Loughan House.  He said they would be given a 12 weeks' training course in child care.  Anybody who knows anything about child care knows that a 12 weeks' training course is not adequate for people who will be responsible for the care of difficult children.  He refused to be specific about the qualifications of those who will be providing the training and the location where this training will be provided.</P>
    <P>On 25 April the Minister did not answer the question whether the psychologist, the only professional person being appointed full time to Loughan House would have a qualification in child psychology or if he would have any experience in that field.  Not only is it absolutely scandalous that the only person who will be professionally qualified in Loughan House is one psychologist but so far the Minister has refused to indicate the qualifications of the person filling that post.  He has also refused to indicate the qualifications, training or experience of the two welfare officers to be appointed full time to Loughan House.  I have no way of knowing, and neither has anybody else, if these people have any qualifications whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that psychiatric care will be provided in that institution but so far he has refused to say where it will come from or if the psychiatric care will be provided by people with experience in child psychology.  He has also made it clear <Col N="150" /> that he is not making arrangements to ensure that even one residential child care worker with suitable training will be employed at Loughan House.</P>
    <P>These are some of the matters the Minister has refused to answer.  His failure to do so indicates that he neither understands the crucial importance of the training of the staff in the context of residential child care nor has made any suitable arrangements in relation to each of them.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that there is no criticism by this party of prison officers or their work.  We are merely saying that they are being asked to perform an impossible task after 12 weeks' training, to care in a residential secured setting, for the most difficult disturbed children in our society.  I want the Minister to tell us how he can possibly reconcile his approach to Loughan House with the enlightened approach in the Fianna Fáil manifesto published last June.  We heard of new, informal and less institutionalised procedures and tribunals in relation to family law and child offenders which would have expert and remedial backup services at their disposal.  We heard of the 1908 Childrens Act being amended to bring it into line with modern social thinking.  We heard of the age of criminal responsibility being increased and that suitable remedial places of detention would be provided for youthful offenders.  The only provision made by the Minister is the provision of a secured centre at Loughan House, 100 miles from Dublin, the place of residence of the majority of the offenders and where the back-up services and the links with the community and the family which are so essential to these children cannot be provided.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister first announced his plan, people whose lives were wrapped up in child care have shown total opposition to it.  When asked what organisations he consulted the Minister said it was not in the public interest to let us know.  We know 11 organisations sought to send a deputation to the Minister but he selected only six.  I would describe that decision as ill-advised and arrogant in view of the very delicate issue involved.  Why <Col N="151" /> were the Association of Civil Liberties, the Prisoners' Rights Association and the Labour Women's National Council excluded?  I know personally that these women are very interested in this area.  They are very concerned and well-informed and would have had a contribution to make.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not see comparisons with other countries as relevant. He should not have disregarded the wealth of knowledge and experience gained internationally, and to do so could not be in the public interest.  I would ask him to consider the kind of boys we are dealing with in this institution, deprived boys, boys who by any yardstick have suffered disadvantages all their lives.  Statistics show that a great number of them are the products of broken homes, a great number are under age, underweight, and in every way deprived and showing signs of deprivation.</P>
    <P>While delinquency is not confined to these boys, in the main these are the boys who will be accommodated in Loughan House.  Boys of more privileged parents will have been rescued long before they come to that point.  I intend to allow my colleague, Deputy Lipper, to speak for the time remaining to me.  It is very, very important, and it has been recognised as being so by those involved in child care, and by all the experts in this area of child care to build up a proper child-parent relationship from scratch, as it were, in some cases and rebuild it in other cases in which it has broken down.  In the main the children are living in deprived homes, disturbed homes or broken homes.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the work done by the social welfare section of his Department.  How can the social work necessary be carried out by the welfare section of his Department when one party involved in the problem is situated 100 miles from the other party?  The parents will be here in Dublin or elsewhere and the children will be located in County Cavan.  I detected today, as I think most Deputies did, that the Minister was not quite as sure of himself as he was in <Col N="152" /> the past on this issue.  I hope this is an indication that he is having second thoughts.  The buck stops with the Minister.  The problem is a very serious one for him and I would ask him to be very careful and reconsider the whole matter.  He is meeting associations deeply involved in this problem next week and I would ask him to hear their views, scrap this ill-advised scheme and spend the money allocated for this particular purpose, plus a great deal more money, on projects which will prove more effective and beneficial for the boys concerned and for society as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLipper" hpid="Mr. Lipper Mr. Lipper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all in favour of Loughan House.  I appreciate and deeply regret that we have a high rate of juvenile delinquency, something which must be strongly opposed by all law-abiding citizens. However, in condemning these delinquents to the kind of institution the Minister proposes, I must examine my conscience and ask myself what have I done to keep these children out of Loughan House or what have the people, now supporting Loughan House so loudly, done for these youths? Delinquents are, of course, a source of concern to every right-minded citizen, but what have right-minded citizens done to try to eradicate the menace that has grown up over the years in our society?  Do these people, now so loud in condemnation, not feel that when our youth fail us it is a shocking indictment of ourselves? It seems to me that the type of punishment now proposed by the Government has failed in western Europe and throughout the world as a whole. In many countries this type of punishment has been scrapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All children are born good.  There is nothing wrong with them.  It must always be remembered that we are the products of our environment.  What have successive Governments done to eliminate the scourge of juvenile delinquency?  The answer is obvious. Until such time as those who are now shouting loudest are fully satisfied in conscience that they have not failed our youth, then I say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to Loughan House.  As an ordinary individual <Col N="153" /> it would be difficult for me to say just what the alternative is.  There is no doubt something is required to solve this problem.  The Government have a responsibility to improve the standard of living and it is out of the standard of living, or lack of it, that the present unhappy delinquency is born.  The Government have a duty to cry halt to certain types of violence and certain cults on television.  What appears on the small screens in our homes is being imitated by too many of the younger generation.  We have a responsibility to pour huge sums of money into social welfare so that all kinds of highly qualified people can be sent in among the delinquents to show them proper leadership and, at the same time, encourage our equals to play their part in helping them instead of knocking them at every chance we get.  What do we expect form youth? They see so much that is grossly wrong all around them and, worse still, they see so much that is wrong being swept under the carpet of power and money.</P>
    <P>At home in Limerick City Council and other public meetings fellow human beings have been denied the right to put a caravan on the roadside to provide themselves with some kind of shelter.  We have had the experience of those who now so loudly condemn Loughan House denying the right of the Simon Community to provide shelter for what would appear to be the derelicts of humanity.  How can we blame the youth when they rebel?  Can we stand idly by?  Is that the kind of leadership and example to give our youth?  No.  Until I am satisfied that we have done our part and, despite that, our youth have disappointed us, I do not want to see a Loughan House.  We should not forget that our youth are exploited.  There is drinking.  There are discos and even, in our case, local newspapers, newspapers which openly supported a project designed for the youth but a project which has now gone dead.  We were led to expect great things for our youth and youth were looking forward.  Now there is a deafening silence.  A great sports complex was proposed in Limerick.  It died the death.</P>
    <P>Drugs and drink call for close attention. <Col N="154" /> Boys and girls can walk into pubs and get drink.  No questions are asked. Drugs are pushed.  The pushers must be caught.  The publican has the right to conduct his business in accordance with the law and responsibility for upholding the law rests on his shoulders. The only decency in the trade today exists in the older public houses in which every step is taken to prevent the abuse of drink and the breaking of the law by children.  It would seem now that the whiz kids have moved into the licensed trade and their only object is to get rich quick.  Let them bear in mind that they are contributing in large measure to the horrible society causing so much trouble, heartbreak and destruction.  Times may have changed and conditions may have improved, but it would seem as if improvement has taken place only for a minority.  They continue to get richer due to the attitude of the Government and others in authority while those struggling to survive can hardly manage.</P>
    <P>What can we expect when our youth see so many at the top of their professions or businesses get away with some of the worst forms of delinquency? Is there to be one law for the rich and another for the majority who have to struggle through?  This afternoon the Minister admitted that he is not so sure that Loughan House is the answer.  That frightens me.  I wonder is the Minister opening up not something that will help our society but rather a college or university for hardened criminals.  I believe the Minister to be sincere when he said he would spare no money from the point of view of transport to Loughan House for those parents who want to visit their children there.  I doubt, however, if this is feasible or practicable.  Parents from Limerick or further south will have to leave their children at home while they visit Loughan House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Loughan House is not being put forward as a complete solution to the problem we are discussing.  It is not a complete solution and it cannot be regarded as anything more than a necessary immediate response to an <Col N="155" /> emergency situation.  The Labour Party spokesman, Deputy Mrs. Desmond, quoted from the Fianna Fáil election manifesto but I can assure that Deputy that there is nothing in the manifesto which is counter to the Loughan House project which, as I said, is an interim measure.  Deputies anxious to refer to the manifesto should read the second paragraph under the heading &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; which states:</P>
      <P>It is on these foundations that Fianna Fáil in Government will build, to ensure that the citizen is free from attack, the homes and property of our people free from marauders, the streets free to walk in; that the gardaí are given support by financial, technical and manpower improvements so that crime becomes unprofitable and where not prevented is speedily detected;</P>
      <P>One can be very selective in quoting from such documents to bolster up a case which is a weak one.  I believe Deputy Mrs. Desmond did not pay much attention to the comprehensive reply I gave to her question today and a number of questions tabled by her colleague, Deputy Browne.  I am satisfied I gave a full and comprehensive answer, as I should do, to the Deputies.  I was confused by the statement of the Deputy a short time ago that the Labour Party believed that a custodial centre is necessary.  The spokesman for that party was not at all sure that a custodial centre was necessary.  The impression I got was that when Deputy Mrs. Desmond suggested that the moneys be spent in other ways that that was giving the knock to any moneys being spent on any sort of custodial school.  I got that impression from the Leader of the Labour Party today.  I do not want to misinterpret the Deputy but that was the impression I got.</P>

      <P>If I am misinterpreting the Deputy I apologise.  I did not make that statement for the purpose <Col N="156" /> of trying to score any points.  If the Deputy feels I am misinterpreting it I accept that I am wrong and I will see to it that I do not give a wrong impression.  Therefore, there is agreement that a custodial centre is necessary. We believe that such a centre is necessary and it is because of this belief that the green light is being given to a Department of Education project to build a custodial centre in Lusk, County Dublin.  I have already informed the House of the progress to date.  We are going ahead as fast as we can.  Forgive me for saying this but if our attitude was shared by the previous Government then three years work would have been completed. However, nothing happened for three years.  I make that statement honestly and sincerely and not with the intention of scoring any points.</P>
      <P>Because nothing happened for the last three years in this regard I now find myself in the situation of having to deal with a serious problem on our streets.  I want to put a simple question to all Members: do we do something now to try to control those who are running wild or do we not?  We do not have a custodial centre at present to keep them in a school.  They cannot be kept in Lusk, Clonmel or Finglas.  I would have avoided a lot of flak&mdash;I am as sensitive to flak as anybody else&mdash;if I had done nothing until a unit in Lusk was built.  I am convinced that the existence of Loughan House will act as a good deterrent to young people.</P>

      <P>I know them well enough.  I have had word from the Garda Síochána that there was an effort last week by a group of these people to burn it down.  Do I do nothing and allow them run free on the streets?  The Deputy, among others, is looking for extra gardaí in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown.  The harsh reality of the situation is that if I do <Col N="157" /> as the Deputy suggests I will be allowing them to run wild on our streets as they are.  A special school is being built but it will take three years to do that.  I give an assurance tonight that Loughan House will cease to exist as a custodial centre for under 16s the moment Lusk is ready.  That is the special school that Deputy Barry Desmond is talking about.  I can do no more than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">

      <P>Can the Minister give a deadline?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the deadline.  The experts in the field, the Office of Public Works, say that it will take three years to build that special school and that is the deadline.  I wish to state on behalf of the Department of Justice that there is still a need for Loughan House within that Department as a centre in the ordinary sense. I am sure the Deputies are aware that we have the highest number of prisoners this State has ever had.  I am the first to admit that our prison system is not geared to cater for the numbers we have.  That is a worry to every one of us.  That is something that is non-political.  There is no political kudos to be gained by any of us in doing what we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know of any countries, even countries wealthier that us, who have found an answer to the problem.  In the last few months I studied reports on <Col N="158" /> countries wealthier than us as to how they have faced up to such a problem. Some of those countries had a head start in providing special homes and schools, like those referred to by Deputy Barry Desmond.  There are custodial centres like those I am referring to in practically every European country.  We are not doing something new.  I would love to see workers engaged pulling down building after building and erecting community centres if that was the answer to the problem.  I hope it will be the answer.  Nobody in the business has come up with the answer. Deputy Mrs. Desmond made the point that people who have spent their lives in child care are against Loughan House but that is not so.  I should like to refer her to a good letter on the Loughan House project by the staff of the Clonmel school.  There were many other letters from people who have spent all their lives in this service.  If I do as the Deputy and others have suggested I will be doing nothing for three years and letting people run wild.  I cannot forget my responsibility. I was asked what organisations I intended meeting and I should like to tell the House that I will meet those organisations who have a genuine professional interest in this problem but I am not prepared to meet the organisations who are for hire to create a lot of trouble for the sake of causing it.</P>

      <P>Under the free travel scheme a person living in this country who is in receipt of British invalidity benefit is entitled to free travel if aged 66 or over.  Free travel was extended from 1 April 1977 to recipients under 66 years of invalidity pension from my Department or of disabled person's maintenance allowance from a health board but not to British invalidity pensioners under 66 who are living here.  The question of further extensions of the scheme is a matter for consideration in the context of the reviews of such schemes which are carried out from time to time in my Department.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Senecia Jacobea</i> (Ragworth) is declared a noxious weed under the Noxious Weeds Act, 1936.  There were no prosecutions in 1977 under the Act. However an intensive publicity campaign on the eradication of noxious weeds was held during the year as it was decided to place the emphasis on educational rather than punitive measures.  In addition proceedings have been taken out this year against 11 offenders for offences committed in 1977.  Ragworth was found in all 11 cases.</P>

      <P>As I said in reply to a parliamentary question on 27 April 1978, I cannot undertake to give, by way of a reply to parliamentary questions, my views on the merits or demerits of any particular legal provision on which a Deputy might decide to seek comment nor can I undertake to indicate at Question Time what specific legislative proposals I might have.  In this case the difficulties are even greater than usual since I am being called upon to give at short notice my opinion on a 200 year-old Act, the amendment or repeal of which might not even be a matter that would come within the area of my ministerial responsibility.</P>
      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question on 26 April 1978 I said that many proposals to amend the intoxicating liquor laws have been made from time to time, some conflicting to a greater or lesser extent with others, and that, while I would consider all such proposals, I was not in a position to say whether it is likely that any amendments of the Acts would be proposed by me.  The licensing of theatres to enable intoxicating liquor to be supplied in them would, naturally, be considered in the context of any general review of those Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there are five priority countries for our development aid.  Our programmes in these countries are formulated in consultation with the Governments concerned.  The primary consideration is the need and priority of the particular country, together with the ability of Ireland to provide assistance of the kind that is required.  In so far as is possible, projects are chosen which support, as directly as possible, the poorest and most needy sections of the community in each country.  Care is of course also taken to ensure that projects are technically feasible and have a satisfactory cost-benefit ratio.</P>
      <P>The general criteria outlined above would also normally apply to our projects in non-priority countries.</P>

      <P>The balance of the programme is expended mainly through Government Departments, educational institutions, organisations concerned with the welfare of students from developing countries, and governments of developing countries.  I should add that, while these happen to be the current percentages, they are liable to change at any time as circumstances make that desirable.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the number of semi-State agency employees involved in the projects funded by his Department in developing countries in 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977 compared with the number of semi-State agency employees involved in projects not funded by his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The execution of projects under the bilateral aid programme is contracted out to semi-State bodies as well as to other organisations.  Thus the number of employees assigned to a project by a semi-State body is primarily a matter for the body concerned and this information is not automatically available to me.</P>
      <P>I can now advise the Deputy, however, that in 1977, for the first time, three officials of semi-State bodies were assigned on a full-time basis to projects under the bilateral aid programme. In addition, in each of the years mentioned officials of semi-State bodies were assigned, as required, on a short-term basis to assist in the implementation of projects.  It would be extremely difficult and time-consuming, however, to quantify these short-term assignments.  In addition, given that the grades of staff involved, together with the duration of their involvement, varied considerably from project to project, this might not be a particularly meaningful exercise.</P>

      <P>In this country, a class C driving licence is required for driving a three-wheeled motor car, and this class also includes the normal private car with four wheels, as well as light goods vehicles.  There is a general requirement in connection with the driving test that the test must be conducted in a vehicle representative of the licensing class and, in the case of class C, this involves the use of the normal private car with four wheels. I have no proposals for altering these requirements.</P>
      <P>I understand that there is no standard practice among the EEC member states in their treatment of the three-wheeled motor car for driver-licensing and the driving test.</P>

      <P>The capital value is determined in accordance with section 18 (1) (b) (iii) of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, and at present is £175 in respect of a ground rent of £25 a year.</P>
      <P>A certificate of reasonable value is issued on the basis of the total consideration proposed to be charged, namely, price plus capital value of ground rent.  Where the ground rent is omitted, the total consideration would be unchanged if the price were increased by the capital value of the ground rent.</P>

      <P>There is no European Commission &ldquo;ruling&rdquo; in this matter. However, the Commission submitted to the Council of Ministers on 13 April 1978 a proposal for a Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states concerning the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  The aim of this proposal is the creation in each member state of appropriate means for satisfying outstanding claims for remuneration, and so on by employees in the event of employers' insolvency. The proposal seeks to provide increased protection for employees and to harmonise the various provisions existing in the member states.</P>
