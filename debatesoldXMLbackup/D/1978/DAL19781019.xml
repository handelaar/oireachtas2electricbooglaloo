    <Title>European Monetary System: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Conclusions of the Presidency presented by the Taoiseach to the Dail on 18 July 1978, following the meeting of the European Council in Bremen, and, in particular, the conclusions on closer monetary co-operation.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(The Taoiseach.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I had about five minutes and in those five minutes I said that in a way I thought this debate was premature because it was evident from the form of the statements made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance the previous day that they had not thought out or thrashed out as a Government, politically or departmentally, the implications of this scheme for us.  If this debate is premature how much more premature was it for the Minister for Finance to create the impression, an impression with which the rest of the Government appeared to go along&mdash;certainly there was no sign of dissent&mdash;over a month ago that, irrespective of the British decision in this regard, we were going to enter this scheme.  I drew attention yesterday to the indignation the Taoiseach showed the previous day when Deputy P. Barry alleged the Taoiseach had expressed such a point of view.  I think Deputy P. Barry had been confusing The Taoiseach with the Minister for Finance because it is certain <Col N="749" /> the Minister for Finance did create that impression.  There are more instances than one but I will just cite <i>The Irish Times</i> report of 19 September, which came from Brussels, and quoted Deputy Colley's reaction as Minister for Finance after the end of the EEC Finance Council meeting.  The Minister said: &ldquo;If, however, Britain decided not to participate it would be essential to enable the Republic to join.&rdquo;  I read that, and so would anybody else, as being a commitment in principle, assuming we can get the money he had in mind, to align this country with this scheme irrespective of the British decision.  I am not the only person, and neither is Deputy Barry, who drew this conclusion.  A paper delivered by Mr. David Croughan, senior economist in the Confederation of Irish Industry, pointed out at a seminar of the Irish Council of the European Movement last week that this decision had been made in principle.  I quote: &ldquo;Indeed, Government statements to date have been fairly firm that Ireland will join the European Monetary System regardless of what the UK decision is.&rdquo; That certainly implies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before the Deputy goes any further, do not muddy the waters any more.  We consistently said our decision would be taken independently of the British decision provided the terms are right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an important distinction.  I will develop it in my own speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should at least&mdash;I respect his profession as an economist&mdash;not misinterpret two very definitive statements made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, without any critical standards apparently being applied to them and without any figures given, which makes it very difficult for the layman to understand what <Col N="750" /> exactly is involved for this country.  The impression given this month by the Government, and Deputy Barry is quite right in this, is that we will go in irrespective of what Britain does.  Any decision can be predictable if certain conditions are observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The impression given was that a decision had been made in principle. Here I want to accuse the Government of doing something which is entirely in the tradition they have displayed and fostered for 50 years, the tradition of playing down to the ignorance of the people.  I accuse them in this regard of an exercise in what I describe as leprechaun economics.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a weak witted Wolfe Toneism which finds its expression in the idea that there is some national objective to be achieved in breaking the link with sterling even if half the people in the country are thrown out of their jobs.  I will give an example of the leprechaun mentality.  It comes from &ldquo;Tuarascáil&rdquo; in <i>The Irish Times</i> of last Wednesday.  I made a rough translation of it:</P>
      <P>It was a nice thing that George Colley said on Sunday: that there will be an end, maybe, to the link between our own money and that of Britain before he puts his Budget before the Dail at the beginning of next year.  But we hope, if Britain stays out of the Community monetary system, that Mr. Colley will make some bargain with them, the way that both sorts of pound will be valid in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>What kind of bargain could you make the way both pounds would be?  I do not see any aid to economic bargaining.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not finished with &ldquo;Tuarascáil&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It would be an imbecile thing if we had to go for a <i>bureau de change</i> under a bush or at the back of a bramble every time we went to Crossmaglen or Aughnacloy....  Now that pigs have golden tails and cows have golden horns it would be right that we would be able to depend on ourselves and part with the British pound with or without Community help.  But the Act of Union will never be repealed until this is a currency independent of the British pound in all Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That shows the Irish literary tradition is flourishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the least of what it shows and I will concede that one straight away.  What it does show is that it is lucky from some points of view that they are printed in Irish because they would be laughed out of it if they were printed in English.  That point of view is entirely in consonance with the atmosphere which the Government are allowing to creep up.  It has a grand ring about it.  The pikes will be together by the rising of the moon to break the link with sterling.  We will be doing it on the Curragh of Kildare next.</P>
      <P>I am still waiting to hear from the Government a serious assessment of the prospects for the Irish £ in the event that the English £ and itself drift apart.  I do not want to offend Deputy O'Kennedy, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but I cannot regard his speech as a serious contribution on this topic.  The Taoiseach spoke on this matter on Tuesday and I will give you my interpretation of the Fianna Fáil language, for what it is worth.  I feel that the Taoiseach, as a former Minister for Finance, has grave misgivings, which he is dressing up in Fianna Fáil speech, about this weak-witted Wolfe Toneism on the financial plane.  His misgivings came through when he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important element in our assessment will concern the implications of participation in the system on relations with Northern Ireland and progress towards the objective of national unity by consent.  The most <Col N="752" /> favourable outcome from this view-point would clearly be the establishment of a durable system on a basis that would embrace both the United Kingdom and Ireland and would have a beneficial impact on both economies.  An acceleration of economic development in this part of the country would enhance the economic attractions of cross-Border economic co-operation and of eventual national unity.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt the Taoiseach's commitment to national unity any more than I doubt the commitment of any other Deputy, but when I see this hare being raised in this context it is a signal that he has grave misgivings about an unconsidered departure of the Irish £ from the British £.</P>
    <P>I am neither for it nor against it.  I am for it if the terms are right.  I would ally us with the Finnish mark or with Icelandic currency if the terms were right.  I am waiting to get from the Government their assessment of two things.  One of them is what the Irish £ is worth by itself, a naked bare Irish £.  That question has not yet been raised.  When that has been established and we have made a calculation of what the value of our £ by itself would be, I want to know whether the balance of advantage would be for or against joining a system which would award it a value on its own merits, independent of sterling.  It is scarcely credible that a debate like this could be in its third day and the Government, who have appointed a special Minister for Economic Planning and Development, could still have left us unenlightened about this.  I am not an economist, I have to fly by the seat of my pants in dealing with matters like this and I do not mind being lectured by the Minister. I just hope that he will not leave this bit out of his lecture when he replies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Do we get extra time to lecture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>A question will be asked in Europe and in the rest of the world which never has been asked before: what is the Irish £ worth?  Myles na gCopaleen once got impatient when he heard people talking about the link with sterling and <Col N="753" /> said: &ldquo;The Irish £ is sterling, the only difference being that instead of a portrait of Queen Elizabeth there is a personable shawlie on the £ note.&rdquo;  What is our currency worth independent of the British £?  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance said nothing on that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not take his economic advice from Myles na gCopaleen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know whether this debate will conclude without our hearing anything about this from the Government.  I should like to know from the leprechaun economists on the other side, whether senior or junior&mdash;the junior leprechauns felt that they were not being taken seriously in the councils of Europe and had to be given a grander title so that they would not be shoved down below the salt altogether&mdash;what their calculation is in this regard.  Might it be the case in the event of the British not joining this system and our deciding that the conditions were right that the Department of Finance or the Department for Economic Planning and Development calculate that our £ will be attached to the European system at a level above or below that of the British £?  What are the consequences for our naked £?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must realise that this exercise is pretty empty.  In both Houses and on both sides there are not five people capable of debating this subject with an adequate professional knowledge. The rest of us just have to do our best.  I presume that values attached to currencies are not simply pulled out of the air or arbitrarily chosen.  They are related to factors like a country's balance of trade and they are contrived to exist at a point that will ensure that a country is not beggared, and does not beggar its neighbours.  The currency which we will be using once we are separated from the British £ will have some value.  I cannot foresee what it will be, but I would have expected the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance to tell us.  Will it be the case that, while the British will go on getting 3.75 marks for their £, we will get only, say, 2.50 dm for ours and that, <Col N="754" /> while the British will be getting 8 francs for their £, we will be getting only 6?  Is that a possibility?  I should like to know what the Government think about this. If the situation is as I have outlined, then we will be getting only 70p in Holyhead for an Irish £.  What effect will that have on our economy?  In the short term it will have a very healthy effect on our exports, but what effect will it have on the enormous relative preponderance of manufactured consumer goods imported from Britain?  What effect will it have on the consumer price index and what effect will the CPI have on wage rounds thereafter?  This House will make itself ridiculous if it concludes this debate without discussing these questions.</P>
    <P>I listened to three speeches from the Government side and the impression that remains with me is that, so far from being enlightened as to the probabilities of a financial kind which this system opens up, we were being lectured by all three Ministers, particularly by Deputy O'Kennedy, in regard to restraint and discipline.  I lost count of the number of times the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke about discipline.  He was like an evangelising scoutmaster&mdash;discipline, discipline, discipline.  He was waving his rod at us for an hour and ten minutes about discipline.  That is not good enough in a debate on the European Monetary System.  If there never were such a thing as the European Monetary System, discipline in regard to wage demands and discipline by the Government in what they offer to people by way of reliefs is required at the best of times.</P>
    <P>In regard to the centre of gravity of Deputy O'Kennedy's speech yesterday, I am reminded of something which the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>The new system can increase investment and trade.  It can reduce unemployment and inflation.  But it is equally true that none of these things will happen if we diverge too widely from the standard of practices which have ensured the success of the major Continental economies.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Diverge widely&rdquo;?  When were we ever next or near the practices&mdash;economic, social or political&mdash;which left the Germans and the Dutch where they are?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="755" /> When I was a student in Germany 24 years ago I was getting 11.65 marks for a £1 note.  I can now get 3.75 marks. That difference is accounted for by an inestimable amount of German sweat, hard work, restraint and discipline, all the things Deputy O'Kennedy is in favour of but that he never preached to his electors in north Tipperary at election time.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch never used the television to preach coming up to election time.  The Germans and the people who are of the same kidney as themselves have achieved that. They have achieved that not by lying in bed with brandy hangovers but by getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning and eating their breakfast on the trams and doing three hours work before a time when Donnybrook Bridge is choked with traffic from people going into their business which they are going to leave again in another hour and a half for their lunch break.  That is how they did it. When did we ever come next or near such practices?  When were we ever encouraged to come next or near such practices?  It has been a soft sell from that side of the House from the day that party ever started, soft soap and soft options.</P>
    <P>The Coalition got a hammering from the press and from the Opposition which put it out of Government because it had an unsympathetic face.  It had in a lot of ways.  I will never be found apologising for, say, Senator's Cooney's hard line towards the people who would put bombs in a passenger train, and I will not apologise for Deputy Ryan's perhaps excessive moods of speech when he was telling the people that he was not just going to soak the wage earners but that he was going to soak the rest as well in order to pull the economy out of the recession.  These were disagreeable things to have to say and do but they were done by a Government with a sense of responsibility.  When we went to the polls in 1977 we did not make a flock of promises which now the Taoiseach is trying to persuade the people to forget.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We must not diverge too widely from the practices which have ensured the success of the major continental <Col N="756" /> economies&rdquo;.  By coincidence I was in Germany during their last general election. I happened to be there during the week coming up not just to their last general election but coming up to their last two general elections.  I cannot tell you the gap, I cannot describe the depth of the abyss that separates the political practice in what is now a model democracy from that here.  I could not describe the scorn and contempt with which something like the Fianna Fáil manifesto would have been received by the kind of people I am talking about who achieved that economic miracle.  I cannot describe how beneath contempt the Fianna Fáil Party and all it stands for and all it has stood for would be regarded by the people in Munich, in Bremen, in Frankfurt, who have brought that economy up from ruins and put it at the head of Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  When I think of 1973, when I think of that modest 14-point programme, when I think of what I suppose was the starryeyed optimism, which seemed very unreasonable at the beginning of February of that year, with which it was put together and when I think what an enormous proportion of it was achieved in difficult times, I feel sad at the thought, not that I am out of a job&mdash;believe me, I cannot say how little that means because I am perhaps in a sense happier on these benches in some ways&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it makes me sad for the people, the rank and file workers who simply could not find it within them to be bought by Fianna Fáil, the voters who could not find it in them to be attracted by those promises.  It makes me feel sad for them and sadder still for the vital 50,000 who were persuaded to change sides by the remission of motor taxation which of course they should still be paying.  It makes me sad to think of the occasional failures of the 14-point <Col N="757" /> plan.  We promised to control prices and we made a miserable failure of that.  I never denied it.  I said it in this House as early as 1974 that we never should have made such a promise.  It was a foolish promise to make and we have paid the penalty for it.  I do not whinge about it or complain about it.  If I have anything to do with manifestos in future that promise will never appear in it and I would say it will never appear on a Fianna Fáil one again either on their present performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the quality of the Taoiseach's contribution here that we should not diverge from the continental practices that put the Germans, the Dutch and the Danes where they are.  We could not be further away from these practices and we are being dragged further and further away from them by the manner and style of the Fianna Fáil Party and Government in the 1977 election and after.  Of course there is a weak attempt to draw back now.  There is a hope that the people will now accept a cold bath which they will perhaps have a chance to get themselves dry from and warm from before the next election comes along.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made a speech of bottomless fatuity in Belfield yesterday in which he said that redundancies were responsible for the fact that the employment targets of Fianna Fáil had not been reached.  I am amazed the students did not run him out.  He might as well have said that prices were to blame for inflation. That is the level of the contribution from a man who wants us &ldquo;not to diverge too far from continental practices&rdquo;.  He would not survive for five minutes at the head of the CDU or the SPD.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>At every stage of this short speech I am trying to stick to the text which has been put before this House by <Col N="758" /> two members of the Government.  I am not going to say much more but if I could be allowed a bit of latitude I want to divert for a moment from the kind of controversial material I have been giving the House up to this and to say something which I hope the House will regard as constructive.  The reason why this exercise with the EMS is a potentially perilous one for us lies embedded somewhere in the reflections to which the Taoiseach gave expression, in the words &ldquo;we should not diverge from the European practice&rdquo;.  Another reason why it is perilous for us and why the questions which I want to hear discussed and answered here are vital is that we have too many trade eggs in one basket.</P>
      <P>That situation has enormously improved as can be freely admitted since 1970 or thereabouts but we still have far too many trade eggs in one basket. Therefore the question of breaking the link, about which I have no chauvinist feelings one way or the other, with the currency of that large trading partner is a vital one for us.  But there is a corollary to that simple proposition and it is that we should make ten times more effort than we are doing&mdash;in saying that I do not in any way mean to belittle the efforts of Córas Tráchtála; indeed I would like to praise Córas Tráchtála and everybody else connected with trade here&mdash;we should make ten times more effort to diversify our trade with the other countries in Europe so that whatever happens to the British £ we will not be entirely dependent on the relationship of our trading economy to theirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I promise not to be contentious any more.  I would be grateful for five minutes to read to the House something which I feel deserves publication in a more serious context than in the Aer Lingus inflight magazine &ldquo;Cara&rdquo;.  It is an interview with a gentleman called Anthony Cooney who was the representative of Córas Tráchtála in Western Germany.  He says some very interesting things about the Irish exporters in Germany and what he says about Germany applies equally to Holland, Belgium and, <Col N="759" /> in a slightly lesser degree, to France, Italy and Denmark.  He points out first of all that there is a difficulty in communication between the Irish exporter and the Germans.  What he says about Germany can be taken as applicable to the whole of the continental EEC.  The difficulty in communications arises from or is very largely contributed to by the inability of the Irish exporter to speak any language except his own.  This handicap will be with us as long as Irish business executives are unable to communicate with the Germans in German on the same level as German businessmen can communicate in English.  The interviewer asked him if there was any noticeable improvement in this situation.  Mr. Cooney said:</P>
    <P>I certainly have not seen any on the ground this side.  I could possibly count on the fingers of one hand the number of Irish businessmen I have known over recent years who can speak German with any effect, in a business context.</P>
    <P>At a later point in the interview he urged that the semi-State bodies should blackguard&mdash;although he did not use that word&mdash;the Department of Education into providing a better training in continental languages.  The Japs, the Chinese and the people in Hong Kong would not think this a fatuous suggestion. French is the only language that gets a look in for reasons that are 100 years out of date.  He then spoke about the situation with regard to trying to assess what a huge market such as the German market needs.  It was constantly being put to him by the interviewer that the Irish product could stand up to other products and he replied that there are some things associated with Ireland and with the image it has, such as the fresh air, that do not need to be especially pushed in Germany.  The Germans will buy items such as tweed, smoked salmon and holidays but he regards it as an eccentric idea that he should buy a computer or a chemical ingredient produced in Ireland.  It is a new idea to him.  That idea is even more exotic still <Col N="760" /> when it comes to consumer goods.  He said:</P>
    <P>We would have to put the German consumer on the analyst's couch, and ask him a number of questions in relation to Ireland, before we could even begin to make decisions about what for example our promotional symbol should be, or what kind of flavour our promotional activity should take. There is an awful lot of work involved in this kind of activity, there is an awful lot of money involved.  But even that would not be a problem if there was a firm consciousness, a determination among the organisation whose responsibility it is to do this kind of thing, that it should happen.  The determination does not exist.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Government for this.  This is a deep-rooted problem, educationally and socially, but it is highly relevant to what we are discussing now. Mr. Cooney was asked whether Irish people generally had taken advantage of new Common Market links to set up business in Germany and he replied:</P>
    <P>No, and this is disturbing and saddening. All politicians and Ministers have been keen to remind us that entry into the Common Market would mean expanded or extended home markets.  But the fact is that we are not treating these markets like home markets.</P>
    <P>If the people from Hong Kong were here they would not be long learning how to penetrate those markets and their politicians would not be slow to regard that as a number one priority, that the national aspirations should take a back seat for a few years.  Mr. Cooney continued:</P>
    <P>We are still treating them like foreign markets, we are afraid of them.  I think there are only four Irish citizens running registered businesses in Germany at this point in time.  That is some four to five years after our entry into the European Common Market.</P>
    <P>Of those four or five businesses I think a couple of them are pubs.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of thing we should be talking about in this debate.  It should <Col N="761" /> not be an exercise in trying to persuade the people that we have threshed out the matter of the EMS.  We have not.  We have not faced up to the real problem of breaking down our excessive dependence on Britain as a trading partner and, secondly, we are still waiting from the Government side a calculation of what the Irish £ will be worth when it is standing by itself.  I hope it will not be beneath the dignity of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to deal with both these matters in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important issue to arise at the Bremen Conference was the question of the EMS and the questions that arise from that.  Whether all the member states join or not, the creation of a greater zone of economic stability in the Community will have important consequences for trade and economic activity in all regions and sectors.  The consequences for agriculture are special ones and I should like to concentrate on them.</P>
      <P>Currency instability has had a greater impact for agriculture in the Common Market than in the Community market for other goods and services.  Because of the nature of the common price system the Community has had to introduce MCAs to counteract monetary disturbances that we have seen during the decade.  We are all aware of the results. The unity of the market has been broken and trade distortions have multiplied. While we had high MCA charges our exports to many markets were penalised. Nevertheless, it is only fair to point out that without MCAs the Common Agricultural Policy as we know it would hardly have survived intact.  Trade with certain markets, especially the United Kingdom, has been facilitated by MCAs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the new monetary system is established the present complex MCA position will be stabilised and simplified. If the new system is successful the prospect of a gradual phasing out of existing MCAs will be enhanced greatly. This is important for the whole Community since it would mean a return to the situation where all producers and <Col N="762" /> traders were on the same footing and it would involve substantial savings for the Community budget.  It is particularly important for us since it is the only sure way to eliminate the anomalies and inaccuracies of the MCA system, some&mdash; but by no means all&mdash;of which are greatly to our disadvantage.  Apart from this and also apart from certain technical changes in the way in which MCAs are calculated, the new system would not involve any substantial changes in the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>Of course the system could have particular trade implications if we were members of the EMS and the United Kingdom was not a member.  Breaking parity with sterling would affect trade in agricultural products to only a fairly small degree.  This is because the much maligned MCA system insulates agriculture from the immediate effects of exchange rate changes.  About 90 per cent of our agricultural exports are subject to MCAs.  If the Irish £ were to appreciate against sterling, for the export of these products to the United Kingdom the result would imply a corresponding increase in the MCA subsidy.</P>
    <P>There are a small number of agricultural products&mdash;sheepmeat and potatoes are the main ones&mdash;that are not subject to MCAs.  For sheepmeat we are looking increasingly to France rather than to the United Kingdom for our export outlets and stable exchange rates would help us there.  For potatoes, the future prospects would be greatly influenced by whether we succeed in getting a useful common organisation during the next few months.</P>
    <P>Certain processed products are also outside the MCA system.  In the event of a break with sterling and a consequential appreciation of the Irish £ some difficulties could arise.  In the case of some processed products there are anomalies in the MCA system and they involve problems for us at present.  These problems could be aggravated. However, much would depend on the extent to which we succeed in reducing the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>In other respects the EMS has consequences of considerable importance for us.  We have seen tremendous developments <Col N="763" /> in Irish agriculture in recent years. To a large extent these are due to the stimulation of a reasonably rapid increase in the price of goods produced by the farmer.  The biggest single factor in these price increases has been the fairly frequent green £ increases.  Often this policy of adjusting the green £ in line with the movement of sterling is a sensible one for us and the results are obvious. In a new system we must expect fairly infrequent green £ adjustments and consequently less price stimulations in agricultural development.</P>
    <P>We would expect other incentives&mdash;a lower rate of inflation, for instance. However, the main emphasis for agricultural development in better farming would come from efficiency, greater productivity and greater output.  We must be in a position to compete on equal terms with our partners in the Community or we will not succeed. Even though we could no longer rely on inflation and green £ changes to provide large price increases for farmers, there is no reason why Irish agriculture should not continue to thrive and prosper even giving increased efficiency, productivity and output.  In planning for greater development Irish farmers have the estimable security of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I mentioned earlier that I do not see the new European Monetary System in itself involving any major changes in the CAP.  Neither despite some recent comments, should changes of any kind have to be made as the price of the establishment of the EMS.  The agricultural policy has served the Community well.  There is a firm commitment among the majority within the Community to the principles and mechanisms underlining the policy. These will not be bargained away.  The policy will develop otherwise it will fossilise, but its fundamentals will not be changed.  There will be development and not dilution.</P>
    <P>Bremen did, however, call for some changes in their reference to consideration for special agricultural problems in the Mediterranean and other less favoured regions, though there is no doubt that the market organisation for some Mediterranean products is weak.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> We have always supported and will continue to support efforts to strengthen these markets.  This strengthening must not, however, be at the expense of producers elsewhere in the Community and it is our firm intention to insist on that.  Market improvements alone will not solve the problems of the Mediterranean or of other less favoured regions.</P>
    <P>Structural developments also are required and we have consistently pressed for these.  A major advance has been made in this regard by the inclusion in the last price package of the special Mediterranean action programme and of drainage measures for Ireland.  At the same time I secured the commitment of Mr. Gundelach on behalf of the Commission for further structural proposals for the west of Ireland.  At the Taoiseach's insistence the reference to the Mediterranean areas in the Bremen conclusions was extended to include other less favoured regions and to take account of that commitment.  Detailed arrangements for the new western drainage measures have been prepared by my Department and the Office of Public Works and these are now in the final stages of being cleared in Brussels. As soon as clearance is received the new arrangements will be announced and the schemes can be got under way.</P>
    <P>As regards the further measures for the west, officials of my Department and of the Board of Works have had a number of discussions with the Commission officials over the past few months including visits by officials of the Commission to the west of Ireland and proposals for further measures are now being drawn up by the Commission. When the Commission have taken a decision I would hope that the proposals could be approved by the Council of Ministers within a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I see EMS as involving no major changes for the Common Agricultural Policy.  It should stabilise and possibly make easier the phased elimination of MCAs.  If we join and this results in a break with sterling, the majority of agricultural products are insulated from the effects by the Community system.  Finally, and most important, future agricultural development in an EMS situation will more than ever depend <Col N="765" /> on the ability of our farmers to increase their efficiency and productivity.  I have no doubts about their ability to do this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his introductory comments to this debate indicated very clearly that most of the work on this issue has yet to be done.  He indicated also that as yet it is not possible to come to any firm conclusions about this prospect of closer monetary co-operation.  It is necessary at this stage again to remind ourselves of that salient fact.  One has only to read this morning's newspapers to see continuing negotiations between the British Prime Minister and the German Government and the discussions therein to appreciate that as yet a great deal of water has to flow under the bridges of the Nine before we can really come to any definite conclusions as to the balance of the advantage to this country of joining the system.</P>
      <P>There seems to be an automatic fatalistic assumption in this country that willy-nilly whatever the French and the Germans jointly devise&mdash;and that is the nub of the issue&mdash;it is they who are making the running and whatever they devise we will automatically hop on that Franco-German train overnight.  We are not quite sure even what the destination is going to be.  We must be careful on this.  It reminds me of the kind of euphoric statements which were made in 1972.  I will be glad to get the sketch afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We must remind ourselves that in 1972 there was a great deal of euphoria in this country on entry into the Community.  I was very much in favour of entry and still am.  I held then that the net balance of advantage lay with this country joining.  I was not very popular with some sections of the trade union and labour movements for advancing that view at that time, but it was done with a degree of sobriety. Therefore, some of the more euphoric nonsense which is talked in relation to this issue has to be discarded very rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> The Taoiseach has suggested, and I quote him, &ldquo;The new system can increase investment and trade.  It can reduce unemployment and inflation&rdquo;.  This is not necessarily true.  It is a hypothetical proposition.  It is like saying that if we give up sin overnight we will finish up in Heaven but we will not be aware of that consequence until after we are dead. Some of the euphoria which has been generated around this issue has been elevated to a degree of complexity with which the common politician and the common electorate could not possibly appreciate.  This is a little bit of hoo-hah which some politicians like to indulge in on the basis that they know best for the electorate in their countries.</P>
    <P>One has to look at the situation in a very calm and objective manner.  I want to go on record, as I did when we entered the Community in 1972, that I am not opposed to the idea of a sensible scheme for monetary stability in Europe provided the scheme is conceived in such a way that it will facilitate the immediate and long-term growth of the European economies.  I am not opposed in principle to this new scheme.  I would favour it provided&mdash;this is a tremendous proviso&mdash;the Community arrangements for the transfer of capital resources are designed to make a real impact on unemployment in Ireland and in the Community. I am not opposed to such a scheme provided there is sufficient flexibility within it to protect ordinary national, economic and social objectives but there is no indication that that is so. There is not as yet the slightest indication that the introduction of this new system will result in the transfer of any resources to this country or to any other country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance came to the House on Tuesday last and spoke about Ireland looking for £650 million.  There is not the slightest indication so far that we will get even £1 transferred resources because of engaging in this operation. We may make a big deal about certain transitional arrangements in relation to agriculture in the west of Ireland.  They may be major to some areas of the west of Ireland but I believe they would have come irrespective of any negotiations in <Col N="767" /> relation to European co-operation.  It has to be put on the record that the degree of transferred resources to date in the Community has been very small.  We have to be careful to ensure that any new scheme of voluntary stability will not inhibit the prospect of radical, national and structural planning which we need here and which we do not have. We have not any development of major State enterprise here.  We must ensure that the new disciplines will not inhibit that in any way.</P>
    <P>We all know that we have a pretty bad system of industrial relations with virtually no worker participation in enterprises here.  The result of this is that by and large workers care very little about the viability of the enterprises they work in.  There is no indication that this system will encourage that development. As politicians we have very little control over the general banking system here and there is no indication that the introduction of this new monetary system will give any impetus to such control.</P>
    <P>We are entitled in those circumstances to have considerable reservations about the real impact of this new monetary system.  As we know, we tend to have fashions.  We had a fashion in the mid-sixties of the development of free trade with Britain.  Now we are coming on to a further economic fashion.  It is now fashionable to spend one's time talking about economic and monetary co-operation. It is incredible that a number of member states in the Community, including Ireland, with the possible exception of Britain, are following sheep-like this Franco-German self-centred and self-interested initiative without asking for and without securing one institutional reform in the Community. There is no question of Ireland going to the French and Germans and saying that we want the regional fund changed and we want the social fund changed as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for our involvement. There is no indication that there is any marriage between institutional reform in those proposals and the introduction of the Franco-German initiative.  That is a pity because that opportunity is open to us in those negotiations.</P>
    <P>It is not wise to rush headlong by the <Col N="768" /> middle of December into this new arrangement. Who is doing all the running? It is the French and the Germans. I have been on the Council of Europe for the past five years and I have met many French and German politicians.  I am a member of the Economic and Social Committee of the Council of Europe.  They have assured me on many occasions, even as late as a few weeks ago, that if it suits them they will ditch it, just as the French did on many occasions and as the Germans will do if it suits them.  That is why I have some support for the caution, some of which may be chauvinistic but a good deal of which is a bit more hard-nosed, of Jim Callaghan and the British Treasury.  They will not be taken for a soft ride in terms of these negotiations.</P>
    <P>Our Minister is off to Bonn.  I am quite certain that the President of the Commission, Mr. Jenkins was given the assurance that we were anxious to enter irrespective of the cost.  The £650 million, apart from it being of very little relevance, is the Irish sop we are seeking for entry.  I say that as one who has repeatedly wished to see Ireland deeply involved in European integration in the Common Market.  As one who campaigned within my own party at a time when it was unpopular to support that point of view, I feel that we have to be very careful in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>Another assumption that has gained a great deal of influence in recent years is that the exchange rates can be enormous in terms of the economic and social development of individual economies. That is no more than a point of view.  It is not necessarily a fact of life.  I do not necessarily share the view that changes in exchange rates have a dominant influence on the balance of payments adjustments. I do not necessarily share the view that exchange-rate mechanisms which the Community currently enjoy are going to pose major problems for producers, traders, investors and the servicing of the public debt.  I admit that fluctuating rates do not help in an atmosphere of uncertainty but I question their influence.  There is too much pre-occupation with post Keynesian economic theory on the part of the Government, Mr. Jenkins and some of <Col N="769" /> the Commission's personnel involved in these proposals.  I hold the view that there are more vitally influencing factors here than exchange rate relationships. Our incomes policy could wipe out our current disabilities in relation to exchange rates.  One major change in our industrial relations policy could wipe out the relative impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the disabilities they have for Irish exports and for our general relationship with Europe.</P>
    <P>Our failure to resolve major problems both in industry and agriculture is of much greater importance.  We have a level of industrial technology and of general entrepreneurial skill which are quite low.  These are of greater importance in terms of our economic and national development than the influence of any exchange rate policy that we might wish to follow The general level of import prices outside the EEC can be of even greater importance.</P>
    <P>Without trying to knock the relative importance of this debate, it has to be stressed that the extent to which we indulge in closer monetary co-operation is no panacea for our remaining problems.  Some of the euphoria which has been generated by the Government in relation to this issue has to be discounted to a considerable degree.</P>
    <P>One of the major observations of the Taoiseach and the Minister is the need for discipline if we enter into this new relationship.  If we are to enter into it with confidence, the Minister said, it will require improved productivity and a general commitment to the necessary incomes policy from the commencement of the new system.  The Minister was preceded by the Taoiseach when he said that the Government will have to operate fiscal and monetary policies which will sustain growth, encourage employment and keep down costs.  He indicated that the social partners will be under an inescapable obligation to complement those efforts.  In particular, he said, it will be essential to ensure that the rate of increase in incomes does not out-strip productivity.</P>
    <P>I view with great scepticism, if not <Col N="770" /> downright cynicism, comments of that nature.  There is no national effort in relation to incomes policy of any shape, size or consequence.  The efforts of the previous Government, particularly the efforts of the much maligned former Minister for Finance, to try to have some developments towards an incomes policy floundered and he was kicked out on his ear; so were the rest of us.  We were not successful in creating a national climate of moderation and restraint in relation to incomes policies. Now we have the Taoiseach, even last night, chasing around the country saying that if we are to have a new system of monetary co-operation we must accept the disciplines of the French and the Germans, in so far as they are the leaders in terms of what comprises discipline at this stage.</P>
    <P>No matter what sector one looks at at present, no sector is willing to observe any form of moderation and restraint in income control.  This was being deliberately encouraged by Fianna Fáil prior to the election.  The situation now is that the Garda Síochána wish to have substantial pay increases well in excess of national pay agreements.  The local authority engineers feel they must have their slice of the cake.  The Post Office technicians, another major group, wish to have their share of the action.  Every speculator in the country has already had his share of the action with the changes in capital taxation.  There is not a farmer in the country who wishes to pay a penny more in taxation.  Deputy Haughey handed the medical consultants a 25 per cent increase on the basis of buying some involvment from them in a more comprehensive health scheme. Go through the list and take any interest group and you will not find restraint.  Is there any restraint on the part of Ministers?  People drive around in State cars at a conservative cost to the tax-payer of £35,000 for a Mercedes.</P>

      <P>In giving these examples I have referred to what I regard as sectional indifference to any form of restraint or moderation.  No matter what sector one takes one finds not the slightest response in relation to the need for income discipline put forward by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. We have created that climate as politicians because in successive elections we have tried to convince people that they need only vote for us to get automatically the benefits of such selfishness and automatically the economy will continue to expand.  We know from bitter experience and the experience of some 93,000 people still unemployed that that kind of situation cannot be sustained in an economy the size of ours.  That is my fundamental point.  We have been hypocritical with the Irish people <Col N="773" /> because we have failed and continue to fail, even by the personal example of Ministers, to convince the people of the need for such restraint.</P>
      <P>I think my point is echoed very well and very coherently by the President of the ICTU, Mr. O'Sullivan, this morning, when he pointed out the kind of social climate we have created in which none of us produces goods with great productivity, starts a factory, exports our commodities, travels to the markets, learns a foreign language and becomes an entrepreneur in the truest sense.  We have not trained our Irish people to develop in that way; but we have trained them to make a buck as fast as they can, to speculate and grow fat on the backs of their fellow countrymen.  We have encouraged that system and climate.  The present Government have been adept in fostering that climate over the years.</P>
      <P>The question of transfer payments loomed large in recent debate and has been referred to, particularly by the Minister for Finance in his speech.  The papers submitted to date by the Irish members of the committee participating in these negotiations advance an estimate of £650 million.  This has been defined by the Minister for Finance as additional investment required in the immediate and narrow context of entry to the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amount is extraordinarily small bearing in mind the amount of transfer payment which we require not just in terms of economic and monetary co-operation but in terms of any real prospect of transfer of Community resources in the system itself.  It should be pointed out that FEOGA guarantee expenditure which has come to us and which has brought great benefit particularly to the farming community&mdash;I do not regard that expenditure as being in the normal definition of the term a resource transfer.  Some people in Ireland have taken this into account in talking of transfer payments from the Community to us.  This would seriously distort any consideration of transfer payments.  It simply represents payments made to us under the FEOGA guarantee section which have been very substantial, some £350 million for 1978 in the <Col N="774" /> latest estimate.  That sum, in my opinion, is the overall impact of CAP and merely one element in the operation of the Common Market as a whole.  I do not regard it as a transfer payment but rather as a repercussion of the integration of the market itself.</P>
    <P>Resource transfer mechanisms are, in particular, the FEOGA guidance section, the social fund and the regional fund.  Any examination of these three areas will show that payments to us are, by and large, rather minimal.  In 1976 Ireland received about 5 per cent of the total of the payments available within the Community.  It seems an extraordinary figure that the receipts to this country from the social fund and the European Regional Development Fund should represent only .3 per cent of Ireland's GNP.  It seems an extremely low level of resource transfers to the least well off State as we allege we are, and it is true enough.  It is a very small indication of the resource transfers resulting from the present mechanisms.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the reply by the Minister for Finance as reported at columns 271 and 272 of the Official Report of 12 October 1978.  In the five years since 1973 to 1978, on average we have received about £17 million a year from the social fund.  That is a miniscule allocation to us.  We have received amounts varying from £4.6 million in 1973, £8.4 million in 1974, about £12 million in 1976, about £20 million in 1977, and £25 million in 1978.  The average payment to us from the social fund over the past five years has been £17.3 million.  The regional development fund payment for 1978 is estimated at £17 million.  There has been a whole range of studies such as the regional studies jointly financed by Ireland and the Communities, pilot projects and studies to combat poverty, projects in the hydrocarbons sector, research and development projects, moneys for miscellaneous surveys and studies carried out by Irish agencies for the Commission. For those we get about £1 million in 1978.</P>
    <P>One has to start these negotiations by pointing out to the Community in no uncertain terms that the contribution by the Community to this country in terms <Col N="775" /> of real resource transfers by and large has been minimal.  Of course&mdash;and this is grist to the mill of what one would call the anti-common marketeers&mdash;the reverse has happened and the disparities have widened since Ireland joined the Community.  In Ireland's case, GNP per head has fallen relative to the Community average despite the fact that we negotiated Protocol 30 of the Treaty of Accession which recognised the special problems of concern to us and the need to ensure the success of the Irish Government's policy on industrial and economic development.</P>
    <P>I recall the tremendous Dail debate on that Protocol.  I recall the way in which the Protocol called on the Community institutions to use all the means at their disposal under the Treaties for the purpose of achieving those objectives, and in particular the financial resources of the Community.  During that period the GNP <i>per capita</i> of the most well off countries has improved.  Admittedly in isolation it improved in Ireland too, but relative to the Community it declined and our general rate of unemployment is still the highest in the Community.</P>
    <P>With regard to the estimate of £650 million the Minister said it is necessary to have regard to the balance of political and tactical realities.  He dismissed it as that and gave no further elaboration.  I do not think his heart is very much in the prospect of obtaining even £650 million of transitional aid.  It must be pointed out repeatedly to the Community that we have not benefited to any significant degree from transfer resources.  The tremendous benefit which the CAP has been to Irish farmers has over-shadowed dramatically the impact we expected from other areas, particularly the social fund and the regional development fund.</P>
    <P>The speeches by the Taoiseach and the Minister rather dismissively ignored the tremendous impact a change in exchange rates could have on Irish industry. I am talking not so much in the context of an incomes policy or wage costs generally, but in the context of the impact a new system dealing with the prevailing rates of exchange could have. The problems of a number of industries which are already in serious difficulties, <Col N="776" /> notably the clothing, footwear and furniture industries which are experiencing great difficulty in competing on the home market, would be exacerbated if the Irish £ were to be revalued against sterling.</P>
    <P>There shall be further consultation between the Government and the Confederation of Irish Industry and the individual industrial sectors prior to the conclusion of the negotiations.  I hope this will come about.  There is no evidence of much consultation as yet. Next December this House could be presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> by the Government saying: &ldquo;This is the package.  We have negotiated it at the final meeting and we are in&rdquo;.  I do not think the Government are sufficiently sophisticated to take on this issue on their own.  I do not think sufficient study has been made of the situation to enable the Government to proceed willy-nilly with the negotiations and bring back a package whether we like it or not.</P>
    <P>There should be further extensive consultations between the Government and the CII and the individual sectors about the impact of possible changes.  Since we do not yet know the variables open to us, it is not possible as yet to assess the precise changes.  Reading contributions made by a number of CII experts in this field, and appreciating the disquiet which is quite evident now in many sectors of the business community about this proposal, the Government would be well advised to initiate extensive consultations with them.</P>
    <P>These are my observations on this proposal.  I do not believe the introduction of the new system envisaged will necessarily take Europe any more rapidly out of recession.  We are now in the final stages of recession and the prospects are reasonably good in terms of economic indicators, but I do not hold the view that we are on the verge of a major breakthrough simply because of a new system of monetary co-operation being introduced.  The euphoria about the EMS, particularly the euphoria generated by the President of the Commission, Mr. Jenkins, is somewhat irrelevant in terms of the origins of the proposals and in terms of the real intent <Col N="777" /> behind them.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government have lost an opportunity of seeking major institutional changes parallel with these negotiations.  That opportunity is not likely to come again because the French and the Germans are not likely to provide an opportunity for such fundamental negotiations in regard to institutional changes again, but will rather proceed on the basis of their own self-interest and expect the other countries of the Nine to go along with them.  In reality that is what we are doing, and it is in that context we have to view these negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate centres on a fundamental financial matter and, when one removes the emotion of the initial comments, one is down to a very fundamental economic matter which must be debated at length.  Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance were very forthcoming.  They certainly gave the House a broad outline of the up-to-date situation.</P>
      <P>If one looks back to 1927 when the punt was introduced, one finds that at that stage it was necessary to get some confidence associated with the currency and, as it was directly linked with sterling, it is worth-while now to look back at the situation.  Quoting from Reade &amp; Company, a financial organisation which produced a paper on Ireland in a European monetary union, they said: &ldquo;At the foundation of the State there was a need to establish confidence in the currency of the new Government. Guaranteeing a one for one link with the strongest currency in the world was seen as the best way of achieving this.  Since confidence has been established by now and since sterling is no longer a strong currency, that particular argument has lost some of its relevancy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are now looking at is a similar situation and the sterling, over the past seven years particularly, has gone through some rather trying times.  It is literally impossible now for our manufacturing industry and our exporters to plan and programme their policies because very wide fluctuations can very suddenly appear and distort <Col N="778" /> their whole costs system, their manufacturing costs and their raw material costs, and can have some very adverse effects.</P>
    <P>It is opportune that the European Monetary System should, therefore, be debated at this time in the light of those experiences, particularly the experiences during the previous Government's term in office.  Our exports and our efforts to generate economic development were badly affected by the drastic devaluation in our currency and, while it gave our exporters a possible advantage, the fact is that imports rose steeply due to the fall in the value of sterling.  We are now looking at the possibility of linking up with the other European currencies.  We must approach this in an aggressive and positive way.  It will certainly bring about a need for greater efficiency. Maybe that is no harm.  Maybe that is the challenge necessary and, if the challenge is taken up, the advantages can be very great.</P>
    <P>The restraints such a link will bring about in the fluctuation of currency can certainly be advantageous.  Looking at the example of the workings of &ldquo;Snake&rdquo;, while it was not a perfect system, it certainly helped those partaking in that currency arrangement during those traumatic years of very high inflation.  I think it was in 1974 that Britain, France and Italy left &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; because the disciplines of their economy and the restrictions it was putting on their finances were too great and so they could not remain within the system.  The devaluation of the currency during that period certainly had its adverse effects and naturally, when Britain left and sterling was taken out, that had adverse effects for us.</P>
    <P>Now the trend is for our exports to move considerably away from our literally total dependence on the British market and that is opening up new horizons for us.  In that situation the opportunity of linking with European currencies will open up new lucrative avenues of expansion if we can bring about a realistic cost situation at home. One of the major advantages since joining the EEC has been to farming and spin off industries.  Yet there are anomalies and those anomalies have created some problems for our added <Col N="779" /> value processing industries, particularly the MCAs.  The continuing situation regarding the green £, while to the advantage to the farming community, has very often had adverse spin off effects from the point of view of creating maximum employment in the food processing industry.  One would hope that, when all the other major considerations have been evaluated by the Government and the decision is in favour of joining, there would be a much more realistic and a much greater opportunity for expansion.</P>
    <P>In referring to agriculture it is, I think, worth commenting on the recent symposium of the Irish Council of the European movement.  An executive of the Irish Farmers' Association addressing that gathering said that, since Irish farmers were less productive than their EEC counterparts, a European Monetary Union would expose Irish agriculture to intense competition.  If we are less productive, this is the opportune time to become more productive.  This is one of the major challenges when looking in detail at the implications of joining this monetary union.</P>
    <P>Between 1973 and 1977 one sees that sterling depreciated by 17.2 per cent against the franc, by 36 per cent against the German mark and by 17.4 per cent against the dollar.  That highlights the very unstable situation developing during that period.  If we are to develop our exports we must endeavour to get a co-ordinated and positive approach to our costs.  The Government very successfully negotiated the national wage agreement and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is, no doubt, discussing with the social partners the need for another co-ordinated approach to wage increases.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to highlight, as Deputy Barry Desmond has done, certain sectors where there was ground to be made up over a period.  Some sectors may have moved along at the same pace as others.  The forthcoming challenge will create problems for industry in the short term.  It is quite unfair to criticise the Minister for Finance for going to Bonn. Following the visit by the British Prime Minister, this is the ideal time to get exact up-to-date information.  It does not <Col N="780" /> make sense to criticise that.</P>
    <P>It is impossible at this stage to make a hard and fast decision when the British Government are still discussing this matter. If they decide to enter, it will create a more favourable climate for us in considering the question.  If Britain goes in, it would not be possible for us to contemplate staying outside the system.  We, positively, must get into a queueing situation behind the British in making the decision as to whether we should enter or not.  The situation is not unlike that which existed when we were talking about entering the EEC.  Because of our trade with Britain we had to look very seriously at the situation and consider what we would do if they should not enter.  It is obvious that this decision will be affected in different ways by the British decision.</P>
    <P>We must look at situations which may develop and at the options in regard to the financial link.  We must consider the options presented by the basket currency system and the parity grid system. It would appear that the parity grid system would probably be more favourable from our point of view. Looking at the method of operating and the stabilising of currency and the percentage which prevailed in the &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; situation, it is obviously desirable that one's currency would be controllable and that costs and potential exports would not be affected in the way we have experienced during the past four or five years.  It is also worth while to reflect on the position of the Central Bank during the period of inflation and the devaluing of the Irish £ along with sterling and the lack of control we had in those circumstances.  Hopefully that situation would not repeat itself.  If entry to the European Monetary Union would bring stability, then it is most desirable.</P>
    <P>One must look at the band of investment in the country and the countries involved in this investment, particularly the US, Japan and Germany, as well as Britain.  This opens up the whole question of currency linking, and in the medium to long term it is to our advantage to be part of the system.  The trend in investment during the past three or four years has broadened greatly and when other currencies are coming in by <Col N="781" /> way of investment we must align ourselves as closely as possible.  Much of our export potential will be going to the countries of origin and therefore the stabilising of sterling against those currencies is desirable.  The potential for industrial investment which can arise from closer co-operation with the mainland European countries appears to be really strong due to the advantageous climate which we in Government have created since returning to office.  There would definitely be a greater potential for attracting further investment, mainly from Germany and, hopefully, also from France.  They have tended from time to time over the past number of years to look towards Eastern Europe.  Becoming more closely aligned with the other EEC members in the currency link would certainly bring about a better situation in that area.</P>
    <P>The break with sterling, which has been talked about so much in recent times, needs very careful consideration.  I cannot quite grasp the reason for a lot of the comments from Opposition members on the situation.  I cannot understand this sudden urge to discuss this matter in detail.  Brendan Halligan, one of the prominent members of the Labour Party, during their period in office certainly brought this to the forefront but it was normally associated with emotion rather than with hard figures.  I cannot contemplate a situation where a break with sterling would be a real option unless there were a lot more figures to back up the idea.  We are still dependent on the British market for about 50 per cent of our exports and, with the strengthening of sterling, London has again become on the of the major financial centres in the world.  That is to our advantage and a link with sterling in a new European monetary system could have great benefits for us and strengthen the Irish £ which was set up in 1927 because we wanted it linked with the strongest currency available at that time.  Now we have an opportunity of linking with some of the world's strongest currencies, particularly the German mark.  This will be a great challenge.  If we accept this challenge and if the detail of the central fund and the initial assistance is <Col N="782" /> forthcoming, there is tremendous potential for us.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have been very forthright in giving us a broad picture of the present situation.  Reading the text of the Taoiseach's and the Minister's addresses it is very hard to find where the grounds are for the comments made by the Opposition. The Taoiseach outlined the situation broadly.  The Minister gave more detail and figures.  How one could draw the conclusion that there is a difference of opinion between the Taoiseach and the Minister is beyond me.  With our small open economy, staying out of the EMS would certainly leave us isolated as would have been the situation had we not joined the EEC.  It is opportune that the monetary union discussions are taking place a number of years after our joining the EEC when we have developed and diverted much of our trade to our other members.  Now is the right time to have the opportunity of joining the monetary union.  It is indeed a positive and programmed policy of a more integrated Europe.  There certainly have been comments about the possibility of being drawn into the centre where a lot of the activity is.  There have been comments about the reasons why the German Government have suddenly decided to press ahead with these discussions. They appear to be the forerunners in the discussions but if one goes back to the Werner Report of 1960 one would see that this is where the idea was first mooted so there is nothing new about a European monetary union.</P>
    <P>It has been on the table for quite some time.  With the stabilising of sterling our other European partners see it as an opportunity of bringing about co-ordination and getting away from these major fluctuations which we have had to contend with in the past, particularly during the Coalition's period in office. Work has been going on behind the scenes on the part of the financial planners within the Cabinet, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the Minister for Finance.  We are now getting an opportunity to voice our general comments.  A lot of work remains to be done but the informed discussion that we are having on the matter <Col N="783" /> now will make the decision that much easier when the full options become available to us.  The time scale is extremely tight and that is probably to our advantage in that decisions have to be considered in great detail and it is not something which can be allowed to drag on because of the spin-off problems the uncertainty would create.  The possibility of getting closer to the European mainland in this way, with vast markets becoming available to us, will certainly be to our advantage.  The fact that we will be part of this strong financial bloc will also mean that we will be in a position to exploit to our own advantage the Middle East markets and beyond.  If it brings about a greater co-ordination and a more stable planning situation in finance it can only be to our advantage.</P>
    <P>The one remaining item I would like to refer to is the situation regarding the dollar premium and the possibility of other than sterling finance coming into the Irish investment market.  Our Central Bank would naturally have to have restraints on this particular source of supply of finance funds but that is another area where with proper control over a period we could engage in greater investment and, looking at the percentages that have prevailed, from 20 per cent up to 90 per cent and now standing at 40 per cent, there is a real possibility of getting in a greater flow of investment funds.</P>
    <P>The British situation, when finally considered hopefully will be on the side of entry to the monetary union.  Their present attitude possibly is not unlike their stance on joining the EEC itself and, when the matter has been fully debated and hopefully they join, it will then open up to our country a wonderful opportunity.  We have to look at it in that light and aggressively formulate policies to take the maximum advantage. The disadvantages have been spelt out and they are real and they have been recognised.  The cost situation, the ability to produce, the reference from the farming community that we are not as productive in this area as in other areas, are questions that have to be faced up to. We must prepare now to go into the eighties.  We have the opportunity.  We <Col N="784" /> can gain a much wider market for our exports.  At this early stage it is desirable no doubt as the Taoiseach said, to modify our demands.  I was surprised that Deputy Desmond referred to the fact that we were not looking for some structural changes within the EEC.</P>
    <P>In his address the Taoiseach highlighted some anomalies, particularly with regard to the regional fund, and he hoped that in the process of negotiating the EMS we could bring about certain changes that would be to our advantage. This is an ideal opportunity and it is high on the Government's priority list.  It is a real opportunity to get more assistance from the regional fund and will help to develop a greater importance for that policy.  The regional fund has been to our advantage to a limited extent, but there is much room for improvement.  In the discussions that will take place we can take advantage of the circumstances and obtain some improvements with regard to the fund.</P>
    <P>I consider that our timing is right.  The fact that we have had a preliminary detailed briefing allows us to consider in greater depth the problems involved and the modifications that will be needed. When the Minister for Finance concludes his further meetings I hope we will have the situation that the British Government will have decided that it is to their advantage to enter the EMS.  In such a situation it would be positively to our advantage to join.</P>
    <P>We have real potential but we must highlight it.  The unions and employers must be made aware of what is involved. They must be made aware of the fact that, while there may be restrictions and a need for restraint, it will be to the overall benefit.  There will be advantages for us and we can continue on the path of creating the employment we have been so successful in doing since we returned to office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no exaggeration to say that this is a very important debate.  The proposals for monetary union have significant and serious implications for a country like ours.  We are a small peripheral maritime region remote from the centre of the European mainland, but nevertheless we are now a <Col N="785" /> member of the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>The proposed monetary union has major economic and social implications for the country.  It is vitally important that public interest and awareness be created about the significance of this latest EEC proposal.  In a debate such as this complex issues are raised and it is difficult for the layman to analyse and give a judgment on the pros and cons of monetary union.  However, because of the serious implications this proposal would have for Ireland, it is important that an effort be made in the debate here to try to relate the proposal to the problems of ordinary people throughout the country.  The proposal for monetary union is a natural and logical milestone on the road towards ultimate European union.  It is the logical extension and the practical application of the basic philosophy enshrined in the Treaty of Rome where a movement was envisaged towards economic, monetary, political and complete European union.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Taoiseach's contribution last Tuesday when he opened the debate and I have had an opportunity to study his fairly detailed speech.  It strikes me that, while European monetary union is a logical evolution of the whole concept of European union, nevertheless for this country there are certain prerequisites and preconditions that will have to be fulfilled before we contemplate taking such a major irrevocable step.  I am glad that the Taoiseach in his speech adverted to what is perhaps the most important aspect and in the brief speech I propose to make I shall concentrate almost exclusively on this aspect of the proposal.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the Bremen Council and the proposal in relation to monetary union and he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bremen Council called for continued consideration of special agricultural problems in the Mediterranean regions and in other less favoured regions.  The reference to &ldquo;other less favoured regions&rdquo; was included at my insistence.  I regard this emphasis as particularly important.  It <Col N="786" /> is intended to cover further Community action to improve the structure of agriculture in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Before contemplating such a major step as that proposed at the Bremen Council we must be realistic.  We must face the facts.  We must examine the practical results that have emanated from our membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>One of the great attractions of EEC membership&mdash;the aspect which appealed most to people and which influenced their overwhelming vote in favour of entry&mdash;was that there would be available to this country, particularly to the under-developed western region, financial and other resources that would enable us to formulate and implement a new dynamic programme of regional development. The Taoiseach also referred to this important aspect of regional development. He said that the matter we are discussing is concerned essentially with two issues. The first is the monetary arrangement which would govern parity changes with reference to creating a zone of monetary stability in Europe; the second, studies of the measures needed to strengthen the economies of the less prosperous member countries of the Community in the context of these arrangements. He also pointed out that he regarded this formulation and implementation of a coherent regional development policy as a vital aspect of this issue.</P>
    <P>If one looks at it in a narrow, economic and perhaps academic sense, monetary union is an exciting prospect with the wide differences in currencies between one country and another and so forth, and the manner in which monetary union would facilitate international trade and economic growth and development.  It is important to bear in mind that for a small country like Ireland where many economic, social and democratic problems exists, un-regulated growth and development of this kind could have very serious consequences. It is discouraging to note that after five years of membership, instead of the disparities between the favoured and less-favoured regions in the EEC being eliminated they have been widened <Col N="787" /> and our growth and development here have not kept pace with those of other countries in the EEC.  Before we can contemplate finally making an irrevocable decision to support the concept of monetary union, among all the issues to be considered the one of paramount importance to this country is to ensure that the EEC recognise and realise the disparities which exist between the richer and poorer nations in the EEC.  Up to now the EEC have failed to recognise the gravity of these disparities. In the protocol to our accession special recognition was given&mdash;although I feel it was mere lip-service&mdash;to the fact that we had special economic and social problems here.  It looked as if the EEC were serious in their concern about Ireland.  Not merely was a decision taken to recognise the serious problems of our more remote regions but the entire island of Ireland was regarded as a special development region in the EEC context. However, in the five years that have passed no serious attempt has been made by the EEC&mdash;and perhaps successive Governments here are partially to blame for this&mdash;to give practical expression to the pledges contained in the protocol of our accession to the EEC in the form of a coherent, comprehensive, realistic regional development policy which would help us to accelerate the development of our less-favoured regions and which also would enable this country to accelerate economic and social development to bring us on to a level with the more favoured countries.</P>
    <P>That is why I am worried about this proposal in relation to European monetary union although the logic of it is perfect from a purely economic point of view.  I endorse what the Taoiseach has said and I hope a serious effort will be made to convince the EEC of the dire need for a formal, comprehensive, realistic regional development policy.  A regional development policy should have two objectives in a European context. From our point of view these two objectives are formulated and implemented policies which will enable this country as a whole to accelerate economic growth and development.  The second objective must be to ensure that the regional disparities <Col N="788" /> which exist in this country can be eliminated.  I recognise, appreciate and welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has adverted to this need for a coherent regional development policy.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this whole debate and the proposals for European monetary union have implications for the Minister sitting opposite within the aegis of his departmental responsibility for economic planning and development.  As well as endeavouring to have the EEC formulate a coherent or comprehensive regional development policy, each individual nation has an onus, in this regard and here I am talking particularly about Ireland.  There is an onus on us also, on the Government of the day and on the powers that be.  Time is running out.  It is a matter of extreme urgency that we think about formulating an acceptable and appropriate regional development policy which would be appropriate to the special problems of this country and which will enable the Government to go to the EEC and say &ldquo;We have now formulated a comprehensive, realistic regional development policy appropriate to our needs&rdquo;, and we can go and look for the necessary financial assistance from the regional fund, the social fund, FEOGA and other agencies which have relevance to that.</P>
    <P>I want to talk on a non-political basis here.  I am talking largely in the light of my personal experience of having being a Government Minister with responsibility over four years for economic development in what by any criteria might be called the least developed region in western Europe.  I recall bringing the former Commissioner, Mr. George Thomson, to the Aran Islands and along the western seaboard a couple of years ago and he saw for himself the stark reality of trying to promote and generate economic development in those regions in a way which would in turn generate employment. I appreciate the problem from my own experience, and I want to talk in this context of our regional development policy of the real problems and the enormous challenge of trying to build up the western regions of our country and putting in the necessary infrastructure, the communications, roads and so forth.  To <Col N="789" /> do this on a proper basis would demand resources which we have not got at our diposal here.  Therefore we rely more and more on the availability of these resources from the relevent EEC area.</P>
    <P>I recall that Father McDyer, a man whom I frequently quote here and commend for the wonderful work he did in that small parish of Glencolumbkille, on many occasions, publicly and privately, expressed the hope that the type of development which he engaged in so successfully in that small parish could be carried out in every other parish.  He, as well as I, looked for the availability of substantial resources from the EEC.  It is all right to have an academic discussion about monetary union, its implications, international finance, international trade and so forth, but we cannot lose sight of the basic problems we are confronted with here.  I believe that the implementation by the EEC and the Irish Government of a comprehensive regional development policy is vitally essential before we contemplate any further major steps such as monetary union.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline as briefly as possible some of the problems which I see.  The EEC have failed up to now to come up with a proper regional development policy.  This is probably due to the fact that successive Governments have failed to recognise the need for such a policy.  I have never accepted the idea of the system under the regional fund whereby an industry established one year is the following year listed among the projects qualifying for regional aid.  I am sure the Minister for Economic Planning and Development will agree with me that this is not the way to approach the problem of regional development.</P>
    <P>As well as the need for special recognition to be given to the problems of the less prosperous member states there will also be other problems, which have been dealt with in the Taoiseach's speech.  There is the question of what we do if Britain does not go in.  The thinking underlined in the Taoiseach's speech and those of other Ministers is the hope that all the EEC nations will agree to monetary union and that, as far as we are concerned, as the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> ... measures to strengthen the economies of the less prosperous member states would be essential if the zone of monetary stability is to succeed.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his sentence has referred to the basic problem as far as we are concerned.  Special measures will have to be instituted to ensure the progress of the less favoured regions of the EEC.</P>
    <P>The pros and cons of the proposals for monetary union have been very thoroughly analysed by various speakers who are far more competent to do so than I am.  Most of my remarks are related to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  I hope he will give us some idea how he sees the second issue arising from the Bremen Conference being applied in practice. This, as outlined in the Taoiseach's speech is:</P>
    <P>... studies of the measures needed to strengthen the economies of the less prosperous member countries of the Community in the context of these arrangements.</P>
    <P>I feel it is vital that the Minister tell us how he sees this being applied in a European context and also in relation to Ireland.  What study is being undertaken in this respect?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said that some officials from the EEC have been over here studying some of the problems.  He referred, in particular, to the drainage of the west of Ireland.  I fully agree with the drainage of the west of Ireland and I am glad that the EEC have made financial assistance available for this.  The problems of the west of Ireland cannot be solved on a piecemeal basis. While the drainage of the west is a basic structural problem providing funds for this is not the full answer.  I have been preaching this both in Government and outside Government.  Regional development is not industrial development nor agricultural development alone.  It is the total of a lot of things.  It relates to the natural resources in the west, tourism, agriculture, fisheries, industrial development, mineral development, fish processing and so forth.  It is essential to have a policy which will ensure the maximum <Col N="791" /> development of the different sectors in a co-ordinated manner.</P>
    <P>I endeavoured to give practical expression to this type of comprehensive co-ordinated regional policy and planning by pushing the idea of the western development board.  I believe the EEC are approaching the question of regional development the wrong way.  There is no co-ordination between the regional fund, the social fund and FEOGA as well as the new dimension for drainage.  I would like to see a comprehensive policy coordinated for the western region, which may be called the western development board or be under some other name.  I do not mind what it is called but I envisage this western development board as using all the available resources.  Each should be developed to the maximum extent but have the necessary overall co-ordination avoiding duplication.  I feel it is vital to get away from the haphazard piecemeal development which we have had.  A massive drainage programme of the west should be undertaken within the context of an overall economic regional development programme to see how that fits in, how the improved land can be developed to get greater production from it and how that production can be processed.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hog the debate.  At this stage of my life I may be over-conscious of the problem.  I may be considered a crank in relation to regional development, but in the light of my four years' experience working in the most remote areas I feel that it is an exciting challenge.  A major part of the Minister's function must relate to regional development.  A national development strategy must be implemented at local level.</P>
    <P>Monetary union is a major issue.  The ideal situation would be for all the countries involved to agree.  If one or two of them decide to opt out, particularly Britain, we will have a serious decision to make.  The issue of monetary union must be approached on a broad national basis in the sense that it transcends party politics.  If this proposal becomes a reality we must endeavour to ensure that it works to our best advantage.</P>

      <P>As Deputy O'Donnell said, this is a matter of great national importance and not one of party politics.  It is, as has been said by many speakers, the most important decision we have had to face for a long time, at least comparable to our decision to join the common market in 1973.</P>
      <P>I am a novice when it comes to discussing economics and exchange rates. However, I do have views to express on the possible impact of the proposal on employment.  For many months I have been saying that the Government's policy for the creation of employment is basically and historically wrong.  By their policies the Government have sought, almost to the exclusion of everything else, to encourage private enterprise in the hope that private enterprise will create more employment. Even at this early stage, many people doubt the wisdom of their policies in relation to job creation.  It has been a fatal mistake to place all their eggs in the private enterprise basket.  The reason it is a fatal mistake is that we are under-productive in comparison with the other member states.  The NESC Report dealing with employment projections shows that in comparison with the Benelux countries and Denmark, two Irish workers produce almost as much as one worker in the Benelux countries.  The comparison is even worse with Germany.  It means that we have twice as many people at work than our output merits by continental standards.  The Government encourage private enterprise to employ more people to become less competitive. As profit is the main motive of private enterprise, what has private enterprise said to the Government?  Not to put it too crudely, they have told the Government to get stuffed.</P>

      <P>His arithmetic has been wrong.  We are under-productive.  As well as the problem of unemployment we have the problem of under-employment. I was shocked to hear the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach telling me this week that the proposed census will not have any questions relating to employment or occupation. The criticism was made that the Coalition Government did not have a census and that is a valid criticism.  It is equally valid to criticise the Government for ignoring the problems of unemployment and under-employment.</P>

Apart from Belgium, we have the highest level of registered unemployed in the EEC. The Government made a tragic mistake by placing all their eggs in the private enterprise basket.  This has allowed the Government to adopt policies which favour the rich and penalise the poor. This leads to another problem, to the deep <i>malaise</i> here compared with the rest of Europe in industrial relations. Perhaps it is not articulated as such but the policies the Government have been pursuing favour the rich and penalise the poor, abolishing wealth tax, taxing children's allowances, abolishing rates even on sumptuous mansions and talking about removing food subsidies.  That <Col N="794" /> has caused an alien feeling in the work force which has resulted in massive <i>malaise</i>.  In the past year over 70 per cent of all disputes were unofficial.  I shall return to that subject later.  I want to concentrate on employment because this is central to the whole debate, in my view, on the EMS.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned the central problem relating to the EMS and the one which has first priority for this country is the employment problem.  Judging by my visit to Germany a few weeks ago it is the central problem there also.  They are alarmed because their unemployment has reached 4 per cent and that allows for a female participation rate about three times the Irish rate and for the fact that they produce twice as much per worker as here.  Yet, our registered unemployment is more than twice the German rate.  While in Germany I was amused to find that the proposals of the present Opposition in Germany to solve their unemployment problem included&mdash;they must have read the Minister's Green Paper; I do not know if he read theirs but I think they read his&mdash;work sharing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the reduced working week, reduced working year and earlier pensions and so on.  When I asked the German party involved about the effect of a shorter working week and year on the availability of people for second jobs&mdash;two jobbing as the Minister has called it&mdash;there was no answer.  What about the availability of people who retired early?  Of course there was no answer.  The fact is that it is no answer and what the Minister has proposed in his Green Paper is no answer.  The only true answer to unemployment is to create productive employment by economic growth used for that purpose, not make-work jobs but real productive employment, wealth producing rather than wealth consuming jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year and again this year we have had unparallelled economic growth, 7 per cent last year and 6½ per cent this year.  It has been wasted rather than used by the State to create wealth producing jobs.  It has been wasted on the wealthy people, presented to them on a plate.  I challenge the Minister to tell the House how many jobs have been created as a result of the abolition of wealth tax, if any.  The Government have squandered the economic growth left by <Col N="796" /> the National Coalition and sustained into this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Stability is being sought to generate economic growth which will generate growth in employment.  Unquestionably unemployment is the central problem which has to be tackled <Col N="798" /> and, therefore, it is central to the European Monetary System.  Because of mistaken policies currently being pursued, which I am asking the Government to change dramatically, we are not ready to enter into this proposed monetary system and take full advantage of it.  I cannot think of a time since 1960 when we were so unprepared to deal with a proposal for a changed monetary system than we are at the moment because of the tragic change in policy on 5 July 1977.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Economic Planning and Development knows all about these things and, when he is replying, I hope he will let us know what in his opinion will be the effects of the European Monetary System on unemployment in Ireland.  What will be its impact on the participation rate, as the economists call it, for the whole work force.  I mentioned unemployment and underemployment. In addition, our participation rate is the lowest in Europe, especially for women. We are vastly underemployed and under productive.  How does the Minister see the European monetary system affecting this?</P>
      <P>I fear that, because of our under-employment, our underproductivity, and our high unemployment we will come off worst under this system.  Our economic growth, which is the highest in the EEC, should be an advantage, but our huge underemployment will be a dramatic disadvantage.  Before we enter any European monetary system we should be aiming at getting our participation rate right and converging with the European rate.  We should be getting our productivity rate right.  Instead of an improvement in that regard, there has been a slight disimprovement.  We have taken a turn for the worst.  This calls for a dramatic change of emphasis by the Government.  Although it is important I have no wish to go into the question of domestic policy on job creation.</P>

I am very much for private enterprise and a mixed economy.  Private enterprise in Ireland cannot produce the goods for the Government because it is already over-manned. Therefore, we must depend on new projects which the IDA are trying and which are not working nearly as fast as we need them.  The only alternative is State commercial enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asked me to make suggestions.  I made them before, and I will take the opportunity in the very near future to do so again.  The figure of £650 million has been mentioned by many people.  It was certainly mentioned by the Minister for Finance and I think also by the Taoiseach.  I know it is not a definite, final figure.  The Germans, the French, the Italians, the Danes or the British are not in the business of giving out money, of giving gifts, of giving money away.  Anything they give has a price tag.  They will give <Col N="800" /> £650 million or whatever is finally agreed, only if it is to their advantage.</P>
      <P>As a country we are often described by economists and others as net beneficiaries of the EEC meaning, presumably, that we get more out of the EEC budget than we put into it.  An ordinary person reading about net beneficiaries would think somebody else must be a net loser, that we cannot all be net beneficiaries because we cannot all take more out of the budget than we put into it.  It would appear that, out of the kindness of their hearts, because they love Ireland and Ireland has a weaker economy and is poorer and so on, some other European countries are subsidising Ireland.  In fact, nothing could be further from the truth.  The non-budgetary benefits, the trade benefits, and so on, to the other EEC countries, especially the continental ones, are much greater than any budgetary benefits we enjoy.  They are all net beneficiaries.  I suppose that is the basic idea of the Common Market. We all combine together for the common good but I believe the others are much greater net beneficiaries in the total sense than we are.</P>
      <P>Similarly, with the European Monetary System they will be seeking their own national advantage and, if they pay us £650 million, it will be the price they are prepared to pay for similar gains from us.  We will not get one penny for nothing.  When talking, therefore, about aid from the Common Market we ought to emphasise this point.  Whatever we get will have a price on it.  We will get nothing for nothing.  That is the truth of the Common Market.  Indeed, it is the truth of human life.  Now I want to know what we will have to pay for this £650 million.</P>
      <P>Referring to the fact that Ireland is a net beneficiary in the EEC, the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>But the essential point is that notwithstanding the regional fund and budget transfers to Ireland under the present system, we appear, on these statistics, which are admittedly out of date, to be diverging economically from rather than converging with the more prosperous areas of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> That is a very important point.  Although we are supposed to be net beneficiaries we have in fact fallen behind.  Why? Because the strong economies of the EEC are doing much better out of it than are weak economies like us.  We are now paying and will continue to pay a huge price in subsidies to the wealthier countries of the EEC rather than the reverse.  I hope the Minister will refer to this whole question of budget transfers, the regional fund and so on, and tell us whether we are in fact net beneficiaries or net losers and, if the latter, why.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the question of monetary stability, in my not too long lifetime there have been arguments for monetary stability and fixed exchange rates.  My understanding is that monetary stability and fixed exchange rates led to the vast economic problems that arose in the UK which led to a number of devaluations. so that eventually, in the interests of stability, fixed exchange rates were abandoned.  Now we are back once more to the idea that we need fixed, or fairly fixed, exchange rates.  This could well be the fashion of the day.  It could well be of not enduring importance.  Who knows but that in five years time, perhaps sooner, perhaps later, the fashion will change and economists will proclaim that fixed exchange rates are too restrictive, too restraining, and are causing havoc in individual economies and nations should return to a floating currency. Currencies should be more flexible. That could well happen and I would like to hear the Minister for Economic Planning and Development give us his views on this.  To me, it is like the hoolahoop.  It comes into fashion every ten or 15 years.  It goes out of fashion again and something else takes its place.</P>
    <P>I was not at all surprised that at the Bremen summit the British were the least enthusiastic about the European Monetary System.  I do not know if they have become more enthusiastic since. There are some indications that they may have but, from their own experience, they have every cause to be worried about fixed exchange rates.  It is a very big issue.  Is it a fashion?  Is it something that will last for a few years? Will we be confronted some years hence <Col N="802" /> with the advice that there should be more flexibility and the £ should float?  If that should be the eventuality than the risks which seem inherent in this whole proposal are to me questionable.  I look forward to hearing the Minister on that aspect.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear on the radio yesterday an eminent economist say, talking about the breaking of the link with sterling, that had that happened four years ago the £ would have appreciated in value.  It was fashionable on the part of young economists then to talk about breaking away from sterling. Had that happened our £ would have appreciated in value.  If the same thing happened today our £ would not appreciate in value.  It would depreciate against the £ sterling and we would be less well off.  That means that the British economy, helped undoubtedly by North Sea oil, has overtaken ours.  They have put their house in better order.  This comes back then to the question of policy on employment and policy on wages and salaries.  The British Government have been very courageous in their policy on wages.  They fought for and got their 10 per cent last year and they are fighting now for 5 per cent this year. This Government wanted 5 per cent.  It got 8 per cent.  That is as high as 16 per cent in private industry.  There is no wages policy.  There is a massive wage drift due mainly to the Government's own spending policy.  Borrow £820 million and spend, spend, spend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opinion, the Irish £ would depreciate against the British £ if the link were broken now.  He said that two or three years ago the Irish £ would have appreciated.  He was asked why this was so.  In his view, North Sea oil accounted in part of this but it was also due to the success the British Government have had in their wages policy.  The British worker has become more competitive. I am saying that not only have the British Government done well in their wages policy but the Irish Government by their spendthrift policy and free-for-all manifesto created the environment in which people want more and think that more is there.  They got 8 per cent in theory under the national wage agreement, but the Minister will know that in some cases increases have been as much as 16 per cent, which means a wage drift of about 8 per cent and that means less competitiveness.  The Government's wages policy is wrong. Their job creation policy is wrong.  It is designed to make the productive part of our economy less competitive because the Government are trying to persuade employers to employ more people when, by European standards, they should be employing fewer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed by the Taoiseach's speech at UCD the other day.  I am also amazed by the recent speech made by <Col N="805" /> the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in which he expressed surprise at the number of redundancies.  I and several other Deputies told him it was obvious there would be more redundancies since Irish industry is over-manned. Yet the Minister, who knows everything about economics, did not know there would be so many redundancies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be more redundancies, especially in the context of a European Monetary System because we will have to compete within exchange rates.  We have the additional burden of being an off-shore island with transport costs and difficulties in getting to the European mainland.</P>
      <P>The Government's job creation policies are wrong; their lack of wages policy is wrong.  They are leading us into an increasingly uncompetitive situation and they are causing unemployment to be perpetuated at a very high level. Because of this free-for-all, spending environment created, many workers have been making unreasonable demands over and above the national wage agreement and when these demands have not been met there have been unofficial disputes. The level of unofficial disputes&mdash;71 per cent of all disputes this year are unofficial&mdash;is in major part a result of the spend, spend, spend environment created by the Government's manifesto.  The <i>malaise</i> in industrial relations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now making a budget speech and is not staying on the motion.  I have given every latitude, and there is a lot of latitude on the motion, but we cannot go fully into domestic economic matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean to transgress.  This <i>malaise</i> in industrial relations, as a result of the lack of wages policy and of bad job creation policy, has added to our lack of competitiveness and that is what this debate is about.  We are becoming less and less competitive <Col N="806" /> and the finger must be pointed directly at the completely misguided and misdirected policies of the Government, who have so ill-prepared us for the massive challenge now confronting us.</P>
      <P>On the subject of competitiveness the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>These changes affect in the most fundamental way the competitiveness with which we can sell, our rates of inflation&mdash;and ultimately the levels of economic growth and employment we can attain.</P>
      <P>The basic idea behind the proposed EMS is greatly to reduce such fluctuations by building up the monetary influence of the Community to be more commensurate with its collective economic weight.  Stability of exchange rates between all the currencies of member states would itself contribute to this.</P>
      <P>The fluctuations referred to by the Taoiseach were those effecting rates of inflation, levels of economic growth and employment.  That is what the EMS is about.  The Taoiseach said so and I agree with him.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
      <P>The Community cannot flourish if trade does not flourish and individual member states are affected in the same way to a greater or lesser extent. We, with imports and exports equivalent to more than 90 per cent of Gross National Product, are particularly vulnerable.  Other things being equal, the greater the expansion in international trade, the greater the benefit to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already spoken about the bad effect of Government policy on job creation, industrial relations and competitiveness. Now I want to refer to the effect of the Government's policy on imports. They have misspent the economic growth created by the National Coalition Government and are continuing this year with misguided policies.  They completely wasted the growth.  Where has it been spent?  It has been spent in Japan, in Germany, on a consumer boom, an import boom causing us further <Col N="807" /> problems and facing us with a possible balance of payments' problem.  But money generated by the economic growth left by the National Coalition Government has been, because of Government policy, spent on imports.  When the Taoiseach spoke about the growth of international trade I am sure, even though he did not spell it out, that he meant a two-way growth in international trade. The fact is our exports have been growing at a much lesser rate than our imports and that is directly attributable again to Government policy.  I want to measure my words and I do not wish to exaggerate but never before in the history of this country has a Government's economic policies been so out of place, so wrong at the time.  That is the whole basis of my contribution to this debate today.  I plead with the Government to change the policies, forget about the manifesto if need be, get the right policies, abandon the outrageous foolishness of the manifesto and go back to the more responsible and statesman-like approach of the National Coalition programme.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House much longer.  I just want to recall that this whole question, this whole debate and the next and future debates are to do with unemployment and employment.  It is the central, most pressing economic problem facing us as a country and the EEC as a Community.  Economic growth is being sought not just for the sake of economic growth but to provide the extra worthwhile jobs that are so badly needed here and elsewhere.  That is what economic growth is about.  Every other aspect of the EEC economy proposals either monetary or economic are to do with generating growth controlling inflation and achieving monetary stability so that the climate will be better for employment prospects.  Inflation, industrial relations, trade, imports and exports, competitiveness, are all connected with this question.  Under every single one of those headings the Government's policies have not only been wrong but monstrously so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When this debate was announced, like many other people particularly <Col N="808" /> Members of this House, I was glad that the Taoiseach said that it would be a preliminary debate, that further information would be available and when that was available another debate would take place.  I got the impression, as so many other people did, that this was something which had not gone very far and we were going to be in on the ground floor of the debate, that ideas would be tossed around in this House and before an official decision was taken we would be able to get far more information about what exactly was going to happen.  In fact when the Taoiseach spoke two days ago in this House he said:</P>
      <P>The purpose of this debate is to discuss the conclusions and to afford the House an opportunity of considering and expressing views on the proposals put forward there for a European Monetary System.</P>
      <P>He was talking about Bremen.  He said:</P>
      <P>A fair amount of work has been done on these proposals but this work is as yet incomplete.  It is, therefore, not possible to come to firm decisions.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach went on to say that he would discuss them in general terms and the Ministers mainly responsible would have more information and be able to give the House a better idea of what was happening and he hoped that the contributions made by Deputies would be helpful.  I hope mine will be helpful.  I was amazed to find that almost immediately afterwards the Minister for Finance came in and in concluding his speech said:</P>
      <P>Many of the details of the system have not yet been settled.  So far the discussion have been mainly carried out in expert Committees&mdash;the Committee of Central Bank Governors and the Monetary Committee&mdash;and there has been little real negotiation at political level.</P>
      <P>Then he makes the astonishing statement:</P>
      <P>But from the few meetings of Finance Ministers that have been held I have carried away the firm impression that the system will be brought into operation next year.</P>
      <P>The Minister goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> A further meeting of the Finance Council is to be held on 20 November and it will then report to the European Council.  The European Council has undertaken to take decisions and to make commitments on the system at its meeting in Brussels on 4/5 December.</P>
    <P>It is rather a pity that somebody did not tell the Taoiseach this because apparently he was under the impression that things were entirely different.  He was under the impression that before any final decision was taken that this House would get an opportunity of discussing the matter very fully.  But it appears from what he said that the work is incomplete and that it is not possible to come to firm decisions.  The Minister does not agree and feels that decisions will be taken.  In fact some decisions have been taken.</P>
    <P>So far in the House&mdash;and I have gone to a good deal of trouble to listen to and read up what has been said from the Government side&mdash;there has apparently been no effort made by any Government spokesman to try to answer the number of very relevant questions which were put from this side of the House earlier on.  Of course we do not expect the Government to have a crystal ball.  We do not expect the Government to know exactly what is going to happen.  For instance, we do not expect the Government to be able to say with any degree of certainty whether or not Britain is going to join the EMS but the very least we could expect is that somebody would be able to venture an opinion on whether they would or not and if Britain goes in, how certain things will turn out and, if Britain does not go in, what the likely result will be.  Apparently it has not been considered necessary to do this.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the famous majority of 20 has anything to do with this.  To be fair to the Ministers I have only heard one Minister crowing about this but some of the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil, particularly down the country at county council meetings have a habit of saying &ldquo;It does not matter what you think about it.  This is what Fianna Fáil are going to do&rdquo;.  At the back of their minds is the idea that it <Col N="810" /> does not really matter what is said in this House or it does not really matter what we know because apart from what the experts have to say outside unless Government Ministers and the Government in general comes clean about it we will not know what actually is happening until it has happened.</P>
    <P>Therefore I am surprised and disappointed that the Government have not made a greater effort to bring us into their confidence and to let us know what exactly will be the result if a decision is taken and particularly what will be the result of Britain coming in or staying out.  There was also the question of this famous £650 million.  I am amazed to find that nobody seems to be able to say where this figure came from.  Perhaps the Minister or whoever is replying to the debate might let us know where exactly that figure came from.  Did they snap their fingers in the air and decide on that figure?  If they did not do that, will the Minister tell us how they arrived at the figure?  I am sorry to have to ask the Minister for Economic Planning and Development for an answer to that question. He is an economist and is good at his job but he has been known to make some terrible predictions.  It will be very little use to us in a year's time if he should come along to this House and tell us that he is sorry that things are not going to turn out as he expected and that he does not know the reason.</P>
    <P>I do not expect anybody to have a crystal ball.  I do not expect the Government to be able to state the position exactly but I expect them to be able to say why they have chosen a certain figure.  I expect them to tell us how that figure was arrived at and to explain why they consider it is adequate.  I do not expect the Government to act as though they were in a trade union bargaining situation, where they ask for a certain amount but will accept less.  From my own experience years ago I discovered that to let that information be known to the other people engaged in negotiations meant that one would get a lesser amount.</P>
    <P>I do not know nearly as much about the matter as the Government but I think the amount mentioned is entirely inadequate. <Col N="811" /> However, I could be convinced if the Government speakers could let us know with some degree of certainty how the figure was reached.  I should like them to tell us what will be the general result if that amount is given.  I should also like to know what are the hopes of getting the amount mentioned or any amount.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that so far there is no mechanism by which this can be arranged.  It just cannot be done. There has been a considerable amount of generalisation.  If a person wants to sell something he shows the best side of the bargain to the potential buyer.  I know that the Germans, the main backers of the EMS with the French, would like to give the impression that everything can be done but that we should leave plenty of loose ends so that different interpretations can be given later.  We cannot afford to make a mistake on this matter.  We must know exactly what will happen.  The Taoiseach said &ldquo;This work is yet incomplete.  It is not possible to come to firm decisions&rdquo; and the Minister for Finance told us that there has been little real negotiations at political level.  How can the Government come to this House with the suggestion of what is the right thing to do when it is quite obvious that they do not know whether or not it is right that we should enter the EMS?</P>
    <P>I know it is easy to wave away comments like this and to say that we will have another debate, but if my guess is correct whatever arrangements are being made will be neatly tied up in a package and we will not be able to get out of them by the time the second debate takes place.  If that is so, it is increasingly obvious that we must get the information that all of us have been asking for in this House.</P>
    <P>We know that, if Britain does not enter, the effect on industry here could be catastrophic.  I was very impressed with some of the work carried out on behalf of the farmers by the chief economist of the IFA, Mr. Lorcan Blake.  I was impressed by the arguments set out in the paper he presented at the seminar in Dublin on 13 October on the EMS and the sterling link.  He has <Col N="812" /> scotched the idea that it would spell ruin for the farmers if the British did not enter the EMS.  He pointed out the fact, of which so many people do not seem to be aware, that the compensatory arrangements already in operation would mean that it would not matter so much.  I cannot understand why we have not received similar information or comments from the industrial side.</P>
    <P>I am only a layman in this matter but I have had a certain amount of experience in this House and I cannot understand why it does not seem possible to estimate what will be the effects on industry. It is my personal opinion that, if we enter the EMS and Britain does not, the effects will be very bad.  I realise there are a lot of political kudos in the old thing of &ldquo;having a bash at the old enemy&rdquo;, of saying that at last we are breaking the link with sterling.  I am quite sure Fianna Fáil would be able to get a considerable number of people returning to them from the more extreme organisations simply because they felt that something was being done, but that is of little use to the man or woman who will lose their job as a result of an illconsidered decision that is taken because nobody has gone to the trouble of finding out what exactly will happen.</P>
    <P>I said earlier I do not expect the Government to have a crystal ball that will tell them everything that will happen in the future about this matter, but I think that the alternatives, if Britain enters or does not enter, should be easily ascertainable. For that reason I think that before this debate took place a document should have been produced that put down in black and white what would be the effects.  The Government have a majority of more than 20 in this House but responsibility rests with the House for giving an opinion on what is proposed.  Responsibility also rests on the House to advise the Government as to whether what they are doing is right or wrong.  I do not want to be taken by anybody as saying that the Labour Party are opposed to the idea of entry. That would not be correct, but we are entitled to the relevant information.  I am demanding, as did other Members of my party and Members of Fine Gael, that we be given sufficient information to <Col N="813" /> make up our minds.  If the Government do not know&mdash;and it is my opinion that they do not know because they have not enough information&mdash;I think it was wrong for them to go as far as they have gone without getting that information.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to be critical.  Members of the Government are past experts at criticising in this House, whether it is justified or not.  All of us do it but party politics should not be played on this issue. I am not saying here that we are opposed to the EMS just because the Government are in favour of it.  However, my party consider that if a mistake is made now that mistake can have terrible effects on this country in years to come. Therefore, it is only right and just that we should be told much more than we have been told.  The only reason I can see for not telling us is that the Government do not know.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which I do not want to go into too deeply.  What will happen if Britain stays out and as a result Northern Ireland stays out?  Does it not immediately create a further barrier and not, as a foolish Fianna Fáil back-bencher said, strengthen the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Border?  It would leave another very strong barrier whereby the people in the North could claim that this was proof they were English and we were Irish.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Mitchell, referred to the punt as opposed to the £.  That is a handy way of differentiating between the two, but the British £ is recognised here as it is in London.  We are talking about the £ and the effect of the change which may occur if Britain stays out of the EMS and we go into it.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to make it clear that we are not opposed to the idea of a scheme for monetary stability in Europe.  All of us from time to time have felt that some type of monetary stability would be grand to have.  It would be nice if we knew that next week, next year and so on our money was going to be the same in relation to that of other countries.  A ridiculous situation has been allowed to continue whereby people, particularly those who have worked hard all their lives and are reaching retiring age, may feel that they have enough to keep them <Col N="814" /> in comfort and then find that that is not so.  What they have is not worth as much as they thought it would be and instead of living in comfort they are living in penury.  We would not be opposed to the idea of a scheme for monetary stability in Europe if the scheme is conceived in such a way that it will facilitate the medium and long-term growth of European economies.</P>
    <P>We would not in principle be opposed to the scheme if, unlike Community arrangements so far, it was backed by transfers of capital resources designed to make a major impact on our unemployment problem and if there is sufficient flexibility within the new scheme to protect national economic and social objectives. This House and the Government know that, far from the bonanza which we were supposed to be getting by way of social assistance when we joined the EEC, we seem to be getting even less than we were.  There is no use in anybody, particularly members of the Government who have the responsibility, trying to say &ldquo;It is all right, within the EEC we are partners, we are the same as the other eight and they will see us right&rdquo;.  They will not do any such thing.  As with every other bloc, when the opportunity arises it is dog eat dog and the little dog is the fellow who gets eaten up because the big dogs will take their share of him.  It is evident that, despite efforts of successive Ministers in Government to try to get our share, the EEC big guns have taken every opportunity to try to get more than their share and to do things which they would resent if done by a small country like Ireland.</P>
    <P>Do not let anyone try to cod us that we have not an unemployment problem. Even the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is now aware that we have, after a year of Fianna Fáil rule. We cannot just get all the unemployed to emigrate.  If that was done it might achieve what the Taoiseach wants, the elimination of the dole queues.  Maybe that is what Fianna Fáil have in mind.  If they have not, then they must ensure that the money which will come to this country will be a lot more than they are looking for.</P>
    <P>The Government must put down in <Col N="815" /> black and white how they propose to spend the £650 million, what exactly they intend to use it for and how they assess £650 million as being the correct amount.  Is it just a figure taken out of the air?  Perhaps somebody said that £650 million is a lot of money, nearly as much as the £850 million which they had to borrow this year.  The £850 million has been of very little use to the Government this year and the £650 million is entirely inadequate.  I am not an expert; I am using my own experience as a politician to estimate what the amount should be.  Not alone will it not solve the unemployment problem but we could have a far worse unemployment problem.  If the people cannot get employment and if the social welfare amounts which they get are not going to be kept in line, we are going to end up perhaps with real hunger in the country.</P>
    <P>The decision to go into the EEC was backed by a massive vote here.  In my opinion, it was taken far too quickly. The questions of what we should get before we went in and what the opposition was were badly handled.  How would the people of the country vote now if they got a similar opportunity? The Government at the time said that we had to do this, that Britain were going in and if we did not go in we would be in a bad position and so forth.  Those were the arguments used.</P>
    <P>It now appears that Britain may not go into the EMS.  That does not seem to have the influence on the Government's decision that it could have.  I have not any greater love for Britain than has any member of Fianna Fáil.  I know what the British stand for and that from time to time they are doing well or doing badly, but they are our customer and they have taken about 46 per cent of the produce of Ireland.  As long as that is the case we must take cognisance of what they do.  It is nonsense for somebody to try to wave a tricolour and claim to be doing the patriotic thing, saying that we do not care what Britain does and we are not tied to the £ sterling.  We may get a few cheers from people who say &ldquo;This is wonderful; at last we are going to get away from them and our punt and their £ will be entirely different&rdquo;.  That will be <Col N="816" /> of very little use when the unemployment problem will grow.  We could find ourselves in the position of being unable to compete at all, particularly if our punt were to go up, while we import produce from Britain.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am aware that you are trying to be fair and I do not want to take advantage of you, but I point out that even at present imports of British goods which can be produced here constitute a national scandal.  I do not blame the Government entirely for this.  I blame the people who import these goods.  In a sizeable country town I went to five drapers' shops before I could buy an Irish-made shirt.  That is a shame in a country where so many in that industry are unemployed. The same applies to shoes.</P>

      <P>I succeeded in getting it in though, by doing that.  If we go in without Britain imports are bound to increase.  There are still people who will buy foreign goods and particularly British goods, and will continue to buy simply because the goods are a little cheaper, even though members of their families may find themselves out of jobs as a result.  We are not giving the attention to this matter which should be given to it.  I feel the Government rushed in to the House to have a debate on this matter without putting anything very important or very definite before the House.  I am long enough in politics to know that there are times when it is opportune to have debates on certain things and it is not every day that one gets the election of a Pope coming up in a week in which something which is likely to get a fair bit of contentious publicity is to be debated.  I will not blame the Government for using the opportunity to try to get it crowded off the pages and to have nobody except those who take the <Col N="817" /> trouble to come into this House know anything about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this is a very definite part of my speech because I believe it is true that the Government did not have the details which I would expect them to have before bringing this into the House. I remember commenting to one of my colleagues many years ago, when the Minister for Health, who has just entered the House, was Minister for Finance that, whether I agreed or disagreed with him, if he was asked for facts on a question of finance&mdash;at that time I had the honour to be spokesman for my party on finance&mdash;he had the answer at the tip of his fingers.  I suggest he would not bring before the House the type of thing we are debating because, being an expert on it, he would feel that his job was to be able to answer all the questions.  So far, we have got no answers.  I do not know what the reply will be like but I imagine we will have more muffling of the problem, a lot of reference to the fact that it is the first of two debates and when the second debate comes along it will give a lot more information than we have now.  The decisions will be taken by that time and then there will be nothing that the House or even the Government, if the error of their ways is pointed out to them, can do about having the matter rectified.</P>
      <P>This can be a matter of major importance or one of very little importance.  If the Government are serious about having a discussion on it and giving an opportunity to Members of the House to debate it I believe the onus is on them to produce in detail what is likely to happen. I referred earlier to the extraordinary difference between what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance had to say.  The Taoiseach is very definite when he says:</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, not possible to come to firm decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said that while a fair amount of work had been done the work had not yet been completed.  I would not quarrel <Col N="818" /> with that.  He also said, which is the really important thing:</P>
    <P>I will discuss them in general terms and the Ministers mainly responsible will go into more detail, particularly on progress so far.</P>
    <P>What way did the Minister for Finance go into detail?  After waffling for quite a bit he eventually came out with a gem:</P>
    <P>... there has been little real negotiation at political level.  But from the few meetings of Finance Ministers that have been held I have carried away the firm impression that the system will be brought into operation next year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance had been attending the meetings.  It is rather a pity he did not give this information to the Taoiseach because he could then have said that whether we like it or not, no matter what discussions have taken place, the decision is that it will be put into operation next year and we will have very little say in it.  It is too bad if my interpretation is the correct one.  I cannot give any other interpretation to it because of what the Minister then said:</P>
    <P>A further meeting of the Finance Council is to be held on 20 November and it will then report to the European Council.  The European Council will undertake to take decisions and make commitments on the system at their meeting in Brussels on 4-5 December.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his speech and the Minister for Finance earlier in his speech admitted that neither of them know exactly what is happening but the Minister now says that decisions will be taken pretty quickly and that it will come into operation next year.</P>
    <P>I got the impression from the Taoiseach that he felt that this was something which would be discussed over several months.  The Minister for Finance was pretty definite.  If he is correct in his assumption that the discussions will take place on 4 and 5 December and decisions will be taken by the European Council and commitments on the system made, then I feel that he is correct in saying that it will come into operation next year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> When I listened to what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance had to say and I went through all the documentation I felt that this was perhaps the old Fianna Fáil arrogance of: &ldquo;we are doing it, it does not matter to anybody else but we have made our decision.&rdquo;  I went through the details given and it has now become clearer to me that they are saying: &ldquo;We do not know what will happen or how it will happen, but it will happen.&rdquo;  That is pathetic coming from the Government.</P>
    <P>They are saying the very same thing with regard to the £650 million.  If they came into the House and, as they are so good at doing, produced a shopping basket and said: &ldquo;This is how we are going to spend it, this is what we require the money for, and this is how we estimate the amount&rdquo;, then we would all have to say they are at least doing their job.  This is not what has happened. They are simply saying to us that is what they think we may get.  We are not in government and we cannot be sure of the figures but at least we are satisfied that the £650 million compensation they are talking about appears to be entirely inadequate.</P>

      <P>In my reply to a question by the Deputy on 6 April 1978 (Official Report Volume 305, columns 242 and 243) I outlined the various levels at which acute general hospital services would be provided as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the first level, community specialities such as general medicine, <Col N="820" /> general surgery, obstetrics, gynaecology and paediatrics will be provided in general hospitals to cater for the immediate catchment area of the hospital.</P>
    <P>On the second level, regional specialties such as orthopaedics, ENT ophthalmology and urology will be provided in a number of larger hospitals.</P>
    <P>On the third level, services of a highly specialised nature will be provided in a very limited number of centres, mainly in Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>The services to be provided in each general hospital, including county hospitals will be determined in consultation with the local health board taking into account the over-all organisation of general hospital services in each health board area and having regard to the requirements of the catchment population of each hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of services in county hospitals is primarily a matter for the health board in each case, having regard to the general structure of the service in the area.  Each area has to be considered on the elements involved in its own situation.  If I may come back to Roscommon hospital, I want to assert that the federation arrangements were worked out between the health board and Portiuncula under the chairmanship of an officer of my Department.  As far as those participating in the talks were concerned, the arrangements were satisfactory and had the approval of Comhairle na nOspidéal.  Excellent medical opinion was of the view that the level of service to be provided in Roscommon was completely adequate for the purpose and represented a good solution to the problem.  For some reason best known to themselves, the Western Health Board decided not to adopt those proposals. The Deputy need not continue to flog this issue any further at this stage because Comhairle na nOspidéal are meeting the Western Health Board to discuss the situation further.  At that meeting a solution may emerge.  If a solution does not emerge, I have indicated that I am prepared to meet the Western Health Board after that meeting to discuss the situation further.  If the <Col N="822" /> Deputy were being responsible he would be prepared to accept the situation as it stands and let us see if some rational and sensible solution can be worked out.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the further progress that has been made since his Department arranged the seminar on mental handicap last January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main points emerging from the discussion during the seminar was the need to establish in many areas a service to counsel and support the parents of young mentally handicapped children living at home.  Following the seminar I set aside some of the financial resources of my Department for that purpose and requested the health boards to let me have proposals for suitable schemes following consultation with local mental handicap interests. I have conveyed approval to proposals submitted by four health boards and I expect to receive proposals from the remaining boards shortly: these will receive immediate attention in my Department.</P>
      <P>The other main topic touched on during the seminar was the shortage of residential places for the adult mentally handicapped.  I have already made considerable provision for such places in this year's capital programme&mdash;750 residential and 250 day places&mdash;and I am considering at present what further projects can be provided for in the 1979 programme.</P>
      <P>During the seminar views were expressed on a number of other facets of the mental handicap services&mdash;for example, the development of group homes and hostels and the relationship between the statutory and voluntary agencies.  These are being borne in mind in the planning of the services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the invaluable nature of the seminars in question and the constant prospect of review of the programme, would the Minister consider arranging a further seminar next year at which the progress now being made could be reviewed?  Many <Col N="823" /> health board members have assured me that it provides them with a valuable opportunity of conveying their views to the Department and to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of initiatives in relation to the mental handicap services have been taken as part of a comprehensive programme for the mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>In the community sphere a counselling service for the parents of young mentally handicapped children living at home has been initiated, the domiciliary care allowance which is paid to mothers caring for their handicapped children at home has been increased from £25 to £35 per month and certain other improvements have been made in the scheme.  In addition, there have been two increases in the Disabled Persons Maintenance Allowance which is paid to needy handicapped persons over 16 residing at home.</P>
      <P>In the provision of residential and day accommodation, schemes are in progress or in planning which, over the next few years, will improve existing facilities and provide some 2,000 extra places for children and adults at an estimated cost of over £23 million.  Since August 1977 some 450 new posts have been approved for the mental handicap services which have considerably improved the range and quality of the services available throughout the country for our mentally handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the planning of future services, I am at present awaiting the report of a special study group representative of my Department and other interests&mdash;that is the report I mentioned to Deputy Desmond&mdash;which will be making recommendations to me regarding the future development of our mental handicap services.  On receipt of this <Col N="824" /> report I will be considering what further initiatives might be taken in the continuing development of the service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, when that report is presented we would have the basis upon which a comprehensive programme might be detailed.  While the improvements outlined are welcomed, the Minister will accept that they are really improvements on the existing service. The setting out of a comprehensive programme would appear to depend on the report that is awaited?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no real line of demarcation.  We are going ahead with anything that appears to be immediately advantageous.  As I said in reply to Deputy Barry Desmond, the home counselling service emerged from the seminar and there was no reason why it should not be embarked upon so we went-ahead with it.  We do not necessarily have to wait for this other report to decide an initiative.  The main thing is the provision of places and that is well under way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the enormous cost of capital and current expenditure on institutional care, particularly for mentally handicapped children, would the Minister undertake a special review of the £25 allowance in the context of next year's budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, this sum of money has not kept pace with inflation in the past five years. With that in mind, perhaps he would be in a position to encourage the parents of mentally handicapped children to devote more care to them in their own homes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important aspect of the matter.  First, let me remind the Deputy that the level was at £25 for many year but we increased it to £35 in April this year.  In addition, we made that £35 available to every child.  We have also instituted the home counselling service.  These are very important aspects of the domiciliary side.  I agree with the Deputy that we must do <Col N="825" /> everything possible within our resources to help those parents to keep their children at home.  I will ensure that that aspect of the matter is prominent in the review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister is aware of the extremely high cost to parents of keeping mentally handicapped children at home.  Whilst the £35 allowance is a help, would the Minister consider the possibility of having medical card cover issued in respect of the children, even in circumstances where the family income in general would not qualify the family for medical services?  Would the Minister consider the idea of having medical card services so that the cost of local GP would be covered in respect of children kept at home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a fair number of these families would have medical cards anyway for one reason or another but it is an idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Is the Minister aware that there is still great difficulty in finding suitable places in institutions for young people who cannot be kept at home and who badly need to be institutionalised? Is he aware of the problem arising when these young people who are being accommodated reach the age of 16 or 17 and are no longer kept in the institutions which cater for young people and a suitable alternative home or institution cannot be found?  The parents go through great stress for perhaps a year under threat of having the child sent home to them when the child is not suitable for living at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I accept that.  The bottleneck is in the provision of residential places for the adults.  It works both ways.  First, the accommodation is not there for the adult mentally handicapped person.  Also, when some in-patients grow from childhood to adulthood they <Col N="826" /> stay on in the institution and occupy a place which should be reserved for a child.  So, the real need is for adult residential accommodation.  That is why in our building programme we are concentrating on those.  When the works began in 1978 are completed we shall have 700 extra places.  At the moment we are planning a capital programme for 1979 and we shall almost certainly be giving priority to adult accommodation.</P>

If the Deputy <Col N="827" /> looks at the figures he would see that the proportion of GNP has been fairly well settled since 1974 at around 6 per cent. This year it will be 6.25 per cent of the Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because of the Green Paper that I asked the subsequent question.  The Green Paper appears to indicate there might be a lessening of the proportion of GNP to be devoted to health.  Prior to the election the Minister's party undertook to fix a proportion of GNP for a foreseeable number of years to be allocated for health to allow for proper planning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many variables.  There is the level of GNP itself and there is the proportion of budgetary expenditure.  All these must be taken into account in deciding on the level but as I said there seems to be some natural order, prevailing over the last few years anyway, which seems to have settled the proportion at around 6 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the pervasive propaganda against increased health expenditure from a number of quarters, including his own party and one Minister in particular, does the Minister feel it incumbent on him perhaps at some future date to spell out in a White Paper or another Green <Col N="828" /> Paper from his Department the true facts?  We thank the Minister for his recent publication of a statistical nature but surely there is need now for him to defend the position particularly against those from Trinity College who would have us emasculate all health expenditure.</P>

      <P>Some decision appears to have been taken on this assumption&mdash;I make that statement&mdash;that the Minister has been asked clearly to find the money otherwise than from central funds through his proposed insurance scheme which will produce funds far in excess of the requirements of the extension of the scheme.  In these circumstances would the Minister not agree that it is fair to assume that the Minister's allocation is either cut or going to be cut?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not make any such assumption.  My new proposals are simply an extension of the existing scheme of health contributions.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing is that during 1978 we maintained the percentage of GNP devoted to the health services and in fact increased it slightly. The latest estimate is that in 1978 it will <Col N="829" /> be 6.25 per cent as against 6.07 per cent in the previous year.  The second factor is that the Government, as the Deputy knows, are engaged in the Economic and Social Development Plan in planning the economic and social development of the country from 1977 to 1980.  That will be dealt with in a White Paper to be published at the end of this year. Whatever provisions are to be made for health and all the other various social services will be included in that overall economic plan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The following are the principal reasons why consultants' fees are not included in the proposed extension of free hospital services: (1) I believe, and in this I am supported by international experience, that Irish medicine will benefit from retaining a balanced mixture of public health service and private practice.  (2) Persons who will not be entitled to the services of hospital consultants without charge, that is those with incomes of £5,000 a year or more, will be paying a smaller percentage of their total income on health contributions than those at lower income levels.  (3) Negotiations with the medical <Col N="842" /> profession on a new contract for hospital consultants have been based on an acceptance of the principle of retaining a reasonable element of private practice. (4) Even if provision were made whereby consultants' fees incurred by persons in the upper income group would be paid through public funds, it is reasonably certain that the great majority of these persons would still choose to have private treatment.  This contention is supported by the fact that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board at present provide insurance cover for more than 20 per cent of the population.  Making such provision could therefore lead to a waste of public funds.  (5) The Voluntary Health Insurance Board are extending and improving their services to facilitate persons who wish to take out insurance against these charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Health, through the Health Education Bureau, recently activated a campaign aimed at helping people to achieve and maintain a healthy bodyweight by means of a balance between activity level and energy intake from food and drink.  The campaign was conducted through the medium of a calorie intake chart and a pack entitled &ldquo;The Better Health Pack&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The pack comprised hints on exercise and energy intake and the chart gave detailed information on the relative calorific values of certain foods to enable people to plan their calorie intake in relation to the amount and type of exercise undertaken.  The chart also mentions the need for a balanced diet of calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fats and vitamins and gave general information on the food and drink sources which would provide these nutrients.</P>
      <P>To complement this campaign, I will ask the Food Advisory Committee to prepare details of the relative intake of these nutrients from food and drink which will enable the individual to plan his particular nutritional needs.  The Health Education Bureau will arrange this further campaign in due course.</P>

In the case of ophthalmic services the waiting period are 3.5 months for children and 3.8 months for adults, while for aural services the periods are 7.9 months for children and six months for adults.

      <P>Deputy O'Toole has received permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 438 of 12 October 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter.  I tried to raise it on Tuesday and yesterday and I suppose, third time lucky, I should be thankful for the opportunity of raising it now.  The question reads:</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Toole asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he will state, in relation to the recommendations from the National Prices Commission which he approved during the months of July, August and September 1978, the commodities in question and the extent of the increases; and, in relation to the recommendation which he did not approve, the increase recommended and the commodities concerned.</P>
      <P>The written reply of 12 October reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of price increase recommendations made by the National Prices Commission during the months of July, August and September 1978, will be set out in the commission's reports for these months.  The press statements to be issued in connection with these reports will indicate which of these recommendations I have approved. The July report will be published on Friday next, 13 October <Col N="897" /> 1978 and it is expected that the August/September 1978 report will be published towards the end of this month or early next month.</P>
    <P>In other words, I was given the expected dates on which the National Prices Commission reports would be published. I did not seek this information.  I sought specific information of price increases for the months of July, August and September.  Any citizen would be entitled to the information I was given this day week.  That is the position as I see it.</P>
    <P>I understood that Question Time was an important part of our parliamentary procedure.  We all realise that the parliamentary question is the only device open to people like myself to elicit specific information on important topics. As I have outlined, the substance of my question concerned price increases, which is the concern of every consumer. In seeking this information I was seeking something which I have previously sought and got.  Indeed, there have been instances when I have received a comprehensive reply to a specific question. On 7 March, 6 April and 20 June last year I received comprehensive replies to similar questions.  On 2 March my colleague, Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan, received a comprehensive reply to a similar question as did Deputy Barry Desmond in October last.  But on 28 June last, the last day on which this House sat prior to the summer recess, I received a reply which was similar to the reply received by me last week.  In other words, there seemed to be a change of heart somewhere along the way.  It would now seem that the performance is being repeated during this session.  I am being denied general information which I seek through the normal device of a parliamentary question.  Is the information sought available?  In the absence of information to the contrary I must assume it is available.  If so, I must also assume in the absence of that information that the Minister has something to hide. That is the only logical conclusion I can come to.</P>
    <P>Deferring the evil day when the people must have this information is in no way advantageous to the Government or to <Col N="898" /> the Minister.  This recent development, which is a deliberate curtailment of information, is nothing short of a scandalous abuse of the long-held privileges of the Members of this House.  It is an erosion of my rights and the rights of other Members of this House and reduces Question Time to nothing more than an exercise in evasiveness.  That is my opinion of the present format of the replies to such questions.  What is the Minister afraid of?  Why is the responsible Minister not present?</P>
    <P>It is generally understood that one of the major planks in the Fianna Fáil manifesto was the control of prices being handed over to a senior member of the Cabinet.  The Minister, Deputy O'Malley, has said that he is responsible for price control.  I am not surprised that he did not come into the House this evening because his record in relation to the control of prices is nothing to shout about. Since last July we have had something of the order of 430 price increases.  One of yesterday evening's newspaper headlines, &ldquo;Shopping Basket Shock&rdquo;, brought home to me the importance of receiving information to which the country, the House and I are entitled. The article informed us that the shopping basket has soared to 12p in the £ more than in Great Britain.  Every housewife in the country knows it and no amount of ostrich-like activity or evasiveness is going to hide that fact.</P>
    <P>What is contained in the National Prices Commission report for August/September?  Nobody knows. This lack of information is leading to a certain amount of worry.  It is causing speculation and confusion.  The confusion is being compounded by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. I was present in the House yesterday afternoon at Question Time when Deputy O'Leary put down a question to the Minister for Finance in regard to the consumer price index and what might be expected in the future.  The Minister stated that, from the information available to him and taking all factors into consideration, he expected the CPI for mid-November would show a reduction, despite the fact that only last week we had major increases in the prices of sugar and briquettes which would affect <Col N="899" /> the CPI to some degree.  While the Minister was on his feet, the Taoiseach a few miles away was addressing, according to yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i>, the Kevin Barry UCD Fianna Fáil Cumann.  He said that while inflation had been brought well down into single figures it was now pushing upwards since it reached the low rate indicated in the May CPI.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The causes are near home and lie with higher food prices and income increases that are out of line with the real growth of national output.</P>
    <P>That indicates to me that he expects an increase in the mid-November CPI figures when the times comes while the Minister for Finance at the same time is giving us categorical assurances that from the information available to him the CPI figure of mid-November will show a reduction.  If that is not confusion in the case of two gentlemen who we must assume are very close to each other, I do not know what it is.</P>
    <P>Further, Deputy O'Leary tried to elicit from the Minister for Finance if he was taking the August-September price increases into account when assessing the mid-November CPI.  Again, we had evasiveness.  He would only say that all relevant factors had been taken into account and his prognostication was that there would be a reduction.  This has now become a matter of serious concern and is causing not a little confusion here and among the many thousands of people outside this House interested in price levels.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the position is that every effort is being made to ensure that the inevitable rise in the cost of living and the inevitable increases approved by the Minister will come in unheralded and unknown to as many people as possible. This would seem to be the policy now adopted by the Minister.  We have reached the stage where the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in releasing press statements from the GIS normally refers to increases as having come from and been approved by the National Prices Commission while if a reduction comes about he comes to the House himself.  He did this in the case of <Col N="900" /> the few reductions we have had due to external circumstances, as for example in the case of the ESB charges which were due to exchange rates on the international money market which affect the price of oil.  He came here to announce that, giving the impression that he was responsible for reductions while the poor old National Prices Commission were responsible for increases.  Let me ask once more why is it, despite the fact that the international rate of exchange has resulted in an upward valuation of the £ sterling, we have not benefited?  Why can he not insist in the case of oil prices, for instance, that they be reduced to take account of the improvement in the £?  I should like these questions to be answered.  I am sorry the Minister did not think it worthwhile to live up to his responsibilities and come here.  If he is in charge of prices, let him face the facts as they exist and answer for some of the increases for which he and his Government are responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask when the August-September report will be published.  It is fairly obvious from the delayed publication of the July report that the Government had made no decision on the sugar price increase until quite recently when they decided to knock a penny off the recommendation of the National Prices Commission.  In these circumstances one would expect that the August-September report, on the assumption that it is a unified report as it normally tends to be at that time of year, should be out in the very near future.  I should also like to know if the negotiations between the Minister and the petroleum companies in any way affect its publication.  That is my main query.  Perhaps we could then put in better context the statement of the Minister for Finance yesterday in terms of anticipation of the mid-November figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, in reply to Deputy Desmond, I would hope that the August-September report would be published by the end of this month or certainly by the first days of November. I think we shall not fall very <Col N="901" /> far short of the normal length of time for publication of the NPC report.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I think it is sad to see a Deputy from the main Opposition party launching an attack on the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy because of his inability to be here this evening. Perhaps Deputy O'Toole does not follow the press very carefully.  Perhaps he did not get the papers this morning or listen to the news, but I think he would agree that the greatest and most crucial problem facing the Government at present is unemployment, and that it has been and will continue to be the task of the Minister to promote industry which will provide good and steady jobs for our young people and our people generally.  Because of his duty in that regard the Minister is at present touring the United States with officials from the Industrial Development Authority in the cause of jobs for the Irish people.  I suggest that is a very valid reason for the Minister not being here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been fairly common over the years for Deputies on all sides of the House to put down questions seeking information on price increases recommended and approved in a particular period.  As the Deputy rightly said, it was the practice until fairly recently to give the information in the form of a rather lengthy tabular statement irrespective of whether the details had already been published or not.  These tabular statements may be very lengthy, as the Deputy is aware, and were time-consuming for the officials concerned in compiling them.  As Deputies know, reports are published by the National Prices Commission on a monthly basis. To each report details are appended of price increases considered by the commission in the period covered by the report, usually the period from the first day to the last day of the month to which the report relates.  These give information such as the name of the firm which sought the increase, the products involved, the price increase sought, and the recommendation made by the Commission to the Minister.  In a statement to the press at the time each monthly report is published, the Minister indicates the recommendations he has approved, <Col N="902" /> those he has refused, those for which he has allowed a lesser increase, or those which may be still under consideration.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it seemed to the Minister that a considerable amount of official time and the time of the House could be saved if Deputies seeking this type of information were referred to the monthly reports of the National Prices Commission which are readily available in the Dáil Library in the case of reports which have already been published, or which will be available within a reasonably short time in the case of reports covering a current month.  There is no need to mention that Deputies and Senators get a copy of this report at the time of its publication.  By answering appropriate questions in this fashion, the Minister was of the opinion, and so am I, that duplication of work could be avoided.  I am sure everybody will agree that, where this type of information is already available, or will be available within a reasonably short period, the compiling of lengthy tabular statements, which are merely copies of statements already made, or which will be made in the near future, should not be necessary.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a press statement issued by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy on 13 October in which he referred to statements or suggestions that the recent increases approved by him, and announced in the July monthly report of the National Prices Commission, were the beginning of a new inflation spiral.  This suggestion was made by a colleague of Deputy O'Toole.  The Minister said that these suggestions are not only misleading but could be harmful.  Price increases announced in conjunction with the publication of the July monthly report, as pointed out in the report, should increase the consumer price index by only 0.7 per cent, including the increases in the price of sugar and turf which fall in the August-November quarter.  The latest estimates for the consumer price index to mid-November 1978 suggest that the quarterly increases will be substantially less than that for the quarter to mid-August 1978, giving a year on year inflation rate less than the 8.2 per cent recorded to mid-August 1978.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> I should like to thank Deputy O'Toole for the opportunity he presented to me to publicise a press statement issued by the Minister today in connection with the Government's price control policy. There are a few items in it which I am sure Deputy O'Toole, Deputy Desmond and others will be pleased to hear about. The Minister indicated in this House, and publicly, that he had met the National Prices Commission shortly after taking office, and that he had submitted various criteria or proposals to them for the application of stricter control on prices.  The commission discussed these and, arising from developments and meetings which took place in the meantime, there will be stricter criteria in future on some items.</P>
    <P>The Minister has now decided that price contracts should only be operated for the major dominant firms in the private and public sectors, or where there are special factors such as seasonality of sales which require that price adjustments occur only once a year, or because of technical problems relating to the ultimate unit price to the consumer.  Efficiency improvements will continue to play a prominent part in price contracts and in future firms on a price contract will be required to report each year on developments in this area. The overall operation of price contracts will be reviewed for each firm at least every three years.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Prices and Charges (Notification of Increases) Order, 1976, manufacturers who occupy a dominant position in the market place, and who employ more than 100 persons, are obliged to give two months' notice to the Minister of any proposed price increase. The Minister has now decided that in the case of some companies on a price contract, together with CIE and Bord na Móna&mdash;the two major State companies not on price contracts&mdash;the period of notification should be extended to three months.</P>
    <P>Up to now firms who export 25 per cent or more of their total volume of a product or product group at a price which is not less than the home or Irish price are exempt from detailed price control. <Col N="904" /> The Minister has decided that the export exemption limit should now be raised to 35 per cent of total volume.</P>
    <P>There are many other items in the press release which the Minister has sanctioned and which he hopes will lead to tighter and stricter control on applications for price increases to the National Prices Commission.  I am sure Deputies opposite will welcome the arrival of these new criteria.  We had discussions in this House about what the criteria should be and how we should strengthen the hand of the National Prices Commission and, in doing so, strengthen the hand of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the last point made by Deputy O'Toole in which he quoted from a statement made by the Taoiseach at UCD yesterday.  It is unfortunate that when we quote statements in this House, some of us are inclined to quote what suits the occasion and leave out one of the most important elements of the quotation.  If Deputy O'Toole had got a copy of the Taoiseach's statement in UCD he would have realised that the quotation went on to say:</P>
    <P>We can have either sensible increases in real incomes and more work for our young people or large increases in money incomes with less work opportunities and more price rises.</P>

I would not accept that because the Deputy feels information is being cut down by the change in the structure of the reply to his question, his rights are being eroded.  I think he would agree it is only reasonable that the Government of the day should see the report of the National Prices Commission before any of us have an opportunity of seeing it.  The Minister may recommend various matters in the report, or recommend the report as a whole, but the final responsibility for the passing of the report must rest with the Government.</P>

      <P>I have seen the report in the <i>Financial Times</i> to which the Deputy refers.  it is headed, &ldquo;Irish Telecommunications.  A race to catch up&rdquo;, and it does not include the statement referred to by the Deputy.  In the course of the article the correspondent compared the telephone service here unfavourably with that of other EEC countries, which are highly developed telephonically, but he referred also to the high quality of the international telephone service and of the telex service in this country.  It is the position that the telecommunications service here is not as highly developed in certain respects as that in other EEC countries and the current telephone development programme for which I introduced legislation last year is directed towards closing that gap.</P>

However, the average waiting time at present of all applications <Col N="855" /> on the waiting list is 13 months.  A random sampling of installations made in 1977 showed that 39 per cent of the installations in the sample were made within three months of the date of application, 62 per cent within six months, and 78 per cent within 12 months; the remaining 22 per cent were in respect of applications outstanding for varying periods in excess of 12 months.</P>

      <P>No such proposal has been submitted to my Department by Wexford Corporation.  However, the Housing Authorities (Borrowing and Management) Regulations, 1974 to 1978, require local authorities to sell sites for a price not less than the cost to the authority of the acquisition and development of the sites, less the value of any site subsidy payable.</P>
      <P>Developed sites provided by local authorities do not, in general, include site fencing and walls as these are regarded as the purchaser's responsibility.

      <P>Under the revised scheme for house improvement works operated by my Department, housing authorities may avail of grants of up to £600 per house for the provision of extensions for the relief of over-crowding, the provision of fitted bathrooms involving an addition to the floor area of the house, provision of a hot water system, provision of an electricity supply, a private water supply, private sewerage facilities or the replacement or substantial reconstruction of a roof.  My Department will also recoup to a local authority £1,200 or half the cost, whichever is the lesser, when they provide extra rooms and works required for the proper accommodation of physically disabled people or those suffering from acute mental illness. Housing authorities may contribute towards the cost of such works out of their housing revenue accounts.

      <P>There are at present no other funds at my disposal out of which moneys can be made available to housing authorities for improvement works to their rented dwellings because of the necessity to conserve available capital for the provision of urgently required new local authority houses and the financing of house purchase loans.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to enter this debate because of the complicated nature of the matter under discussion.  I do not claim specific knowledge in this area.  However, I would not wish to miss the opportunity of making a few brief observations.</P>
      <P>I listened very carefully to what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance had to say on this question and I acknowledge that the House was given as much information as it was possible to give.  I was glad to hear Deputy Tully say that in a matter of this kind, party politics should not come into play.  The subject is much too serious for that sort of treatment.  I am well aware that in a negotiating situation it would not be in the national interest for a government to put all their cards on the table.  There is always held back a certain amount of negotiating power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody can say that the proposal for a new European Monetary System comes as a surprise because we have known for some time that such a move was bound to be made sooner or later. The matter was being actively pursued as far back as 1970 and had it not been <Col N="864" /> for the oil crisis and the difficulties that arose from that, we should be much further along the road than we appear now to be travelling.</P>
    <P>This move towards a new European Monetary System must have been well researched during the past years and there must be a pool of information on the likely effects of taking such a step. Such information should be reliable. There has been enough time in which to have had a serious examination of the whole matter.  Monetary instability in Europe has been the cause of a good deal of trouble but there is a new determination to change this situation.  It is my experience that in matters of this kind we gain most by letting our European partners know that we are prepared to co-operate in a Community way in settling Community problems but that while we agree to co-operate we are conscious that such a move would cost the country the sort of money that perhaps we do not have at our disposal. Because of the anxiety and the concern of the stronger member states in particular to bring about a uniform monetary system, we might do very well by indicating our agreement to co-operate provided that this would not cause us serious loss and would not put us in a situation with which we would not be able to cope.</P>
    <P>Ireland's decision in relation to joining the EMS could have an important effect on the British decision in this regard because we are one of her best customers.  In such circumstances Britain would have to be concerned as to our attitude to breaking the link with sterling.  This leaves us in a fairly strong position and in a situation that we can use to our advantage.</P>
    <P>If I am criticising the Government at all my main criticism is that both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance warned the House that in the event of Ireland joining this European Monetary system, certain disciplines would have to be followed here.  However, nobody attempted to tell us how the Government proposed ensuring the attainment of these disciplines.  My personal view is that this country is in a serious situation. If we are to solve the unemployment problem and to find jobs for the <Col N="865" /> huge numbers of young people coming on to the work market, changes will have to be accepted regardless of whether those changes are occasioned by a decision to join the EMS.  The country needs to be shocked into a realisation of the changes that are necessary if we are to achieve the employment targets that have been mentioned frequently here.  No Government, let alone the incompetent one we have now, could possibly run a country in a situation in which strikes are the order of the day, in which the media day after day have news of yet different strikes.  No country could be run successfully in such circumstances. As an example of what I have in mind, there should be some explanation from the Government as to how they intend tackling the situation. We should have some assurance from them that they will not allow this spate-of-strikes situation to continue.  Because of these difficulties the country cannot develop her resources as they should be developed and as we are entitled to develop them.  There has not been mention of any specific measure so far as the Government are concerned that would deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>I fear that the real preparation necessary for a change to the EMS is not being made.  Steps are not being taken to bring about the disciplines that have been referred to both by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Finance.  Let us consider the difference between this country and others in regard to productivity, exports and competitiveness. Since the close-down of the mill in Waterford we have been left without chipboard.  During the past couple of weeks I found it necessary to place an order with Austria for this commodity and I got what I considered to be a very satisfactory deal.  I told the gentleman with whom I was placing the order that I was a little unhappy about placing the full order with them because of the use to which this chipboard was being put.  I said that if anything went wrong with his factory we would be left out on a limb.  I asked him what labour relations were like and what was the strike position.  He hesitated for a few moments and then said that he could understand my anxiety. <Col N="866" /> He said that they had a strike in one industry last year for one-and-a-half hours.  I asked him to tell me something about the system that begets this type of peace.  He said that the workers in industry are well looked after but that that was not the main reason.  He was convinced that the main reason was that in Austria the unions own some of the principal industries and the last thing they wanted was a strike position.  Daily they are up against the problems of management, running an industry, keeping it competitive and ensuring that this kind of disruption does not occur.</P>
    <P>I remember making this kind of suggestion in this House on one occasion.  The then leader of the Labour Party was quite annoyed and said I knew that the charter did not allow them to produce money, start an industry or take over an existing industry.  I told him to change the charter.  I know that would require legislation, but we have had no indication about how the Government propose to solve the problem.  They say that all these disciplines are necessary if we are to take this jump into the European market system, but they do not explain how they are going to bring this about. This is a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>I have always been concerned about the development of the agricultural industry. The Minister for Agriculture spoke here this morning.  Unfortunately I was not here at that time but I got a copy of his speech.  No matter what the Government decision is, he cannot be wrong.  In one paragraph he said it would have one effect and in the next paragraph he said it would be all right because we have a monetary system that takes care of this and therefore agriculture was not in a serious position.  He said that we can wear this without any serious effect.  When I read his speech in detail the overall impression I got is that it would put agriculture in some danger and we would not have the price increases of recent years that gave the agricultural industry the enormous boost he admits it got.  That too is a serious situation.</P>
    <P>What are we doing to change this?  He said the answer is greater productivity and greater efficiency in agriculture. Again I ask him and the Government <Col N="867" /> what they are doing to bring about this instant productivity and efficiency. When Fianna Fáil were in opposition they were howling across the floor at me about what they would do about the advisory services and the enormous number of extra people they were going to put into the West.  I am glad Deputy Callanan is in the House because he was one of the people who was shouting at me and rightly so.  There is scope there for development in the West.  This is the type of preparation that is lacking. When will the Government make a serious decision of this kind.  No indication is being given to the House as to the serious steps we are preparing to take to rectify this situation.</P>
    <P>Scope for agriculture is enormous from many points of view, first, from the point of view of increased production; second, from the point of view that all that production is for export and that is a very serious consideration from the point of view of the balance of payments and third, the extent to which we are processing these raw materials is totally insufficient.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about anomalies and what effect our entering the European Monetary System would have on correcting these anomalies or reducing their effects but he did not say why they were not rectified at the last price-fixing review or what steps he is taking at present to have them corrected.  He said that all these anomalies were not to our disadvantage.  He is right, but before a price package had been agreed the serious anomalies which existed in relation to canned beef and further processing of beef and so on, should have been corrected. A great many employment opportunities have been lost as a result.</P>
    <P>These may appear to be simple points, but they are extremely important points that the Government should be telling the House.  They should not merely be making vague references to the difficulties that could or might arise and the disciplines that would have to be accepted by the people if we were to make this move.</P>
    <P>For far too long we have been tied to the lame dogs of Europe.  We need this shock but at the same time we must <Col N="868" /> make the necessary preparations and be able to say to the people that if they do this and this, this will be the result.  Apparently we are going in headlong knowing there will be very serious disturbances and very serious disruptions.  A figure of £650 million has been put on this.  We would not have arrived at that figure unless the cost had been calculated.  In my view it was very foolish of the Government to mention that figure.  I am not suggesting that it was taken off the top of somebody's head, but it would have been better if it had not been mentioned.  That kind of information should be kept in the negotiator's pocket.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are in a strong position because of the influence our decision will have on that of the British and because of the anxiety, particularly of the Germans, to bring this about.  I cannot decide why the Germans are suddenly becoming concerned with this point but it could easily be that they know that whatever mistakes have been made in the UK they have managed to reduce inflation and to control wages and salaries.  The Germans might not be in such an advantageous position in the future if the UK continue on the road they have been pursuing for the last couple of years.  I remember when the Germans were not exporting a pound of butter to the British market. Now they are very heavy suppliers of that market and have been for the past few years.  They have been very heavy suppliers because of the weakness of sterling that enabled them to do it and get enormous MCA subsidies.</P>
    <P>I do not know all the reasons for the sudden concern about this.  I am quite sure we have sufficient experts looking into these matters, understanding why certain moves are being made and how we can best deal with these moves. Nobody should imagine for a moment that we are in a weak position; we are not.  As a small member state we have always been given quite an amount of consideration in Europe.  One thing we will need to be able to prove in the future is that what we are getting from Europe we are using to the best possible advantage and not wasting.  In the present year an immense amount is being wasted in a once-off effort that is not coming off. <Col N="869" /> They will be very conscious of that in Europe and it might have an effect on their attitude to us in the future.</P>
    <P>Those may be simple observations but they are not unimportant ones.  As I see it the moves now being made resemble almost a return to the gold standard. We all know that there have been peculiar consequences of such a decision in the past and that a book was written about the folly of returning to the gold standard.  It is difficult to know what would have happened had we stuck with the gold standard&mdash;when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I am talking about sterling&mdash;in 1932 rather than saying it was all a cod and listening to Keynes and his advice.  Certainly the Germans have feared inflation and have always kept it at a very low point.  They have succeeeded in making Germany the strongest member state in Europe.  Bringing about a situation in which there would be stability in this whole area might be extremely important to us.  Nobody wants to be guessing about this, particularly without sufficient knowledge in relation to it.  If we get the sort of compensation that we estimate we need there is much to be said for this country entering a European Monetary System and appearing to want to do it in a Community way.  If we indicate that we are prepared to co-operate, provided that we can be adequately compensated for any loss we are likely to incur or any disadvantage it will mean to this country we will get a very good deal in Europe, as always, because I believe we have come out of membership extremely well. I shudder to think what would happen this country had we not been in the EEC during the past few years.  We have reaped immense advantages but we should have made better use of them.  I hope whatever decision is made will be a sensible one, well assessed and that there will be a reliable pool of information available to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and to whoever has any responsibility in this whole area. Otherwise we have not been doing the job we should have been doing since 1970.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what effect thinking about the European <Col N="870" /> economic and monetary system has on other Members of this House.  I must admit the effect it has on me is to give me a headache which I trust will not prevent me from presenting my point of view with reasonable clarity.</P>
      <P>Our party are generally in favour of the concept of a European Monetary System or European Monetary Union. Indeed some of the arguments put forward by the Taoiseach in his speech are ones with which I would concur as strong reasons for wishing that the system would come into existence on a basis that we could enter successfully, without risk to our economy, and for seeking to enter such a system on reasonable terms once it has been proposed.</P>
      <P>What the Taoiseach said about the dangers to a common agricultural policy from monetary instability is, of course, right.  For this country the importance of a common agricultural policy, of ensuring that it is not prejudiced either by attempts by member countries with divergent interests to undermine it or by monetary instability, is evident.  The way in which events in the monetary field over the last few years have undermined the unity of the market and the clumsy and, in many cases, damaging way in which the monetary compensation amounts designed to remedy this have worked&mdash;damaging from our point of view&mdash;is something with which we must be concerned and anything that offers a prospect of solving this we must look at very seriously.  The monetary compensation amounts system has quite serious defects.  A number of Irish processing industries have been put at a serious competitive disadvantage in a way which seems to me to be non-communitaire. I must say that I have had difficulty in accepting that the system should operate with such limitations as to damage industries here when the whole basic principle of the operation of the Community is to prevent unfair competition arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other more general point the Taoiseach made, with which, of course, I concur, is the general consideration that a successful European Monetary System&mdash;if it emerged&mdash;would have very significant effects for the further <Col N="871" /> economic and political integration of Europe in which we have a very strong interest.  I noted his remarks on this subject with considerable pleasure and the degree of commitment which he expressed to further integration, with all the consequences that would have.</P>
    <P>I was concerned, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, to pursue what seemed to me to be the interests of this country in respect of European integration.  I saw that interest as being&mdash;and our Government saw that interest as being&mdash;in a development of Europe towards economic and political integration in order to limit the extent to which, under the existing half-way house arrangements, certain large countries are able to dominate the Community, to operate and undertake activities and policies which are at times detrimental to other member states because our Community decision-making mechanism is one which is so incomplete and defective as to permit this to happen.  I have always been convinced&mdash;and my frustration in the Council of Ministers for four and a quarter years reinforced my <i>a priori</i> conviction&mdash;that the preservation of the kind of degree of sovereignty at national level which exists at present in the Community in its particular form tends to help big countries to boss small ones but does not give small ones any great power to stop themselves being bossed.</P>
    <P>Sovereignty is something which is not equal between States.  A big country has much more sovereignty and much more power to enforce its will, to pursue its own policies regardless of the interests of others, while a small country, such as ours, can only very rarely exercise sovereignty within the present system by declaring something to be of vital national interest.  The extent to which it can press this is limited, but I have never seen any limit being imposed through self-discipline by the larger countries on their abuse of the unanimity system in matters of the most minor importance in terms of their own interests, economic, financial or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The more I have seen of the system the more concerned I have been to diminish the sovereignty of the larger <Col N="872" /> countries which they continue to exercise because of the incomplete form of the Community, and which has enabled them to pursue policies inimical to our interests.  While not convinced that we have yet reached the point where the mutual solidarity of member countries, or the independence of the Commission, is such that we can completely abandon the unanimity rule in cases where there is a genuine vital national interest, I hope we can move towards that fairly rapidly and, in the meantime, that we can improve the decision-making system so that abuses of the veto, which continue almost exclusively from the larger countries, can be minimised and the whole Community system made to work in a manner more equitable and fair to smaller countries.</P>
    <P>It is because of my conviction of that that I am very happy the Taoiseach has stated his conviction so strongly because on a few occasions when we were in Government in debates on European affairs there were instances when spokesmen from the Opposition benches, particularly the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, seemed to demur somewhat at our Government's approach on this point and their alliance with the Gaullists in France in the European Progressive Democratic Party also tended to cast some doubts on the degree of their European commitment. However, since the change of Government, I have not detected any signs of incipient Gaullism.  It seems to be a non-infectious disease in this particular respect, so far at least, and I am glad the Taoiseach's speech is one which will give M. Chirac the next best thing to heart failure, wishing no harm to M. Chirac, but certainly paragraph 13 of the text is one that the leader of the French wing of the European Progressive Democratic Party can hardly read with much pleasure.  I am very glad the Taoiseach shares our view and does not share M. Chirac's view on this basic issue. Whatever reasons may have induced Fianna Fáil to join the European Progressive Democrats, they are in fact closer to us in their position as stated by the leader of that party than they are to their curious allies in that curious European grouping.  Just how they will fight a <Col N="873" /> European election saying the opposite things to their European associates, and what the effect of it will be, remains to be seen.  I presume they are hoping their respective election campaigns will be mutually impenetrable and the Irish election campaign based upon the principles laid down by the Taoiseach here will not be heard of in France through the French papers and not too much of what M. Chirac says will penetrate here when the Taoiseach is saying the opposite.  So much for that.</P>
    <P>We are in agreement basically here and I am genuinely glad of that even though I cannot restrain myself from poking a little fun at the Fianna Fáil Party in their relationship with the Gaullist Party and the consequences of that. It is important for the country that the policies we pursued in Government are being maintained by the present Government and that on this issue, whatever apparent verbal differences there may have been at any time, there is now a basic unanimity.</P>

      <P>I hope the Taoiseach will carry more weight in his economic speech, as reported in today's paper, <Col N="874" /> which was so much at variance with the speeches of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>I want to come now directly to the European Monetary System.  I want to express one basic doubt or concern about the way it has emerged.  When we joined the Community the old EMU was still hanging around the place and people were still taking the Werner Report seriously.  It occasionally came up for discussion at the meeting of the Council of Ministers.  At the first meeting I attended&mdash;my memory of those days is one of great pressure and I do not want to mislead the House but I think it was the first meeting I attended&mdash;this issue came up and I recall addressing my colleagues on the subject and asking them, in view of our individual difficulties about controlling inflation in individual member states, how did they propose to control inflation rates within the monetary system, without which it could not stick together.  I thought some of my colleagues were beginning to share my scepticism and, indeed, that particular proposal about the EMU on a very simplistic basis evaporated very shortly afterwards.  The idea was revived by the President of the Commission last year but it did not provoke any great echoes in the immediate aftermath among heads of Government here or elsewhere and it was only much more recently, in the flurry of activity of international summits that occurred earlier this summer, that it began to appear as if there was a genuine interest in and commitment to the establishment of a European economic and monetary system.  This originated from a particular source, a meeting between two heads of State who committed themselves very strongly to the establishment of this system without explaining very clearly what had led them to this overnight conversion from the evident scepticism they had shown throughout the previous five years and, indeed, even after the President of the Commission had made his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impression, although we are not fully informed as to what was in their minds, exists that what led them to this sudden change of mind was the continuing <Col N="875" /> fall of the dollar and concern for the effect it might have in different ways on their economies, the economies of Europe, and on the industrialised world as a whole.  In so far as it is this factor which accounts for the suddeness of the conversion I am a little concerned that a proposal as fundamental, far-reaching and long-term as the one now being so actively canvassed and pressed should originate apparently out of an <i>ad hoc</i> situation, not necessarily of a continuing nature, and one that could at any moment be reversed, because in certain circumstances somebody somewhere might come to think the dollar is under-valued and it might rise again.  If that happened would the enthusiasm be maintained?  If that is not the explanation for the sudden change of heart what is it?</P>
    <P>I would have hoped that the Taoiseach in his discussion with the French and German leaders and other leaders in the Community would have been able to establish more clearly the reasons for the sudden change and would have been able to inform the House what those reasons are.  The first thing we need to know before we launch ourselves into the system is why it is being launched now with such urgency. The House is entitled to some idea of the reasons for this and I do not think&mdash;I hope I am not being unfair to the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance&mdash;that in either of their speeches this aspect of the matter is either dwelt on or referred to.  I am concerned that because this decision was taken so suddenly, and perhaps for a very <i>ad hoc</i> reason, it has not been fully prepared and is being pressed forward at a pace which does not leave time for adequate study of the full implications of this measure for the economies of member countries.  All previous discussion, whether academic or political, of the European Monetary Union has taken place on a basis and at a pace which has allowed for the evolution of ideas, for some attempt to assess the consequences and some attempt to measure what steps would need to be taken to make the system work.  On this occasion it is being rushed at at a speed which is worrying people not merely here on this side of the <Col N="876" /> House but in many European countries, as I have found in the last couple of weeks in various contacts I have had.</P>
    <P>There is, on the one hand, among many people in the Community a genuine interest in the proposal and satisfaction that at last the matter is being looked at seriously, but there is concern at the speed with which it is being tackled and the lack of preparation and concern lest the whole aim which we seek to secure by moving into the EMS should be undermined by rushing at it and by a failure which could damage the whole concept for the future.  On a small scale, we have seen this happen with the &ldquo;snake&rdquo;.  We have seen France in and out of the &ldquo;snake&rdquo; and we have seen Britain and ourselves in for seven weeks and then out again.  While that is not quite the same thing, rather similar kinds of pressures will be operating in the EMS as operated in relation to the &ldquo;snake&rdquo; and without adequate preparation there is a clear danger that this whole experiment may fail.  This I would deplore for the same reasons as the Taoiseach.  He sees, as I do, the importance of it for Europe and for us as a part of Europe and for our national interests pursued within the European context.</P>
    <P>Looking beyond this general concern at the way this matter is being approached and the general lack of preparation, I am particularly concerned because we have more problems and more potential problems with the EMS than most other countries, perhaps more than any other country, though I am less certain of this.  We have, after all, the lowest GDP per head of any country in the Community.  Though the disparities in levels of GDP between ourselves and the member states are often exaggerated when expressed in simple exchange rates terms, even adjusting for exchange rate distortion and even at purchasing power parities in so far as they can be measured&mdash;a lot of work has gone into reasonably accurate measurement of them recently&mdash;the disparities are great.  Roughly speaking, as between ourselves, on the one hand, and France and Germany, on the other hand, it would appear that their national output per capita is, in real terms and <Col N="877" /> discounting exchange rate distortions, almost twice ours.  A recent study published in the Economic Journal in June of this year which gives estimates for 160 countries and more detailed figures for a number of individual countries suggests-and there has not been much change in the relative position since 1970-that our GDP per head is about 42 per cent of the 1970 figure and that the figure for France and Germany is about 76 or 78 per cent. Even if one discounts the exchange rate distortion, there is no doubt that there are very great disparities, almost of the order of 2:1, between ourselves and other member countries at the country level and it is greater at the regional level.  We are by far the lowest by a clear margin in terms of income per head in the Community.</P>
    <P>Arising from that and because this is a mark of the fact that we are at an earlier stage of economic development, we have a clear need for a far bigger input of capital to achieve growth and to narrow this gap.  The Taoiseach said in his speech that this gap has widened in recent years, though he said his figures were not up to date and only to 1976.  If one takes the 1977 figures, when our economy as a result of the policies we pursued grew at what now looks like finally being determined at about 6 per cent, as against no more than about 2 per cent for the rest of the Community, it seems that the four-point gap which the Taoiseach detected as having arisen by 1976 was probably closed by our efforts in 1977.  At any rate, we certainly have not gained any ground <i>vis-á-vis</i> other member countries during these years and the narrowing of that gap, which, despite the many benefits of membership, has not been narrowed, must be a major objective.  It clearly can only be achieved with a much bigger input of capital into our economy, much of which will have to come from outside, all of which cannot be generated internally.</P>
    <P>If we are to catch up in terms of living standards and if we are at the same time to provide employment, as we all aim to do and as the Government plan to do in their programme, the growth rate which would be required to achieve these two <Col N="878" /> objectives at once would be very high indeed, beyond any past experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the figure would be even higher than 7 per cent if we are to catch up as well and that would require a volume of investment and an improvement in the return on our investment which would certainly constitute a very big increase.  Investment must, in large part, come from outside because we could not generate that amount at home from our own savings, relatively high though these have been in recent years.</P>
      <P>Because of our economic difficulties and because of our desire to catch up with other countries and provide more jobs, this country is liable to, and at present has, long-term balance of payments problems.  Our deficit is relatively large compared to other countries and is rising at present.  Our inflation rate is high.  The figure given by the Taoiseach is three-and-a-half times the present German inflation rate and, as the Taoiseach said, it is rising and rising for domestic reasons and not for external reasons.  We are worse placed than any other country, with the possible exception of the UK, to enter the EMS for reasons that are fundamental to our economy, quite apart from reasons that may derive from recent developments in our economic situation.  Our underlying situation is less favourable.  Even if our economy were now in good shape, we would still need very massive aid indeed to achieve the kind of convergence in our economies which would be necessary to enable us to remain within the system without very damaging economic effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has mentioned some of the problems with which the system could present us.  He mentioned the problem of the intensification of the pull of central areas in terms of the pull of resources from peripheral areas.  That danger is certainly there.  By comparison with our present situation where we are a big importer of capital, at best that importation of capital could be reduced; at worst it could even be reversed, although I hope that would not happen.  The Taoiseach is right in saying that without <Col N="879" /> adequate aid there would be an intensification of the pull to central areas from peripheral areas.  He also gave as one of the problems which we would face in the EMS, pressures to reduce our balance of payments deficit, which, as I have said, is now rising very rapidly, pressures to reduce it more rapidly than at present envisaged, which would have a deflationary effect.</P>
    <P>He also referred to the fact that in the initial period the parity of our currency might be higher than it would otherwise be.  His phraseology on that point is a little obscure, though when dealing with parities politicians are probably wise to be a little obscure.  I take it he meant that if we entered our currency would tend to be pulled upward by its closer association with the German Mark and other &ldquo;snake&rdquo; currencies and this could lead to an over-valuation of our currency which could make us uncompetitive in both the export and the domestic markets.  Given that there is strong evidence that we have already become uncompetitive in both these markets in recent months, that we should be in danger of becoming more uncompetitive through joining is obviously a serious potential problem.</P>
    <P>Not alone does our basic long-term underlying economic situation make aid for our economy more important for us than for others, we also have to face the fact that our basic situation has been substantially worsened in recent times by unwise reflation of our economy of an essentially temporary character following the change of Government.  The policy of our Government had achieved a 6 per cent growth rate.  At the time it was thought to be in the region of 5 per cent or 5½ per cent, but it looks as if it will eventually be determined by economic experts at about 6 per cent This was achieved with inflation moving rapidly down towards the figure of 6 per cent, to which it fell in the 12 months ending in May, aided as to 0.5 per cent by the Government's removal of motor taxation.  Otherwise the decline was the lagged effect of our policies and did not owe anything, as any economist would have been able to observe, to the new Government's policies, so that we can <Col N="880" /> say that we achieved a 6 per cent growth rate with a decline in inflation down to something of the order of 6 or 7 per cent-possibly 7 or 7½ per cent might be the fairest figure to put it at-before the effects of the present Government's policies in terms of increasing inflation had begun to be felt.  We achieved this with a very rapid export growth so that indeed in the first nine months of last year the value of manufactured exports rose by 50 per cent and their volume by something between 20 and 25 per cent. We achieved it with a very modest import growth and we achieved, immediately after our period of office with the lagged effect of our policies near balance of payments equilibrium.  As far as I can judge the balance of payments deficit fell to about £60 million in the 12 months ended March last, which is about the last period for which we can claim any credit because the effects of the new Government's policies naturally begin to take effect after about nine months or so.  We also achieved a downwards movement of unemployment which gave us a reasonable expectation at the time we left office of getting unemployment below 100,000 early this year, although this objective which we had set ourselves and which we believed we could achieve has not been achieved by the new Government and the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate has not fallen below 100,000.</P>
    <P>I would like, in parenthesis, to ask the Taoiseach, and the Minister beside him, and other members of the Government if they would mind dropping this phrase &ldquo;a few thousand short of target&rdquo;.  If we could just stick to facts we would have more chance of getting our policies right. The figures are quite simply that when we left office the seasonally adjusted unemployment figure was 113,000 on the live register, which as a measure at least of trend is reasonably reliable, even if the level may not be precisely right as of now.  In September the figure was 100,000.  So within 15 months there was a reduction of 13,000.  This clear commitment spelt out in the Government's policy document earlier this year was to a reduction in the numbers out of work of 5,000 in 1977, 20,000 in 1978, that is, in the first 18 months a reduction of <Col N="881" /> 25,000 of which 13,000 has been achieved in the first 15 months with the strongest evidence that there will not be much more decline because between May and September the seasonally adjusted index fell only by 2,000, by 500 a month, and if that rate continues for the concluding three months of the year the reduction would be 14,500 of the reduction of 25,000 proposed.  A shortfall of 10,000 is not a shortfall of a few thousand and it is not, and will be seen eventually not to be, accounted for by increased redundancies.  And if it is accounted for by increased redundancies, what on earth have this Government done to increase redundancies?  The answer to that of course is simple enough.  Their policies have led to increased inflation, a return to the rising trend of increases in wages and salaries and loss of competitiveness, which probably has contributed to increased redundancies.  But from a very careful study of the figures I find it very hard to see that the whole of this shortfall, or indeed more than between a half and two-thirds of it, could be conceivably accounted for by redundancies, never mind by increasing redundancies due to the new Government's policies.</P>

      <P>I am afraid, Deputy and Minister, we are getting into a domestic economic debate now.  It is not so.  It must be related to the EMS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is, first of all, that our economy is probably, even under normal conditions in the long term and on a fundamental <Col N="882" /> level, less well placed than almost any other to enter the EMS without aid and that these problems of a fundamental long-term character have been seriously aggravated by policies which have, since the change of Government, led to increased inflation and a worsening in the balance of payments.  Therefore, the need for aid is not only basically very great in the case of this country but it has been made greater by the events of the past 15 months.  That thesis is entirely directed towards the EMS and I would ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to permit me to state it in those terms.</P>
      <P>The action taken by the new Government has been to stimulate consumer demand to an extraordinary degree with the injection of an additional £300 million into an already bouyant economy growing at 6 per cent.  This £300 million pounds was not even for investment but for consumption.  The situation has been aggravated by the total loss of control of credit in this period, with an increase of 45 per cent in personal loans in 12 months before any action was taken to check it and the loss of control of wages and salaries with the result that the reduction in wage inflation which had halved the rate of increase of hourly wages to 14 per cent by the end of last year over a period of two years&mdash;a remarkable achievement in the face of the inflationary pressures which faced the whole of the industrialised world in that period, which if maintained would have brought the hourly wage rate increase down to below 10 per cent this year&mdash;has been reversed and any economists whom I have heard speak on this subject are now talking of a level of earnings increase currently two-thirds higher than the figure of 10 per cent. They are talking of a figure of 16 or 17 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a sharp reversal of the downturn in the trend of wage and salary increases with all their inflationary effects as a result of the policies of the Government and the impact they had on the wage earned, on expectations and on the kind of claims that people have made for increases as a result of and following the change of general economic posture following the change of Government.  The Taoiseach <Col N="883" /> in his speech yesterday dwelt on this failure very frankly.  I must say that his speech, apart from the single reference to the few thousands, which I hope he will not be tempted to use again, gave a very frank and fair account of our economic situation.  The Taoiseach said frankly that it was our own fault, that external factors were favourable, commodity prices were moving down and therefore, in so far as inflation was rising again and prices, having gone up from 6 to 8 per cent, were still rising, the fault is our own domestically.  I have to agree with that. It is right that he should say that and I am glad he did so.</P>
    <P>In this situation we are not well poised to cope with the economic and monetary system.  We have been caught off balance because of totally inappropriate Government policies which have weakened the position which the National Coalition Government had consciously and conscientiously built up in recognition of the possibility that whether through this kind of development, which did not seem likely at the time, or because of the absence of progress towards the economic and monetary system sterling might fall sharply again, there was a possibility that we might have to face the revaluation of our currency <i>vis-á-vis</i> sterling and face having to enter into some kind of link with the other EEC countries.  That was a large part of the <i>rationale</i> of our policies.  The new Government dismissed all this, entered on a policy direction totally contrary to ours and consequently have now been caught on the wrong foot as they are asked to enter an economic and monetary system at a time when our economy is moving rapidly in the wrong direction.  It is the country which will suffer from this and perhaps the Government also in the longer run.</P>
    <P>But moving from this short-term aspect to the longer-term more fundamental considerations, what I want to make the main theme of my speech is the question of what kind of aid an economy like ours would need and what kind of community budget would be required to sustain a monetary union as now proposed.  There is nothing <Col N="884" /> whatever in the Taoiseach's speech about this, which indeed reads rather more like an economist's speech&mdash;&ldquo;on the one hand&rdquo;, &ldquo;on the other hand&rdquo;&mdash;than as a statement of facts and figures of what the situation is and exactly what policies are required and the precise terms.  However, there was one reference in his speech that worried me and perhaps the Minister for Economic Planning and Development could deal with the point in case I have misunderstood it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to his insistence at the Bremen meeting on the inclusion of a reference to &ldquo;other less favoured regions&rdquo;.  He went on to say that this reference was &ldquo;intended to cover further Community action to improve the structure of agriculture in the west of Ireland&rdquo;.  All of us are concerned to improve the structure of agriculture in the west of Ireland.  We are very concerned to secure faster growth for the west than for the rest of the country so that people there can catch up, just as we wish to catch up with the Community. However, the Taoiseach would appear from his words to have conceded something to his colleagues in the Council that we never conceded, namely, that the word &ldquo;region&rdquo; in relation to Ireland can legitimately be used for EEC purposes as referring to one part of the country.  The whole of our policy with regard to the regional fund was to insist that the whole of Ireland was a less developed region and, therefore, that the whole of Ireland and the whole population should be taken into account in measuring how much aid we should get. When in government we never permitted for EEC purposes any distinction to be made.  We never used the word &ldquo;region&rdquo; for EEC purposes or in an EEC context to mean anything other than the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach in Bremen specifically raised the question of other less favoured regions of the Community and referred to the west of Ireland, that was breaking with a point on which we had been insistent.  It was a dangerous break because once that happens there is a danger that some countries would try to make a distinction between parts of Ireland such as Dublin where the GNP <Col N="885" /> per head is higher and would try to claim that such parts did not need aid.  If that should happen the basis of our claim for aid is reduced in terms of population, area and the total amount of aid required. I should like clarification on this matter.  I hope the Minister may be able to reassure us that what seems to be intended by the Taoiseach's words is not the case and that perhaps his wording has misled me on this point.</P>
    <P>While the Taoiseach does not refer to the question of what aid we would need, the Minister for Finance does refer to it almost halfway through his speech.  In his contribution he confirmed reports that the Government had sought aid of the order of £650 million for five years, an average sum of £130 million a year, terminating after five years.  We have not yet had the document on which this is based.  I trust it will be published with the White Paper or whatever the new document will be called before the next debate.</P>
    <P>I noticed that the Minister for Finance was extremely defensive on this point. Before anyone had even the chance to suggest that the figure was too low he went on to admit that it could be argued that the figure should be very much greater.  If that was the case why did he not argue that point?  He said &ldquo;It is necessary to have regard to and take a view on the balance of political and tactical realities.&rdquo;  That is a nice phrase but what does it mean?  Does it mean that the Government having unwisely committed themselves &ldquo;in principle&rdquo;, in a rush of initial enthusiasm at the thought of&mdash;however unpreparedly&mdash;breaking the link with sterling, with all the connotations that has for some people, as Deputy Kelly pointed out this morning, consider that against this background they cannot convincingly ask for the scale of aid that we need?  It sounds very much as if this is the explanation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance went on to describe this figure of an average £130 million a year terminating after five years as &ldquo;the additional investment required in the immediate and narrow context of entry to the system&rdquo;.  That is fair enough.  If he is making the point that even if we do not join the EMS we will <Col N="886" /> still need more aid from the Community than we get now and that this figure is related just to the question of entry&mdash;I take the distinction, but I would ask how reliable is the figure of £130 million a year?  How accurate is it as an assessment of our needs in order to cope with entry to the EMS?  Have we any expert advice on this?</P>
    <P>Some people in this House might say &ldquo;no&rdquo; because no such expert advice has been furnished to us here.  The Government have not published any document and nothing has been said about it in any speech by any Minister.  However, I have to tell the House that we have expert advice on the subject, advice for which I have the highest respect and which I should like to present to the House as fully as possible so that we may see how much aid experts think a country like Ireland would need.  I apologise to the House if this analysis has to be a little long and complex and if it involves rather more figures than I should like to use in presenting a case on what is a major issue to Parliament and to the country.  However, we must get to the nub of the matter.  Can we assess how much is needed in order to enable a country like this in good condition, as it was 18 months ago, to enter the EMS? Perhaps we may need more now after the past 18 months but let us forget that part for the moment.  Basically, what is the sum required?</P>
    <P>We have expert advice and we have it from what the Government must see as an unimpeachable source&mdash;the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. Prior to being in Government the Minister was honoured&mdash;and the country was honoured and I say that genuinely&mdash;by his appointment as a member of the Study Group on the Role of Public Finance in European Integration. That was the group that produced what was known as the &ldquo;MacDougall Report&rdquo;.  This report includes annexes prepared by individuals, including one by the Minister to which I need not refer. It dealt with a specialised aspect to do with Parliament.  Volume I of the General Report is the joint product of the whole group for which he shares responsibility.  In fact, to quote from the preface to the report &ldquo;the General <Col N="887" /> Report, including the introduction and summary, have been unanimously agreed by members of the Study Group&rdquo;.  There was no question of minority reports.  This is the view of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development of what kind of aid is needed in the circumstances we face for a country like Ireland in the kind of economic condition the country was in 18 months ago.  Let us forget about what has happened since.</P>
    <P>What does this report, the considered view of the Minister as a distinguished economist, tell us about transfer needs in the economic and monetary union?  First of all, the inside cover page explains the unanimous position of the study group. It says that pre-federal integration, which would not include economic and monetary union, would require a number of new Community policies which &ldquo;would lead to a rise in the Community budget from its present 0.7 per cent to around 2-2½ per cent of Community GDP&rdquo;.  In other words, to move to a stage prior to monetary union would require trebling the Community's present budget.  What about economic and monetary union?  It is not dealt with in detail in the report.  At the time the study group completed their work 18 months ago they did not see this as a realistic possibility.  However, it is dealt with briefly with some relevant figures.</P>
    <P>The inside cover section goes on to say:</P>
    <P>For more ambitious plans, the Community budget would have to be extended by far more to provide sufficient geographical equalisation of productivity and living standards together with a cushioning of temporary fluctuations, in the absence of which monetary union in particular would be unattainable.</P>
    <P>It was the clear view of the Minister that what is required in the way of a Community budget and transfers in the circumstances of economic and monetary union is far more than a trebling of the budget.  The words are explicit, clear and unambiguous and they are followed with more precise calculations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> How much more will be needed?  Can we derive any helpful information on this from the report?  I think we can.  Having referred to an ultimate federation of Europe which the group said would occur presumably at some distant date, one in which the federal public expenditure would be around 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the federation's GDP&mdash;that is 30 times the present Community budget&mdash;it goes on to deal with the intermediate stage of monetary union which is something between the pre-federal stage about which the report is mainly concerned and the Federation of Europe stage which is referred to here.  It goes on to deal with the intermediate stage of monetary union.  It says: &ldquo;This intermediate stage would involve federal expenditure of the order of 5 to 7 per cent of gross product if defence is excluded&rdquo;. For the purpose of this debate we can exclude defence.  It goes on to say: &ldquo;Such an arrangement could provide sufficient geographic utilisation of productivity, living standards and cushioning of temporary fluctuations to support a monetary union&rdquo;.  We know from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development that he believes, with a whole body of other expert opinion coinciding with him, that monetary union is unattainable with the trebling of the Community budget but that it could be supported if the budget were increased to ten times its present level. Without having done the kind of work that the Minister has done on it but with a certain feel for these kinds of figures derived from having worked with them for a long time, they seem to me to be of the right order of magnitude.  If one examines them closely one could argue that they could be a little higher or lower but I endorse them as being reasonable.</P>
    <P>Can we compare this with what the Government have proposed to the European Commission in respect of transfers to this country in one of three papers which we have not yet been allowed to see?  In today's paper I notice the contents of what appears to be another of these papers summarised by the well-informed Brussels correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i> who is privileged beyond what Members of this House are in having access now to these papers, which <Col N="889" /> privilege I hope at some stage will be extended from <i>The Irish Times</i> correspondent to this House.</P>

      <P>I am not accusing the Minister of any leak from here.  We all know what a leaky place Brussels is. Given that it is a leaky place, what is the point of sending documents out there while refusing them to be published in this House until after the leak out there a week or two later?  We have to be realistic about this in view of our, at times, rather bitter experience of leaks which were sometimes embarrassing to us and to the national interest.  Anything sent to Brussels it is assumed will leak out, at least anything written and often things that are said.  The House should be given the benefit in full form of what is now appearing in the papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before pursuing this calculation in more detail, we have to ask ourselves, in order to reach an answer to this question, how big the transfers would need to be to this country.  We have established how big the Community budget would need to be to support EMU, but that does not tell us directly what the transfer to this country should be.  It cannot be concluded from that by any arithmetical process that the transfers should be ten times what they are now.  That would be a false and simplistic approach.  We have to look at the report in more detail to find out what the Minister thinks and what conclusion he has reached as to the scale of transfers needed to this country. To do this we have to look at what the report tells us about the disparities between levels of GNP or income per head within the Community within its regions, and within various federations of states within provinces or regions of those countries.  A table on page 27 of the report shows our gross domestic product in purchasing power parity terms&mdash;which is the correct way to measure it, corrected for exchange rate distortions&mdash;as being 54 per cent of the Community average in 1975.  It also shows that in 1970 the richest region in the Community was 177 per cent of the <Col N="890" /> Community average.  Even if we make no allowance for the widening of disparities between regions and countries to which the Taoiseach referred&mdash;because that was corrected in 1977, but assuming that in 1975 the same ratio existed between regions in the Community as in 1970&mdash;then the ratio we get between the richest region, Hamburg, and Ireland taken as a region, as it must be, is 3.2:1.</P>
    <P>How does that variation in living standards in the Community between regions compare with other federations of states?  The table gives figures for quite a number of such federations of states.  The highest figure for any such federation of states is for the USA, a variation of 2.9 between Alaska and Mississippi.  Most federations of states mentioned in the table have variations in a range of 1.6:2.5.  Therefore, within the Community the disparity between Ireland and the richest regions is between 50 and 100 per cent greater than the disparity that exists within any of these federations of states.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of this calculation?  It is to make comparison with what these federations do in terms of transfers.  The report goes on to deal with this.  It tells us that: &ldquo;In countries studied some relatively poor regions enjoy net inflows up to around 30 per cent of the regional product&rdquo;.  But there are in those countries no regions as relatively poor <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rich regions as we are <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rich regions of the Community. Therefore, if in these states the scale of net inflows into the poorest regions runs up to 30 per cent, even though the disparity is less in the Community, logically in a full federation the net scale of transfers needed to this country would be somewhere in excess of 30 per cent of our GNP.  I hope the House is with me in the logic of that and I hope in the arithmetic of it.</P>
    <P>But, as the Minister and his colleagues on this committee have pointed out, monetary union falls short of this full federation and they have assessed the needs of a monetary union at ten times the present Community budget and the needs of a full federation at 30 times that.  We can conclude from this, as is clear from what they say about other <Col N="891" /> federations of states and about the disparities within them and within the Community between us and other countries, that the kind of net transfers we would need in a full federation would be in excess of 30 per cent of our national product.  One can conclude that in a monetary union the figure would be about one-third of that, just as the total Community budget is about one-third. One arrives then at a figure of net transfer of 10 per cent of our GNP as needed in the EMU situation.  This is clearly the view of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development as set out in this report.  Given that our GNP next year will be of the order of £6,000 million, what we need in order to make monetary union attainable is a net transfer of the order of £600 million a year permanently, not £130 million a year on a five-year basis.</P>
    <P>I apologise for all these figures.  I have produced them because the Government have not done so.  Had the Government done the homework that the Minister has done in other contexts or if they had had the courtesy to present us with the Minister's homework or to make reference to the Minister in the speeches made giving him credit for the homework, I would not have had to drag the House through all these figures.  In the absence of any reference to the excellent work of the Minister and his study group and of any of the figures that he produced I felt I had to bring to the attention of the Members of the House who are entitled to know the Minister's view on this even if we have not heard this from the members of the Government who have spoken so far.</P>
    <P>We can see now how dangerously inadequate the Government's approach to this problem has been.  First they knocked our economy off course with a massive increase in public spending, a massive increase of 45 per cent in consumer credit in terms of personal bank loans leading to wage and salary increases now running at three times the German level, to an inflation rate at three and a half times the German level and still rising even at that point, according to the Taoiseach yesterday. Having done so much damage to our <Col N="892" /> possible position in relation to an economic and monetary system or indeed our possible position in relation to a break in the link with sterling, when the economic and monetary system was announced they were so taken with the idea of bringing the Government to break the link that they rushed in to announce their commitment in principle to the new system with an enthusiasm that has drastically reduced their bargaining power, as the Minister for Finance admitted effectively, unlike the UK.</P>
    <P>In discussions in progress now in Bonn the UK have a very strong position because, although this was not perhaps the purpose of the exercise, at the Labour Party Conference they got a very strong vote against economic and monetary union.  While they may not have welcomed that domestically in view of their domestic situation, I am certain that in Bonn in the last 48 hours the Prime Minister of the UK has been saying to Chancellor Schmidt, &ldquo;If we are to join the economic and monetary system in face of the fact that I have this massive vote of my party conference against, you have got to give us some major concession to enable us to join&rdquo;.  His bargaining power is strong.</P>
    <P>From the beginning the British Government showed hesitation.  They have been able to produce evidence, not entirely intentionally perhaps, that they are under great pressure in their own party and in Parliament on this issue. The Prime Minister has gone to Bonn in a very strong position to seek from Chancellor Schmidt concessions, of a kind which Chancellor Schmidt has, on previous occasions, accorded to the United Kingdom and to which he obviously attaches importance.  We can recall his speech at the Labour Party Conference at the time of the referendum, its impact and how well judged it was.  We can recall the aid he gave to the £ sterling at the end of 1976.  I wait with interest to see what he will do today.  I only hope that whatever he proposes by way of assisting the United Kingdom will not touch the common agricultural policy, about which both Chancellor Schmidt and Prime Minister Callaghan have distressingly similar views.  I hope that Britain will be accorded the assistance <Col N="893" /> she needs but that it will be of a character which will not adversely affect our interests.</P>
    <P>We are not in the position to go along with a strong bargaining position.  On the contrary the Minister for Finance admitted that we could have looked for a very much greater amount of aid.  He admits that this is arguably necessary without defining the need as precisely as his colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, did 18 months ago.  He says that this means that the Government had to have regard to the balance of political and tactical realities, which means they could only look for about one-fifth of the sum which the study group of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development 18 months ago suggested would be necessary for a country in our position, stronger as our economy was at that time than it is today.</P>
    <P>The Government will scarcely be surprised, against this background of bungling and weakness, that the Opposition should be critical and should be concerned that we may be on the point of walking into the economic and monetary system on a basis that will prove too much for our economy.  The Taoiseach has warned about an overvalued currency in the early stages.  This is at a time, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, when wages and salaries are rising much faster than is economically desirable and prices consequently have moved from 6 per cent to 8 per cent, and, according to him, are still rising.</P>
    <P>This is only a preliminary debate but it is important to clear all those issues.  I have outlined the brief which the Government should have brought to Brussels, which they can even now, belatedly, bring to Brussels.  It has the backing of the MacDougall Report.  I do not suppose that if they went along and said that it was the view of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development as an economist that this was all they had, it would be much use to them. I am referring to his role in the report because in this House we respect his economic judgment because the Government, presumably, must have regard to <Col N="894" /> it.  But, of course, he had other distinguished colleagues with him, including the chairman of the group.  I thought at the time that the importance of their report was underestimated.  I regret it did not get more publicity and had I been at a different stage of my career I would have written extensively about it in <i>The Irish Times</i> to ensure it got this publicity because I believe it is of major importance.</P>
    <P>I was stuck in Rome on Monday at a conference on the Italian economy, at which I was asked to speak on the state of the European economy, including the European Monetary System, when one of the following speakers, Lord Thompson, who had been a member of the European Commission, made such frequent references to the MacDougall Report and attached great weight to it. It was he who reminded me of something which I had not forgotten&mdash;although I did not recall the precise figure until I came back to the report&mdash;that, as he said, a community budget of the order of 8 per cent of GDP would be needed to sustain an economic monetary union.  He said 8 per cent but the figure is actually 5 per cent to 7 per cent.  He mistook the average of it but it was his reminding me of that figure which made me go back to re-read the report, which I would have done in any event.  I had forgotten that that was actually the figure which the Minister and his colleagues had felt was necessary, a ten-fold increase in the Community budget.</P>
    <P>The case which the Government can make in Brussels is a very strong one. The factual basis is there.  I am not aware that any Government or any economists have attempted to refute those figures.  If they have I may have missed it but I certainly have not noted any serious critical comment suggesting that the order of magnitude of transfers or the order of magnitude of the size of the Community budget required to sustain a monetary union are incorrect.  I have found it astonishing that, apart from myself and Lord Thompson, in the other countries of the EEC this report has not come up for much attention in the context of the European Monetary System.  It is an absolutely vital document, <Col N="895" /> totally relevant and pretty precise in its assessment of what is required to sustain this view.</P>
    <P>I fear that what is happening is that for reasons which are extraneous to our immediate interests, for reasons very specifically relating to the interests of Germany, in particular, and also France, this proposal has been suddenly taken out of a drawer, into which it was put after the speech of the President of the Commission in Florence last year, has been resurrected and pushed, because, particularly of the concern of Germany but also France, about the fall of the dollar, with vigour and determination, by the political leaders of those countries who have clearly briefed their Press that they are determined to go ahead regardless, and the others can take it or leave it; if they do not want to come in they need not and they are trying to force this issue.</P>
    <P>We should, in concert with other countries, where our interests coincide, but while making our own specific case relating to our own problems, make it quite clear that if the European Monetary System is to work and be successful for the very purpose that the German Chancellor and the French President want, it must be adequately backed, not simply by reserves, which they are willing to consider quite seriously, although with a two-year time lag, but adequately backed in terms of transfers on the scale set out and specified in the MacDougall Report.</P>
    <P>This is the line we should be taking.  In taking this general line, as distinct from pursuing our own specific interests in regard to a particular figure, we would have very considerable support from the United Kingdom and Italian Governments, for example.  Indeed, it was evident from what was said, publicly and privately, at the conference in Rome that there are very close contacts at present between the UK and Italian Governments on this issue, as they see, it a measure of common interest.  While I have always been very careful&mdash;a lot more careful than the Minister for Fisheries&mdash;not to tie us in with Britain's interests except to the extent that they coincide, and while I recognise that in <Col N="896" /> the Community, in the case of fish and to some degree in the case of this also, there may be a case for keeping our interests separate because it is possible for us to secure concessions which would not be given on the same scale to a large country like Britain, nonetheless, there is a common basic interest here which we should pursue.  We need support for the general principles adumbrated in this excellent report.  We can get this from the Italian and UK Governments but we will have to pursue our own particular claim on our own, calculating our figures on the excellent basis set out here.</P>
