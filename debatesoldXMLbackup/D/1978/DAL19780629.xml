      <P>: I am very glad to see the representation on the Labour benches this morning.  For some hours last evening we thought they had given up the ghost; they are welcome back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Adjournment Debate affords us an opportunity of reviewing the activities of the Government over the preceding 12 months.  It also affords us an opportunity of pondering on the possibilities of what the future holds for the Government and the country as a whole.  In recent years the previous Government got very little joy from an adjournment debate. They were under severe pressure. Inflation had been rising to an all-time record.  Unemployment had got completely out of hand.  Prices of foodstuffs, clothing, footwear, transport and many other commodities had been escalating.  Apparently, the Coalition Government at that time had lost control.  They had not the will, the capability or, above all, agreement between the Fine Gael and Labour Parties to do anything about the situation.  They could not formulate any policy or plans.  The Coalition Parties could not agree on anything in the interests of our people and the nation as a whole.  However, <Col N="2345" /> there was one area in which agreement could be reached.  Of course, that was the unspoken agreement to hang on to office irrespective of the consequences for the country.</P>
    <P>That was the situation confronting the former Government when embarking on an adjournment debate.  We can well appreciate their dilemma, their difficulties and problems and the resultant mad scramble to put the onus and blame for misfortunes on everybody except themselves.  Usually external factors were blamed It is true that the world did go through the trauma of deep economic depression.  That external factor, combined with the absence of any ideas or plans whatever on the part of the previous Government, put us in a very serious situation and made the present Government's battle in sorting out the mess they inherited on assuming office all the more difficult.</P>
    <P>Let us contrast that situation and the deep depression felt with the situation now obtaining.  Let us take a look at the speech delivered by the Taoiseach here yesterday morning. There is an air of optimism prevailing in the country, except of course from the Opposition benches&mdash;but that is understandable.  Obviously this depression will become deeper in the opposition benches as time progresses.  But they realise, as do the electorate, that the country now has a Government committed to working for our people and attending to the policies set out in their pre-election manifesto.  We have a Government planning sensibly to make life that little bit better for all and particularly to create the job opportunities so badly needed by our young people.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil came back into office in one of the greatest landslides in our history.  The election manifesto had been very carefully prepared, very serious thought and consideration went into it.  It was not merely a handbook for the occasion, as people were led to believe at the time by the Opposition parties.  It was to be the basis of a carefully considered and thought-out plan for the restoration of the ailing economy we inherited.  That manifesto was fully accepted by our people and <Col N="2346" /> endorsed in the most comprehensive way.  Undoubtedly their first year in office has been one of success for the Government.  That is probably the main reason why the combined Opposition parties are at present in such disarray.  For the first time in four years inflation has been reduced to a single figure.  This is exactly in line with the plan set out in our manifesto.</P>
    <P>For the first time in four years the unemployment figure has dropped below 100,000 and the signs are that this figure will continue to drop.  The cost of living, the prices of foodstuffs, clothing and the necessities of life for the working family, have steadied and we now have greater price stability in relation to income than we have had in previous years.  Following the budget introduced by the Minister for Finance last January real incomes rose and the less well-off are a little better off.  We can never be really satisfied that the less well-off should have to depend on social welfare benefits at the present rate.  I am satisfied that the Government are making a genuine effort to improve the conditions of social welfare recipients by keeping a tight rein on prices.  I hope this situation will continue because there is little or no point in expanding social welfare benefits if a tight control is not kept on the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Government are not claiming all the credit for the fall in inflation. Obviously, outside influences assisted us in a number of ways, particularly the improved rates of currency exchange and the steadying of sterling. The removal of rates from private housing and the abolition of private motor car taxation were also very important factors.  It should also be borne in mind that prior to the election last year Fianna Fáil and the electorate were told by the Opposition parties that a reduction in the rate of inflation to that which we now have, was not on.  A very important thing has been the return of confidence in the economy.  Investment has come back in a big way.  The building and construction industry, which was always one of the mainstays of our economy, has become much more buoyant and is more active.  The sales turnover for <Col N="2347" /> building materials for this year shows an increase in the region of 20 per cent over the corresponding period for 1977.  This is an indication of how the industry has improved during the last 12 months.  The outlook for the future is optimistic and no doubt we can expect to have many more jobs in the building and construction industry.</P>
    <P>Compared with this time last year we have 10,000 fewer people unemployed according to the live register.  The greatest improvement took place during the past three months.  There is no doubt that unemployment still presents the greatest single challenge to the Government.  Shortly, we will have more thousands of young people seeking their first jobs.  The Government in their role as the biggest employers planned over 11,000 additional posts in the public sector.  It is disturbing to note that so far, only about 4,500 of these jobs have been filled.  I understand that the reason for the delay has been administration.  I sincerely hope that the officials concerned will show more urgency in their approach so that there will not be any further unnecessary delays in relation to Government policy.  I appreciate that delays in filling posts due to administrative difficulties can and do arise but exceptional circumstances require exceptional measures.  I hope that the Ministers and officials in the Departments concerned will look at this matter urgently.</P>
    <P>For our young people the special environmental improvement schemes are now getting off the ground.  There are justifiable reservations regarding the method of recruitment of workers for these schemes.  It has been suggested that in many cases the method of recruitment has led to a closed-shop type of operation.  Responsibility for filling posts in such employment schemes should be the responsibility of the local National Manpower Service and the local council or corporation involved.  It is of little comfort that unemployment at international level, particularly of young people, continues to be a serious problem.  So far, in Europe there is no sign of any great improvement, indeed the <Col N="2348" /> signs are to the contrary.  If this trend continues the EEC Commission must take action to alleviate or solve the problem.  This would be of benefit to us as any additional aids towards youth employment would be of substantial help to us in creating jobs for young people.  In the final analysis, however, the onus is on us to make whatever sacrifices are necessary.  Unemployment is probably one of the greatest evils in our midst and it must be tackled properly so that we will have success in reducing it even further in the near future.</P>
    <P>Our economic development during recent years and the accelerated growth during the past 12 months must give us added confidence in our future development in the immediate years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>: In that time conditions have not been too favourable and it is very encouraging to note that our rate of growth has been far above the EEC average.  Our rate of inflation is down.  Unemployment figures are coming down.  They must, however, continue to improve.  We have many advantages going for us.  We should perhaps be doing a little better. We are in a very good position to attract more foreign industry.  We must improve our image abroad and, <Col N="2349" /> of course, at home, so far as industrial relations are concerned.  We have too many unofficial trade disputes.  It is very disconcerting to note that the biggest percentage of industrial disputes last year were of an unofficial nature.  Surely we should have reached a stage in our development where unofficial disputes should never arise?  I do not for a moment place the blame on any particular section, whether management or worker.  There are, however, three parties involved in any negotiation whether on pay, hours, internal disputes or whatever.  Surely the parties should be big enough and mature enough to sit around a table and sort out their problems in a satisfactory way without anybody having to resort to unofficial action?  We owe this maturity to the nation, we owe it to each other and, above all, we owe it to the many thousands of unemployed and particularly our young people who are seeking jobs for the first time.  It is they who will suffer in the final analysis if foreign industrialists will not invest in this country.</P>
      <P>The incentives for industrialists introduced by the Government in this year's budget are attracting many inquiries and great interest.  Let us not cancel out these incentives.  Let us be more broad-minded and fair to each other.  The Government, and the Minister for Labour, particularly, have a responsibility in this area.  The Minister has in the past stood accused for not becoming involved in strikes of some duration.  Quite often for him to become involved would not necessarily help the situation.  As has been pointed out on numerous occasions, machinery and procedures are available to all the parties in disputes and this machinery should be used in a proper way without necessarily having reference to the Minister.  I hope, however, that the commission established by the Minister recently will come up with something constructive and will make good recommendations for improvement in this sphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be sensible and indeed it would be rather naïve to think that in our economic development we can be divorced from all external factors. Our economy, based as it is on buying <Col N="2350" /> and selling abroad, must suffer in the event of under-development internationally. Estimates of European growth for this year show a figure of something under 3 per cent.  This will be insufficient to create the needed additional employment but, irrespective of what happens at international level, we ourselves must take on the burden of responsibility and make ourselves equally competitive if not more competitive than our neighbours to attain the necessary growth at export level.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper is a new and additional thorn in the sides of the Opposition parties.  Their reaction has been that of the ostrich.  There was vehement criticism of the Green Paper from the Opposition some days before it appeared, when they did not even know what it contained.  In their wildest thoughts they could not have visualised that the Green Paper would turn out to be such a constructive and logical document, perhaps even revolutionary to the extent that it proposes to eliminate unemployment completely within five years.  The Opposition Parties when in Government never considered that there was any way to create full employment.  On the contrary.  The Coalition Government accepted a minimum unemployment figure of at least 100,000 in modern-day circumstances. At one stage we had 117,000 officially unemployed.  We all accept that the role of an Opposition is to oppose.  In this term, however, the Opposition have carried out this role in a very disorganised and disjointed way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the last 12 months neither Fine Gael nor Labour have offered any constructive opposition. They have not produced any alternative policies, with the exception of a brief policy on Northern Ireland which was altered after a few weeks following belated contact with the grassroots. Not a single piece of policy or a constructive suggestion has come from the Opposition since last June.  Perhaps the reason for this is that both Fine Gael and Labour are now reconciled <Col N="2351" /> to sitting on the opposite benches for a further 16 years.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper is purely a discussion paper, to examine the possibilities of speeding our progress towards full employment.  It will create consultation discussion at all levels on the best way to go about achieving full employment for all our people. Perhaps the Opposition parties do not wish to attain such an objective.  They should come out into the open and say that they are prepared to accept large-scale unemployment and that they are not prepared to consider anything that would go a long way towards providing jobs for our people.  The electorate will not be fooled by this red herring.  They proved many times in the past and as late as June 1977 that Fine Gael and Labour are only fooling themselves.  I said earlier that Fianna Fáil came into Government because the people wanted a strong, decisive Government in which they could have confidence.  That is why we came back with such a big majority.  The Green Paper is now asking the people if they want full employment and at the same time it is setting out the options as to the best way such a policy can be attained.  The Green Paper is honest and straight.  Nobody can accuse the Government of being otherwise.  I feel the Opposition will once more emerge from this particular effort with the usual lack of grace.</P>
      <P>During the term of office of the previous Government law and order was a favourite banner and was thrown about quite a lot.  At the same time we had a complete breakdown of law and order in our cities which deteriorated with time.  We had the birth of large-scale juvenile crime and vandalism.  Since Fianna Fáil came into office the strength of the Garda has been increased considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other points I would like to make but my time is up.  The vast majority of the people I have come across in my constituency are very pleased with the Government's performance during the past 12 months.  There are a lot of obstacles ahead which will be tackled by a <Col N="2352" /> Government working in unity and with a proper policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: The motion before us relates to the Green Paper and to the adjournment of the House. We must examine the contention of the authors of the Green Paper that it represents &ldquo;an imaginative and positive approach towards the problem&rdquo;.  The paper also said that &ldquo;the agenda for public discussion contains many radical choices&rdquo;. There is an urgent need not only for my party but for the House to examine the Green Paper and to put forward a critical but constructive alternative strategy to the country.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has described the proposals in the Green Paper as radical. I submit that it is an abuse of the English language to suggest that it is in any way radical.  The contents and the options outlined in the Green Paper are more akin, at a first reading, to an election manifesto of the Conservative Party in Britain for the next election than a response to Irish economic and social needs.  The most frightening aspect of the Green Paper is that after 12 months in office all the Fianna Fáil Cabinet have to offer is the rather vague concept of work sharing and cuts in social expenditure. I do not know what the Cabinet have been doing for the past 12 months but they certainly must have worked with the enthusiasm of a chained gang in irons on this Green Paper because it certainly does not contain very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware, as every Member of the House is, that there is a deep sense of national concern about unemployment, particularly about jobs for the thousands of young people who are now leaving school.  I have no doubt that very many Irish people in employment, including myself, are prepared to make sacrifices so that our families do not have to emigrate or live on the dole.  I believe that any Government calling for restraint must, above all, be seen in word and in deed to place a fair burden of sacrifice on all sections of the community.  That is a real alternative which our party offer.  We cannot support the assurances of my constituency colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, <Col N="2353" /> that all our people will ride on a rising tide of future prosperity provided people now in certain sections of the community are prepared to half drown themselves with sacrifices.  I do not believe the deprived sections in our community will fall for this illusion. They fell for it in the past and they are still deprived as a result.</P>
    <P>I am shocked to see that very many members of the Cabinet have no conception of what the real life of industry is on the factory floor and in the public service.  It is absurd to suggest that work sharing, in the context in which it is proposed, which is also income sharing, reduced overtime and early retirement would produce 65,000 jobs in a year.  When those jobs must come about in the context of reduced earnings, no real increase in earnings, more taxation or public service standstill in terms of expenditure, the proposition borders on the preposterous. If those meagre and largely irrelevant proposals towards job creation are all the Fianna Fáil Party have to offer on the anniversary of their election to office the prospects for the next few years are quite grim.</P>
    <P>I believe that my constituency colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, is capable of far better work than was produced in the Green Paper.  That is perhaps one of the most striking aspects of it.  It is about time we got away from the pre-election article which he wrote in <i>Business and Finance</i> on 4 March 1976 because the Green Paper is virtually a rehash of the article by himself and Mr. Seán Barrett.  We are told in that article where the cuts can be made.  My constituency colleague is more than capable of producing far better work than this very disappointing document.  I know that the pressures of party politics and of inter-departmental conflict and internal power struggles, which always goes on no matter what Cabinet are in office, leave their scars on documents but there is no reason why they should have left such a massive scar on this document.  Another disturbing aspect is that the more hard-nosed and realistic members of the Cabinet&mdash;I will give two names to the Minister, Deputy <Col N="2354" /> Haughey and Deputy Brian Lenihan&mdash; freely admit that the basic assumptions behind this document are quite impractical at best.  In practice they are quite reactionary, because we have the contrast of a political party which gave a £10 million handout to the best-off members of the community while threatening to abolish food subsidies for the poor.  That kind of analogy does not require elaboration.</P>
    <P>The £10 million tax rebate to about 2,000 individuals gives them £5,000 a year each.  For each year to come they will have that benefit.  That money would have built 650 houses each year for the homeless and would have helped to provide about 1,500 jobs each year.  The situation is that a budget policy of massive handouts to everybody has resulted in a decrease of £200 million in State revenue in 1978 money terms.  Now we are told that the shortfall has to be made good by general cuts in public expenditure. The pensioner and the unemployed breadwinner with a limited income who is getting no relief from the abolition of rates and car tax are now being asked to suffer from the abolition of food subsidies in the years ahead.  They are even being asked to suffer from the cutback in the CIE programme. They are being asked to suffer what will effectively be a standstill with no real increase in social welfare or in the health services.</P>
    <P>The electorate are going to scorn that kind of inverse means test.  I do not see anybody morally supporting a Government which provides massive handouts to the electorate, particularly to the better-off sections of the community, and a year later demands sacrifices from the less well-off members of the community.  The money that is urgently needed for social welfare, the health services and education was squandered by Fianna Fáil in their quest for power at any price.  At a time when every single scarce resource of the State should be exclusively devoted to job creation, all Ministers Colley and O'Donoghue gave in the budget was a supermarket of free offers.  Like all free offers, the customers will have to pay in full measure at the checkout.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper does not hold out much hope for a significant reduction <Col N="2355" /> in unemployment in the short term. The job creation measures of the Government in the budget were welcome. They were decisive but are not sufficient to make an impact on unemployment. It has to be pointed out that the emigration figure of 14,000 in the past 12 months together with the partial recovery of the European economy and an excellent tourist season this year, have contributed as much to the reduction in the number on the live register as the Fianna Fáil job creation programme.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Green Paper does not see any major dynamic future for public enterprise.  The proposals concerning State-sponsored bodies are rather sparse.  The idea of an industrial development corporation is once again ignored.  We are back to the old consortium which has not met more than three times in 12 months.  I am disappointed that the CIE capital programme is half buried.  By and large, the public capital programme seems destined to stand still.  I am disappointed that the prospect of joint ventures between State-sponsored bodies and private companies is only half-heartedly endorsed.  There does not seem to be any urgency about the need for exploiting our oil, gas and mineral resources.  I do not know what the Cabinet are up to these days but I do not get an impression of urgency in that regard.</P>
    <P>I know that the Government have bragged about the reduction in inflation to 6.2 per cent.  When considering that figure we must take into account the abolition of rates and the stability in world commodity prices.  To some extent it ignores the hidden inflation in food prices which has hit low-income families and pensioners.  For example, the food price index showed an 8 per cent increase over the past 12 months.  The underlying aspect of the 6.2 per cent inflation rate should not be ignored in the context of phasing out food subsidies, no increase in children's allowances this year and no social welfare increases in October.</P>
    <P>One of the more sickening aspects of the Green Paper is its failure to see any responsible role for a fair system of taxation in our economic and social <Col N="2356" /> structure.  We gave a few tax reliefs, abolished wealth tax and that is it.  I have always said that taxation is a method of serving the dual purpose of providing the State with resources for financing vital public and welfare services and of ensuring a more equitable distribution of income and wealth. The squandering spree of the Fianna Fáil Party in the election, the two-stage rocket of a budget and the scramble backwards in the Green Paper have emasculated our taxation system.  I believe that taxation is necessary if we are to have the public services we need in a modern and socially progressive democracy.  Taxation is necessary if we are to reform the quality and improve the scope of our social welfare, health and education services.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's dispute with the Fianna Fáil Party's approach is with the manner in which the weight of taxation foreshadowed in the Green Paper is to be distributed now and in the future.  There is clear evidence in the Green Paper that the relative burden of taxation and general charges on wage and salary earners are to be further increased.  An example of that approach is, the temptation open to Deputy Colley to put a 2 per cent payroll tax on wage and salary earners to pay for our future health services which would bring in £35 million per year.  That is the kind of option which people will be facing.</P>
    <P>The Government have already made the tax system less progressive by dismantling capital taxation, the abolition of most domestic rates and the abolition of most road taxes.  As a result, the contribution in taxes by the relatively better-off sections of the community has diminished.  They are now buying bigger and better houses and will have much to say if second mortgaging is proposed by the Government. They are grabbing as much property and farmland as they can buy.  Most of them are blowing their tax reliefs and rates reliefs on foreign holidays.  Just try to get your car in or out of Dublin Airport at present and you will see clear evidence of where this money, given by Fianna Fáil to the relatively better-off section of the community, is going.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2357" /> Comparatively little of what that section saved in taxation is being invested now in productive capital formation. If it were not for the productive investment growth from America we would be in even more serious trouble.  Such investment is by no means assured or stable.  Therefore, the alternative strategy of the Green Paper should have been directed to strengthening the general recovery of the economy, towards more radical and more definite measures to reduce unemployment and raise living standards. Instead we see prospective inflation and budget cuts, increased taxation and a minimal job creation programme.</P>
    <P>There is an alternative to this very conservative Green Paper.  I regret to have to use that description.  I had been very hopeful that we would see a major document.  I can assure the Minister, Professor O'Donoghue, that there is no more critical person in the House than myself in relation to previous Green Papers.  In Killarney I had great disappointment in saying very harsh things about the Green Paper of the previous administration in the final year of their office.  I was in serious difficulty with the Government side at that time for expressing such views, but I have always expressed my views and that is what we are here for.  The present Green Paper is on a par with the previous one except that undoubtedly some of the chapters dropped from the earlier one in Deputy Ryan's time as Minister for Finance seem to have been resurrected and are emerging in a very conservative context, particularly as regards public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The alternative strategy should be that of a modern mixed Irish economy. We can bring about full employment without poverty.  It is not enough to say to the Opposition: &ldquo;Are you or are you not in favour of full employment? Do you or do you not want it?&rdquo; The issue is how to have it.  Our strategy should be based on a much more effective system of national economic and social planning which would include the development of more commercial State enterprises.  I should like to see the expansion of agriculture-based industries, where <Col N="2358" /> there is considerable scope.  We need the encouragement of more investment in home-based exporting manufacturing plant in the private sector.  I am not opposed to private enterprise but I do not expect it to provide full employment&mdash;which it never set out to do. Those who say private enterprise has failed to provide employment can scarcely understand the fundamental mechanics of the economy.  I favour more investment in home-based manufacturing enterprise and I favour the balanced encouragement of foreign investment. The Government have given excessive emphasis to that aspect, trotting off to America at every hand's turn and to multinational companies trying solely to get foreign investment going here almost as though it was our saviour.</P>
    <P>We should have an extension of our public capital programme to provide a better general infrastructure, better transport and communications.  We can also provide employment from the immediate exploitation of our oil, gas, mineral, bogland and timber resources. The latter two have great potential. We should set up a national development corporation to initiate new industrial development and co-ordinate existing programmes.  Two or three years ago I was sceptical about the idea of a national development corporation. I am opposed to bureaucratic structures for their own sake but the more I see the lack of Government policy in the case of successive Governments and the more I see lack of co-ordination between different State agencies the more I am converted to the idea of a general industrial development corporation, an extension of the concept of the IDA.  This would be of major benefit.  The consortium idea proposed and initiated by Fianna Fáil is not working.  I do not think the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy O'Malley, a very competent Minister in many ways, believes in it.  The measures I am suggesting would provide many new jobs which with the provision of more jobs in our education and training services and in our social and health services, could bring about a degree of full employment.</P>
    <P>There has been excessive dependence <Col N="2359" /> of late on foreign companies for the development of new industries. I am perturbed that we are becoming heavily dependent on American and multi-national enterprises.  No Government here is likely to carry great influence on the foreign investment policies and controls of the Carter administration, for instance.  We may have a good deal of ethnic influence, but any retrenchment in US policy in this area could have most serious effects on domestic employment.  Large sections of our industry are now subject to external control.  There is still a substantial degree of uncertainty about the future of our export tax relief system in the context of EEC policy.  Therefore, I would wish to see much greater stress in Government policy on Irish participation in our industrial sector.  For example only 3 per cent of jobs in manufacturing industry are in our public enterprises. We should have far greater expansion in that area.</P>
    <P>In the Labour Party, as in ICTU, we have advocated the setting up of an industrial development corporation.  It would have a number of functions.  I am open to argument on it but I believe there is need for the establishment of new State industrial enterprises and for a more positive approach to the promotion of joint ventures between State-sponsored enterprises and private entrepreneurs.  An industrial development corporation could identify potentially viable new industrial projects, for instance, in the food processing and maritime sectors.</P>
    <P>I have been hypercritical of the Green Paper but I think the food processing end of it was reasonable. The section dealing with agriculture as a whole was thoughtful.  There were other sections such as higher education, which are courageous, to say the least of them, but I do not know what happened in the slot machine at Cabinet discussions, but by and large there are aspects of the Green Paper which are certainly very defective.</P>
    <P>There is need to balance the current large influx of foreign based industry, and an industrial development corporation can do this.  We need a countervailing <Col N="2360" /> industrial influence with the development of more Irish participation in industry.  A further function of an IDC would be to co-ordinate the substantial involvement of State agencies in the industrial sector.  These agencies do invaluable work in industrial research, export promotion, in the advisory services and in industrial training and education, but there is need to co-ordinate these activities to ensure that they do not waste taxpayers' money and that we obtain the optimum benefit from their resources.</P>
    <P>We come back to the old problem: where does the money come from?  I believe there are cash resources in the country.  The more I travel around the country, even in my own constituency, the more I am convinced that there is plenty of money and no need for great cutbacks in public expenditure.  I am completely opposed to abuse even with regard to social expenditure, but I am appalled at the way this document has been presented.  One has only to go into a public house in any city or town on any night and one can see the amount of money being spent.  We can find the money for many of the services we wish to introduce.</P>
    <P>We can have the cash resources we want from a just system of general taxation, which we do not have.  We can have those resources from a proper social incomes control over the banking and credit systems, particularly with regard to the use of their money on house construction.  We must do something about land speculation which is outrageous.  All sections of the community will have to make more sacrifices in the national interest.</P>
    <P>A good deal of the money which has come from the EEC by way of CAP income should be more fairly distributed.  I am not opposed to the farming community getting as much money as they can from the Community but once the money comes to this country it should be redistributed more effectively.  At the moment it is being distributed in a very narrow way, to very large farmers in certain counties, and they pay no tax.</P>
    <P>The stress and the balance of the Green Paper is out of touch.  It has proved to be a disappointment.  I have <Col N="2361" /> not met many economists who regard it as a significant analysis of the present situation.  I have not met many members of the NESC who regard it as containing positive and far-reaching proposals.  I do not want to discourage the Minister for Economic Planning and Development but we must go back to the grindstone.  There is a need to take very difficult political decisions at Cabinet level, to have another look at the document.  My outline of alternative strategy has something to offer. I hope my contribution will not be regarded as too critical and that it will be regarded as positive.  After 12 months of Fianna Fáil Government we are entitled to take stock of the economic and social policies of the Cabinet.  I have no doubt that the Green Paper will be changed substantially. The Minister and the Cabinet should have a radical re-think of the document. I would then welcome it, irrespective of party political affiliation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Adjournment Debate every year gives the Government an opportunity to examine their performance in the previous 12 months and to charter their course for the coming year.  This Government are almost one year in office and today we can look back on their performance in that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, we can look at the situation we inherited last year.  At that time our country was listed among the nations in Europe with the highest rate of inflation and unemployment and we had prices spiralling practically every day. The people were disillusioned by the inability of the then Government to cope with those serious problems and there was a complete lack of confidence in the country.  Even the Government themselves seemed to be bereft of any idea of how to govern.  I appreciate that Coalition Governments are faced with more difficult problems than a one-party Government, particularly in relation to taking decisions and to getting agreement at Cabinet level and so on.  This is especially the case when the parties in Government are made up of people with totally differing ideologies.  I appreciate that it is difficult <Col N="2362" /> to get them to speak with one voice.  That is why during those years of Coalition rule we had on a number of occasions Ministers making certain pronouncements but when questioned about them usually they said the views they were putting forward were not necessarily the views of the Government.  This has always been the difficulty of a Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Today we can examine the achievements of the Fianna Fáil Government now almost one year in office.  We can look back with pride on our achievements in those difficult months.  It has been generally accepted that inflation has been reduced, for the first time in many years the unemployment figure is below 100,000, prices have steadied and there is an air of confidence in the country.  The people feel we are moving forward steadily and that they can look forward with confidence to years of progress under this Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
    <P>In our election manifesto last year we set out what we proposed to do to tackle our serious problems of trying to root out the evils that beset our Government and our country.  In so far as it was possible in the short term we have succeeded in carrying out the promises in the manifesto.  We abolished domestic rates and road tax on cars up to 16 h.p.  We increased housing grants and loans and there has been an upsurge in the building and construction industry partly because of that increase which gave new hope to many young people who wanted to build their own homes.  We have seen an increase in third-level education grants which has given hope to many young students.  Jobs have been created for our young people and this has been the primary concern of the Government.  Other items in the manifesto have still to be fulfilled. We said it was a five year programme. It cannot be achieved overnight and the Government have four years to implement the remainder of the manifesto. I have no doubt that this will be done.</P>
    <P>For the remainder of my speech I shall deal with agriculture because this is the area for which I am responsible. Here, also, confidence has been <Col N="2363" /> restored.  The favourable out-turn for agriculture in 1977 is probably already familiar to the House and I shall refer only briefly to the salient features.  The overall increase in gross agricultural output was about 9 per cent.  This very significant advance, even though attributable in part to good weather conditions, displays an underlying upward trend in farm production, higher productivity and improving standards of efficiency on farms.</P>
    <P>The growth in volume and a very substantial advance in farm prices brought total agricultural output in 1977 up by about £350 million to reach a record level of £1,375 million. The volume and value of imports increased also, and, allowing for this, total family farm incomes reached well over £700 million.  This was over one-third above that of the previous year. The improved income in 1977 compensated farmers for the outcome in 1976 when the advance in their income did not keep pace with those in other sectors or with the rise in living costs.</P>
    <P>The improved income position of the farmers last year provided the resources necessary for further investment within the agricultural sector. There are very clear indications of a substantial level of investment being undertaken by farmers.  Approvals for land reclamation works reached nearly 180,000 acres in 1977.  Expenditure on farm buildings to the tune of over £70 million was approved for grant purposes under the farm modernisation scheme.  The number of new tractors purchased is up by 20 per cent.  Fertiliser use increased by more than 12 per cent in 1976-1977 and the level of sales this year clearly indicates a further expansion in fertiliser use.</P>
    <P>Creamery milk production continues to show a significant upward trend in the present year and all the indications are that this trend will be maintained.  There are good prospects too for growth in the livestock sector, and growth here will be enhanced if greater intensification and higher stocking rates are achieved and modern output systems adopted.  The sheep industry has been given a new <Col N="2364" /> lease of life as a result of the arrangements made for access to the French market.  We can, therefore, expect that this industry will now recover rapidly from the doldrums of past years.  The acreage under barley is also up again this year.</P>
    <P>Taken all round, therefore, the prospects for the farm industry are excellent and there is no doubt that agriculture will continue to make its contribution to growth in the economy.  It is of the utmost importance not to lose sight of the value of that contribution, nor, or course, should we risk complacency simply because farmers and farming are doing well at present. Agricultural land is this country's major national resource.  In terms of employment in farming itself and in industries either supplying farmers with their inputs or processing farm produce, agriculture is of vital importance. It is worth reminding ourselves of the value of our agricultural exports in our balance of payments.  For example, the EEC prices deal negotiated by our Minister for Agriculture last May meant an annual gain of about £105 million for the Irish agricultural sector and an expected balance of payments benefit of about £70 million a year.  The low import content of agricultural products exported means that agriculture's contribution to our balance of payments is greatly enhanced in value.  I make these points merely to emphasise that when the farming industry is doing well it is not at the expense of the rest of the economy; quite the contrary.  A prosperous agriculture brings enormous benefits to the entire community.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper points to a number of policy options in relation to agriculture. These concentrate firstly on ways and means of maintaining and, where possible, accelerating the upward thrust in output from primary farm products.  All the options set out in this area, whether they relate to performance incentives, a new direction and more positive development role for the advisory services, a greater emphasis on farmer training and education, a fresh approach to improving farm structure, a conscious programme for accelerated land drainage, a review of the smallholders' dole system <Col N="2365" /> and a suitable taxation policy for farmers, are all positively motivated. Some commentators have set out to look at many items in the Green Paper in a totally negative way or have sought to distort the ideas outlined in it purely in terms of cutting this or that area of expenditure.  This negative approach is not helpful.  The entire basis for the options is to seek to direct expenditure in the most productive possible way in terms of increased output and job creation.  I hope that the farming bodies will approach the discussion which will be taking place on the Green Paper in an equally positive way during the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The main contribution which the farming industry can make to job creation will be to a great extent in the food processing industries which depend on the produce of the farm for their raw materials.  In so far as farm output can be increased the throughput of the processing industries can be expanded and extra jobs can be provided in these industries.  This is the second main area of discussion in the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>There is no question of ignoring the significant employment content in farming itself.  Indeed, in all discussions on the EEC socio-structural directives up to the present the Minister has placed special emphasis on the need to rethink the philosophy underlying these directives.  When these directives were framed in the early 1970s we faced a much different situation from what we have today.  At that time the European economy was buoyant and there was every prospect of alternative employment for those who might want to leave farming.  In that climate it was rational that the directives should seek to induce movement of people out of agriculture so that those who remained in the industry could enjoy better living prospects.  Today when employment is a critical issue, the philosophy of the sixties and early seventies is no longer appropriate.  A job preserved on the farm now is as valuable as, and in some respects more so than, a job created elsewhere.  Whatever about the long-term value of the strategy inherent in the EEC directives, we must take count of the situation that faces us at present.  When we do so, we <Col N="2366" /> come to the conclusion that the right approach now must be to encourage all those who want to stay in farming to develop their holdings fully so that they can increase output as rapidly as possible and in the process also get a fair income from farming.  This must be the objective to pursue in the review of the directives which is currently in progress.  I am glad to see that in their policy statement issues this week the Fine Gael Party have now come to this same conclusion.</P>
    <P>It is not that the directives as they stand have any adverse effect on farming. First of all, they offer a very substantial incentive towards capital investment by farmers.  The State's expenditure on capital grants to farmers this year will be £28 million, and the figures for land reclamation and building work on farms, which I quoted earlier, indicate clearly that farmers are responding to the incentives offered.</P>
    <P>There is an apparent belief in some quarters that only development farmers qualify for these grants.  That is not the case at all.  The bulk of the State's expenditure goes to farmers outside the development category.  It is fair to say that the grants for farmers are generous and we certainly cannot over-emphasise the value of grants in developing farm output.  The £28 million spent by the State this year may be small when compared with the £105 million accruing to farming from the recent price increases.  I firmly believe it is the price he gets in the market place that determines the farmer's confidence in the future and stimulates his decision to expand output and, if I am right in this belief, the farmer has every reason for confidence at the present time.</P>
    <P>There is an attitude that the only future for transitional farmers is to get out of farming.  This is an attitude which, as well as being wrong, tends to erode farmer confidence instead of developing it.  I think it was a Macra na Feirme spokesman who said recently that the modernisation directive is not an attempt to annihilate the small farmer and he went on to say that we should do less complaining about the EEC and seek more to avail of the opportunities it offered to farmers. <Col N="2367" /> This is the aggressive attitude one hopes for from young farmers.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;transitional farmer&rdquo; is a much abused one.  In my book the greatest scope for the development of the industry rests with the big numbers of farmers in this category and I hope to see the vast majority move upwards and onwards and certainly not out of farming. I want to echo in a general way the call for less moaning about EEC measures.  As a west of Ireland man I would be concerned if we were not able to point to a real benefit from our membership of the Community. The benefits are, of course, there. Apart altogether from price gains, which apply to all areas across the board, under the disadvantaged area directive a sum of almost £21 million will be disbursed in the present year. Almost all of it will be in western areas.  This is a big sum even by modern standards and it clearly brings a very valuable supplementary income to western farmers, many of whom are also in receipt of the smallholder's assistance from the State.</P>
    <P>The general review of the areas designated as disadvantaged is now almost complete.  All the areas which sought inclusion have been looked at and the boundaries of the existing areas have also been examined.  The result is that a vast amount of information has been complied.  This is now being sifted and assessed and over the coming months I shall be considering what possible adjustments might be appropriate.  I have just announced the rates of headage payment for the current year.  The rates for cattle and beef cows show an increase all round of £1 per livestock unit and the overall maximum payment for an individual farmer has gone up to £400 as against £370 at which it stood in 1977.  Up to the present 35 per cent of the State's expenditure under these schemes has been met from EEC funds.  There is a proposal already tabled by the EEC Commission to speed up the rate of recruitment to 50 per cent and I would hope that the Council of Ministers would take a positive decision on this before long.  Apart from the value of these payments in supplementing <Col N="2368" /> farmers' income in problem areas, the payments should also constitute a strong incentive to small farmers in western areas to increase the number of cattle carried so as to gain the maximum benefit up to the limit of £400 a year.</P>
    <P>Another EEC measure of direct interest to the west is the drainage measure.  Deputies will be aware that one element in the price package agreed upon by the Council of Ministers in May was a decision in principle to provide for this measure.  This means that about £21 million of EEC money will be directed towards accelerating drainage work at arterial and field level throughout the 12 western counties over a five-year period.  This is now a firm decision and, once again, it shows that the special needs of problem areas like the west are not overlooked by the Community. There always seem to be plenty of voices ready to condemn the EEC but here is a tangible earnest of the Com-munity's willingness to assist where the need for assistance is established.  Now that the decision to give funds for drainage has been taken the next step is to prepare a detailed programme for implementation of the scheme on the ground over a five-year period.  This will cover such aspects as the acreages we would set as targets to be tackled each year, the way in which the funds would be disbursed, the organisation of the procedures to be established, the role of the co-operatives and so on. A considerable amount of detail and information must be complied and submitted to the Commission for approval.  The preparation of the programme is already well advanced and my hope is that we can see the whole measure translated into action on the ground before very long.</P>
    <P>This particular scheme relates to what I said about employment in farming and related industries.  Apart from the jobs which can be generated in drainage activity the whole purpose of the exercise must be to put extra productive land at the disposal of farmers.  If we do this, and follow up with proper management and use of the additional land which is improved, we will be making it possible for more farmers to expand output, improve <Col N="2369" /> their incomes and stay on in farming. At the same time we will be producing additional supplies of raw materials for expansion of activity in the processing industries.  It all boils down to better job prospects all round.</P>
    <P>Deputies will know that the Council of Ministers invited the Commissioner for Agriculture to present additional proposals which would aim at improving further the general conditions of farmers in the west.  This decision came as a result of persistent demands by the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Gibbons, that there was a genuine need for such measures and, of course, the fact that the Council heeded those demands is again an acknowledgement of their willingness to take special account of problem areas.  Discussions on the possible content of further measures that might be appropriate for the west are progressing and we can expect to see specific proposals on the table before very long. The upshot of all this concern for western farmers will surely be that agriculture in the west will have a great deal going for it over the next decade.  I believe it is possible to create a new dynamism among western farmers. It is there already in a number of areas.  The more progressive cooperative societies have been the main agents for progressive developments. Building on their example we should be able to get things moving throughout the west.</P>
    <P>Land, for us, is the equivalent of oil or mineral resources for other countries.  Of all the EEC partners, we are unique to the extent to which the economy depends on agriculture.  In times of recession that dependence becomes doubly important.  The farming industry have not been found wanting in this respect over the past few years and we can be confident that they will perform well in the future.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this administration will give every help and encouragement to the farmers to achieve greater productivity on the land, greater incomes for themselves and their families, and by doing so they will be making a more valuable contribution to our economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): An Adjournment Debate before the long summer recess has been availed of over the years to take a look at the Government's performance over the previous 12 months. It is appropriate that on this occasion we should do that because this Government have been in power for 12 months.  Contrary to what the Minister for State and Deputy Brady said this morning, the economy was handed over to them in a sound and growing condition. That was acknowledged by the Taoiseach in the December Adjournment Debate.  The economy was nursed through a terrific economic international blizzard and was left in a sound and growing condition.  In the words of the Taoiseach, the economy was ready to take off on a sound foundation. It is interesting that we should have a look now at how this Government have performed.</P>
      <P>In my opinion the Green Paper has been introduced into this debate to muddy the water, to confuse the issue and to distract attention from the Government's performance.  We cannot look at the Green Paper without looking at another document&mdash;the Fianna Fáil election manifesto.  That manifesto was not about the economy but getting votes.  It worked well in that regard. They got the votes on the promises contained in it&mdash;to abolish rates on houses, motor taxation and by implication to abolish wealth tax.  Those promises have been paid for by borrowing on a grand scale.  The time to repay that borrowing has not yet come. The interim between the time when a large sum is borrowed and the repayment date is always a pleasant period because it is a time of spending, a time to enjoy the borrowed money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For election purposes in 1977 this Government borrowed money to abolish motor car taxation regardless of the income or the capacity of the car owner to pay.  They borrowed money to derate houses regardless of the capacity or the income of the occupiers of those houses.  They borrowed money to abolish wealth tax.  They engaged in that borrowing with an enthusiasm and recklessness that would do credit to a spendthrift who would borrow money <Col N="2371" /> to go to the Chelthenham races or buy a fur coat or other luxuries.  That was the type of performance the Government engaged in.  As I said, the manifesto was not about the economy; it was about getting votes.  The White Paper since published and the Green Paper are not about the economy either.  They are to pay for the manifesto promises, for the spendthrift activities indulged in by the Government to get into office.</P>
    <P>We have been accused by the Taoiseach of being pessimistic.  Indirectly we have been accused of being antinational in regard to the Green Paper. I do not believe that document will generate confidence or that it will generate an economic atmosphere that will encourage people to invest.  I am not the only person who has doubts about it.  Today the ESRI published a document which throws the greatest doubt on the Green Paper and on the likelihood of that document to attain its objectives.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in government always have a stop-go approach to the economy, and that is what we have here. Last year they had money to spare. Now we have a document talking about cutbacks in the non-productive fields.  If they talk about cutting back, in the non-productive fields they are really talking about less money being in circulation.  If they talk about cutbacks in house building and social welfare, that means there is less money in circulation.</P>
    <P>If I were a businessman thinking about investing in the immediate future and read the Green Paper and the report from the ESRI I would not feel confident; I would feel very doubtful about the future and would be slow in investing.  That is the situation the Government have created by their spendthrift policies to get into office. Now they are going in the other direction. It would be a pity to spend too much time dealing with the Green Paper.  On the one hand we have the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and on the other we have the independent experts in the ESRI who wrote their paper before <Col N="2372" /> the Green Paper was published.  Let them battle it out and let the business people and the investing public judge. I trust that the strategy of the Government works but if it fails the blame must lie fairly and squarely with them for creating the situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>I am the spokesman for my party on matters dealing with the environment and I propose to devote the remainder of my remarks to that field. The Minister for the Environment is a very nice person and one whose company one would enjoy but he has been a dismal failure in the Department. Perhaps he was given a task that was hard to perform.  If the title of the Department means anything they are entrusted with the care of the environment.  Last year the new Government met for a couple of days in July and adjourned until October and when the Dáil resumed I questioned the Minister as to his proposal about an environmental policy and I was told that I should repeat the questions after about four months when there would be some news.  After Christmas I complied with that suggestion and there was a press release from the Department to the effect that the Minister was to prepare several policies.  However, nothing happened and there is yet no definite policy on the environment or on any aspect of it.  Four months later, on the eve of this debate, we had another announcement from the Department informing us that the Minister was setting up a council to advise him.  There is no national policy, no regional policy on the environment. There is no policy in this respect relating to the Dublin city centre area or in regard to new housing schemes. Neither is there any policy relating to the conservation of our heritage, to major industrial development or to energy or transportation.  It looks as if we are merely to drift on with a Department with a new name who have not indicated any performance to date. Time does not permit me to develop the matter further but I should like to hear from the Minister on the points I have raised.</P>
    <P>One part of their policy on which the Government are clear is their determination to cut back on local authority <Col N="2373" /> housing.  They served notice of their intention in this respect in the White Paper and they have repeated it in the Green Paper but we do not need any paper to make us aware of the Government's intention.  The facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>In the first quarter of 1978 there was a fall in the completion of local authority houses to 906 compared with 1,171 in the same period of 1977.  That was a decrease of 20 per cent.  The amount of money allocated for new houses to commence after 31 July this year has been cut back savagely. County councils applied to the Department for allocations of almost £14 million but were granted only a little more than £4 million or about one-third of what they requested.  That confirms the Government's intention to implement a cutback in this area.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The excuse offered for this savage cutback is that people wish to build their own houses but such an undertaking is now out of the reach of the ordinary family.  Let us consider briefly the position.  The cost of land for new houses in the County Borough of Dublin has increased from £3,755 per acre in 1976 to £4,833 per acre in 1977&mdash;an increase of 29 per cent.  In the remainder of County Dublin the increase is 89 per cent. Local authority loans have fallen from 17.3 per cent of the total loans in 1976 to 10 per cent in 1977.  The cost of houses in the private sector has increased by 30.46 per cent between the first quarter of 1977 and the first quarter of 1978, notwithstanding the fact that the house building cost index has increased by only 8.3 per cent and the Consumer Price Index by 8.4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and the Department of Industry, Commerce <Col N="2374" /> and Energy have thrown in the towel completely so far as controlling housing costs are concerned.  I am fortunate in that I have before me some information from the Department of the Environment which bears out what I am saying.  The price of imported timber decreased by 9.3 per cent between April 1977 and April 1978 but that decrease is not reflected in any way in the house building cost index. The Department of the Taoiseach did not know that the cost of timber had decreased by that amount and neither was the information available to the Department of the Environment.  The Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy are only being made aware of it now after I drew it to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>On 27 June I tabled a question to the Minister for the Environment asking whether there had been a decrease in the price of imported timber in the last 12 months and, if so, the percentage decrease and whether this decrease had been reflected in the house building cost index.  The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>The average price per tonne of imported coniferous sawn timber decreased from £149.50 to £135.53 or 9.3 per cent between April 1977 and April 1978 (the latest month for which figures are available).  The timber element in the house building cost index, which is related to the trade price of timber, has remained static over the period in question, as trade prices have not reflected the decrease referred to.  I am bringing this aspect of the matter to the attention of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy for any action he may consider necessary under the Prices Act.</P>
    <P>So much for the promise in the manifesto to monitor prices and to restructure the Prices Commission.  Some agencies and timber merchants in this country are being allowed to rob people who have been building houses for the last 12 months to the extent of almost £14 per tonne.  I want to know what the Minister has to say about that.  I want him to explain how the price of houses has jumped by 30.34 per cent between the first quarter of 1977 and the first quarter of 1978 while the housing building cost index has <Col N="2375" /> increased by only 8.3 per cent and the consumer price index by 8.4 per cent. Is it not obvious that the Government are standing idly by, in the immortal words of their leader, and allowing young married couples to be fleeced, right, left and centre while, at the same time, refusing to build local authority houses and telling people they should build their own homes.</P>
    <P>The next matter with which I want to deal is rates on private houses.  We know that the Government, in their manifesto, undertook to relieve private houses of rates.  We know that they did that.  But they also undertook in their manifesto to see to it that the rate relief which the landlords would enjoy would be passed on to the tenants.  That has not been done. Legislation was necessary to implement that promise.  The requisite Bill to pass on the rates relief to 300,000 tenants in this country was introduced in this House on 14 December 1977.  I need not repeat the history of that Bill.  There were a couple of hours debate on it in this House in the last month or so.  I pointed out that that Bill was absolutely defective, that it would not pass on rates relief to the tenants, that it would not afford tenants the machinery under which they might claim rates from the landlords who are enjoying several million pounds worth of relief as a result of that manifesto.  We are going on holidays now until 11 October and that Bill still has not had a Second Reading.  The Government made no serious attempt to have it passed through this House.  As chief spokesman for the Opposition I had the opportunity of speaking on it on two occasions only, for a total of about 40 minutes.  That Bill has no chance now of becoming law until well after next Christmas, over 12 months after the introduction of rates relief which is enjoyed by landlords but which has not been passed on to the tenants. Many of these tenants will have left their flats in Dublin or their private houses in the meantime and will never get this relief.  The Minister for Finance, to whom I mentioned the matter in the House the other day, <Col N="2376" /> seemed to think it was not necessary to have legislation to enable tenants obtain this relief.  Of course it is necessary. Tenants can claim if they are living in controlled dwellings, but approximately 5 per cent only of rented dwellings in this State are controlled. The remainder of tenants are left to their own devices.  That is a deplorable dereliction of duty on the part of the Minister for the Environment and the Government.  However, perhaps the Minister was given an impossible task.</P>
    <P>Again in regard to the same Department&mdash;the Department of the Environment&mdash;I might say the Road Traffic Act broke down eight months ago.  Since then there has been no satisfactory machinery for dealing with the offence of driving motor vehicles with too much alcohol in the blood. It took the Minister and his Department over eight months to get a Bill into this House to amend the Road Traffic Act and close the loopholes. Were it not for the co-operation given from this side of the House, again we would be going into recess with that Bill not enacted, with inadequate machinery still at the disposal of the Garda Síochána in regard to this very serious matter.  It is another example of the way the Government deal with the serious business entrusted to them.</P>
    <P>Another bit of dirty work the Minister for the Environment was asked to undertake was that in relation to the reduction of the agricultural grant. This Government came into power leading farmers to believe that all they had to do was elect Fianna Fáil to office and they would see no more taxation.  The Minister for the Environment, as the agent for the Minister for Finance, with the concurrence of the Minister for Agriculture, put a Bill through this House reducing the agricultural grant to £60 and increasing the rates of farmers by various percentages from 33 to over 80.  The Green Paper we are now discussing contains proposals to reduce that agricultural grant further and indeed abolish it altogether.  Do the back benchers of Fianna Fáil approve of that?</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister of State at <Col N="2377" /> the Department of Agriculture here for the last half hour dealing with agriculture.  Unless I missed it I do not think he made any reference to land structures or to the Land Commission. He concluded his contribution by saying that land was as precious to our people as is oil to the Arabs.  If so the farmers of this country are being thrown to the wolves.  On the Land Bond Bill debate the other day I ascertained that the activities of the Land Commission had come to a standstill; in the last year they acquired compulsorily only 15,000 acres of land compared with their activities in my best year in office when their intake was approximately 34,000 acres. Again, we are going into recess until 11 October next and the Land Commission have been instructed by the Department of Finance to cease serving Section 14 notices, to cease acquiring land.  The result of that is that small and large farms coming on the market are up for grabs at the mercy of speculators, professional people, non-farmers and very large farmers.  The farmer with perhaps 30 or 35 acres of land will have no chance of buying 10 or 15 acres of land, or 20 or 30 acres of land, if it comes on the market within striking distance of him.  That land is gobbled up by the big man, by the speculators, by people who are delighted to get into land now, people who heretofore could not be got to look across a ditch into a field at the time of the economic war or compulsory tillage.</P>
    <P>It is an absolute disgrace that the Land Commission are not being encouraged to serve section 40 notices to protect the small farmers until the Minister, who in Opposition waxed eloquent about chequebook farmers buying up the land and depriving the small farmers of it, is in a position to implement the report of the commission set up by the previous Government which has been in this Government's hands for nearly 12 months now and until such time as the Minister gets legislation through this House to enable the small farms to be brought up to a viable acreage and to protect them from the ravages I have mentioned. It is no use for the Minister of <Col N="2378" /> State at the Department of Agriculture to talk about the importance of keeping people on the land and the importance of the small farmers in the west if he, his Minister and their agent, the Land Commission, are not prepared to do anything to help and to protect them.</P>

      <P>: Shortly after I came in I heard Deputy Fitzpatrick refer to me as a nice fellow but a dismal failure in the Department of the Environment. I will not dispute with or worry about the term &ldquo;nice fellow&rdquo;.  What people think of me as a person is their business, but if I could be described as a dismal failure by the Deputy I should love to hear his description of my predecessor when what happened in this Department over the four-and-a-half years of the Coalition's term of office as a result of the policies my predecessor was obliged to pursue is compared with what happened during the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>When I took over the Department of the Environment approvals for new house grants for the first six months of 1977 totalled 2,150.  The number of grant applications for the new £1,000 grant reached 14,000 during the past 12 months, 9,000 of which have already been approved.  Surely this could hardly be described as a dismal failure.  Before I took over this Department sewerage schemes and road works were grinding to a halt because of lack of money.  Since then there has been a drastic change for the better. The allocation for sewerage schemes this year has increased by £10 million and the allocation for roadworks has increased by nearly 40 per cent.  Is this to be described as a dismal failure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We gave undertakings in the manifesto. My Department have fulfilled their commitments, and will again where the policies of the Green Paper are concerned.  We said we would do away with domestic rates and on the day after I was appointed we did this by way of a motion affecting 880,000 ratepayers.  According to Deputy Fitzpatrick this is a dismal failure.  We also said that we would remove road tax on cars of 16 horsepower and less. <Col N="2379" /> We did this on 16 April, the day after the Government was appointed, benefiting the vast majority of motorists. We increased the new house grant from £325 to £1,000 and removed the income limit of £2,350 that was in existence from 1 January 1976.  The popularity of this decision is evidenced in the number of applications for the £1,000 grant.  We increased from £200 to £600 the reconstruction or improvement grants for people who wished to improve their homes and we increased the water and sewerage grants.  Of course, all this is a dismal failure and we should not have done it, according to Deputy Fitzpatrick.  There are other instances of where we introduced necessary improvements.  For example, in relation to houses for old people there are improved grants and loan facilities available for people who supply or build these houses.  So far as my Department are concerned, there is nothing that we said we would do in the manifesto that we have not done.  I have fulfilled my part of the manifesto; but, according to Deputy Fitzpatrick, I am a dismal failure.</P>
    <P>This year it is estimated that my Department and the local authorities will spend a total of £560 million. More than £400 million of this will come from central funds and the remainder will come from rates which are still outstanding and from other sources of income available to local authorities.  The massive injection of funds into the local authority sector this year gives an indication of the contribution this sector can make to our national economic and social advancement. For the man in the street this sector provides vital services without which ordinary life would be seriously disrupted.  In these days of concern about employment it should not be overlooked that local authorities are major employers.  The Department of the Environment have been deeply involved in the implementation of many of the policies of the Government outlined in the manifesto, again in the White Paper last January and more recently in the Green Paper.  In important respects realisation of the Government's aim of economic and social progress has hinged on the <Col N="2380" /> efforts of the local authorities under my guidance as Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Fitzpatrick's criticism of the renaming of this Department, the decision to have a Department of the Environment is surely an indication of the Government's determination that good quality physical surroundings should be part and parcel of plans for improving our living standards.  The Government's programme for the environment is progressive. The traditional programmes in housing, the provision of roads, sanitary services and local amenities are the means by which the physical environment is shaped by local government. The physical planning system is even more important in ensuring that the necessary environmental considerations are taken into account in the planning and carrying out of the various forms of development.  Good progress is being maintained with the arrangements necessary for the implementation of the Water Pollution Act. A full account of the existing arrangements for pollution control generally and how they work is now available in published form in the Report on Pollution Control, which was prepared by the inter-departmental environment committee.  The report serves to underline the range and complexity of pollution-type problems nowadays and the variety of arrangements which have already developed to meet them. There is a general conclusion in the report that the arrangements generally are satisfactory but that there is still room for improvement.  Particular problems, which are identified in the report, are now being examined in the various Departments concerned with these problems.</P>
    <P>The process of strengthening the arrangements for the protection of the environment will be continued.  The Government appreciate that the quality of development and of the physical surroundings generally have become more important in the eyes of people as part of what goes to make up the quality of life and have decided that it should figure more prominently in the area of public policy and should receive still more attention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2381" /> One of the most important tasks which I have to undertake, as first Minister for the Environment, is to prepare, in consultation with other Ministers, proposals for the national policy for the physical environment.  I have also to arrange for an assessment to be made of the state of the environment and for reports to be published from time to time.  To assist me in these and other related functions the Government decided that an environment council should be set up as an advisory body.  I see this body as a forum in which the different strands of interest bearing on the environment will have a chance to discuss and assess a range of topics and problems of environmental concern and, hopefully, come up with comments and advice which will help me to carry out the general environmental role which I have been assigned.  I am happy to say that arrangements for the setting up of the council have now been completed and the inaugural meeting of this council will take place at 3 o'clock tomorrow.</P>

      <P>: With regard to the building and construction industry the Government have consistently pinpointed the level of unemployment as a real threat to the future of the country.  The Green Paper says:</P>
      <P>Primary emphasis must be placed on action to increase employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have done more than express concern with unemployment in the last 12 months.  They have matched their words with action.  Much of the increased employment which will flow from the initiatives of the Government will come in the building and construction industry, for which I have overall responsibility.  I do not intend to dwell on the lean times which the industry went through since 1973.  It should be enough to say that as a result of the positive action taken by the Government since July 1977, the performance of the industry in that year and the prospects in the medium-term have improved enormously.  Anyone <Col N="2382" /> connected with the industry will agree on this.</P>
    <P>This year looks like a record year for the construction industry.  This follows on the Government's provisions for it in the 1978 public capital programme which amounted in all to £469 million, an increase of £98 million or 26 per cent on last year's expenditure which, I suppose, is a further failure on my part.  Taken with estimated current public expenditure of £104 million the total public investment in building and construction at £573 million represents over 61 per cent of the expected output of £936 million for the industry in 1978.  This expected output would give a growth rate of about 7.6 per cent over 1977.</P>
    <P>I have, as Minister for the Environment, direct responsibility for certain sectors of the industry, such as housing, road works, public water supply and sewerage schemes and environmental services.  The public capital programme allocation for those areas amounts to £201 million and has been increased by an enormous 37 per cent over the January 1977 allocation, another failure I presume. Indications this year so far support the considerable improvement expected in the industry.  Cement sales, which are recognised as a good general indicator of trends in the industry, have during the period 1 January 1978 to 31 May 1978 shown an increase of 18.3 per cent, compared with the corresponding period in 1977.  The year on year increase in sales was 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>With regard to the jobs front published figures for employment support the improving trend.  The index of employees in the private sector of the industry, which is published by the Central Statistics Office, covers firms with five or more people employed, This showed an increase of 7.9 per cent on average for the first five months of this year over the similar period in 1977.  The latest monthly unemployment figure, which is March 1978, of 24,040 is 1,525 down on the figure for March 1977.  The house building sector, which is one of the major sectors of the industry, accounting for almost <Col N="2383" /> 40 per cent of the total output in the industry, has also shown improvement in the last 12 months.  Up to the end of May this year 1,257 more dwellings have been completed when compared with the corresponding period of 1977. All the signs are very encouraging and I am confident that this trend will continue throughout the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>Housing is by far the largest single contributor to output in employment in the building and construction industry. There have been many important developments in the housing area, not least of which have been a significant overhaul of the levels of grants available from my Department and the raising of loan and income limits for house purchase loans from local authorities.  I do not propose to outline upward revisions in the range of assistances for housing made available by the Government.  The Deputies will be fully aware of their extent from a study of my speech when I introduced my Estimate on 9 March last.</P>
    <P>As far as housing generally is concerned I am confident that 1978 will be a good year.  There is a high level of investment from the public capital programme amounting to £140.58 million, an increase of almost 42 per cent on the provisional outturn for 1977.  In fact, this year's public capital programme allocation for housing is by far the highest to date and reflects the importance which the Government attach to housing.  Some of the major figures in the 1978 allocation are the £39 million made available for house purchase and reconstruction loans compared with last year's outturn of £17.66 million and £17 million for housing grants from my Department this year compared to an outturn of £4.6 million in 1977.  This is something which Deputy Fitzpatrick has forgotten. If one compares local authority housing at £80.77 million with the 1972-73 figure, when it was £28.78 million this shows some increase over that period.  There were increases in between which I will refer to.  Those figures reflect the Government's determination to maintain a high level of output in housing.  The <Col N="2384" /> current projections are that last year's figure of 24,548 house completions will be exceeded substantially and that 1978 completions should reach 26,500.</P>
    <P>As regards the private housing sector, by 6 July the scheme of new house grants will be in operation for one year and I have already given the number of applications and said that to date 9,000 grants have been approved.  The pace of payments of the grants has increased as more and more houses qualifying for this grant are being completed and occupied. There were 847 grants paid in the month of May.  Similarly demand for improvement grants has been quite unprecedented.  Applications so far this year have been more than double what they were in the same period last year.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of correcting some of the misapprehensions of Deputies opposite about the local authority housing programme. The Government do not intend to run down or drastically curtail the programme.  Indeed, they have strengthened their commitment to meeting the genuine housing need of families, disabled and elderly persons, and other categories who cannot provide suitable accommodation for themselves, by ensuring that adequate incentives are available to draw other categories off the waiting list of housing authorities.</P>
    <P>The public capital programme capital allocation of £80.77 million for 1978 represented an increase of 9 per cent over 1977.  That amount is sufficient to maintain activity on the programme this year at about the same general level as in 1977.  Nearly 700 more dwellings were under construction at the beginning of this year than at the start of 1977.  Employment on the programme in the first quarter was well up on last year in spite of the sizeable &mdash;but hopefully temporary&mdash;fall in completions and new starts.  Nevertheless, the low completions and starts are causes of concern.  I shall look to housing authorities and the NBA to play their part in improving the situation.  We will have a better idea of what is happening when we get the returns at the end of this quarter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2385" /> There has been agitation among some Deputies opposite about the White Paper references to the need for a critical appraisal of the estimated cost of local authority housing schemes.  The references to the review of the programme and its costs, and to the reassessment of housing needs and local authority rent policies, are simply sound common sense.  They are good housekeeping on the part of the Government, who in the last analysis are answerable to the general body of taxpayers on whom the financial burden of the programme lies so heavily. The cost of providing a typical local authority house and the public burden of subsidising loan and other charges over a long period of years are now such that there is a serious obligation on everybody responsible for the programme to ensure that these outlays are incurred only where a local authority house represents the only practical way to provide for the genuine housing need of a family or person.  The Green Paper has spelt out the Government's thinking and it is now open to public comment and debate.  It would be helpful if Deputies would recognise the fact that capital costs taken in conjunction with the level of the programme in recent years and existing arrangements for subsidisation and financing of on-going expenditure on maintenance and management, have reached a level which places an enormous burden on the community.</P>
    <P>However, I want to make it clear that, while the Government regard it as a duty to the general body of taxpayers to avoid unjustifiable expenditure from public funds, it is accepted by the Government that present standards of construction and accommodation should not be reduced.  The sensible alternative course is to accept that we cannot afford to provide local authority dwellings for comparatively well-off families but that we should maintain a reasonable level of programme with special measures to ensure that the houses go to the really needy, including the small families, elderly and disabled persons.</P>
    <P>As to central city redevelopment it seems that some Deputies opposite, <Col N="2386" /> whose own special interest in the redevelopment programme is acknowledged, regard it as outrageous for us to even question whether or not the tax paying community should have to subsidise the rehousing of one family for years and years at a cost of certainly up to £60 a week in some cases. They have raised time and again the red herring of comparing central city redevelopment costs and the costs of perimeter building.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>: We know that some public services are already in existence in central city areas which have to be provided in new areas.  We also know, however, that so many new houses are required that the bulk of them must be provided in perimeter areas, which must accordingly get the services anyway. The additional cost of providing in the perimeter the extra margin in services for the relatively few families which could be catered for otherwise in central city areas would be relatively insignificant.  I would suggest therefore that Deputies opposite might adopt a more honest and more responsible approach to this aspect of the public housing programme, acknowledge that central city rehousing costs are abnormally high, and accept that they are supportable only when they are incurred as part of a general attack on central city problems.  It is not true that more housing in the inner city area would solve the problems of the inner city.  There are many other problems involved in the inner city situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to road safety, it is now compulsory to fit cars with seat belts. However, we estimate that seat belts are worn by only 10 per cent of drivers. In many countries the wearing of seat belts is compulsory.  It it compulsory in Austria, Australia, Finland, Norway, New Zealand, South Africa and many other countries and in all the countries of the EEC with the exception of ourselves, Britain and Italy.  It has been well established that the wearing of seat belts has a tremendous effect in cutting down the number of <Col N="2387" /> fatal accidents and indeed injuries on the roads.  There can be genuine and valid objections to the wearing of seat belts by certain categories, for instance pregnant women and invalids.  Children cannot be expected to wear seat belts, but children should be kept at the back of the car.  It is my intention to issue a formal public statement very shortly which will invite the views of the public on my proposal to make regulations under the Road Traffic Act which would require seat belts to be worn by drivers and front-seat passengers in cars and light goods vehicles, subject to any necessary exemptions from these requirements for the categories I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Despite the criticism of Deputy Fitzpatrick, sanitary services have been greatly increased in the last 12 months. Apart from creating immediate employment, there is no doubt that these services will lead to further development in housing and industry.  In order to ensure a high level of activity in regard to this programme, I intend to approve the commencement of a considerable number of priority water and sewerage schemes in order to ensure that these services will be available in the coming year.</P>
    <P>In regard to house prices, I appreciate that it has been a boom year for selling houses.  The average price of lower cost houses has not increased as much as the average price of more expensive houses.  One way to attack this problem is to make serviced sites available.  The provision of serviced sites at cost price to the private sector or to anyone who wants to build a house will be a great help in reducing or regulating the price of houses.  The cost of sites in the Dublin area of housing in the private sector has increased tremendously.  When the price of these sites is compared with the average increase it gives an inflated effect.  The price of houses in rural areas has not been greatly increased in the past 12 months.  Despite Deputy Fitzpatrick's claim that I am a dismal failure, the record of my Department is open to judgment and I am sure he will find few people to agree with him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: In responding directly to the previous speech, I should welcome the Minister's proposed regulations in relation to the wearing of seat belts.  This is a positive move.  One could wish for more to welcome in the Government's programme than that, but it is a positive gain and it would be ungenerous of me not to say so. The Minister's party are fond of extracting statements of intent from other people.  The irony in the events of the last few months is that the one statement of intent which they are all waiting for on the far side of the House has not been made, that is, the Taoiseach's own statement of intent.  If that came out we might have a different political and economic situation.</P>
      <P>To comment briefly on what the Minister has said, it is true that the cost of sites in the private sector in Dublin is astronomical.  There was a curious gap in what he said in that, while he acknowledged the problem, he did not give any indication of his proposed method of solving it, except by providing serviced sites for the private sector.  The problem of site costs in high density areas will never be solved unless a firm approach is taken to the control of the price of building land.  The previous Government and the Government before them had the benefit of the experience of the Kenny Report.  Much of the experience and wisdom of that report still remains and needs to be implemented.  Unless that step is taken, the problem of the cost of sites will remain indefinitely with us and will probably expand into areas where it is not now common.</P>
      <P>At about a quarter to seven last Wednesday evening the guillotine fell for the second time in two days on the Finance Bill on the ground that the Government needed to terminate discussion on that piece of legislation. The irony of that event could be seen within 24 hours of the guillotine falling when at approximately twenty-five minutes to five on the following day this House ran out of business.  It must be unprecedented in the annals of this House that, within less than 24 hours of a guillotine motion being applied, the business before the House expired and the Government had nothing to replace it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2389" /> It is a useful illustration of what has been happening during the year, especially during the past few months. What we have been seeing during this time, especially in the last few days, is a Government being saved by the bell from having to face the fact that the Order Paper with which we were presented today when we came into the House is a legislative desert.  There is nothing of major significance on the Order Paper with the possible exception of local authority legislation to deal with rates on flats, and there is no sign of anything substantial to follow. The legislative record of the Government, if you exclude Bills that were published or about to be published when they came into office, has been appalling.  One could be happier if one could say that they spent all this time arguing about their White and Green Papers.  But these documents lead one to suspect that all the time spent in arguing inside the Cabinet might have been better spent producing necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>I want to deal in broad terms with the Government's Green Paper which was published for this debate and which has evoked a distinctly cool response all round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy is not the only person to be stunned by it.  When I compare it with other published documents, I find it is one of the most regressive documents that has ever been published by a government.  It can be argued that it is more regressive than the White Paper which preceded it.  It can even be argued that it is more regressive than the Third Programme for Economic Expansion which was produced a long time ago by a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the areas in which it is most regressive is in its attitude to the public sector.  There seems to be a sort of assumption running through the Green Paper that the public sector is by definition a non-productive sector; that jobs can be maintained there but need not and perhaps cannot be created. There is almost the assumption that <Col N="2390" /> jobs created in the public sector are always a cost and never a gain.  It must be stated firmly from this side of the House that this view of the public sector is unrealistic, unnecessary and not founded on fact.  We do not see the public sector as the sector in which the only jobs that are provided are jobs digging holes and filling them in again. We see the public sector as an area in which public policy can be directed towards creating service and industrial jobs in the same way and with much the same profitability criteria as in the private sector.</P>
    <P>It is by no means impossible to create profitable jobs in the public sector, but one reason why the public sector has such a bad name on the employment scene over the years is that it has tended to be used by successive Governments as a sort of economic dustbin&mdash;anything private enterprise cannot make a go of, let public enterprise look after it.  The public transport system is the classic example.  The result of this has been that, except in a number of areas where there are happy exceptions, the assumption has grown that public sector enterprise is not good and that we have to carry it subject to whatever amount of political effort can be put into the organisation and adjusting of the level of subsidy.  This is the most fundamental fault of the Green Paper. It says more or less: &ldquo;We have done our bit in direct job creation or will have done it in the very near future: after that, it is for somebody else to pick up the torch and carry it on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is where another problem of the Green Paper comes in.  It seriously underestimates even the scale of the problem of job creation confronting us.  It is a massive problem.  Not long ago in answer to a Parliamentary Question I put down to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy we were told that each of the 800 permanent jobs that are being created over a period of years at the Alcan plant in Shannon is going to cost £350,000 in terms of direct capital investment. Not all of this is State money; some is private money from the consortium concerned.  But £350,000 for a job is a staggering <Col N="2391" /> figure.  It can be argued that this is unusual, but I very much fear this sort of figure will become more usual rather than less as companies go more for profitability, more for technology and less for job creation.  The £350,000 figure is a multiple of the highest figure that the Industrial Development Authority have ever used as a yardstick for an adequate cost of direct job creation.  The danger is that the IDA figure will float upwards rather than that the Alcan figure will float down.</P>
    <P>This morning we had the publication of a report by the Economic and Social Research Institute which, although drafted before the Green Paper would, I gather, come to much the same conclusion if it were published afterwards.  I regret that I have not the actual document but there are a couple of paragraphs from today's <i>Irish Times</i> to which the House should pay attention.  It says:</P>
    <P>On the overall employment front, the review is almost universally pessimistic.  This year, as Table 2 shows, 17,000 new jobs will be created in the year to last April compared with the previous year. However, total employment, at 1,058,000 will still be below the 1974 peak of 1,066,000, and in coming years, agricultural employment is expected to fall at a rate of 2.5 per cent a year so that the total level of farm employment by 1985 will only be 188,000, a reduction of 48,000 on the 1976 level.</P>
    <P>Another part of the article points out that one section of the review by Richard Vaughan reviews historical trends in profits in Ireland and suggests that, contrary to popular belief, excessive profit increases might militate against job creation.</P>
    <P>These are the figures as estimated by ESRI and I suggest they are more realistic than the Green Paper figures. The Green Paper skates over the difficulties involved in job creation and leaves unanswered several vital questions. For example, if it is true, as the Green Paper suggests, that the boost which is being given to the economy this year will have the effect of creating more jobs in industry and in the <Col N="2392" /> public sector, what will happen next year and the year after in relation to jobs?  If we are to read the Green Paper again what will happen next year and the year after will be deflation. Either employment will have to be be reduced or taxation will have to be increased.  This may ultimately have the same effect of reducing the growth in employment generally.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the Government, hung up with their manifesto, had to introduce this kind of budget this year without any rational survey of the needs of the economy.  What was needed was caution and a certain amount of holding in reserve for the kind of boost that might be necessary if employment and the economy needed it later, in two or three years. The danger now is not just that the Government will have found themselves hung up by their own manifesto but that the economy and the employment market will find themselves the ultimate sufferers.  For example, the Government have on several occasions made it clear that they do not want the burden of taxation increased beyond certain levels for the population as a whole.  If they are going to take taxation as a proportion of the gross national product something else will have to give and it can only be jobs.</P>
    <P>We have in the Green Paper the emergence if not the development of a concept of work sharing.  It is extremely vague and will have to be fleshed out in much more detail.  I suspect that if and when the detail appears it will be a much less attractive proposition than it is now, and I do not say that it is attractive now, because it is quite justifiable to read into the Green Paper on work sharing the notion that what is really involved is a hidden way of soaking up unemployment at the expense of the community as a whole in ways which may only lead to the further loss of jobs in one area.  There is no point in robbing Peter to pay Paul: if you are going to create jobs here at the cost of losing them there the ultimate effect is nil.</P>
    <P>I return to the role of the public and the private sectors as seen in the Green Paper.  The Green Paper effectively relies on fiscal stimulus <Col N="2393" /> rather than on public investment in job creation.  The point about public investment in profitable job creation is that with public investment you have options; without it you can only go down on your knees and say your economic prayers.  There is a lot economic &ldquo;piousness&rdquo; in this document.  It is all summed up in a persuasive theme of the sections of the document dealing with employment in general and with work sharing in particular, that what is really wrong here is people's attitude.  If we change people's attitude to work, remuneration and so on&mdash;so the argument goes &mdash;we shall have a different country and have work enough for everybody. On page 71 of the Green Paper it is stated fairly categorically that those who have employment already must be prepared to make the financial contributions and provide the opportunities of work for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Even this analysis is open to argument. It could be argued that if those who are in employment are going to make sacrifices what will ultimately benefit will be the Government's level of borrowing and not the level of job creation.  Even if we were to accept that this sentence can stand on its own we are implying that it is public attitudes that are the real key to economic and employment growth.  While Members on these benches do not discount the importance of attitudes, we believe that economic analysis is the fundamental tool for deciding what should or what should not be done with the economy.  If we base our proposals and our plans on economic analysis and not on a generalised moral appeal, we will find that this analysis will fit the hair-shirt&mdash;if there is to be a hair-shirt &mdash;to different shoulders from the ones for which Fianna Fáil have fashioned it.</P>
    <P>I would even like to take on the Government on the question of attitudes. There is no more potent force in the formulation of attitudes than the Government themselves.  We now have the spectacle of a Government who abolished car tax and wealth tax, who failed to increase children's allowances and who did their best in many instances to appeal to the most <Col N="2394" /> selfish side of human nature, coming back to the House and going back to the country with the Green Paper that looks for restraint and for the hair-shirt. It has all the jangle and the blare of a Salvation Army band.  It is extraordinary to see the Government preaching against excess with all the zeal of a man recently reformed from some vice and who has now become puritanical in his obsession about it and in his opposition to it.  If the Government do not succeed in this area it will largely be because they have set such an extraordinary headline themselves. When I was canvassing in the general election I visited quite a few comfortable households.  The owners met me at the door and on hearing I was from the Labour Party asked, &ldquo;What are you going to do for me?&rdquo; I was driven to reply on many such occasions, &ldquo;You seem to have done very well for yourself.  What about doing something for somebody else?&rdquo; The Government are now attempting to preach this gospel, but on the evidence of their performance in the past year it is difficult to see how they can claim any credibility for it.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with education, as it features in the Government's policy to date and also in the Green Paper.  What has happened in education since the general election has been much less significant than the Government or the Minister for Education would like us to believe.  Higher education grants and the eligibility limits have been increased but not by the amount by which people were led to believe they would be increased. Prior to the general election the word went out from Fianna Fáil that when the grants would be increased the cost of living would be used as a guide. Not surprisingly, this very important qualification did not find a place in the manifesto but still the message went out.  Although the levels have been increased they are still way below the limits to which they should have been raised if the Government had adopted the cost of living as a guide.  In real terms they are still below the levels at which they were introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government ten years ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2395" /> The Minister for Education introduced an Estimate in this House which would dazzle one with the number of noughts at the end of it.  On 4 June 1978 he went on the radio to claim: &ldquo;I have a full 20 per cent increase and increases down the line in all areas.&rdquo;  Of course the Minister has a 20 per cent increase in global terms but when you strip out of that increase &mdash;as you must&mdash;the recurring costs for inevitable expenditure on teachers' salaries given existing pupil-teacher ratios and inflation, you will find that the 20 per cent dwindles to something almost like a tenth of that figure.  Even within the increases, which are mostly related to £5 million that he seems to have got from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development for direct job creation, the sector that is most in need&mdash;the primary sector&mdash; has done less well proportionately than the post-primary sector.  The proportion of extra points to primary schools &mdash;many of which were in the pipeline before the Minister ever set foot in his office&mdash;is still lower than the proportion going to post-primary schools. That is not the scale of priorities that this party think should be adopted and it is one we would want to see corrected. In fact, I would urge the Minister to keep the Minister for Economic Planning and Development out of his briar patch.  In September last year at a meeting in my constituency at which I was present the Minister for Economic Planning and Development actually went on record as promising a structural reform in the Department of Education which the Minister for Education told me a month later, in answer to a parliamentary question, he had no intention of carrying out.  That may be slightly misrepresenting the Minister's attitude at that time but certainly he seemed to be unaware of the commitment given in relation to his Department by another Minister.</P>
    <P>There has been a tiny effective increase in the Education Vote this year. There have been increases in some areas within that Vote but they have been got at the expense of other areas. Of 20 grants-in-aid paid by the Department <Col N="2396" /> 13 either have been reduced or have been kept at the same level as last year.  That means an effective cut of 7 per cent.  These are the kind of figures that the Minister cannot escape with a generalised smokescreen about a 20 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>In relation to primary education needs, I was interested to note that the Minister in this House refused to give a commitment that the maximum class size in primary schools would be down to 40 by the time the Government left office.  However, on 4 June 1978 he went on radio to say that they hoped to have the figure down to a maximum 40 by the time they face the people again in the next general election.  We want to know if that represents a commitment.  I can promise the Government and the Minister that whether or not it represents a commitment&mdash;and it looks more like an attempt to weasel out of one&mdash;the electorate will be left under no illusions about it when the time comes.</P>
    <P>In relation to comments on education in the Green Paper, the prognosis is not cheerful.  Page 82 contains the statement that &ldquo;reduced overall spending on education cannot realistically be expected&rdquo;.  Further on the Green Paper states, &ldquo;the Government would be reluctant to seek economies in this area&rdquo;.  If I were the Minister for Education I would be shivering in my boots at the qualified nature of the support given here to investment in education.  There is no commitment at all to improving the level of the educational service.  There is only a very milk and water expression of the hope that things will not get worse.  Even at that there is some conflict on the same page in regard to higher education.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper says a loan scheme might be an appropriate form of finance and, in his radio interview, the Minister said: &ldquo;I am not enamoured of the idea of loans.&rdquo;  If the Green Paper thinks loans might be a good idea, and the Minister is not enamoured of them, where does that leave the Minister?  Suggestions have been made on this side of the House that industry might contribute to financing higher education.  There is in <Col N="2397" /> one of the Finance Acts a provision which allows industry to deduct from its profits for tax purposes the amount set aside for educational research and development.  Virtually no industry has taken advantage of that concession and it is our contention that the way to make industry contribute to financing education is through taxation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would urge the Government, and especially the Minister for Education, to take a fresh look at the whole system and to accept the challenge&mdash;it is a big challenge&mdash;of making education a personal service more directly available and responsive to the needs of local communities by setting up a local education authority structure which would radically change the administration and, perhaps, also the politics of education.  This will involve the Minister in challenging some of the powerful interests in education. If he is not prepared to challenge them, and there is very little evidence to date that he is seriously prepared to challenge any of the important educational interests in the interests of children as a whole, we will be left to stumble on with an educational system and administration which is more and more centralised in terms of administration and more and more powerless in terms of what that administration can actually do.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper represents to the Minister for Education one of the most formidable perils he has ever encountered so far in his political life. Things have come to a pretty pass, indeed, when we can see the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Education depicted as the three lone socialists in the Fianna Fáil Cabinet.  The economic policy the Government are pursuing, with its inevitable implications for social policy, is not one with which the Minister for Education can be happy.  If I were him I would regard the contents of the Green Paper in relation to education as something very far short of the guarantee that is needed.  The Minister for Education has public responsibility to be accountable for the public money that goes into the educational system. <Col N="2398" /> He is not doing that.  He is simply wringing his hands when things go wrong.  He also has a public responsibility to make that system more accountable than it is, more democratic than it is, and more responsive to the real needs of the people.  I doubt if this will be done in the lifetime of the present Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>: I listened with great satisfaction to the opening speech of the Taoiseach yesterday.  It clearly showed the tremendous achievement of the Taoiseach and his Government in a very short space of time.  His hard-working team of Ministers have in a very short time brought the country back from near bankruptcy to economic growth and development.  I pay special tribute to all our Ministers for their hard work and dedication. Pondering on the tremendous achievements in the last 12 months one can confidently say that over the next three or four years economic growth and development will surpass anything that took place even under former Fianna Fáil administrations.</P>
      <P>In June 1977 Fianna Fáil inherited a broken country.  Financially and economically it was on the verge of bankruptcy.  That is why the people entrusted Fianna Fáil once more with the task of getting the country moving again.  Inflation and prices were out of control.  We were faced with a difficult task, the task of righting all the wrongs of four-and-a-half years of mismanagement.  We have brought inflation down now to 6.2 per cent. Reducing inflation was one of the priorities in our manifesto.  During the election campaign people actually asked me if the country were finished and if there were any hope for the country.  I believed that, like a business running down and going into bankruptcy, new management would get the country back on its feet again.  I was right in that belief and my confidence has proved correct.  The country is moving and things are better than they were in the four-and-a-half years before we resumed office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £820 million has been pumped into the economy.  The money will go into productive purposes, into the provision of essential services, such <Col N="2399" /> as water, sanitation and roads.  In my constituency of Roscommon-Leitrim we were getting very small subventions for major schemes and all the schemes we hoped to implement were held up. It is only since last June these schemes have been given the go ahead and the necessary finances made available to allow work to proceed.  That is because we have been given a major injection of capital.  It was worth while borrowing this money to provide benefits for our people.  The money is being spent all over the country.</P>
    <P>One of the major achievements of this Fianna Fáil Government has been in the reduction of unemployment. While the figures on the live register may not be absolutely satisfactory they are an indication of the way things are going.  The figures indicate that the level of unemployment has dropped by 10,000 from June 1977 to 99,490 on 16 June 1978.  The figure has fallen and I hope the next published figures which are due out shortly will show a still bigger drop.  Unemployment was rampant and we made the provision of employment a priority in our manifesto, particularly employment for school leavers.  This was a major issue in the campaign.  Constituents asked me could we provide employment and I believed that, if returned to office, the Coalition Government would continue their disastrous policies, policies which would lead to still further reductions in employment and further increases in unemployment.  Fianna Fáil were given a major task but we accepted it, and now we have achieved practically all our objectives as set out in the magnificent manifesto.</P>
    <P>We are now going on to stage two of our development.  Stage two is the launching of our Green Paper entitled Development For Full Employment. The proposal contained in it to create full employment is unprecedented in this or any other State.  We have launched a campaign which we do not need to do.  If any other Government were in office they would not commit themselves to this programme.  They would carry on keeping at a certain level.  Fianna Fáil, as a radical party who are prepared to take steps to solve <Col N="2400" /> the problems of this country, are prepared to launch this Green Paper and to work with the social partners to achieve full employment.  In the fifties and sixties we cut down emigration from this island, and when we left office in 1973 emigration had practically ceased.</P>
    <P>Our next task is to create full employment for the people here at home. It is my ambition to see people coming back from foreign shores to their native land to work here.  In my own area in the last year I have noticed a number of families who have returned because of the improvement in the economic climate.  Many of these families have found work in their own areas here and have been housed as well.  I am delighted at this.  It is a step in the right direction.  In the years ahead when we create a situation of full employment for our people at home we will welcome more people returning from foreign shores.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have shown that they are more radical than the Labour Party.  They do not compare at all with the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>: Our opponents are hoping that we cannot achieve our projected target.  They are not progressive in their approach and they are very negative in the comments they have been making since the Green Paper was launched.  They have no alternative programme or policy. When the Coalition were in power they produced a Green Paper of their <Col N="2401" /> own in 1976.  That Green Paper was entitled Economic and Social Development 1976-1980, and it is interesting to read now in the context of the present-day situation and of the election campaign of last year.  I emphasise that it is the 1976 Green Paper I am referring to.  Some of the titles in that paper are most unfortunate.  The most notable is the somewhat unfortunate heading of one of the paragraphs in that paper, which in the final analysis was the comment of the electorate at large on the performance of the Coalition and their plans for the future on page 26, &ldquo;An unacceptable outlook&rdquo;.  Certainly a continuation of the Coalition policies and management was unacceptable to the voters of 1977.  I venture to say that now, a year later, we have almost a re-run of the election campaign of 1977 with the launching of this Green Paper.  In drafting the 1976 document it was clear that at that stage the then Government had decided that they were in the grip of forces outside their control and concluded that, and I quote from page 26:</P>
      <P>... it must be realised and accepted by all that there is no real possibility of the economy continuing to 1980 on the lines on which it has developed since 1960.  The more likely outlook would be of some transient growth for a short period, ending well before 1980, followed by a period of severe economic restrictions and very serious financial difficulties, when there would be little or no growth...</P>
      <P>This outlook concludes that, given the very best efforts, the total of unemployed would drop to a mere 80,000 by 1980.  I would hope that it will have dropped to this level by late 1978-79. Indeed we will have beaten many of the Coalition's projections at that stage. Here is another quotation from that Green Paper, page 25:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... there would have to be a real decline in current expenditure... which a failure to achieve an average growth rate would force upon the community, would exert a serious deflationary impact upon the economy and make impossible the <Col N="2402" /> attainment even of the 2% growth rate.</P>
    <P>We now have 5 per cent growth and are continuing on that level and possibly even increasing that growth to 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>Our Green Paper concerns itself with a very desirable package of policies designed to achieve jobs for all by 1983.  There is no thought here of the harshness of the economic climate.  Instead the Government outline a scheme whereby the benefits of higher growth can be channelled into higher employment, not at the expense of lowering the standard of living of those already in employment.  The Government are asking for an acceptance of a lower rate of improvement in standards of living than would otherwise be the case given the high level of growth which we are now projecting.  The Taoiseach said in opening this debate that those who could not see or accept that a solution to unemployment was possible were in effect at a stroke writing off as worthless the career or prospects of a vibrant new generation of the Irish people.  Fianna Fáil's policy is to seize the opportunity which this new generation presents us to build a society which we can all be proud of.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper which we have launched is an approach, an outline, a plan, for the future.  It is vital that we have these plans to work with.  Our aim is to achieve the programme which we have outlined.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the programme deserve comment.  In relation to the level of housing and to finance for housing, the private, banking and insurance institutions are not playing their part in the provision of finance for private housing.  In 1977 only £6 million was loaned by the insurance companies.  The Irish Life Assurance Company, which is 90 per cent Government owned, in that period did not give one penny to finance house-building in this country.  Even this company are now looking for a licence to open their own building society.  I feel that their past achievement does not merit them being given this mandate.  Some years ago I advocated, as I still do, <Col N="2403" /> that the local authorities under the control of the Minister for the Environment should be allowed to raise from the public directly funds for the provision of houses for our people. In England most of the local authorities are in a position to raise finance directly from the public.  The local authorities with the technical knowledge of their engineering staff and the accommodation they have in most of the towns are in a position not only to provide the local authority loans which are presently available, but also to provide loans for people who are not eligible for the local authority loans as they are.  This would be in a sense a national building society under the direct management of the Government. Prior to my election to Dáil Éireann and to Roscommon County Council I advocated that the Government should set up their own building societies, not taking over, amalgamating or monopolising the present building societies but in direct competition if necessary with them.</P>
    <P>The situation where the interest rates are arranged beforehand among these groups is unsatisfactory.  The lack of competition is not helpful to people seeking loans to build their houses.  The banking institutions are not playing their part.  They are more concerned about making profit.  I would call the massive profits being made by the major banking groups as the unacceptable face of capitalism. Every time interest rates increase the banks make more profit.  There must be competition when people are seeking loans.</P>
    <P>A chairman of one of the banks said recently that there must be an adequate level of profit in the private sector.  The bank profits are more than adequate and are totally unacceptable. They are a bad example to other private companies.  The Government should take a serious look at this situation and at the amount of dividends being paid to shareholders at home and abroad.</P>

      <P>: The Government should ensure that the banks provide more money for private housing and give more risk money to young people who wish to build their own houses. The banks are cashing in on this situation by providing bridging finance at high interest rates.  This is an unacceptable position.  They should provide bridging finance at the minimum rate because of the security of the loan involved.  The banks will have to be brought to task when it comes to providing funds because they are the major lending finance institutions.</P>
      <P>I recommend that the ACC be given a greater mandate to provide a banking service.  The farming community should be in a position to deal directly with the ACC and obtain cheque book and other facilities.  The Post Office should be allowed to raise more money.  I do not think the Post Office Savings Bank has been exploited to the fullest extent.  This is an area where the Government could obtain more money for productive purposes. The Post Office Savings Bank should be made more attractive and should be able to provide cheque book and other facilities.  The Post Office should be encouraged to introduce the Giro system.  In England the post office has made enormous profits for the State by providing this service.  The Government should have a serious look at this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Fianna Fáil came into office County Roscommon have been successful in acquiring funds for drainage schemes.  We got £2 million for sewerage and water schemes in 1977. This money has allowed major water schemes, such as the South Roscommon regional water scheme, to proceed. That scheme which is costing <Col N="2405" /> nearly £800,000 is providing water for an area which has been neglected since the foundation of the State.  This injection of funds to provide water will allow the farming community to expand production and will provide them with a service to which they are entitled, that is the provision of water on their farms and in their homes.  As Deputy for that constituency I was proud to obtain the necessary sanction, approval and finance from the Minister for the Environment for that scheme.  The Castlerea regional water scheme has also been sanctioned at a cost of £200,000; the Roscommon town sewerage scheme, phase two, has been sanctioned and work is now proceeding; the contract has been awarded and work will commence in the near future for the Athleague regional water scheme and we are hopeful for approval for sewerage works in Bally-league and in the village called Knockcroghery which also requires this service.  We are hoping in the next few years to achieve all the regional schemes which have been planned.</P>
    <P>In a developing agricultural economy the provision of water on the farm and in the home is vital.  I know the Government have recognised this because of their injection of funds in my area.  The money spent on these schemes will provide enormous rewards for the people involved and for the economy as a whole.  We are now gearing ourselves to ensure that agriculture, which produces one of our greatest benefits, is given the maximum injection of funds to get the maximum return.  A 50 per cent growth rate can be achieved in the agricultural sector if the necessary finance is provided and if the necessary restructuring of land holding is expedited by the Department. The proposed new Land Bill hopefully will help to alleviate the situation in areas like Roscommon-Leitrim where people need the land but, due to the high cost of land, they are unable to acquire it without the help of the Land Commission and possibly the new land agency.</P>
    <P>It was a great pleasure to speak on this Adjournment Debate.  I congratulate the Government on their success and wish them well for their future <Col N="2406" /> years in office, knowing we are about to achieve the greatest growth rate ever.  We are setting ourselves a difficult objective in relation to the elimination of unemployment, but it is an achievable target.  That is something no other country has set out to achieve. Fianna Fáil are setting out on this course which seems to be unacceptable and unwelcome to the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: The reason for the Government's performance being scrutinised so seriously, and the reason for the complaints from the Government in regard to what they think is a cynical approach by the Opposition, by the Press and by virtually every commentator I have heard or read on the subject of this Green Paper, is not simple jealousy of the Government.  It is not envy of Fianna Fáil or resentment of their having won so handsomely the last election.  The reason for the scrutiny is that never since the foundation of the State have a Government arrived in office on the basis of so many absolute and firm undertakings, on the basis of so much expression of undiluted confidence that all they required was a majority in this House and everything would be all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was because of this brazen pretence that they, unlike Fine Gael and Labour, did not consist simply of flesh and blood, that somehow they would <Col N="2407" /> get the gift from God of being spared external recessions, falls in the value of sterling and worldwide movements of a kind that can disrupt the best laid plans.  It was because of those pretences, and because of the pitiful measurement that we are now able to achieve between performance and those promises, that there is this close scrutiny.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out in a newspaper editorial recently, it is the function of an Opposition to give the Government hell.  We can discount much of what any Opposition say, just as we can discount a good deal of the type of self back-slapping that we have heard from Deputy Leyden.  The reason particularly for this close scrutiny of the Government is that, unlike the National Coalition in 1973 and, to be fair, unlike Fianna Fáil in 1969, in 1965 or in any other election they won, they have come into power on a positive and unequivocal set of promises.  Now is the time of the small print, and we are being asked to look behind those promises and to understand the many promises that cannot be fulfilled overnight and to understand that a year in their terms may mean 18 months or two years, and that promises which were supposed to be fulfilled immediately may not be fulfilled until the next election, if they are capable of being fulfilled at all.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the scrutiny stems from the pusillanimous tone in which the Green Paper is couched. The English used in it is abominable. It is full of talk about options.  We are told that the Government wish to present a range of policy options, and to hear debate on these options.  Was there a word in the manifesto last year about options?  Was there a word in it about the people being presented with a set of choices, all of which would be difficult, but between which the people would be asked to make up their minds?  Was there any word that in 12 months' time a paper would appear setting out a few tentative options, or was there anything in the manifesto to indicate that the options offered would be sacrificial?  There was not, and neither was there any word in it <Col N="2408" /> about there not being easy answers, about there not being a panacea.  Was there any word that if we were to make progress people would have to tighten their belts?  If there was one promise the manifesto did not make, it was a tightening of belts, but it certainly distracted people's minds from any likelihood of being asked to make sacrifices.  It steered people's minds away from the reality that there would not be an automatic improvement in their standard of living or in the employment situation.</P>
    <P>We make all allowances for election time.  At such times and at other times we may not mean everything we say and we would regret if people took seriously 100 per cent of what we say, but the performance of Fianna Fáil has been cynical and dishonest from beginning to end.  If a Green Paper of this kind was introduced by the Coalition or even by the Government that preceded the Coalition or by any other government headed by Mr. Lynch, by the late Mr. Lemass or by the late Mr. de Valera, it would not deserve the same kind of niggling examination that it is receiving now; but this Green Paper is a product of the party who had all the answers, who laid down in black and white that there were &ldquo;tens of thousands of jobs only waiting to be created&rdquo;, with the implication, which did not lurk too far beneath the surface, that nothing but Coalition stupidity, malice, envy and dissension prevented those jobs from being pulled out of the air.  That is the background against which the Green Paper is being examined, and I do not apologise for adding my voice to that of my colleagues.</P>
    <P>When I read this Green Paper with its promises of sacrificial times to come, of options that will not be easy, I am reminded of a story I heard as a child.  It was one of the Brother Grimms' stories&mdash;a very apt name for the author.  This story concerned a widower who had a beautiful daughter and who, for the daughter's sake, was anxious to remarry.  When he put the matter to the woman of his choice she, being very anxious for a man promised him faithfully that the daughter of whom he was so fond would have <Col N="2409" /> wine to drink and milk to bathe in. Bathing in milk may sound disgusting now, but it must have sounded fine to a sixteenth century peasant audience in Germany.  The marriage took place; and on the first day the girl had wine to drink and had milk in which to bathe, but on the second day there was no wine so that she got only milk to drink although she had milk in which to bathe.  On the third day she had milk to drink but only water in which to bathe; while on the fourth day it was water all the way.</P>
    <P>That is an analogy not too far removed from what we are discussing today.  I make all allowances for the weakness of politicians.  I have these weaknesses in full measure.  Sometimes we promise more than we can fulfil. A politician may suffer from some personality defect which forces him into public life&mdash;that goes for everybody in this House and for everybody in every county council, too&mdash;in a sense it is a disease and I make all allowances for it, but the Government's performance tops all.  I have never known anything else to come near what they have done.  The Government of Deputy Cosgrave would have been ashamed to have been associated with a performance of this kind in order to get into office.</P>
    <P>Twelve months after being returned to office on a set of promises the Government produce this document that is of stupefying banality.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that we were &ldquo;stunned&rdquo; by the Green Paper.  He is right so far as I am concerned, because I cannot understand most of it.  Never before have I seen a document that is so slovenly, so badly written, which is so full of jargon and which, in the matter of using words that are not understood outside the Department that put them together, is a sure sign that the man who put the document together does not know any better way of putting across what he is trying to say.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper contains words that have never before appeared in print in this country in the sense in which they are being used now.  For instance, there is talk of a &ldquo;secular trend&rdquo; in agricultural employment. <Col N="2410" /> The word &ldquo;secular&rdquo; has two meanings in ordinary Irish speech.  It is used in the ecclesiastic sense as opposed to priests in regular orders, and it also can mean secular as opposed to clerical or professional in a general sense.  But, perhaps because I have the remains of a classical education, my guess is that the word is being made to bear the meaning &ldquo;characteristic of the age&rdquo;. We know there is a trend in rural disemployment that is characteristic of the age, but why can the man who wrote the document not say that rather than use a word that the people cannot understand and which takes me all my time to try to disentangle?</P>
    <P>There is another reference to increases being merely &ldquo;incremental&rdquo; increases in employment.  I know what an increment is.  I was on an incremental scale for a long time before reaching a maximum, but that is not what the genius means in this document. Neither is it what is meant by the genius who presides over that genius in the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  What is meant here by an &ldquo;incremental&rdquo; increase in employment is merely a slight increase, an increase that is so small as not to be worth talking about, but why cannot the author of this document say that?  The Green Paper reflects the belief that we are all Paddys.  Indeed we are paddywhacks of the deepest dye when we can have the wool pulled over our eyes in this way.</P>
    <P>Having said that about the Green Paper I must confess that it contains a good deal with which I agree, and I do not wish to appear to devalue those parts of it that are useful and which I am glad to see included in it. However, before going on to that I wish to make the Press and the people a present of my own conclusions about the way in which the document was put together.  The Department who launched it were idiotic enough to give a clue as to the dissensions in the Government by issuing an <i>errata</i> slip setting out a list of misprints, seven in all, and each one of which one would flash past without having to be told what was intended.  We are told by way of <i>erratum</i>, for instance, that the <Col N="2411" /> word &ldquo;married&rdquo; is spelled in the document with only one &ldquo;r&rdquo;.  We do not need an <i>errata</i> slip to tell us that these were the parts of the Green Paper which reached completion last, but it tells us that these were the parts which came back from the printers and were rehashed.  This slip indicates those parts of the document that were put together fleetingly.  It is obvious that there was not sufficient time to read the proofs. The reason I am sure about this is that on my first reading of the document I found a further nine misprints and if the Minister wishes I can send him a list of those.  The misprints mean that the document was so speedily put together that there was not time to correct it properly and this <i>errata</i> slip indicates the sections&mdash;one of which deals with health&mdash;about which there was the most contention, which were completed at the last moment which had to be recalled from the printer and re-set but without time to proofread before the document was bound. I will give that as a present to some other Sherlock Holmes to see what he can make of it, but that is my belief.</P>
    <P>Some of the items I thought were good ideas, though certainly I was very far from being &ldquo;stunned&rdquo; by their novelty or dramatic quality, as the Taoiseach rather sadly said here yesterday.  The idea of residence-related relief&mdash;even though it has been sneered at in the papers by one or two commentators&mdash;is a good one.  The idea of providing taxation relief or other kinds of relief for work on dwelling-houses is a good idea.  The idea of providing encouragement by way of taxation relief or otherwise for jobs which have an energy conservation element is also a good idea.  I advocated it in this House on two or three occasions, and even though I have said hard things about the Minister's Department I would be proud if I thought that they had picked up that idea from me.  The little section about real-value mortgages is a very useful one.  I hope something will happen about that.  I agree also with the idea that the financing of higher education&mdash;at any rate in so far as it concerns people who are not absolutely <Col N="2412" /> on the floor economically&mdash;should be undertaken by means of loans repayable at a time when the graduate, having climbed into an area of permanent privilege for the rest of his life, will be able to restore to the people some at least of the investment utilised in putting him in that happy position.  These are things with which I agree.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Green Paper which I mentioned before, its banality, its abominable language, which conceals always an abominably mixed and unlucid mind behind it, offended me and must offend anybody.  I am particularly offended by the untruths and ungenerosities which are stitched through it.  The Minister opposite me is not by any means the worst offender on his side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: In fact he is one of the most open-minded of them.  It is threaded through with what I can only call ungenerosities in regard to the progress of the recession and of the recovery since the recession.  In this connection an awful lot has been made by people on the opposite side, the latest of whom being the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy yesterday.  I did not stay here for all his speech but, in the time it took me to go from that door to this door, I heard him boasting about the achievements of Fianna Fáil in bringing down inflation.  I want to quote from no less a person than the Minister for Economic Planning and Development from an issue of <i>Ireland Today</i>, No. 924 of 1 March 1978.  Had I more time I would stitch the cover into the text of what I am saying because it seems to provide ammunition for an Aunt Sally or two.  In an article by him on page 2 entitled &ldquo;The Challenges facing the Irish Economy&rdquo; he says:</P>
      <P>The resumption of steady growth coincides with a significant downward movement in the rate of inflation. Price increases are now confidently expected to fall from the rate of 18 per cent which prevailed in 1976 to single figures by early 1978.  In some measure,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2413" />&mdash;and this is a big admission&mdash;</P>
    <P>this improvement reflects the slowing down in the rate of increase in world import prices and the recent strength of sterling.  However, it is also the fruitful outcome of the income restraint achieved in 1977.</P>
    <P>That Bulletin of the Department of Foreign Affairs is a publication which is circulated all over the world&mdash;the truth or almost the truth, of course, has to be used for foreign consumption.</P>
    <P>The OECD put it even stronger. The Taoiseach used a recent report of theirs yesterday when he said:</P>
    <P>On the basis of the movements in real earnings and the progress made towards reconstitution of the profit share in 1976 and 1977, the pay agreements in those two years made a significant contribution to improving the employment and inflation performance.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach himself said that.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy would not like to hear it, he would not have that at any price.  He would contend that it was Fianna Fáil alone which reached up like some Atlas and dragged down the inflation rate by main muscular force of political gumption.  That is the view of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.</P>
    <P>The OECD are somewhat more sober about it in their publication <i>OECD Economic Surveys, Ireland, May 1978</i> where they say:</P>
    <P>The sharp fall in the rate of inflation between 1976 and 1977, when it decelerated from 18 to 13.6 per cent, is attributable mainly to developments during the course of the latter year.  As already mentioned, tax changes during 1977 played a role in this deceleration, as did price developments in the course of 1976, but by far the largest influence seems to have come from external prices during 1977.  In the twelve months to November 1977, import prices rose by 11 per cent compared with <Col N="2414" /> 22 per cent in the previous 12 months, while the deceleration in export prices was from 26 per cent to 7½ per cent over the same period. The effective appreciation of sterling since October 1976 assisted in the deceleration of traded-goods prices and helps explain the similarity of the slowdown in inflation in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Finally the reasonably moderate national pay agreement of 1977 held cost pressures in check as for most of the year earnings rose less rapidly than consumer prices.</P>
    <P>None of us are angels; we are all flesh and blood; none of us are geniuses, saving the Minister's presence.  We must understand that it is not within the power of a Government to command large-scale results in inflation, unemployment or anything else, at least not in a country like this where one has to face the electorate every four or five years.  Although I make allowances for the young Deputy over there who has just spoken, Deputy Leyden&mdash;I am not sure if it was his maiden speech&mdash;and he has come very fast and far, on which I congratulate him, that kind of Radio Peking or Radio Tirana sort of ignorant repetition&mdash;&ldquo;it is all due to us; we inherited nothing but a shambles but we have brought the sun up over the horizon within 12 months&rdquo;&mdash;is repulsive, is enough to drive people out of politics and keep them out.</P>

      <P>: I make allowances for Deputy Leyden but we had the very same thing from the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy over and over again; he is not able to get to his feet without talking like that. We will have other opportunities, I hope, in the autumn when we will have a paper of some other colour to consider along with the Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice a few things in regard to the <Col N="2415" /> style of this Government.  For example, I notice that there is a very interesting thing going on at present; if one watches it closely one can track it in the papers quite easily, that is, a kind of dialogue between the Government and the private sector.  The Government produced a range of tax concessions, the abolition of wealth tax and things like that.  Their line is &ldquo;We have done our bit, now it is up to you&rdquo;.  No sooner has that been put out in two or three of these G15 scripts than the private sector come back and say &ldquo;Do not leave that baby in our arms, do not tell us in 12 months time when the unemployment figures are nearly as bad as they are now that we are to blame&rdquo;.  Then from the far side of the city the Confederation of Irish Industry say &ldquo;Do not put the blame on us&rdquo;.  The message from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development on 6 April, from the Minister for Labour on 30 March and from the Minister for Finance on 18 and 25 May was that the Government had done their bit for the private sector.  Hardly had they said that when Mr. O'Donovan, the President of the CII on 24 and 26 May, and Mr. Hely-Hutchinson of Guinness's on 1 June, said that companies were not making enough profit and that if the Government wanted investment they would have to leave companies with more profits to invest and not until then would the Government see real action on the unemployment front.</P>
    <P>It would make one cry to see this Government buying votes with enormous sums of money which make it impossible for them to devote the money where it is needed, and telling the private sector, as though the private sector were some kind of far-out reach of the public sector, that it is up to them to do this and that.  It is not the private sector's job to create employment. I am sorry to have to tell a simple truth like that in the presence of an economist.  The private sector are in the business of creating money for themselves.  That is not a sin and I do not condemn it, but to expect people in the business of making money to turn around and behave as <Col N="2416" /> though they were a semi-State body with no obligation on them to make a profit, or if they make a profit to plough it back into some further economic activity of a general utility, is childish.  We have told the Government all along that it was childish. Nonetheless this is the kind of dialogue which is now going on.</P>
    <P>It seems that the private sector have been well treated in a sense, which has been, as we said at the time of the budget, injurious to the public interest generally and the interest of reducing unemployment, by this Government.  I have no doubt, although we were accused of trying to sabotage things by saying so and Deputy FitzGerald was accused of being a national saboteur for doing his duty in saying this, that the abolition of wealth tax was a significant factor in stiffening the resolve of the unions not to touch a wage agreement of 5 per cent.  It is a significant factor in the situation that the Minister now faces, where the wage calculations on which his strategy was based are significantly higher than they originally might have been.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of our term in office, I must acknowledge, we had become unpopular for a variety of reasons.  I noticed that we were being sniped at and bombarded on the one hand from the richest end of the private sector and from Deputy Noel Browne and Mr. Matt Merrigan on the other, and I used to say to my colleagues &ldquo;Courage, if you have these against you, you must be on the right path, even though it may not necessarily be what is popular or what will bring in the votes.&rdquo;  This Government have gone too far in conciliation.  I would not have minded if the wealth tax levels had been raised to the sky, they could have been raised to £5 million and the Government could have raised the level at which wealth tax would occur, but the principle of capital taxation has been here since 1894 in the shape of tax on capital, on inheritance or succession, and it has been thrown away now to pay for the subscriptions that the private sector put into the Government party, at the cost of an extra couple of points in the national wage settlement.  I <Col N="2417" /> know that perhaps the vast majority of the Fianna Fáil Party consist of decent patriotic people but that style of Government is repellent.</P>
    <P>The laziness of Ministers and their inertia and unwillingness in relation to doing the things which were highest on the list of priorities when the Government came into office is discouraging. In his acceptance speech on 5 July the Taoiseach talked about reform of the public service.  Where is the reform? I received two documents in the last two days, one of them a paper delivered by the Minister of State at the Department opposite and the other a report from the advisory committee on the public service.  So far as the latter is comprehensible&mdash;I cannot make out what a lot of it is about because of the way they write English &mdash;the effective reform in the public service since 5 July last has simply consisted of upgrading Parliamentary Secretaries and giving them a higher salary, putting the planning sections of the Department of Finance under the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, and changing the name of the Department of Local Government to the Department of the Environment, and absolutely nothing else.  These are not reforms and only a sleeveen would try to sell them to the people as such.  It is dishonest and cruel to a simple people not too far away from bare feet to pretend that something useful is being done by superficial changes of that sort.</P>
    <P>This is a Government of softies. They do not know what it is to govern. They are willing to incur any unpopularity. I worked within the National Coalition for four and a half years and I know what it is to see people doing things they knew will bring the house down around their ears, but they did because it was their duty to do it.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto played a substantial part in the Fianna Fáil victory but in hindsight the National Coalition had become unpopular for reasons which the manifesto merely built on.  One of the reasons was that the people simply had not the stomach to be governed in the way that we thought it our duty to <Col N="2418" /> govern.  This Government are running away from difficulties.  They are faced with a population which is becoming more and more ungovernable, in common with many other populations in the western democracies, because of the essence in western democracies whereby competing parties offer more and more cake and jam and the people vote for whoever offers the most.</P>
    <P>I could not believe my ears yesterday morning when I heard the Taoiseach say that he &ldquo;wished to thank the people for their support given last year&rdquo;.  Of course they will support a Government who do nothing only give hand outs.  They will support any Government like that.  If there was an election tomorrow, except for the fact that fishermen and various other groups would not vote for Fianna Fáiu, the result might be the same as the one last July.  If that is true, it is true for the reason that the Taoiseach intimated yesterday.  The Taoiseach has the people's support in good times, but fair weather support is not worth anything and there is not much fair weather left ahead, as everybody knows.  We had to fight through horrible external circumstances and horrible internal circumstances and naturally we trod on toes and made enemies when doing so.  We have paid the penalty and I have never been heard to squeal about it.  Unless this Government use their enormous majority to do these things now they will be in deep water in a few years' time.  For example, take a simple thing on the security front.  I do not wish to rake up an unhappy incident but the re-burial of the unfortunate Stagg at Ballina was an outrageous affront to Government.  I am alive to all the personal elements in this, and please believe that I am not trying to re-fight a matter which is of grievous personal concern to relations and so forth, but for a Government to let that be done reminded me of the time they let Nelson Pillar be blown up, when one of their Deputies, the then Lord Mayor of Dublin, said that he had never liked the damn thing anyway. That was his reaction to the destruction of the principal monument of Dublin.  It was from that moment on that the slide began.</P>

I do not know if any of the Ministers opposite read the editorial in <i>The Garda Review</i> after the new commissioner was appointed. You could clearly see that the GRB felt that they had sacked the old man and appointed the new one.  Any Government which allow that idea, whether it is true or false, to get abroad, are in for trouble politically for themselves and will bring the country down with them.  I dislike that style of Government.  We have seen a lot of that over the last year.  My advice to them now is to face their responsibilities and to take a leaf out of Deputy Liam Cosgrave's book. They will lose votes over it, but the people will thank them more for it in the end.</P>

I will make available to Deputy Keating and to Deputy Tully the facts in regard to proposed planting areas in the counties referred to but I did say to the Deputy some weeks ago, and I stand over it, that there will not be a substantial increase in employment in forestry in the planting area compared with the real substantial potential in the industrial area of utilising forest products.

      <P>Before Ireland can ratify these conventions a considerable body of legislation will require to be prepared and enacted in order to give the provisions of the conventions the force of law.

      <P>In order to place the matter in its correct perspective I should add that none of the four instruments has yet come into force internationally because none has received the requisite number of ratifications.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): There is no undue difficulty generally in providing new business telephones in East Galway for applicants in priority categories. Abnormal delay may occur in some cases where there is unusually heavy construction work involved or the telephone is required in an area where there is a temporary shortage of exchange equipment.</P>
      <P>Provision of mobile exchanges in Tuam and Ballinasloe later this year will result in a substantial improvement in these areas.</P>
      <P>The basic reason why there is delay in providing telephones for applicants who are not in priority categories is that the Department's resources of plant and skilled manpower in East Galway as in the rest of the country have not yet been built up to the level required to overtake arrears and deal with current demand. The development programme prepared in connection with the Telephone Capital Act, 1977, which provides for investment of a further £350 million in the telephone service, should go a long way towards eliminating the delays that are being experienced at present.</P>

The former standard of delivery has been maintained over most of the town, especially the business sector, and the surrounding rural area.  However, as postmen are working a longer day under five-day conditions later delivery in some areas is inevitable.

      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>I have received the recommendations of the Advisory Council on Animal Health and Disease Eradication as to the criteria which they consider should be applied in determining hardship cases during the rounds of testing which commenced on 16 January 1978.  These recommendations are at present under examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister state when he will be in a position to say when the scheme will be introduced, if it will be introduced and if it will apply for the whole year? What is the reason for the long delay? It has caused a lot of concern among the farming community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he has recently received a report from the Animal Health Council containing 26 recommendations on the improvement of disease eradication schemes; if he will give details of the recommendations; and the action he purposes to take in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have received the report referred to by the Deputy and, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate a copy with the Official Report.  The council's recommendations cover a very wide field of activity and decisions have not yet been taken on all the points raised.  Some of the recommendations have already been implemented and others are in course of implementation.</P>
      <P>The following is the text of the council's report:</P>
      <P Just="Center">ADVISORY COUNCIL ON ANIMAL HEALTH AND DISEASE ERADICATION</P>
      <P Just="Center">ACCELERATED ERADICATION PROPOSALS</P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <i>Recommendations and Comments</i>
      </P>
      <P>1.  Additional laboratory facilities should be made available with more attention being given to N.V.L. reactors.</P>
      <P>2.  Validity of cards should not, in principle, exceed 12 months.</P>
      <P>3.  Notification of adjoining herdowners of the presence of a reactor herd should be done through the District Veterinary Office using any methods that are feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2449" /> 4.  The present system of notifying a reactor herdowner&mdash;of his obligation to disinfect his premises&mdash;by leaflet should be augmented by visits to each premises by District Veterinary Office personnel to explain the implications and procedure personally.</P>
    <P>5.  A mobile task force should be available to augment advisory visits to herdowners' premises, to ensure that disinfection is carried out adequately and to assist with intensive testing of designated black spots.</P>
    <P>6.  Additional movement restrictions (e.g. the 30 day Brucellosis pre-movement test) should be introduced as early as possible to avoid introduction half-way through the round as would happen if it is delayed until official sanction of the EEC Acceleration Plan is received.</P>
    <P>7.  To provide an adequate identification system both the tattoo (of herd number) and tag (of individual animal number) should be used simultaneously and introduced immediately.  Tattooing, to be effective, should be required for all animals (not just newly tagged cattle) and the onus should be on the herdowner to present his cattle adequately tattooed.</P>
    <P>8.  Channels of communication between the District Veterinary Office and the Garda Authority should be established to control the activities of those contravening the Disease Eradication Scheme regulations.</P>
    <P>For this purpose also a professional investigation section should be set up.</P>
    <P>9.  All dealers' premises should be licensed and subjected to official supervision. They should also be obliged to maintain accurate records which should be available to inspection on demand.</P>
    <P>10.  Any increase in compensation which would be available through participation in the Accelerated Eradication Scheme should be applied to all reactors taken out during the current round rather than applying it to reactors taken out from the date of EEC sanction of the Acceleration plan.</P>
    <P>11.  Part of the increased finance available should be used to increase the rate of compensation for those categories of reactors which are not adequately catered for under the present system.</P>
    <P>12.  In the case of Brucellosis the EEC funds should be applied to the whole country rather than being restricted to those countries comprising the Eradication Area.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>The following recommendations refer to the Pre-Intensive Area</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Council members felt that introduction of compulsory eradication <Col N="2450" /> measures county by county, alone, is not sufficient.  While supporting introduction of compulsory measures where feasible it is felt that it is important to take action to reduce Brucellosis over the entire Pre-Intensive area.  To this end the Council would recommend adoption of the following recommendations:</P>
    <P>13.  If possible herds in the PI area whose disease-free status is known should be allowed participate in the compulsory scheme and attain officially free status as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>14.  Brucellosis should be made a notifiable disease.</P>
    <P>15.  Compulsory Eradication Measures should be introduced as quickly as possible in Kerry.</P>
    <P>16.  Positive-milk-ring-test herds should be required to have compulsory individual animal tests.</P>
    <P>17.  MRT Bulk Tests should be carried out more frequently&mdash;if possible, four times over the 8 month lactation period.</P>
    <P>18.  All animals disclosed as reactors should be identified permanently as such by ear punching.</P>
    <P>19.  Sales of eligible animals, other than those which have passed a 30 day Brucellosis test should be prohibited from 1 January 1978.</P>
    <P>20.  Herds not covered by milk-ring test (succler and mixed herds) should be subjected to test.  (Prohibition of sale of untested animals will facilitate introduction of this recommendation.)</P>
    <P>21.  Dairy Co-ops should be encouraged to introduce milk price differentials in line with this programme.</P>
    <P>22.  Vaccination of all negative females in positive herds is recommended.</P>
    <P>23.  There should be emphasis on the need to improve farm management in terms of disease prevention.  The importance of isolation of animals at calving should receive special promotion.</P>
    <P>24.  It is desirable that flexible targets for the future development of compulsory eradication in the pre-intensive area should be announced, stressing the fact that State assistance, in the form of compensation, will eventually be withdrawn if eradication is not achieved within the period of time specified.</P>
    <P>25.  Funds should be allocated for extensive promotion of the Pre-Intensive Scheme.</P>
    <P>26.  It is essential that any extra staff necessary to implement the acceleration programme should be provided without delay.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture how the EEC aid for accelerated animal disease eradication will be used in Ireland; the diseases to be covered; the amount and commencement date of the payments; if, when, and the amount in which, such aid will be available to other EEC member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: EEC aid received under the terms of the relevant Council directives must be used to secure a significant shortening of the period of time necessary for successfully completing eradication plans as compared with the time taken by programmes hitherto in operation.  Plans to accelerate the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis have been forwarded to the EEC Commission and the Commission's decision on these plans is expected shortly.  The Community aid would apply to cattle slaughtered during a three-year period from a commencement date which will be written into the Commission's decision.  The first payments to this country will not take place until sometime in 1979.  The amount payable to the member state is 60 units of account per cow and 30 units of account per bovine animal other than cows slaughtered under approved plans.</P>
      <P>Aid is available on similar terms to other EEC member states whose plans to accelerate the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis and leukosis are approved by the EEC Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would like to speak on one or two aspects of the Green Paper.  There are many issues which are important and worth debating but I must make the best use, in common with other contributors to the debate, of the time available to me.</P>
      <P>I want to pick up the proposals in Chapter 6 of the Green Paper for what is described as &ldquo;further action on employment&rdquo;.  The intention of these proposals is to seek to abolish unemployment completely by the end of 1983.  It is interesting to note that so far in the debate no speaker on the other side has given any recognition to, or accepted, the fact that the proposals are in that form, and much of the outside comment in the media likewise appears to be unaware of the basic purpose and intention behind these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there has been a fair amount of comment inside and outside the House on the contribution which work sharing arrangements could make towards producing some increase in employment numbers in the case of those out of work and of our young people leaving school, there has been no reference to the elements grouped under what is described as a residual job creation programme.  Yet, irrespective of the contributions which might come from any work sharing arrangements, it would still be necessary to operate some at least of those further proposals for employment in order to ensure that there could be a total abolition of unemployment.  For instance, in face of the present system whereunder people out of work go along to an employment exchange to sign on for benefit, and so on, they would go along to an office of the Manpower Service and be directed to <Col N="2530" /> some from of alternative employment or to a training programme.  We would thereby be substituting training for work in place of unemployment.</P>
    <P>There are a number of elements put forward by which this residual programme of job creation could be operated.  I will deal with three.  There is a reference to extending the activities of the National Manpower Service. There is a reference to extending training programmes and there is a reference to extending employment in various forms of community service. To take the first, extending the activities of the National Manpower Service, it would be envisaged that this service would become a much more active agent in establishing, first of all, employment opportunities in the private sector within their own area and also in identifying the training needs of firms in that area so that they could have the appropriate training programes organised with AnCO, plus establishing the nature of the seasonal or other short-term employment which firms might be able to offer in lieu of having to rely on over-time working by their existing employees.  It would be envisaged that, in order to operate this much more active programme of placing people in employment, the National Manpower Service itself might become an employer so that it could itself retain enough people on its staff and have them available to supply some of the temporary or short-term needs of firms in their particular service area.  That is one element.</P>
    <P>On the training side, as I said, part of that could arise from fuller information which the National Manpower Service would collect from firms in the area.  There would also be need, much greater need as the years go on, to expand and develop not only training programmes but re-training programmes, because the pace of modern technological change is such that it is becoming increasingly inappropriate to supply people with a period of training after they complete their formal education and then certify them as qualified for a particular skill or occupation and leave them with that initial training as their only way of functioning in their chosen skill or <Col N="2531" /> occupation for the remainder of their working lives.  Yet, the methods and techniques employed in their particular occupation may change dramatically, not once, but several times in the 30 or 40 years' span of active working life.  I think, therefore, we will want to develop a much more positive programme for re-training people at different stages of their working lives.</P>
    <P>The third element suggested as a way of providing worth-while employment opportunities would be through an expansion of various community services.  It does not much matter at this stage whether we think of these proposals in terms of their being additions to environmental improvements programmes, whether they operate as ancillary to some of the educational or training programmes, whether they take the form of additions to home care and community health services, whereby one can develop a tendency towards caring for people in their own homes and their own environment rather than institutionalising them when they need any level of treatment beyond some trivial minimum; there is a variety of opportunities of that nature for worth-while valuable employment that would benefit the people themselves and the community of which they are a part.</P>
    <P>As I said, the details of such schemes are not important at this juncture. Neither are the particular numbers who would be employed in these, because obviously the actual numbers would depend on the extent of the employment increase that would take place in other sectors, be it in industry or service activities of one kind or another, and would depend also on the extent to which employment opportunities would be created through any work sharing proposals.  Whatever the number, whenever those first two components of employment increase occur, there will still be some need for a residual job creation programme of the kind outlined in Chapter 6 of this document.  Operated fully and effectively, it would mean that we could evolve a situation wherein there would always be a job or a form of training available to anyone seeking work.  I would have thought that would have <Col N="2532" /> been a fairly important and significant proposal.  Yet, as I said, it has met with what is usually described as &ldquo;a deafening silence&rdquo; from the other side of the House.</P>

If they think there is a superior alternative, let them say so.  If they think we should not seek to aim at full employment, let them say so.  Let them say something.  What we have had from the Opposition is a prolonged attempt to evade and confuse the issue and to sidetrack into discussions of items which, while perhaps important in their own right, I do not regard as of any comparative importance to a proposal of this nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am making the point that we have had either this deafening silence or attempts to side-track into far less important issues.  The reason for this can be found in the absence of any alternative policy on the part of the Opposition parties. I have seen no attempt to put forward an alternative from the Fine Gael side. Judging by the tenor of the remarks made by a number of their speakers, I have to assume that the essence of their position is that the worst of the recession was over some time in 1976, the economy was recovering, growth was taking place, employment was starting to rise&mdash;or was it?  We are not very clear on that&mdash;and all would have been well if things had been left alone and the economy would have been able to continue on some path of further growth and progress in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is a very fair statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am glad the Deputy agrees, because if this kind of growth had occurred we had to ask whether any increase in employment would have taken place.  The last statement I can find that would coincide with this kind of policy position was contained in a previous Green Paper published almost two years ago by the Coalition.  It talked about a possible pattern of growth in the period up to 1980.  Without producing any basis whatsoever for it, it envisaged a growth rate of something in the region of 6 per cent as against 7 per cent.  There is an incredibly spurious and inaccurate estimate of the increase that could take place in industrial employment.  If I moderate that and calculate it on the same basis as our own Green Paper projections, it would be fair to say that employment might rise by about 8,000 to 10,000 a year on the Coalition's Green Paper approach.  That would mean that there would be still more than 100,000 unemployed in 1980.  The <Col N="2534" /> nearest I can get to a statement of what I would regard as the Fine Gael position would be that there was no longer scope for any job creation through additional Government spending; there was a sufficient recovery taking place in output, thanks to the international recovery and so on, and that would have been sufficient for our purposes.  That sufficiency would have meant that more than 100,000 were unemployed right through to 1980.</P>
      <P>If that is their position, let it be put on the record and go out from this House that Fine Gael do not believe there is scope for any significant impact on our unemployment problems in the years ahead.  That has to be their position, because not once has any of their spokesmen implied that it might be even remotely possible or credible to aim for this goal of unemployment. The opening Fine Gael speaker took the opposite tack.  Instead of trying to consider the Green Paper proposals with any element of seriousness, he tried what I can describe as the crude political gimmick of referring to me as a very nice man, a decent chap, but an academic who should be back at university setting students examination papers for the summer. The inference was that you should treat the Green Paper in the same light, as a nice essay for examination purposes, but having nothing to do with the real world.</P>
      <P>We can debate the merits of my academic or political capabilities on another occasion.  The point I want to draw from it is that clearly Fine Gael do not believe that any attempts to approach full employment belong to the world of reality, that for practical purposes practical men should accept the high and continuing level of unemployment right through into the 1980s. If that is not correct will they please put their alternative policy on the record, but not now because I have only a few minutes.  Perhaps a late Fine Gael speaker will do that.  I waited for quite a long time to see if there was any policy proposal but have not heard it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party could claim to have an alternative.  Their opening <Col N="2535" /> speaker, their Leader Deputy Cluskey, spent his time not actually talking about the contents of the Green Paper but instead, including in rather cheap and irrelevant political asides&mdash;he would be better advised leading his own party&mdash;and in conclusion he said he thought the Green Paper was a gimmick and irrelevant and that the Labour Party had an alternative, the socialist alternative.  I was waiting to hear what this socialist alternative was and I never heard it, and I do not think anybody else did either.</P>
    <P>I attempted to see if we could get any further information on it.  I found summaries of earlier speeches by Deputy Cluskey in which he said that the policy of the Labour Party was to aim for full employment.  He said that &ldquo;the socialist message of labour is relevant.  That message is simple. It is that the solution to our major problems lies in the direction of the planned application of the common sense of ordinary people.&rdquo;  That is a marvellous way of telling us that although the Labour Party want to plan for full employment, they have no intention of doing it for themselves. Instead they propose to round up ordinary people with common sense. They do not supply any definition of either &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; or &ldquo;ordinary people&rdquo;.  I am not even sure if you have to be a supporter or an opponent of the Labour Party to qualify for inclusion in this category.  I assume, by the voting patterns of last June, that the majority of the people would be disqualified if support for the Labour Party policies is to be one of the criteria.  I do not know how they are going to get their planned application of the common sense of the ordinary people.  They might get the application of a minority of their own but they should recognise that it is a minority.</P>
    <P>I was hoping we would get a little more information about the planned application of common sense.  We are told that planning is essential.  By planning they do not mean a reheated, repackaged version of the discredited economic programmes of the past. They mean a cohesive national strategy for economic and social development <Col N="2536" /> based upon clear and democratically accepted goals with policy instruments and planning structures designed to mobilise all sectors in a true partnership in their pursuits.  From that we discover that whatever will be in the future it must be different from the past, but we are not told in what way it must differ.  In this Green Paper you are given proposals which are different from the past and what do we get? No response or reaction of any kind.</P>
    <P>A number of other speakers from the Labour Party implied that they were putting forward a socialist alternative. This morning I listened to my constituency colleague, Deputy Desmond. Having first tried to apply the cheap political label that the Green Paper was a type of Tory manifesto, he eventualy got around to implying that there was a socialist alternative and the various things that could be done, but every item he listed, except one, was already contained in the Green or White Papers.  When he eventually got round to implying that there was a socialist alternative and the various things that could be done every single one of the items he listed was contained already in the Green Paper or the White Paper except one. The only exception I could discover in the remarks of other Labour Party speakers was the suggestion that we ought to create a State development corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: We will see about that.  If other speakers did not actually use that phrase they spoke about a greatly expanded role for the State, greater public involvement, public investment and so on.  First of all, we have not ever been told the nature of the investments and the jobs that would be created by this State corporation or by an expanded public investment programme.  Perhaps these opportunities exist.  If they do is it not in the interests of the nation that they should tell us what these investment opportunities are, how much they will cost, how many jobs they will provide and what sort of skills will be needed for them.  I am sure any Government concerned at the well-being of the people would gladly follow through <Col N="2537" /> investigate and involve themselves in any worth-while proposals of that kind. But we never had any&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is fair enough, but the main part of the Labour Party's objection is that the private sector alone is not willing or capable of taking this up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not mind the interruptions provided I get my 30 minutes deducted from their side.  If I may reply, as a digression, it is a separate question about how much the private sector can or cannot do.  We have never said that we expect the whole of the development to come from the private sector.  Our whole argument is that there has to be a balance or a mixture of both public and private initiative.  We can legitimately debate the relative merits or emphasis to be placed on either side. That is a separate debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to believe that the socialist alternative, if it is an alternative, would consist essentially of the provision of all these extra jobs by some programme of a State investment could we make clear how much would be involved, because, on a crude calculation, if one is to say one does not like, does not believe or dismisses proposals to create 65,000 jobs as set forth in Chapter 6 of the Green Paper; if instead one is going to provide 65,000 jobs in some mythical industries not yet known, if they are like other industries, the average investment cost now would be in the region of £30,000 per job.  I hope the House will agree that that is a modest estimate because we know that in some capital-intensive industries investment per job can be of the order of £300,000 or more.  But I will take the modest figure of £30,000 as being not unrepresentative.  To do that for 65,000 jobs gives one an investment requirement of almost <Col N="2538" /> £2,000,000,000.  Therefore, that mean that the socialist alternative&mdash;even if they had the investment opportunities available tomorrow&mdash;calls for finding another £400 million a year for each of the next five years to produce jobs by their alternative.  Therefore, even if they find the jobs, would they also please tell us where they propose to find that additional money?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Of course the Minister's estimates for job creation resulted in a net figure; in other words, a saving.  It would have to be scaled down by net saving and scaled up by the net profit to the Exchequer by the availability of those jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: The net savings are set out in Chapter 6.  I think it is expected to save something in the order of £200 million, so we can be modest and knock it down to £1,800 million.  If the Deputy want to make a case for the Exchequer benefiting more than that we would need to know details of the actual investments.  Certainly if one applies normal wage rates and normal tax rates one would get a figure significantly different from the £20 million I have mentioned.  That is the basis of my argument: if there is socialist alternative, let us hear it and have it.  But I do not believe there is because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: No, we did not.  We published the first version of our proposals in September 1976.  The Caolition Government of the day paid us the compliment of taking back their Green Paper from the printer hastily ripping out a few of its chapters and re-writing them to try to take account of some of the views we were putting forward.  They paid us the further compliment of implementing the first phase of our proposal in their last budget in January 1977. Therefore, we did not keep our proposals secret; we put them forward <Col N="2539" /> the appropriate time.  I am glad to say that they had at least some belated, if only half-hearted, effect on the Coalition.  If they want to win support for their socialist alternative they might please tell the people the nature of that alternative, and how and why that will deliver a superior performance to the proposals we are now advocating.</P>
      <P>There were a few other sort of irrelevant and inaccurate digressions entered into in order to take up time and imply that the Green Paper was faulty, defective or would create problems in other respects.  In the limited few minutes remaining I will have to deal with them rather briefly. Deputy Pattison, my opposite number on the Labour benches, was saying, for instance, that there was going to be an attack on levels of social welfare services, that this was typical of Fianna Fáil, that it was only in the period of Coalition there had been any worth-while and substantial improvement in the social welfare services.  This is simply not true.  While there were reasonably large increases in money terms during the Coalition's period in office, most of those money increases were swallowed by the massive inflation of the last four years.  Looking at the figures, as I calculate them, it would seem that, in real terms, the average increases in all the basic social welfare benefits&mdash; old age pensions, unemployment assistance and so on&mdash;was of the order of 2 per cent a year during the Coalition's term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went back and looked at what had happened during the previous five or six years of Fianna Fáil Government. I discovered that the increases ranged between 4½ and 6 per cent a year; in other words, on average they were 2½ times greater than the increases recorded between 1973 and 1977. Finally, looking at the position this year it would seem that overall the increase will comfortably exceed the 2 per cent of the Coalition's term. Depending on how it is measured it ranges between 4 and 6 per cent. Therefore, far from there being any attack on the poorest or weakest sections of the community, facts show <Col N="2540" /> that they have consistently done better during Fianna Fáil terms of government than during the Coalition's term. I have absolutely no doubt that we will be able to maintain our proud record in that area right up to the next election whenever that may come about.  We must put things like that on the record.</P>
    <P>In the two minutes remaining there are a number of other points I should have liked to have dealt with. I see that Deputy Kelly has left the House.  He was waxing eloquent earlier about prices and quoted from lots of documents.  I was worried about different interpretations and so on.  I was going to ask him would he please just quote the manifesto because that said quite clearly that we aimed to achieve a 2 per cent reduction in prices, through our specific policy changes, and that that allied to the expected improvement in the international situation, would produce a 7 per cent inflation rate this year.  Of course, that is what has happened.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick was saying that publication this morning by the ESRI of a more pessimistic projection than the Government's proposals would shake confidence and so on.  I have to say I do not share that view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: Frankly, I do not see why.  First of all the Green Paper asserts our adherence to a policy which we first enunciated more than 18 months ago, which we have followed consistently and which we propose to continue implementing.  I would have thought that any person worried about the future would at least see that there is a far greater degree of consistency and coherence in our policy position than in the constant yo-yoing that used to take place in the Coalition's days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute have published a more pessimistic forecast, but even if their forecast is right the growth rate achieved by us is among the highest in our history and I do not see why that should <Col N="2541" /> be a source for pessimism or loss of confidence in our future.  We would be performing very well not only by comparison to our history but we would be out-performing our partners in the EEC which is something to be proud of.  I do not agree with the ESRI report; there are always a range of opinions in any professional body, and one cannot predict the future with certainty so we can only wait and see.  The only evidence available for this year supports our view and not theirs.</P>

The earliest possible date is something like five years. We can achieve it provided we get enough support and co-operation from the various sections of the community. That is the essential issue that must be faced, the issue that divides the Government from the Opposition parties. We say quite clearly that it can be done, and, so far, the Opposition parties have been saying not so clearly that it cannot be done.  Let the Opposition parties go out and say that to the young people especially, let them tell <Col N="2542" /> the young people that they do not believe they have a future, that they will not get jobs and that they will have to emigrate or else hang around the street corners for the next 10 or 15 years.</P>

Does the Minister fully realise the present economic state of the country?  The Minister was given very difficult job and has approached the problem of how to achieve full employment to the best of his ability. It will be a happy day for us when we have full employment.  There are many ways to solve unemployment but what has the Minister or the Government come up with?  The Minister is juggling with figures and playing with papers but there are still long queues at the employment exchanges. The huge majority the Government got at the last general election gave them a chance to prove themselves. Their manifesto won them massive unprecedented support.  They change portfolios and created new post which were welcomed, but there are still big jobs to be done here.  The White Paper that was produced recent promised to end unemployment with five years.  The Minister for Finance last Sunday on the radio repeated the promise, and yesterday the Taoiseach in opening the Adjournment Debate backed the Green Paper and committed himself to achieving promises.  When Deputy Lynch was Taoiseach from 1966 to 1973 Fianna Fáil failed to provide full employment. When they left office in 1973 there were 75,000 on the unemployment queues.  Now, we are being asked believe that the Minister has some <Col N="2543" /> magic ingredient that will provide 100,000 jobs within five years.  The Green Paper is no more than a smokescreen.  The Minister is attempting to hoax the unfortunate unemployed yet again.</P>

We may be forgiven for taking the word of the ESRI which has been commenting favourably on the Irish economy for over two decades and which enjoys the highest reputation for its accuracy and, more important, its honesty.  These, regrettably, are not characteristics for which the Minister's party are noted.  We would all be happy that the unemployment figure is falling if it were not for one very disturbing factor, the reappearance of that cancerous, horrible thing that has been with us since Fianna Fáil started to rule this country and before that&mdash;emigration.  I believe <Col N="2544" /> it is now running in the region of 14,000 or 15,000.</P>

      <P>: Last year the boys and girls were told that this was their country.  There was a beautiful song telling them to remain at home and they would be given employment.  They were not told that it would take five or six years to give them full employment. I was not a member of the Coalition Government, I only became a member of this Kildare Street club 12 months ago, but in fairness to the Coalition Government they could claim that their song was &ldquo;Come Back to Erin&rdquo;.  For the first time since the inception of this State that cry went out from this House.  Emigrants were told: &ldquo;Come back.  We have work for you.  We need you.&rdquo;  I am not trying to defend the record of the Coalition but I like to talk about facts.  We must not just talk about a few select people. We must talk about all the people whether there are itinerants, winos or wealth tax merchants.  Every Irish man and Irish woman is entitled to be given a decent standard of living here in this Green Isle.  It belongs to the people of Ireland and their right is full employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil produced a manifesto which fooled the people.  All credit to them for pulling such a fantastic trick. It was the greatest piece of gimmickry that was ever perpetrated in any country.  They are good at that.  However, our young men and women are intelligent people and they are not worried about what happened long ago.  They are interested in a decent standard of living, and only if the <Col N="2545" /> Government can produce the goods will they be returned to office.</P>
    <P>I have been here 12 months and I have been disillusioned, disappointed and disgusted.  This paper, whether it is green, blue or black, is just another paper.  Live horse and you will get grass.  The Government are exporting people, they are promising to keep them here and there is no way they can do it.  The Minister and his party should be ashamed of themselves. Emigration should never have been allowed to reappear.  We have the richest, the best and most beautiful country and any Irishman or indeed foreigner would be only too pleased to live in it.  Instead our people must emigrate.  The infamous Green Paper clearly indicates that Fianna Fáil intend to rob the poor to pay for their election promises to a select body of people, the rich.  They will do this by abolishing food subsidies which now run at £75 million a year.  They were introduced by the last Government on essential foodstuffs.  Recently the EEC increased the price of dairy produce such as butter and cheese.  Fianna Fáil did not increase the food subsidies&mdash; they said they had no money&mdash;so the price of butter has gone up by 6½p a pound.  The price of bread has been increased and also cheese.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister for Industry. Commerce and Energy to say about these increases?  Nothing.  When he was Opposition spokesman he was never off the television and radio and was never slow to condemn Senator Justin Keating for permitting price increases.  At least his predecessor had the courage to put his name to authorisations for price increases.  The present Minister hides behind the Prices Commission and the skirts of that beautiful Minister of State, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn.  Do not forget that the procedure for price increases is the same as it was in Justin Keating's time.  The Minister must approve increases.  The Minister should admit his responsibility and have the courage to face the public.  Whether he knows it or not, people are aware that he is the person responsible for price increases.  He appeared on television so often when he was in opposition <Col N="2546" /> that I confused him with Gay Byrne and Mike Murphy.  That is the man who now hides behind a most beautiful and able lady, his Minister of State.</P>
    <P>What has happened to the promises made in the election manifesto?  We were promised full dissemination at least once a week through the media of comparative prices of the most frequently purchased consumer goods. Why is the Minister afraid of price increases?  Why have all his promises been squashed?  One could classify him as an anonymous minister for price control.  I do not want to be too critical of the Minister, but when he was in Opposition he was the most vocal member of his party in criticising the actions of the Government.  No one can claim greater responsibility than the present Minister for Senator Justin Keating losing his seat at the last election.  That is my humble opinon but I am sure it is shared by many people inside and outside this House. Senator Justin Keating who was one of the finest legislators in Dáil Éireann, lost his seat because his shadow pressed him so hard and got so much publicity. Senator Justin Keating never shirked his responsibilities.  He was honest enough to claim responsibility and to tell us that he could not control prices.  We have no economic crisis now.  We have been promised full employment in five years and have been told that there is great growth in our economy, yet all the time there are price increases.  Nothing has changed in regard to price increases, which are ultimately the responsibility of the man who shouted so loudly and got so much publicity that he was responsible for Senator Keating's defeat.</P>
    <P>There were many closures in a short space of time, including the closure of two factories in the Shannon area.  At that time we had a great champion in the person of the present Minister. He took full advantage of the situation. It was regrettable that these industries had to close, but Deputy O'Malley got maximum publicity at the time. What has he done since he took over the job?  People in Limerick felt that he was going to create new industries or re-open some of the closed ones <Col N="2547" /> but so far nothing has happened. Greater tragedy has happened in our area.  I do not want to go over the Ferenka affair again but I do not know who is to blame for it.  When people are given the responsibilities of Government we must assume that they are to blame.  The people of Limerick will be the best judges of the matter at the next general election.  Thank God we are dealing with an intelligent electorate today.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the performance of the IDA in my area.  I would be serving the best interests of the people I represent if I were to call for a sworn public inquiry into their performance. How do they attract new industries?  What are their standards in providing support for new industries and how effective are they in spending taxpayers' money?  In view of my dissatisfaction with their operations, I have no alternative but to ask for an inquiry so that the people of Limerick can be assured that Government money is being properly spent.  They have no such assurance at present.  The people have no confidence in the IDA or in the Minister.  Therefore, I am calling for a sworn inquiry into the operations of the IDA.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the recent Road Traffic Bill.  But I fear the Government did not go far enough.  If a person is found guilty of drunken driving, it is up to the courts to decide what to do, but I feel sorry for a human being when he alone must take responsibility for his actions despite the fact that when inebriated or under the influence of drink a person cannot be held responsible for his actions.  I suggest that when the Minister is reconsidering the legislation he should provide that the man who sold the last drink to the person charged with drunken driving, the publican should also be made responsible.  The carnage on Irish roads is terrible and I welcome the Minister's legislation except that it does not go far enough; there are more people involved.  I also say in this House that anybody attempting to have a case of this nature withdrawn or quashed should himself be charged, whoever it may be.  I hope the same law will apply to the Mick <Col N="2548" /> Lippers, the Ministers, the judiciary. the Garda and everybody else.  Let us be honest and sincere if we are trying to do something towards reducing and, please God, eliminating fatal accidents on the roads.  Nobody should be excluded from the law.</P>
    <P>Also, when the Minister is reviewing this Bill I hope he will include those that I feel contribute in a big way to drunken driving, the people who serve the drink.  They should also be held responsible because when they get a licence to operate that business they are giving an assurance to the licensing authorities that they will conduct their business in a fit and proper way.  Surely to allow a person to leave your premises as a drunken man and put him in charge of a vehicle, is actually to give him a machine gun.  Who will pull the trigger?  That is what I should like the Minister to consider.  The present Bill does not go far enough.  One could not expect the Minister to say that but I can say it; he certainly did not go far enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I sat here for about four hours last night and for a long time today to find out the opinion of various speakers on the economy and particularly in connection with the discussion document, the Green Paper. A very prominent journalist said last week that there would be a very big debate this week on the adjournment and that he feared the Opposition would talk themselves out of it if they were not careful and did not have alternatives to put up.  That is what I think they are doing.  I farm 50 acres of land and if somebody comes to tell me I am making a mess of the job or that I cannot do what I propose to do&mdash;that is what the Green Paper talks about&mdash;I would say &ldquo;Can you give me your alternative?&rdquo;  If he cannot do that I could become very nasty and say &ldquo;Get off my premises when you cannot tell me how to go right but say I am going wrong.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many options in the Green Paper that I do not agree with.  Deputy Andrews said the same thing. But the Green Paper is a courageous discussion document for all concerned with the economy.  I shall not bore the <Col N="2549" /> House telling about the parts of the manifesto Fianna Fáil have already put into operation.  That has been done by various speakers.  Irrespective of what is said here, the public and the newspapers seem to think we are doing fairly well, although not as well as some of us would like in the past 12 months.  But we are now at a vital stage when a document is produced to plan the policy of Fianna Fáil and the Government of the next four years. The Government are doing something that the people want; they want positive not negative thinking.  The Government are putting their head on the block and telling the young people: &ldquo;We want to provide employment for youth.  We have a programme which we think can achieve this.  Some of us may have reservations about full employment but at least there is a commitment in the paper that if certain things are done and certain options accepted, we can produce full employment.&rdquo; This is a very bold statement but it has been made.  The Government will be held responsible for making it.  You certainly will not cod the people and the young people will watch to see what will happen.  I am convinced that if we are able to do what is proposed in the Green Paper when the options are adopted, in the next five years, we could be embarrassed by the number of people on this side of the House.  I am not an economist.  I should love to see it happen, but I have reservations about full employment.  The Green Paper is a courageous document on which there can be various arguments.</P>
    <P>One of the most important points was made yesterday by the Taoiseach concerning agriculture.  It was the most important statement made for a long time to my mind, because a number of us have been talking about it for a long time, about the importance of agriculture and how vital it is to the economy.  There are a number of opinions in the Green Paper in relation to agriculture.  I claim that if sufficient money were put into agriculture it would be the saving of the economy.  Many jobs would be created. Many people want jobs but the first thing we must do&mdash;and I emphasise this&mdash;is change the attitude of Europe <Col N="2550" /> towards our small and medium farmers. The farmers' dole is discussed in the Green Paper.  I intend to go into that and spend some of my time on agriculture.</P>
    <P>Under the present system there is no incentive, apart from the across-the-board grants for everybody or 30 per cent if you are under 55 years of age.  I am talking of transitional farmers because there are only a few others.  In my part of the country only 4 per cent or 5 per cent are development farmers under the present definition.  I speak of the ordinary farmer who is classified as a transitional farmer.  He gets a 30 per cent grant for reclamation work or putting up sheds if he is under 55 years of age. There is not much point in putting in a manager on a 30-acre farm.  The EEC directive must be changed.  If a farmer of 25 or 30 acres could get the maximum grants for increasing his stock and machinery, in addition to certain bonuses for his achievements, this would be of considerable help.  In an area like Connemara there is no hope of developing the land and small farmers there must get unemployment assistance.  If a farmer of 30 acres got help to drain his land, with the additional incentive of a bonus if he achieved certain targets, it would be much more preferable to him than the dole.  We must change the system of grants now operating.</P>
    <P>When the first directive came from the EEC I condemned it.  I was told I was throwing cold water on it.  Five years ago I suggested that there should be a pre-development scheme for those who would not qualify but nobody gave consideration to it.  However, the farming organisations took it up, Fine Gael took it up and now we are talking about it.  I brought up this matter at the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture five years ago.  If the big people in Europe will not change their attitude towards the ordinary small farmer here we must ensure that we have a national scheme to give the people concerned some incentive. I suggested something on the lines of the incentive scheme for small farmers.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in the Taoiseach's <Col N="2551" /> speech was on the farmer, and this was pointed out in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Some 80 per cent of farmers are in the category I mentioned, but unless something is done by way of incentives to improve their lot there is no use in our talking about them.  I welcome the money provided for drainage in the west of Ireland although I have reservations because I think some of this work cannot be done.  That is a parochial matter and I will not discuss it here, although I noticed that every speaker in the debate referred to his own constituency. It seems everyone plugs his own area, but I prefer to stay on the national issue in this debate on the economy.  I wish my contribution to be positive but I am sorry to say that the approach of the Opposition in this debate has been negative.  If a person criticises something he should put forward an alternative.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper is a revolutionary document.  Although I do not agree with everything in it, nevertheless it is a document that is worth discussing. However, I should hate to accept the assumption in the paper that 4,000 jobs will be lost each year in the agricultural sector.  If proper assistance were given to farmers that would not happen.  A figure of 5.7 per cent has been mentioned in respect of growth rate and I accept that.  The farm modernisation scheme has been mentioned.  I agree that portion of the money involved should be given by way of grant, but some of it should also be given by way of bonus if a person reaches a target.  Great work was done under the incentive scheme for small farmers.  I know many farmers who worked hard to achieve the targets and many of them increased their incomes substantially. If people presently drawing unemployment assistance knew that they could get a bonus in addition to a grant they would be very happy to avail of the scheme.  I want to differentiate between the very small farmer who may have only four or five acres and the farmer with a reasonable holding.  The former must be given social welfare.  The man <Col N="2552" /> with a reasonable holding has no incentive to develop his land.</P>
    <P>The question of land structure was not mentioned to any extent in the debate.  Something must be done about this matter.  I would ask the Minister for Agriculture to issue an order to the Land Commission immediately that until he brings in legislation an order under section 40 of the 1956 Act be put on all sales of land from now on.  I know it will hold up the sale for only three months.  I hope legislation will be brought in before the end of this year to curtail the buying of land by speculators and by people who have too much land already.  The Minister concerned has promised to do this.  Every person who has land for sale will try to sell now. The Land Commission are not active in the matter and I would ask the Minister to take action.  If farmers with reasonably sized holdings could get some help to purchase land when it comes on the market in their locality they could make a reasonable living on the land.  Action must be taken to stop speculators in this area.</P>
    <P>Many people criticise the Land Commission, and I accept that they have major faults.  However, if we replace them and ask local bodies to decide who will get land that may not be satisfactory.  Blood was spilt over land and it is still a sore topic in many parts of the country.  At least the Land Commission are not parochial in their attitude as might be the case if farming organisations or advisers had to decide who would get land.</P>
    <P>In the Green Paper the Taoiseach put enormous stress on agriculture.  We must try to achieve the full potential of the industry and to keep as many people as possible on the land because there are no jobs for them elsewhere. We must try to help the people who can pull the country out of the mess it is in.  The people in agriculture must be given a chance.  If the small farmer goes he cannot be replaced.  He stood for everything that was good in the country and he should be helped. More money should have been given for land settlement.  We are getting more for drainage works and I am very <Col N="2553" /> grateful for this.  We hope to get very good results.</P>
    <P>There is the whole question of land and what can be got out of agriculture. It is annoying to hear about our factories not being able to compete wth those abroad.  For instance a farmer here sells cattle on the hoof and they are taken to Britain and processed there.  The British factories can pay a better price than ours can and yet we have the raw materials here at our door.  I cannot understand it.  I would not agree that there should be any attempt to stop the free sale, but if our factories were efficient we would be able to compete here and to employ people at home.  We should be able to meet any competition from abroad.</P>
    <P>I may have spent a little too long talking about agriculture and the clock is moving on.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a special tribute to the Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  He is doing a very good job. I would like to see a few changes in regard to health and social welfare. There is a medical card system.  It is terrible that the small farmer has to give up his blue cards in order to get a medical card.  This is discrimination against a man who is in cattle alone. A sheep man is not asked for the card for his sheep and a tillage man is not asked for it.  If a man is in cattle the home assistance officer goes and asks him how many blue cards he has.  There is an estimated value on each of them which is fairly high now because of the price of livestock.  There should be discussions between the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Health and Social Welfare. There is a danger that if a man has a health card he will not produce all his cattle; some of them would be hidden away.  When the question of testing arises, if the calves are produced the vet is asked to give an account of the number of cattle he has tested.  This is something that I would like to see changed very quickly because it is detrimental to the question of disease eradication.</P>
    <P>I come back to the question of employment. In agriculture there could be a lot of employment.  I have talked <Col N="2554" /> about giving the full grants to the small farmer providing that he works to a plan.  I do not know how few commercial farmers we have but I think the figure is about 1 per cent. The farmers have to be planned and the plan has to be serviced.  If we are to change the system so that the smaller farmer can be planned and get the full grant there must be an increase in the number of agricultural advisers in every county.  There must also be a substantial increase in the staffs of the farm development offices, and here there is plenty of scope for employing people.  My county is not the smallest in the country.  If in the morning it came about that the system was changed there and every farmer was prepared to go to an instructor and work to a plan, who would plan him?  There are not sufficient instructors. Who is going to do the development for him in the development office?  There is a great need for clerical assistants there.  It annoys me to see somebody with a degree in agricultural science sitting in an office when he should be out talking to the farmers and telling them what to do. He has a pile of paperwork in front of him which should be done by short-hand-typists and young boys and girls who need jobs.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for the Environment.  He has been referred to as a national disaster or a complete failure.  I do not see how it can be said that he was a complete failure. We got substantial grants from his Department, and I hope we continue to get them.  I do not know how many extra people the local authorities could employ.  In my county there are roads to be widened and a lot of other work to be done to provide amenities. All these things will improve the countryside and plenty of people would take this employment in preference to the dole.  There are old people who might prefer to remain as they are with the few bob they get.</P>
    <P>No young person wants to draw unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  I am glad that someone on the Labour benches said there should be a difference between talking about unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  Unemployment <Col N="2555" /> benefit is the unemployed person's own money; he has paid for it.  Unemployment assistance means the dole. I have never met anybody who would not prefer work to the dole.</P>
    <P>This is going to be one hell of a discussion document, because some of us will be talking very much against some of the options.  We agree with a lot of them and I am glad that Deputy Kelly said that there were a good many things in the Green Paper that he agreed with.  I have spoken to a few people since the document was issued. There were quite a number of shocks at some things that appeared in it, but people said that at least here is a document, here is a suggestion, here is a target that nobody could imagine we would be talking about in five years. We must have a serious look at this document and see if its objectives can be achieved.  I have reservations about it but I believe we can go a long way.</P>
    <P>I am terribly impressed in this year of 1978 that the Taoiseach came out strongly yesterday on the importance of agriculture to our economy.  When we were talking about this 20 years ago I was very much associated with agricultural organisations.  I have been a member of a political party all my life but not a very prominent politician. We got very little heed from politicians then about the importance of agriculture to the country.  They have seen the light since.  I do not say that industries are not important.  They are. In my constituency one of the towns has become a ghost town because of the closing down of the Tynagh mines. If we do not get an industry there in a short time we will be in a very bad way.  Industry is important, but it has been said here that the few inches of soil and the minerals which we have are the wealth of the country.</P>
    <P>Somebody said here recently that you can get carried away.  I got carried away when talking about agriculture. I have spent all my life working on a 50-acre farm, and that was not so easy a few years ago.  I worked hard on it.  I like to listen to a person expressing theories, but if he has not some practical experience I would not listen to him for very long.  It is the <Col N="2556" /> man with practical experience who has a theory and he is the man to talk to. The man who reads everything from books and has no experience of putting his theory into practice will get little heed from me.  I know all the things that can happen in trying to put theory into practice.</P>
    <P>I would like speakers on the other side of the House to come out and impress me with their alternatives to the options put up in the Green Paper. I do not agree with all of these options and I would be arguing against some of them.  But they are options.  This is a discussion document, and I would like to hear what the people on the other side of the House have to say about it.  I am talking to the empty benches of the Labour Party.  I mix with all sections of the community and a lot of people in my constituency are labourers.  They want forward, positive thinking.  They want people to put up the best suggestions they can find for full employment, or suggestions for bringing unemployment down to an acceptable level of, say, 30,000 or 40,000.  I do not want to see unemployment solved through emigration.  Someone referred to the public sector.  It should be tapped.  Deputy Desmond had certain suggestions on socialist lines.  I am a socialist and what Deputy Desmond suggested would, according to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, cost a great deal of money.  Now Deputy Desmond gave no indication of where the money would come from.  Whether we like it or not, the Green Paper spells out all the options.  It says where the money is to come from.</P>
    <P>I trust what I have said will be useful. I am not a professional politician but I would like to hear a full discussion and concrete suggestions made by both the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party and I would like to know their alternative to the Green Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>: I listened with great interest to Deputy Callanan.  Without starting on an <i>apologia pro vita</i> I have probably had similar experiences, because for the best part of my life I was more involved in farming organisations <Col N="2557" /> and running a family farm than I was in politics.  We got a very clear picture from Deputy Callanan, and it is a great pity he was not allowed to take some part in writing the Green Paper, especially the chapter on agriculture.  I think he would have written a much better one.  It was a pleasure to listen to him and I agree with everything he said about agriculture.</P>
      <P>The farm modernisation scheme has to be reviewed at EEC level.  The people in most need of aid actually get least.  The whole format of Directive 159 seems to be geared towards capital investment.  The emphasis is on investment rather than output.  Of course, when that directive was conceived Europe had full employment and the emphasis was on cheap food.  Now both here and in Europe the emphasis is on jobs.  Far from getting farmers off the land, as was the original intention, the thinking now is that people must be kept on the land.  State aid can be justified and the economic cost would be far less that it is in creating jobs in industry.  I think the figure in industry would be something like £12,000 as against £4,000 in agriculture.</P>
      <P>We have the highest rate of unemployment of any EEC country.  We have more scope than any EEC country to expand our agriculture.  The average sized farm here is 31 per cent greater than the average sized farm in Holland and we are not producing at the rate we should be producing and we are not, therefore, employing as many people as we should.  Like Deputy Callanan, I believe we could increase the numbers employed in agriculture.  Forget about those employed in the service industries and the processing industries.  I am talking of people on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended rural schools and my children are now attending a rural school, and I am most disappointed to find that there is no effort of any kind to give these children what I would call an agricultural bias.  They have all sorts of subjects and sometimes parents have to ask their children what the subjects are all about.  There is no effort towards <Col N="2558" /> agricultural education, an industry in which 60 per cent of our people are employed.  We apparently do not think it worth while to educate our young people in that important industry.  We do not teach them to respect it.</P>
    <P>At the moment it is practically impossible, even at double the going rate, to get people to work on the land.  The idea has grown up that the farm worker is unskilled.  People go into other industries and end up very sadly disappointed.  The agricultural worker is highly skilled.  He handles very expensive equipment.  He has to be educated and, of course, he has to be paid.  The money to pay him is there but the facilities to train him are not.  A start should be made now in the schools and there should be training courses for the agricultural industry as there are for other industries.</P>
    <P>With regard to Directive 159, we should abandon completely the concept of a comparable income or we should modify the comparable income calculators.  I believe we could obtain an extension of the time from six to ten years.  Pre-development schemes are essential.  Bonuses on targets are essential.  Low interest loans are essential.  All these are essential for people who, in the opinion of the EEC are not capable of making a go of it.  I believe they can and will make a go of it even with the limited resources at their disposal at the moment. Because of the increase in farm prices farms which were not viable a few years ago are now very viable indeed because of farmyard enterprises, horticultural production and intensive dairying.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Green Paper where it says that farmers should pay for the advisory services they are getting. I do not think that is on, because only 11 or 12 per cent of the farmers avail of those services while the people who need them most do not avail of them.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to ask us to come up with solutions to these problems, because we did not create them.  The Government will have to accept some responsibility for these problems.  Their manifesto created this wonderful euphoria, in other words, eat, drink <Col N="2559" /> and be merry, elect us and all will be well.  This is the doctrine that was preached 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>When canvassing people told me that the Fianna Fáil canvassers had been there before me and had promised that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power all would be well.  I told those people what I had said in this House.  My idea was that the farmers, like everybody else, should contribute their fair share, and not more than their fair share, of the tax burden.  It was not right that Fianna Fáil should give the impression that they would give many benefits without any sting.  The sting did not come until after the election. That was a sneaky thing to do and I criticise them for that.</P>
    <P>At the moment farmers have the option of the multiplier or keeping accounts.  The multiplier has been raised so much that it is no longer a practical proposition for most farmers, especially when one remembers that if one opts for the multiplier one must stay with it for three years.  A man would be very foolish to opt for that system when he does not know what the multiplier will be in the coming year.</P>
    <P>There is a danger in not giving an option on keeping accounts.  Farmers may opt for easier systems of farming. They might end up with a lower gross income but with the same net income because of the tax situation. This could reflect very seriously in a cutback in dairying, especially in areas with fertile lands.  That is not desirable. When we were in Government I did not agree with the notional system. Instead of working on valuation I was in favour of a system where the farmer would be asked to pay a few pounds per acre on adjusted acres. That would be much simpler and much easier to calculate.  A fair amount of money would be collected from him and he would be free to opt for any system of farming he liked.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken note of this and are now referring to a resource tax, which is similar.  I believe that as envisaged in the Green Paper a resource tax is unconstitutional. You cannot legally tax somebody on <Col N="2560" /> his land any more than you can tax a doctor or a veterinary surgeon on his skills.  The only way the Minister could lawfully use a resource tax would be as an alternative to farm accounts, in other words, a land tax as an alternative to income tax, but not both.</P>
    <P>At the moment the farmer is badly caught with a very heavy tax bill, whatever way he works.  The loss of the primary grants in some areas, especially my own area, is a very substantial additional burden.  The average 100 acre farmer is caught for an additional £1,000 regardless of his income or of his ability to earn.  In a bad year he might not make any profit but he still has to pay an additional £1,000 as a result of Fianna Fáil's policy since the general election.  This is very serious because it has put that farmer in a non-competitive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> his United Kingdom or European counterpart.  I hope that situation will be rectified soon.</P>
    <P>To remove rates from private dwellings is good but we should not expect another section of the community to make up that loss of revenue.  That is wrong but that is what is happening in my area.  Last year the local rate collector collected £370,000 and this year he will collect £390,000.  This means that the farmers are not only making up the revenue lost by the abolition of rates on private houses but they are paying an additional £20,000.  Is that just?  There are many wealthy people living in urban areas who have two or three homes and they are not paying rates while the man who goes out at 6 a.m. to milk the cows is paying for the lot. If that is a just society go bhfóire Dia orainn.</P>
    <P>We are told that full employment would be created by collecting an additional £240 million next year and £280 million the following year, and we are depending on a 7 per cent growth rate to accomplish this&mdash;the OECD say our growth rate is more in the region of 4.5 per cent&mdash;and the shortfall will be made up by additional taxation.  Where will they get money? I do not know.</P>
    <P>I see no solid evidence of any job <Col N="2561" /> creation effort by the Government in my area.  I have nothing but bad news to report.  There have been many serious lay-offs in Youghal.  Verolme Dockyard were told by the management as recently as last week&mdash;lay off for the autumn unless you get the B &amp; I vessel immediately.  I asked the Minister today what about the B &amp; I vessel.  They are still shilly-shallying in the Department of Transport and Power, talking back and forth while men are going to be laid off.  The Minister could not give me a straight answer.  If he was serious about job creation he would go in there, tell them to get on with that job, arrange the details of this deal and get that ship in before men are laid off.  But he could not even give me that assurance.  That is why I am very sceptical about the Green Paper and about the seriousness of the problem.</P>
    <P>When we approached the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy about our problems in Youghal, when I suggested to him that Youghal should be included in the disadvantaged areas scheme he said: we have worse areas than Youghal, meaning, of course, Limerick.  Limerick was included in the disadvantaged areas. I would appeal to him even at this late stage to have Youghal included before it becomes a disaster area.</P>
    <P>With regard to roads in our area every year we put down notices of motions to have bends removed, to have certain essential road-widening works carried out, to facilitate the free movement of agricultural produce, notably bulk milk carriers, loads of sugar beet and so on.  We were told by the county manager the other day that there is no money available at all for the improvement of the ordinary county roads in the current year; the only funds available are for filling potholes.  That is a most serious situation.  With the modernisation of milk haulage and the movement of large bulk carriers there is continuous additional need for road widening and so on.  But these must now be postponed. We were told also that there was no point in submitting any further local improvement schemes because they would not be undertaken. <Col N="2562" /> The group water schemes have become a sick joke.  We have umpteen group water schemes on hand at present awaiting ratification and sanction. We are told that, because of lack of funds, because of this, that and the other, there is no way they can be dealt with.  If the Government were serious about job creation they should be dealt with forthwith.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing the £4,500 loan was laughed at; it was £2,500 short of the price of a house; the loan applicant paid back £48.90 a month. What have we now?  A £7,000 loan, £7,000 short and an applicant pays £69.50 a month.  A Fianna Fáil councillor at a recent council meeting said that unless something was done very shortly to aid people building their own houses most young people so doing would end up in lunatic asylums.  I did not say it, and he was right, because the massive repayments are frightening when one considers that they are dependent on the ability of a man and perhaps his wife, to earn sufficient, on their health and everything else.  If they get sick everything goes wrong.  The thought of getting sick is enough to drive them insane when burdened with these higher payments.  If the Government are serious about job creation, house-building and so on, let them get on with providing free sites for those people.  We hear about serviced sites but their cost is equivalent to that of a house at present.  If the Government would provide free serviced sites for people they would be seriously tackling the housing problem.</P>
    <P>Emigration is rearing its ugly head again; we are now talking about a figure of 13,000.  Even if we assumed that half of them were on the live register that would mean that the downturn in unemployment is only approximately 5,000.  That is a far cry from the 20,000 jobs promised by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that Deputy Callanan did not write the agricultural chapter of the Green Paper.  He has some good ideas but the Government will not listen to him.  At Cork show this year a survey was undertaken of the ordinary small farm machinery on display <Col N="2563" /> which showed that over 80 per cent was imported.  Again, if the Government were serious about creating jobs they do not have to dig up the roads and fill them up again.  All they have to do is inject some money into the Sugar Company who are building machines under difficult conditions.  It would pay some Ministers to go and see what they have been and are doing in Carlow.  If we are serious about job creation and keeping people at home money should be poured in there, have the Sugar Company build machines for our farmers, of which they are very capable, but there is no way they can do so if they do not get the necessary finance.</P>
    <P>I have confined my remarks almost entirely to agriculture because that is the area with which I am most familiar.  I have pointed out that agriculture has, can and will save our economy in spite of the reckless spending of the Government over the last 12 months.  I warn the Government that if agriculture is to prosper they must change their tactics.  They must cease to think of agriculture as a source of revenue to pay for their follies.</P>
    <P>The only way in which revenue can be generated through agriculture is by making it buoyant and, to achieve that end it must be contained within the proper set of circumstances. The chief requisite in agriculture today is confidence, which has been well and truly shattered in the last couple of months.  I hope there will be a rethink on the whole approach of the Government to this very important industry.</P>
    <P>One Deputy here last evening said it was we who created the crisis of 1974-75.  Were it not so grim it would be amusing.  There was no panic on the part of the Coalition Government during that crisis, when agricultural produce could not be given away, when shiploads of meat were held in Bantry Bay, when horticultural produce was practically on the roads in all our food factories, having been processed and paid for.  We did not close down any plant.  We held on until market outlets improved.  Nobody's confidence was shattered during that period.  We <Col N="2564" /> continued to grow the peas, beans and potatoes; we continued to produce the beef knowing that with people like the ex-Minister for Agriculture around solutions and markets would be found. For God's sake do not blame us for 1974-75.  But Fianna Fáil will be taking the blame for 1978-79 and 1980. They should make sure that their record is right.  The Government can get a certain amount from tourism and from the public sector, but the real way to employ people is to develop the processing industry in the way outlined by Deputy Callanan.  The Government cannot compel people to have their cattle slaughtered here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Government should encourage the people involved in selling our agricultural produce to sell our entire agricultural produce under one brand name as do the Jews. If we can market all our produce under one brand name a lot of our marketing problems will be resolved.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Kelly, I have not completely knocked the Green Paper.  I will support anything worth while in the Green Paper.  Most of us wish to see friends and members of our families employed and I would support any worth-while measure to that end.  Sharing resources to meet whatever is deemed to be the priority of the day shows the sort of spirit that moved even our urban dwellers to confidently vote their way into Europe. They knew it would mean higher prices, but the national interests obliged us to become members of the EEC.  They knew that this would ultimately benefit them.  This spirit can be shattered by the sneaky approach of the Government to certain sections of the community.  They say one thing to the town dwellers, another to the farmers and another to social welfare recipients.  They tell everybody what they want to hear.</P>

      <P>: I welcome this Adjournment Debate to have a look at achievements in education during the last 12 months. Fortuitously, it is just over 12 months since the change of Government, when the country heaved a sigh of relief, particularly those involved or interested in education.  When introducing the various Estimates for the Department of Education, I pointed out that the Government now, as formerly, showed its commitment to education by increasing the Education vote by over 20 per cent.  The amount of money provided, as well as the initiatives taken in education prove the point that a characteristic of Fianna Fáil has been their real commitment to advance education.  I can justly claim on the historical evidence that education has been a priority with us. When I took office about 12 months ago education was gradually being allowed to die but now it is living again.  How has this kiss of life been administered to education?  It was moribund for four-and-a-half years but it has now been revived by the Government's commitment to spend money and by the initiatives taken since we came to office.</P>

      <P>: The second phase of the pupil/teacher improvement comes into effect on 1 January 1979.  The Government which Deputy Collins supported reluctantly, in fact the Deputy hardly spoke on education at all, had suspended the training and appointment of remedial teachers.  One of my first jobs in the past 12 months was to remove the previous Government's suspension on the appointment of remedial teachers.  The original suspension, to keep the books right, was heartless and cruel and was particularly hard on people from what are called educationally disadvantaged areas.  I can claim some credit for removing that suspension.  The result of the initiative of the Government in regard to the pupil/teacher ratio is that there are 900 extra teachers available for the academic year, 1978-1979&mdash; 600 teachers in addition to the 300 being provided to cope with the increase in the primary school population, plus teachers to replace those who retire or who are lost to the teaching force through ordinary wastage.  In all, 1,450 new teachers will enter the service during the academic year 1978-1979.  Of these, 900 will take up entirely new posts, which have been created for additional teachers in large schools and for remedial teachers and to cater for the overall increase in primary school enrolments.  The remainder will go to succession appointments arising from retirements and the normal wastage in any profession.</P>
      <P>Our policy in coming years will be directed towards maintaining such excess in output of teachers over normal retirements and wastage, as will allow a progressive improvement in the pupil/teacher ratio.  During the year also the maintenance grant for the first time for national schools was being paid at an increase of 33 per cent in 1978 over 1977, the amount being £4.4 million instead of £3.32 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is mian liom a rá, freisin, gur shocraíomar níos mó a chur ar fáil dos na bun-scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha agus go mbeidh siad ábalta suíomh do na scoileanna a cheannach.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil sé sin déanta <Col N="2567" /> again agus tá súil agam go mbeidh forbairt sna scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha de bharr an tsocraithe sin.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to let the House know that the transfer committee, the committee which will be dealing with the problems of transfer from primary to post primary schools, have been established and will be meeting this week to solve some educational problems with regard to the transfer from the primary to the post primary schools.  This has been exercising educationalists to a great extent.  I had occasion to refer to it in the House comparatively recently when there was talk of a curriculum development unit.  The research they have done and the tests they have made in the field will be very useful to the pupil transfer committee when they come to conclusions which they will put before me with regard to the transfers.</P>
    <P>In regard to post primary schools, in July 1977, the month in which the new Government took office, I announced the improvement of the pupil/teacher ratio in secondary schools from 20 : 1 down to 19 : 1 and in vocational schools from 17½ : 1 to 16½ : 1.  This resulted in the creation of 600 extra posts in post primary schools in addition, of course, to the normal increases necessary to cater for growing numbers of pupils.  These are 600 people who, if the previous Government had been maintained in office, would not have found posts because they had given no indication whatsoever that they were going to improve the pupil/teacher ratio so there was either the dole queue for those 600 or the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>When giving effect to this improved pupil/teacher ratio for post primary schools I caused it to be conveyed to the authorities of the schools that in the deployment of the increased total staff of teachers, to which the new ratios would give rise, they should particularly bear in mind making the most appropriate arrangements feasible for remedial teaching related to the circumstances of the individual school.</P>
    <P>Another point, which was neglected badly by the Coalition Government, was career guidance.  I am again hearing <Col N="2568" /> holy cries of horror about remedial teaching.  The fact of the matter is that by a regulation enforced by the Minister in the previous Government it was impossible for young people anxious to make careers in remedial teaching to get training.  I took action in the matter which was as follows. The adjustment in the ratios, which I announced soon after the Government took office, should remove for a number of smaller schools the difficulty which they might otherwise have in providing for a guidance teacher within the quota.</P>
    <P>A deterrent to existing teachers to undertake guidance courses, which came to my notice after I was appointed Minister, was that such teachers were required to bear the cost of their substitutes while they were attending the courses.  This was a particularly severe strain on teachers, particularly those teachers who had already given hostages to fortune, like getting married, having mortgages and so on, so by a decision which I have made I have arranged that this requirement of the teacher paying the substitute will cease to this extent.  In the case of a school of 250 or more pupils the school authorities may be authorised by my Department to appoint a teacher outside the normal quota of the school so that the teachers may follow a guidance training course without being penalised unduly for it.</P>
    <P>We have, as the House knows, committed ourselves to job creation.  In the education sector we have created jobs to sustain the educational efforts in the various sectors.  A total of 404 additional non-teaching posts have been provided to date in the vocational sector.  This is to help administration and to help the servicing of the vocational schemes and regional technical colleges.  The total is made up of 311 clerical posts, 42 technician and craft assistant posts and 51 posts in the maintenance area.  This is a substantial buttress to the efforts being made in the vocational sector.  These additional clerical posts sanctioned for vocational committees will enable the committees to service management and provide clerical assistance also for the principal teachers of larger schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2569" /> The principal teachers of larger schools have been agitating for some time for that help.  It was my privilege, on behalf of the Government, to sanction those posts.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the secretarial assistance for primary and secondary schools because I have an appeal to make.  I sent out a circular to the management boards and their response has been sluggish.  So far, not many of those posts have been sanctioned. I am of the opinion that more applications will come in in the next few weeks when the schools have a look at the situation.  There are 600 new posts sanctioned for this area.  I hope the management authorities will not fall down on the job but that they will apply for the posts.  Those of us who do constituency work, attend clinics and so forth, know of the great number of young people with very good Leaving Certificates plus a year's commercial training who are looking for positions.  Here are positions which are available to them.  One of the complaints that businesses make is that most of the people coming to them have no experience.  Here is an area, without suffering undue pressure, where they could get very useful experience if they want to make their way in commercial life afterwards.</P>
    <P>With regard to the grants for secondary schools this year the day pupils got an increase from £50 to £66.50, an increase of 33 per cent, which took effect from 1 January, 1978.  In boarding schools an increase was sanctioned from £50 to £66.50 towards the tuition element of the boarding school fee, with a boarding school fee limit.  There is a limit on the fee that can be charged, if the school are to avail of this grant, of £385, which was raised from £368, also taking effect from 1 January 1978.</P>
    <P>Special assistance in addition to the grants mentioned by me already are payable in respect of pupils from islands and remote areas.  Again, there are regulations which have to be adhered to.  These increases, as well as increases in pupil numbers, will cost approximately £3.1 million.  I am in a position to say here today that I will shortly be announcing substantial improvements <Col N="2570" /> in the aid to schools teaching other subjects than Irish through the medium of Irish.  It will take the form of an increase, in respect of the school year, 1978-79, in the grants payable as well as an improvement in the staffing arrangements in these schools. Our basic philosophy sees the worth of these schools and will want to sustain them in so far as they can be sustained by finance.  We want to sustain them otherwise by giving them a proper and prestigious place in our educational system.</P>
    <P>In regard to comprehensive and community schools, for 1978 the estimated State expenditure is £9,330,000. This is an increase of £2,146,000 over the 1977 figure.</P>

      <P>: In relation to higher education I would like to refer in particular to our achievements in the area of non-university education.  The National Council for Educational Awards which was established by a previous Fianna Fáil administration suffered the loss of its degree awarding powers in 1974, and not since the Children of Lir changed into swans was there a bigger change in educational policy than took place in December 1974 under the previous Government and over the head of the then Minister for Education.  I think, indeed, poor Commissioner Burke was supported in his stand at that time by Deputy Collins but he kept very quiet about it.</P>
      <P>On 29 July 1977 the present Government decided to restore the degree awarding function.  Subsequently after discussions with the various interests involved I announced on 18 September that the NCEA would for the future be the degree awarding authority in the case of the NIHE Limerick and the NIHE Dublin, Thomond College of Education and the regional technical colleges.  This was a decision which was welcomed by students, staff and authorities of the institutions concerned.  Apart from the wisdom of the decision from an educational point of view it put an end to uncertainty, and uncertainty was playing havoc with education in those institutions.  I would like to thank University College, Cork and University College, Galway who had tasks trust upon them by decisions of the previous Government for the work they did in the interregnum.  In our manifesto we undertook to establish the NCEA on a statutory basis.  Having accomplished what I have just outlined I am happy to say that I will be fulfilling this undertaking at the begining of the next Dáil session.</P>

      <P>: In reference to the restoration of the NCEA's degree awarding power I would like to mention the NCAD.  I had a very thorough meeting <Col N="2573" /> with the board of the college in April. We discussed <i>inter alia</i> the question of the source of degrees for students pursuing appropriate courses in the college. I made it quite clear that I thought the National Council for Education Awards was the appropriate degree awarding body in that instance. I would like to thank again the people who were working on an alternative scheme, a scheme that was again thrust upon them by the notorious decisions of December 1974, for what they did. They had considerable expertise before they set out, they had additional expertise when they finished, and I hope this will be available to the new NCEA when they are structuring the degrees and diplomas for the National College of Art and Design.</P>
      <P>A sum of £5 million has been provided in 1978 for building grants and capital costs for the universities and other higher education authority institutions. This represents an increase of £901,600 or 22 per cent on the amount provided in 1977.</P>

      <P>: The provisions in 1978 for a grant-in-aid fund for building costs and other capital costs for third level institutions not funded by An tÚdarás um Ard Oideachais is £2,300,000 which is £1,760,000 more than in 1977.  This will enable £850,000 to be allocated to building work for the Cork Dental Hospital School and £1,450,000 for Thomond College of Education which will be a national centre for the training of teachers of such subjects as woodwork, metalwork, building construction and rural and general science.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the Budget Statement in January 1977 the former administration announced that the maximum of the maintenance element of higher education grants was being increased from £300 to £350.  I would not beat a drum about my commitment to higher education if I had only that to offer to the students of our third level institutions, but that is the drum that is now being beaten. This was to take effect from the beginning of the academic year 1977-78. However, in December 1977 there was a change of Government and you might expect an improvement. The present Government decided that, in substitution for that increase the maximum of the maintenance element would be raised to £500, an increase of 66? per cent on the former figure of £300 with <i>pro rata</i> increases at the lower levels and that that improvement would be made operative from the beginning of the academic year 1977-78. All during the four-and-a-quarter years when the National Coalition held office, not a chirp out of Deputy Collins about increasing the grants, not a chirp out of Senator Horgan, who was free of Whip in the Seanad.  I looked up his record.  He had motions on adult education, leaving certificate music, reformatories and so on, but not a damn word about the students or how they were falling behind in an inflation situation which was often as high as 24 per cent.  Enough said. <i>Verb. sap</i>., as they say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incomes table for the purposes of the means test under the higher education grants scheme has been increased for 1978 from £4,200 to £5,100 at the maximum.  That is an increase of 21.4 per cent, and from £2,625 to £3,400 at the bottom of the table, an increase of 29.5 per cent.  The increase <Col N="2575" /> announced in May 1977 was paid by this Government.  This is another example of the person calling the tune but the Fianna Fáil Government paying the piper, contrary to the tradition that he who pays the piper calls the tune.  All those improvements, both in eligibility limits and in the amount of the grant, apply also to scholarships given by the vocational education committees to various third level colleges.</P>
    <P>With regard to scholarships awarded direct by my Department to students from the Gaeltacht and also to students who wished to pursue their studies in Irish, I have great pleasure in announcing in the case of scholarships, which were going to be phased out altogether by the previous administration, an increase from £470 per annum to £780 for those who stay in lodgings, and from £290 per annum to £480 per annum for those who can live at home while attending university.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Easter week commemoration scholarships, the increase is from £520 to £830, and from £340 to £530 for those who live at home.  I am glad to be able to announce that increase when we are on the eve of celebrating the birth of Padraig Pearse.</P>
    <P>I am fed up with pessimism; I am fed up with melancholy.  I want to banish melancholy from the education scene because we are not running to a recession for excuses with regard to developments in education.  When Tussing is read, &ldquo;Ochón, ochón agus foraoir géar&rdquo;, is all we hear from the far side of the House instead of saying, &ldquo;We have a serious problem. We will have to face it and try to solve it&rdquo;.  That is the determination of this side of the House.  A Green Paper appears, &ldquo;Ochón, ochón, mo léan, foraoir gear&rdquo;.  We refuse to adopt that attitude on this side of the House.  We intend to face the problems and to solve them.</P>
    <P>I have more goodies that I could read about if time allowed but I have proved my case.  So I will say to people who were not so active on the educational scene when they could influence the Government of the time and who are now front runners in the <Col N="2576" /> plea for more money for education: drive out melancholy.  A sound Government with a commitment to education is in charge.</P>
    <P>Hence loathed melancholy of Cerberus and blackest midnight born.  Find some uncouth cell where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings and the night raven sings.</P>

      <P>: We are at the end of the first year of the returned Fianna Fáil administration.  It is only fair to say that this Government have done things that have to be welcomed and I certainly welcome them.  What we have lacked and unfortunately still lack is a decent honesty in politics which admits success, compliments those who have achieved it and focuses on problems which have yet to be solved.  In so far as this Government have done positive things, are responsible for general improvements, I want to go on record as welcoming their efforts.  The public will benefit from such positive gains.  It is only human and natural for a Government to claim success for everything that occurs during their period in office.  It is only human that Fianna Fáil should claim <Col N="2577" /> success for the reduction in the inflation rate and for lowering the level of unemployment.</P>
      <P>If they are to claim credit for the achievement of the inflation rate, then the Coalition should claim credit retrospectively for the four best summers that we had in a row. Alternatively, Fianna Fáil could be blighted for producing two bad summers, one after the other.  With respect, neither Minister Wilson, who is representing the front bench today, nor his colleagues are responsible for the OPEC decision which governs the price of oil.  No Fianna Fáil Minister, including the Minister for Agriculture, is responsible for the reduction in the price of tea and coffee.</P>
      <P>This is the first year of a returned Government and some achievements have been made.  To the extent that they specifically improved the climate in education, I welcome them.  The term of office is four years.  At the end of the first year, it is rather like watching a mile race in which the runners are coming out of the first lap and there are three laps ahead. Few middle-distance runners win a race by leading from start to finish. The form only breaks out when the bell has gone.  Having congratulated the Government on their success and for their vigour and enthusiasm, it is only reasonable at the end of this year to consider their capacity for the remaining three years on the basis of the promises that have been made. While I am not as long in politics as the Minister, he knows as well as I do that eaten bread is very soon forgotten.  It certainly was last June. The promise of jam tomorrow, or improved cat and dog food, is what the public respond to more than a sober assessment of what has been done, what must be done and the capacities of the various contending parties to achieve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One positive benefit on which I think the Government should be complimented is that by publishing first the White Paper on Economic Development last January and in now publishing this document they are potentially raising the level of political debate <Col N="2578" /> in a way not achieved in the past. To that extent I welcome it.  My welcome stops at that point, because the contents of both documents indicate that the largest political party in the country have opted collectively and apparently with the wholehearted support of the back benohers and back room boys for a doctrinaire, right wing approach to the solution of our economic problems and consequently to generating the capacity to solve many of our social problems.  It is a remarkable ideological shift away from a central position adopted and held by the late Sean Lemass into the most naïve belief that the private sector uniquely has the capacity to create the necessary level of jobs in order to produce full employment and, mark you, in five years.  I do not object to Fianna Fáil believing that kind of doctrinaire nonsense&mdash;that is their problem&mdash;but I object to borrowing substantial sums abroad in order to pay for it and running what I consider to be the risk at the end of the day of the strategy failing and the debts remaining unpaid.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the considered contributions of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and his senior colleague, the Minister for Finance, I am totally unconvinced of the capacity of the private sector to do what those Ministers in particular claim it can do.  The economy has obviously performed well this year because it has been pumped with borrowed money.  There is nothing wrong with that.  But we are not looking at this year but at the capacity of the economy to perform over the next three years at the end of which this administration will be accountable to the public.  I do not see in all the publications and pronouncements that have emanated from this administration where they have really got down to a proper analysis of what the country needs.  Instead, in my view, they have resorted to a kind of bluff which the Minister for Education with his own personal charm gave a very human praise to in the House today &mdash;&ldquo;Trust us; back Jack; put Fianna Fáil in office and we will solve all the problems&mdash;not immediately but eventually. And we are better than the <Col N="2579" /> other shower anyway&rdquo;.  That kind of bluff-based foundation to the documentation put forward must be challenged. Because Fianna Fáil have responsibility for government now and indeed have had it for an enormous time&mdash;far too long&mdash;produces a sort of conservative establishment within our own society which says that the people who have been there longest basically know best and we should put them back.  There are serious doubts about the capacity of the economic strategy they have proposed to produce what they claim it will produce.  They have borrowed to make that strategy work, and if it does not we will have the double problem of people remaining unemployed and overseas debt.</P>
    <P>One would think that Fianna Fáil had an exclusive responsibility for the economy and nothing else.  Notwithstanding the presence of the Minister for Education and the work he has done in his own area, the extraordinary concentration on the economy by the present Government to the virtual exclusion of a whole range of areas that do not cost money is another indictment. We have on that side of the House 84 Deputies and therefore no problem about getting legislation through the House.  In the front bench we have a range of individuals many of whom have had enormous experience of a varied kind in different Departments. Within the entire Fianna Fáil party we have people who are now retired but still available who could provide a pool of collective wisdom in relation to administration.  In fact, we have not only 84 seats but, by virtue of their near monopoly of the office since 1932 we have an enormous range of experience also.</P>
    <P>It is to the shame of that party that there has been such a miserable advance in the last year in areas that do not call for money.  Changing the law on adoption does not depend on the performance of the private sector.  Reorganising local government so that it is what it is supposed to be does not rely on the private sector; getting some kind of environmental policy actually published in a year after assuming office does not rely on the <Col N="2580" /> private sector's performance.  We had a most extraordinary indication of what I must conclude is either stupidity or dishonesty on the part of the Government on the basis of the experience they have had and which hopefully they would have been able to use while they were in Opposition, producing policies whereby they would create jobs in different areas of the public sector, explaining tamely and weakly here and elsewhere that the reason the jobs have not materialised is unforeseen administrative difficulties.</P>
    <P>What have they learned in all their years of office if they have not learned how the system works?  Is that not the greatest condemnation of the collective experience of the Fianna Fáil Party that after four years in Opposition with the think tanks, the backup services and all the ra-de-da that we heard about, they designed schemes which were put to the country and upon which they got a mandate and which basically did not work because they had not checked out how they would be implemented?</P>
    <P>That is only in one area.  In the sense of democratic politics it is dishonest to put forward something that you could not deliver when you said you could, and then come in and admit you could not do it&mdash;not because you made a mess of it&mdash;but because there were unforeseen administrative difficulties.</P>
    <P>There are areas of our society that must be changed not because we accept the fashionable trend of change for change sake.  Nobody in the Labour Party is interested in legislative change simply for the fun of it.  There seems to me to be in the Government's side of the House a conservative comfort that once you can get full employment right by whatever means&mdash;and the latest avenue, apparently, is through the Green Paper&mdash;everything else in our society is right.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a total failure to understand that we are experiencing a shift in our population not only with regard to the age structure but in the movement from rural Ireland to urban and suburban areas.  This will affect every aspect of our lives.  Whether we like it or not and whether we agree <Col N="2581" /> with the change we cannot deny it is happening.  It will affect our culture and our attitudes towards all kind of things.  Yet there seems to be no recognition from the far side of the House as to the likely impact of that change and, much more importantly, what we can do as a society to counteract the great social problems it will generate.</P>
    <P>In case it is thought that this is some kind of academic waffle, let me refer to a point made in the debate today by the Minister for the Environment when he said that one of the barriers to the provision of housing in the Dublin area was the inordinately high cost of land.  Then he jumped illogically to saying that the only way to get over that would be for the local authorities to purchase land and to make such sites available as serviced land to small builders.  He did not refer to the fact that it is the basic tenure of urban land that is causing it to be exploited in the way it is, and he did not suggest in his speech that the whole question of land ownership in urban areas should be looked at.  He did not say we should question a society that allows somebody who, by accident or bequest, owns an acre of land on the edge of an expanding community to benefit to an excessive degree.  If it were agricultural land it might be valued at a maximum of £2,000 per acre but because the local authority decide to colour it yellow for residential purposes instead of green for an open space area or for agricultural purposes it jumps to £10,000 or even more. That person is allowed to retain the benefit of that subject to capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>The Arabs are not forcing us to keep those laws.  The price of coffee is not determining the nature of that ownership system.  The EEC have not a directive of land ownership in urban areas.  While we have lost a certain amount of sovereignty we have not lost that much.  In previous Fianna Fáil administrations where they had a majority of one or two and where some of the members were not exactly smallholders and could have been considered to have some kind of interest there might have been some <Col N="2582" /> problems for the party, but in their present situation with 84 seats they could lose ten votes and still get a measure through the House.  Yet we have had nothing from the Minister or from the Government.</P>
    <P>The rate of social change in the country is too fast for us to rely simply on rolling along as we did in the past.  In a society that is changing like that, history shows that it is the weak and the vulnerable who suffer most.  Indeed the Green Paper effectively says this.  While one welcomes the publication of the document and the range and level of the debate to discuss what are proposed as options, unfortunately running through the document is a lot of illogical nonsense, or so it seems to me.  If I am misreading it I shall be happy to be corrected.  I will give one example of what I mean.  One section deals with options for the development of our infrastructure and there is a specific reference to the Dublin commuter rail service with regard to the request from CIE for the investment of money.  Paragraph 5.8 states:</P>
    <P>The Dublin commuter rail service is, however, already operating at an annual loss in excess of £3 million (at 1978 prices), and CIE have advised that a heavy additional investment in replacing rollingstock and the signalling system will be required in the next few years.</P>
    <P>That is the statement of assessment. Now comes the economic wizard of the Western World who replies as follows to the statement from CIE:</P>
    <P>In this situation the options arising are to electrify as recommended by CIE, to maintain the service as it is, or to change standards in various ways.</P>
    <P>How can you maintain a service as it is when it is stated that it has to be replaced in a number of years?  That is not an option.  If CIE are claiming that unless they get money by a certain time the service will not function that is not an option if my understanding of English is adequate.  The final option&mdash;to change standards in various ways&mdash;is an invitation for more options.  What kind of gobbleygook <Col N="2583" /> is that?  The option would appear to be either to electrify as recommended by CIE or to fudge the issue.  Unfortunately in far too many areas the Government have fudged the issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Tourism and Transport is a genial man from my mother's county but in a political sense he was quite pathetic at Question Time this afternoon.  It was embarrassing to see a political person of his stature give the official replies from his brief but plead total ignorance when asked simple, straightforward supplementary questions.  His young support, the Minister of State, was not much better.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has under review virtually everything in his Department that requires a change of legislation.  Alternatively, there is a task force considering it or he is looking at the matter.  He is such a Speedy Gonzales that on 5 July 1977 a new name was given to the Department of Local Government called the Department of the Environment. In answer to repeated questions as to what that meant exactly in administrative terms, six months later in February he announced that he was setting up an environmental council to advise him more or less on what the Department should be doing, other than administer environmental legislation introduced by his predecessor, Deputy Tully.  Having made the announcement in February 1978 about the establishment of the environmental council he attempted to announce this morning in the House, in the manner of his colleague, Deputy Wilson, that the goodies had arrived and that he was going to name the council tomorrow at a Press reception but he did not do it with the same élan and style as his colleague.  I should like to know why it took a year to do it.</P>
    <P>If this is an indication of the collective experience of Fianna Fáil in an area that does not cost money, is it not reasonable to tell such a party and administration that they are moving far too slowly, that they have no excuse for this and that in theory they have all the experience and expertise behind them to move faster?  One can only <Col N="2584" /> conclude that on that side of the House are a conservative administration who are simply concerned with running the country but not in any way responding to the extraordinary process of change occurring in our society.  They are not attempting to ensure that the social injustices generated by that internal change at least are modified in favour of the weak and the poor and those least capable of looking after themselves. This is the end of the first lap of what is normally a four lap race.</P>
    <P>I conclude by repeating that while I welcome the advances that have been made in some areas by this fresh administration there are enough danger signals marked on the wall and displayed in the form of some of the individual Ministers in this Cabinet and in the collective approach of this Government to suggest that somehow between now and three years' time when, hopefully, there will be some reckoning, the capacity to produce endlessly the litany of goodies that the Minister for Education was so eager to produce today is going to dry up. At that time the cost of the drought will not fall on those people most capable of carrying it, but, regrettably, on people who, because of the economic system we have become totally vulnerable in that situation.  I do not know where it is written that in times of economic hardship or recession it is first the weak who must bear the brunt of these cutbacks.  I do not know what kind of economic law it is that states that it is right and proper for the development of an economy that when things get bad and the storm gets really rough you throw overboard those who cannot swim and keep on board the people, who, in theory, are well able to look after themselves. The whole ideological and philosophical basis of this Government as expressed in the Green Paper appears to be based on that principle.  I regret that very much.</P>

      <P>: He was prepared to give some welcome to sections of the Green Paper and a fair amount of credit for what we have done in the last 12 months.  He said that he welcomed the Green Paper because he felt, rightly, that it would raise the level of debate in this House.  I am amazed that he did not have a word in the ear of Deputy Cluskey, the leader of his party, who chose to use the instance of the Adjournment debate not as a debate on the Green Paper, as Deputy Quinn obviously would like him to have done, but as a diversionary tactic.  Maybe he has not read and studied it.</P>
      <P>It was said in one of yesterday's newspapers that maybe there should be a summer school for politicians where they could study it and have it explained.  If they are short of professors over there to explain the Green Paper to them maybe we could send over our doctors from this side of the House to make up for the unfortunate absence of another doctor on that side of the House to explain the significance of the Green Paper.</P>

      <P>: I was amazed to hear Deputy Cluskey using a diversionary tatic and trying to say that the Green Paper was a non-starter and it was this and it was that, and talking about the leadership situation in Fianna Fáil. All this was from a man who himself was deadlocked in a leadership race and who obviously is now leading a party that his deputy leader was not too anxious to lead&mdash;because it is generally accepted that in the final and second ballot his deputy leader would not even vote for himself.  If that is the confidence that the leader and his deputy have in their party, Deputy Quinn should think seriously about coming over here.  He comes from the right roots and we would <Col N="2586" /> have a certain amount in common.  He expounds a different philosophy from that of this side of the House.  I am open to be convinced, but I have not seen anywhere around the world that the philosophy that he expounds has worked as yet.</P>
      <P>We are a democratically elected Government, elected by the people on a programme put before them, and on that we must work.  I tell Deputy Quinn and everybody else who is worried about our stay in power that we ensured our stay in power in the past and I have little doubt that we will ensure it in the future.  All we hear from the far side of the House are the words &ldquo;impossible,&rdquo;&ldquo;impracticable&rdquo;, &ldquo;unimpressed&rdquo; about both the Green Paper and the record of this Government since we came to office.  These words were used this time last year as a condemnation of our election manifesto.  They re-echo the words we heard in the sixties when Senator Whitaker's plan for economic development in Ireland was produced. I am not surprised, because it takes some time for a document like the Green Paper to be studied and digested. It is a discussion document pointing out the options, where the Government intend to go and where we have no doubt the Irish people intend to go.  We have no doubt in our minds that the overwhelming vote of confidence given to us last June was a clear indication from the Irish people that we were to lead them out of the <i>cul-de-sac</i> in which they found themselves back to the road that would lead to where they would find hope for the future and confidence in their own ability to solve their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am new to this House as is Deputy Quinn, but I know that the reality of politics is that you put your programme before the people and they will be the judges at the end of the day.  We have always accepted their judgment and we will be delighted to continue to do so.  The thinking at the other side of the House is sterile, though not to the same extent with Deputy Quinn as it is with other Deputies whom I have heard in this debate.  One would have thought that with the change in leadership which had to come about in Fine Gael as <Col N="2587" /> well as in the Labour Party there would be a new way of thinking and something constructive and positive to be heard in this debate.  Such was not forthcoming.  With the great show that they put on for the media and the outside world with their specially handpicked delegates coming to their ArdFheis&mdash;fill it up with young ones, we do not want the old fellows, we have to present a new image&mdash;one would have thought that, having tried to present that image on television and the other media we would get more positive thinking from them.  After such a pepped-up performance I would have expected to hear more from them.  If they had been in the World Cup, like Scotland they would have finished in the same situation, all pepped up and nowhere to go.</P>

      <P>: We do not have to move a stage down half way in the RDS to make the show on television that 3,000 is equal to 7,000.  I do not believe that 3,000 ever equalled 7,000 but some people try to convince us that it does.  The same thing goes for the criticisms we hear of the famous job creation programme initiated by Fianna Fáil.  They believe the live register one month when it suits them to do so and they do not believe it the next month.  They said last June that we were presenting a fairytale document and they are now saying that we have presented another fairytale document.  But the results are there.  We could not have expected anything more pleasing than to be able to say to the people after our first year in office that we have a birthday present of a reduction in unemployment down to under 100,000 for the first time in many years and inflation down to 6½ per cent, the lowest since 1970.  The £1 in your pocket can buy more for you, for the workers, for the socially deprived and for the Government because they will have more money to use and to go around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the kind of action the people, especially the young people, voted for last June.  The live register shows a <Col N="2588" /> figure of 99,000 and there are people who say that despite that, 10,000 more jobs were not created.  I have heard academics on the far side of the House agree with this side that for every eight jobs we create only five come off the live register.  If we reducd the live register by 10,000, then we produce not 10,000 jobs but 16,000 jobs.  I have little doubt that that is the more realistic figure and, if we could find out accurately, I believe the figure would be even higher.  I do not see the queues of unemployed that are talked about here.  The only yardstick the people of Longford, who elected me to this House, can use is the expansion and development that has taken place and the people will judge Fianna Fáil, as they will judge me, on our performance.  The whole country was stagnating and anyone who does not believe what I am saying can go down to Longford and see for himself what is happening there.</P>
    <P>Longford has raised its head.  We have a road allocation of £1,200,000, which is 70 per cent more than we got from the Coalition last year.  We have approvals for water schemes and sewage schemes and the allocation is almost double what it was last year. We have a housing allocation sufficient to meet the needs of the programme devised for the county.  We have a very large extension in industrial projects large and small.  Two American companies have come in. One will produce 400 jobs at stage one and the second will produce 100 jobs at stage one.  But the former will go on to 800 jobs at stage two and the latter to 170 jobs at stage two.  We had the pleasure of having the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in Longford to open four small factories in one day, a record for any Minister as far as I am aware.  We are building an industrial structure with the small industry complementing the large industry and we will have jobs for all our people, possibly not the kind they all want to do but certainly sufficient jobs over the next couple of years, and, when the time comes, I will face the people down there with a job well done and tell them what the record is.  I will say to my opponents; &ldquo;There is the record.  Beat it <Col N="2589" /> if you can.&rdquo;  I have spelled out the jobs that have been created and the jobs that are coming forward.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has benefited from the great bonanza which the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Gibbons, brought back from Brussels.  I heard it said he was looking for 2 per cent or 1½ per cent and that that was not enough. But the Minister for Agriculture played his part properly and he came back with a bonanza of 8 per cent for Irish farmers, which will put an extra £100 million into the pockets of the farming community in a full year.</P>
    <P>We are developing every facet which will increase production.  I do not believe for one moment the statistics thrown around here about the live register.  I employed 38 people last October and, when I went to check the register, 8 of these people came off the live register.  I do not say that is the criterion for the whole country. The criteria for rural Ireland are different from those of urban areas. I have no doubt the situation has changed dramatically.  Confidence has returned.  Confidence in investment has returned.  The incentive to work has been restored.  The incentive to invest has likewise been restored.  Self-respect has been given back to the people after four-and-a-half years of doom and gloom.</P>
    <P>Any fair-minded person looking at the record of the Government would be proud to be Irish.  The Fianna Fáil Government have lifted the people out of the doldrums.  They have led the people out of the <i>cul-de-sac</i> and put them back on the right road.  Having brought the economy so far it is now our duty to sustain it and keep it on a proper course.  It is our duty to point the way forward.  The Green Paper has been produced as a basis for discussion.  It points the options required to cure the major problems from which the nation suffers.  I was amazed at the sterile arguments and phony hypocrisy on the other side of the House when major problems were there for discussion.  I have come in here to help to offer solutions.</P>
    <P>I could not attempt to deal with the Green Paper in the short time at <Col N="2590" /> my disposal, but the biggest problem that confronts us is job creation.  We know there are influences affecting us and other countries.  In modern technology the machine is replacing the man.  We must face up to that. We should be looking seriously at our taxation and grant structures to see if we can narrow the gap between the machine and the man.  Trade unionists talk about the cost.  The cost to them is one thing but the gross cost to the employer is 27 per cent more, and when trade unionists look for wage increases and try to equate them with the cost of production they ignore the 27 per cent extra cost added on to what the man brings home on Friday night in his pay package.  They will tell you that what the man brings home on Friday night is his pay package. They will tell you that what the man brings home on Friday is what counts. When we talk about job creation and job sharing we must face realities.  We must look at the situation as it is.  If a man is earning £60 a week on continuous overtime he will naturally not want to find himself in the position of having to take home less.  With the overtime he has improved his standard of living.  It has become his way of life.  To try to sell him the idea that he should take less in order to help his friend down the road to find work is simply not on.</P>
    <P>I take a different approach.  We have millions invested in factories all over the country and that investment for the most part lies idle for 16 hours out of every 24.  It is used for just eight hours a day.  I believe the Government should consider a labour subsidy to enable an employer to take on the same number of people on an additional shift.  When a shift system is introduced there is a gap of 12 to 20 per cent to be made up for those who have to go off after the ordinary eight-hour day on to shift work.  The man earning £60 a week will get 20 per cent of that £60, which is £12 a week, as his shift allowance, and he will be quite happy with that, as I have proved in my own operations, because he will not be reducing his standard of living and, concomitant with that the employer will be able to take on extra staff provided there is a subsidy <Col N="2591" /> during the time he will need to develop his markets at home or abroad. Shift working can be a way of reducing overheads and unit costs.</P>
    <P>I would like to see this area pursued with vigour and determination. The employers could be given an incentive to export their products or to review their costs in the home market. They will not do that at the moment because they are afraid to stick out their necks.  I know there is a market for their products because I am in the market place very often.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Taoiseach say that a definite emphasis was being put on the processing of food and that agriculture was to be the main thrust in the revival of our economy.  I have always believed that grass is our greatest natural resource.  We have the best grasslands in the world and can produce the finest agricultural products. We are exporting our raw materials to create the jobs in other countries which are badly needed at home.  I was glad to hear that emphasis was being put on quality Irish food.  As a small nation we can specialise in the production of such food.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to hear the Opposition spokesman for agriculture saying he did not believe we could process food on an economical scale.  I do not take that view.  As I said I am often in the market place and I know there is plenty of room for processing quality foods.  This country can facilittate small food producers who are willing to specialise.  These firms can send their representatives to find out what products are needed, because there is no point in producing a commodity if there is no demand for it. We are in the Common Market with access to 250 million people.  We have first-class raw materials.  It is time we stopped thinking that somebody else will solve our problems.  The main thrust must come from agriculture. There are many difficulties ahead because this is not an area in which we specialised in the past.</P>
    <P>I have heard arguments on the live versus the dead trade.  I do not believe in doing away with the live trade because we need the raw materials for <Col N="2592" /> our processing industries.  I do not believe that if we stopped the live trade tomorrow we would be better off.  Everybody in the business knows that we need the live trade as an insurance policy, as a safety valve to ensure that the farmer gets a true price.  In 1974 we saw the collapse of our cattle market and advantage was taken of the producers, and the small producer carried the can.</P>
    <P>We are killing 1,100,000 cattle for the export trade.  We are putting sides of beef into containers and letting somebody else cut it up and prepare it for the customer.  We are taking the easy, the lazy way out.  We are losing jobs which could be done by our children and eventually their children.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot solve all our unemployment problems; they need the will of the people to do that. We cannot stand aloof and say that this is somebody's else's problem.  This is what history has shown us to be and this is what history has made us.  Because we have been downtrodden for so long we are a dependent people and look to somebody else to solve our problems.  Years ago people in the country looked to the county councils to solve their problems.  As television became more popular they started to look to Dublin and now they are looking to Brussels to solve their problems. Nobody owes us a living.  It is time we solved our own problems, and the Government can only do that with the full co-operation of the people.  I do not believe our people are not prepared to take up this challenge, because they are the same people who came through the famine and who faced crisis after crisis, even Coalition crisis in 1948, the fifties and the seventies.  I was a victim of the fifties crisis.</P>

      <P>: I know where the Coalition went wrong.  They never inspire confidence in anybody, even in themselves.  Maybe Fine Gael are not satisfied with their new leader.  I read a survey in today's paper which shows they have lost ground since the survey carried out last October or November We have no leadership problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2593" /> This country needs direction and leadership.  We have the leadership and the confidence to transmit to the people the magnitude of the problem facing us.  Every person born in this country retains an Irish characteristic. Given the tools they are prepared to do the job.  I am not very handy around the house but if I have to do a job I make the best of it and I am no different from any other Irish person.</P>
    <P>Our schools are turning out thousands of young people with academic qualifications because their parents believed that was the kind of education to have.  In my view a person should be suited for his job.  One of our big problems is that many of our young people are not suited to their jobs and were never shown the direction their education should take.  I do not want to look back, I prefer to look forward.</P>
    <P>The measures taken by the Government are short term.  The AnCO apprenticeship and training schemes and the schemes run by the Department of Education are also short term. In my constituency we have taken full advantage of these schemes by showing the young people where the long term and short term vacancies are.  This big training problem must be faced and the young people will have to be trained.  We must do something about giving them practical experience.  We know from the advertising pages of our newspapers that there is no scarcity of jobs.  The jobs are there but where are the people to fill them? Many young girls with their leaving and intermediate certificates also know shorthand and typewriting.  Every job says &ldquo;experience required&rdquo; or &ldquo;experience an advantage&rdquo;.  These young people do not have the necessary experience. We should encourage industry and commercial concerns to give these girls on-the-job training. Since the State has not the facilities to tackle this major problem we should be encouraging industrialists to become involved in the training of these girls in order that there would be hope for them for the future.  They could be given, say, 12 months training in <Col N="2594" /> industry but with the State footing the bill for their training.  Although there would be some loss in production during the period in training the effort would be worth while in the long run.  I am sure that commercial concerns would be willing to co-operate in such schemes.</P>
    <P>Parents have always considered that the best second-level education for their children was to be obtained in secondary schools and that a boy or girl who had a leaving certificate was equipped for a good place in life. As one who obtained the leaving certificate I can say that not once was I asked to produce it.  The jobs of the eighties are in the industrial sphere, and that is why we must concentrate to a far greater extent on technical education. There is a great shortage of trained personnel in the technological field.  Therefore, parents should encourage their children to opt for education in this area.  Our schools are doing a fine job in providing this type of education, but perhaps more educational facilities in the technological field are required.</P>
    <P>There is far too much emphasis on third-level education.  A boy who has a skill will find it much easier to get a job than will someone who has been through the academic stream.  In addition a person in the technological sphere will be likely to be paid more than somebody in the academic sphere. The main thrust of our economy is centred in our agricultural industry, but this must be expanded by industrialising that industry more.  I look forward during my time in the House to see definite moves in this direction. I am partly involved in that side of the operation and I am aware of the opportunities in the market.  I welcome the announcement this week from the Industrial Credit Corporation that money will be made available on a ten-year period basis and at fixed interest rates for people in small food-processing companies.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas that I should like to comment on but, hopefully, at some time in the future we shall have an opportunity of discussing further this Green Paper.  As was mentioned in one of the newspapers <Col N="2595" /> yesterday, we do not need a summer school to tell us what is contained in the Green Paper.  We have read it and we know what it contains.  Many of the items in it provide plenty of scope for thought.  I trust that it will be given the consideration it deserves and that each of us here will get on with the job that the people elected us to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the few moments remaining to me I would like to make a number of remarks which may be timely at the termination of a year's business of this Dáil.  Clearly it is impossible to go into the various aspects in any depth.</P>
      <P>It is my sincere impression that one of the primary questions which should be before us is that of considering some method of overhauling our system of Dáil business.  There is an urgent need for Dáil reform.  The adjournment of the Dáil this evening for four months can be nothing but a bad example to people who are exhorted continuously to increase productivity. Apart from that consideration it is regrettable that there is being suspended for this period the opportunity which is afforded by the democratic system of regular scrutiny and evaluation of the process of Government. During the coming four months we shall have government by Cabinet without the appropriate public examination and scrutiny which the working of Parliament permits.  Such a situation would be avoidable if we were all of the one mind in that regard.  I am not talking about this Government but about future governments and the way in which the country is to be run generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fundamentally we are talking about the relevance of this Assembly.  I am conscious of a gradual trend towards irrelevance.  I get the impression that we in this Chamber do not, except in a peripheral way, deal with the business of the nation, that this task is undertaken to some extent behind our backs, that we are players on the wing and that the central stage is dominated by the Cabinet of the day and by their civil servants.  Occasionally we are given a piece of legislation <Col N="2596" /> on which to chew for a short period. We chew on it for as long as we believe there is meat in it for whatever purpose we wish to use it and then we go on to something else.  We should be a much more meaningful Assembly.  There is the impression that in a sense we are here merely to express views for the record rather than to listen intently to the proceedings. I am as guilty as anybody else in that respect.  At the end of the year I ask myself where I have listened with the appropriate respect, courtesy and intensity to what has been said, particularly by the people opposite, and I am inclined to think that I have been remiss in this respect.  I am sure that the situation is not much different in reverse.  This is sad because cumulatively there is among us a great depth of resource, of expertise and of ability to contribute to our national welfare.  However, the structures we have make of us what we are. Ultimately, the question will be whether we dominate those structures or whether they dominate us.  The evidence now is that they dominate us and that we are unable or unwilling to ask ourselves now and again whether this assembly and, indeed the Seanad also, are fitting forums for the business with which we must deal. Even those businesses in the country that are only semi-efficient will have a monitoring process for regular reconsideration of their goals and objectives in order to ascertain whether targets are being met.  I am not aware of any such process in this most central of all organisations.</P>
    <P>Recently, for example, we have been discussing Estimates for amounts that have been either spent or allocated already and not one penny of which will be changed by anything that is said here.  In the literal sense we are a reactionary Chamber.  Legislation is introduced as a reaction to pressures or lobbies or to political commitments, sometimes of a dubious nature.  We seem to be unable to respond to the need to discuss in a meaningful way business of an urgent and serious nature.  We deal with one or two expedient measures and are not really the proper forum for the debate that is required.  We should be <Col N="2597" /> much more responsive to public, social and political needs.</P>
    <P>One could be negative all the time, but there are many changes we could make.  For instance, we could have a type of pre-legislative forum at which the best of all the ideas in the House could be pooled into the perameters of the proposed legislation.  It would make not alone for less intransigent opposition but for much better legislation, to the benefit of everybody.  For example we might consider some sort of pre-legislative forum where the best of all ideas in this House could be pooled into the parameters of proposed legislation the appropriate Minister would have before him.  Is it correct that the Committee Stage of a Bill should hold up the central forum of this House while all other business remains in the queue behind it?  I doubt it, and I think most people would agree.  We should have some system of being able to introduce urgent business in a serious way.  That does not exist at present.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, the Dáil should be the focal point of considered, deliberate and progressive change.  I see no evidence of such at present.  It is regrettable, because the quality of our endeavour and the output will be more important always than the number of hours, days or weeks we spend here. In fairness, if one looks at either the quality or quantity of what we have been doing, I suggest neither has been great.  That is not to say that Deputies and Ministers are all on holiday for four months as and from this evening. That is a popular and rather irritating myth particularly for somebody who is fulltime like myself, who will find the same work in terms of quantity there tomorrow as today.  The quality and orientation will change slightly but certainly there will be an enormous volume of work with which I will have to contend the same as everybody else.</P>
    <P>We have had the White Paper, the Green Paper, the manifesto and possibly a gold paper prior to the next election&mdash;a slim and nebulous library. I wonder if the real jobs in all of that are being created only for the printers and paper manufacturers involved in the production of these documents.  It <Col N="2598" /> seems to me that what we have been doing really has been a kind of economic shadow-boxing, creating a climate in which people will expect and accept certain cutbacks when the time comes.  I would have hoped that Governments, and Ministers particularly, would enjoy the processes of decision&mdash; making.  Yet the most popular words&mdash; and here I am not being particularly critical of this Government; I do not know what the previous situation was but I suspect it was not very much different&mdash;are &ldquo;review&rdquo;, &ldquo;reconsideration&rdquo;, &ldquo;in-depth studies&rdquo;, &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    <P>There appears to be no real willingness to make decisions, even sometimes in the knowledge that if one makes decisions one will make the occasional wrong one but that perhaps even a wrong decision now and again is better than no decision; on the basis that, if one makes decisions more often than not they will turn out to be good decisions.  The representatives of the people have common sense, understand what they are about here, have a mandate and should get on with the job.  Instead of that we have a tremendous amount of kicking to touch for various reasons.  Therefore, there is enormous opportunity for inspiration, for leadership, for guidance to young people who want to believe in this Assembly, who want to believe in the Government of the day in the hope that they will give them a lead.  That has been lost.</P>
    <P>We have had Estimates considered. The Estimate for Education was not an Education Estimate; it was a financial statement of the cost of education. It showed no consideration of the need for new forms of education, new ideas and thinking in education.  Incidentally, I should say that I consider the Minister for Education as one of the more adventurous, progressive and dynamic Ministers in the Government.  One turns then to Estimates such as that for the Department of the Environment where the Minister's opening statement was very revealing.  He appeared to be mesmerised by the sheer size of the Estimate. The question of any new idea or thinking about local government structures <Col N="2599" />&mdash;incidentally many of the ideas were committed in that now famous manifesto&mdash;has fallen by the wayside. In the area of justice we did not have an opportunity of looking at the Estimate in depth.  Again we saw no visionary steps.  That is particularly sad because justice is the kind of area, as is education, in which if one got the format right, with goodwill all around, with a desire to make basic changes, enormous social good could follow for the community at all levels. It does not happen.  We have not considered many of the types of changes in the area of justice which would be very receptive to implementation and worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The same would apply to other Ministries.  For example, take that of Fisheries where we had the sell-out of the century about which nobody seemed to bother very much, very different from the kinds of sounds being made prior to the last general election &mdash;a narrow traditional view of these various Ministries inherited and, unfortunately, accepted by some Ministers. It is sad.  Surely the first days of any new Government must be seen as a time for brave new steps, which may not all be in the right direction but which, on balance, would be right. What has happened is that we have a Government which is fundamentally reactionary.</P>
    <P>Cá bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta, geallúint briste eile?  We had various promises when people pledged certain steps which have not been taken. I am not that worried in that respect except in so far as it would hurt young people who have a vision and hope for the future; we on this side of the House do not want to make them cynical no more than anybody else. If, early in the next session, we took an hour or two off to consider ways and means of utilising the best talents of this House to greater effect&mdash; perhaps, in the first stage, by having an All-Party Committee on Dáil Reform to ascertain if we could administer the business of the House in a more efficient way&mdash;I have no doubt the country as a whole would respond to that gesture and be the beneficiary.</P>
    <Col N="2600" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>: We have had a longish debate in which there has been fairly full participation by Members from all sides of the House.  Most speakers addressed themselves to the Taoiseach's opening statement, to the motion put by him that we comment on the Green Paper on development for full employment and that we adjourn.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper contains within its covers much that the Government have been discussing over the past year. As the Taoiseach pointed out it follows logically on the elements in the White Paper earlier this year.  The claim from the Government side is that the White Paper contains the genesis of a plan which will be finalised, hopefully, in discussions with employers and unions which will be chaired, as we understand it, by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this point in the year, when unemployment has dropped for the first time in so many years, the Government may say that much in their garden seems fair.  But they would be the first to concede that the seasonal improvement now taking place in em-ployment&mdash;which reflects this reduced figure on the register&mdash;surely would not have been possible if in the years since 1975 economic recovery had not been under way.  I am satisfied, and it is the Labour Party's contention, that the improvement shown in the unemployment register is such that can give us confidence of an average reduction over this year of 20,000 in the Live Register.  We would say that the limited improvement taking place&mdash;assisted by such seasonal factors as normally take place in summer, increased construction activity and so on&mdash;would not have been possible had we not recorded extraordinary growth in exports from the latter part of 1975 onwards, in 1976 and 1977.  We should not quibble here&mdash;nor has there been much evidence during the debate from this side of the House at any rate&mdash; that whatever improvement has taken place is, in most part due to the actions of an administration in which the Labour Party had a say.  Fundamentally we consider that though there has <Col N="2601" /> been an improvement it is still not sufficient to take up the slack or to assure every young man and woman of a job.  Finally, we see it as purely a seasonal phenomenon.  There has been an improvement in employment.  But we consider that, with the on-coming autumn and winter, with increased numbers of young people leaving schools and colleges, once more, regrettably, the unemployment situation will become even more severe.</P>
    <P>Our chief disappointment is that the Green Paper appears, even as an option, to suggest no new policy departure; it appears to be content to rely, in the main, on existing policies. We were still awaiting the kind of action we were promised in the White Paper when we read the Green Paper. It depends on what happens in the discussions with employers and unions as to whether the later more definitive White Paper we are promised in October will be better than the previous productions.  That is our chief indictment of Government policy as we come to this last day of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Apart from the deficit budget they ran this year, the kind of borrowings they undertook, we cannot see any evidence of the radical policies promised by them, that would demonstrate that they were ready to embark on policies that would make full employment a reality in the eighties.  Instead as a poor substitute for these socalled radical new policies we have work sharing.  Whatever else may be said, it cannot be maintained that work sharing is a new policy.  It has been around in EEC circles for many years now and it cannot be suggested that it has much chance of acceptance here.  That is a matter which will be taken up when the social partners discuss it with Professor O'Donoghue.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, it is not quite clear what the terms of reference of the Minister will be, when meeting the employers and the unions after the Dáil rises.  There was a suggestion that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development would not discuss financial matters with them, and the range of discussions to be opened between the Minister, the unions and the employers has yet to be ascertained.  I have some experience <Col N="2602" /> of meetings of this sort, and I know that there will be a legitimate expectation by the trade unions that positive proposals will be put before them.  I the Green Paper is to be taken as an expression of positive proposals, it does not take much imagination to foresee that the approaching discussions will not be as successful as perhaps some Members of the Government might wish them to be.  Indeed, it would be difficult to see them being successful in the absence of the kind of policies that will call forth union support.</P>
    <P>One suggestion for job creation from the trade unions was the establishment of a national development corporation.  That, as we know, was summarily rejected by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and instead the substitute idea of a consortium was proposed.  The evidence we have of the activity of that consortium to date does not suggest that any great activity can be expected from that quarter.  In fact the same kind of sluggish lack of progress evident there as in the employment action team from which so much was hoped a year ago in the area of youth employment.  There will be a critical approach by the unions in these talks in the absence of positive policies to deal with employment, and especially given the rather cursory rejection their policy proposals on employment by the Government.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is a tribute to the effectiveness, in the sense of its ability to win an election, of the manifesto that almost one year later the Taoiseach in his speech on the Green Paper could refer to it.  It appears that every work of this Government so far can be related to that originating document.  Indeed, the point has been made to some Ministers that so rich was that document in ideas that it largely accounts for the legislation in the first year's life of this Dáil.  The Taoiseach referred to the manifesto and the Green Paper refers to it.  Last Sunday in a radio programme the Minister for Finance said that the fundamental objective spelt out in the Green Paper is to achieve full employment and he challenged anyone who did not share that aspiration to <Col N="2603" /> state so and to make their positions clear.  The aspiration for full employment is shared by every Member of this House and I am sure by all members of the community.  That aspiration is as common as the aspiration for a united Ireland through peaceful means. The Taoiseach also referred to the manifesto as his authority for stating that the unity of Ireland by peaceful means is a common aspiration. The Minister will not get many takers to the challenge issued last Sunday, to those who would declare themselves as being against full employment. The Minister last Sunday said that the policies for full employment were spelled out in the Green Paper. They are not.  The Green Paper is almost in the same position of putting questions and options as was the White Paper last January.</P>
    <P>When the manifesto was first published, on which the Green Paper and the White Paper are based and to which the Taoiseach referred at the start of this debate, it offered the electorate an extraordinary solution to the complex problem of unemployment. The manifesto suggested that if they voted for the abolition of rates and motor car taxation and to reduce income tax, there would be a fall at the rate of almost 25,000 each year over the succeeding three years in unemployment.  That was the basis on which the manifesto was founded and on which the election was won.  The Taoiseach in his opening remarks supported the Green Paper, just as the Minister for Finance last Sunday supported full employment. The Minister last Sunday looked for adversaries of full employment and the Taoiseach at the start of this debate looked for those who would oppose the Green Paper that he supports. Which part of the Green Paper does the Taoiseach support?  Does the Taoiseach support the various cuts listed in the Green Paper, those unattractive grisly options which were not referred to at great length by Government speakers during this debate? Does the Taoiseach support the major portion of the Green Paper which is given over to fantasy?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2604" /> The fantasy in the Green Paper is in the claim that a strategy exists to deal with unemployment, that a policy has been spelt out in the Green Paper that will expand employment.  The grim realities for next year and the year after spelled out in the Green Paper are the cuts suggested in health, education and in local authority housing. Those are the realities in the Green Paper as distinct from the options.  Those are the realities that the representatives of the party of reality have been evading in this discussion during the last two days.  We read on page 6 of the Green Paper:</P>
    <P>This Green Paper proposes an ambitious programme for ending unemployment within five years.</P>
    <P>One feature which must be remarked on in relation to the white papers, green papers, or whatever colour they are called, produced by this administration is that they are always stronger in the preface than in the conclusion.  I have read no more stirring words for a long time than the preface to the Green Paper, as stated in the quotation I have just given.  It also states on the same page:</P>
    <P>The Government believe that the public is far more ready for the impact of radical policies than is commonly supposed&mdash;if they can be clearly seen to be effective in ending the evil of unemployment.</P>
    <P>There is no word more overused in the English language than &ldquo;radical&rdquo; as a description of policies, and I suppose politicians, as a class, are more responsible than others for denuding this word of any meaning, if it has any meaning now, which I doubt it has.  If that has been the fault of politicians in the past, this administration can be fairly charged with taking from the word &ldquo;radical&rdquo; by apportioning in their preface to the Green Paper, that description to the contents of the Green Paper.  There is a strong preface to the Green Paper. We are told to read the conclusions but there is no recipe for action and no certain suggestions in it for anybody's attention.</P>
    <P>The earlier pale production of this 84-man Government, the one called <Col N="2605" /> the White Paper, in page 5 of its preface states that it:</P>
    <P>&mdash;outlines the Government's thinking on the crucial issues of economic and social development and the measures proposed to deal with them.</P>
    <P>There is a lyrical touch in that preface to the White Paper, the harbinger of the Green Paper when it says:</P>
    <P>This White Paper is not intended to be a detailed plan.  This plan will emerge from a planning cycle which the Government intend to introduce from February to October of each year from now on.</P>
    <P>We will not go into the lyrical touches of that, but that is the preface.</P>
    <P>With regard to the citizen who has invested 90p for either the White Paper or the Green Paper we find a chapter, on page 67 of the White Paper, entitled &ldquo;Next Steps&rdquo; where it is stated:</P>
    <P>The development strategy laid out in this White Paper represents a positive and realistic attempt to set our economy on the road to national reconstruction.</P>
    <P>If the man who has bought the White Paper for 90p persists in his belief that there is some positive policy around the corner and hopefully spends another 90p on the Green Paper he will find in it under a chapter dealing with next steps that there is again this absence of detailed development. He will find in Chapter 6 under &ldquo;Further Action on Employment&rdquo; that it states:</P>
    <P>The introduction to this section of the Green Paper estimated an increase of about 22,000 non-agricultural jobs a year as being achieveable with the policies now in operation. The White Paper targets require an average of 29,000 jobs. There is thus, a potential gap of over 7,000 annually to be bridged.</P>
    <P>There is no development strategy spelled out in the preceding 62 pages before this chapter on Further Action on Employment in the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>The conscientious citizen who has <Col N="2606" /> purchased this Green Paper is told in the preface that it sets out an ambitious programme for ending unemployment within five years.  The actual production itself bears little evidence of the kind of policies that this man might expect which differ from policies pursued in the past and which are likely to bring about this result.</P>
    <P>If we look at Chapter 6 we find that it refers to an increase of about 22,000 non-agricultural jobs a year as being achievable with the policies now in operation.  It is assumed in the Green Paper that on existing policies we can produce 22,000 non-agricultural jobs a year and that this is achievable on existing targets. There is the further unproved assumption that the growth target this year will be 7 per cent, which is looking more and more doubtful but because it may be possible to get 7 per cent this year that a similar rate will be achieved in 1979 and 1980.</P>
    <P>These are the unproven assumptions in the Green Paper linked to employment projections, again stated to be achievable without any further proof. This is the kind of material that our gullible citizen, who spends 90p each on those two documents as an insight into the Government's thinking, will get as a reward for his careful reading, the runaround between the preface and Chapter 6, between great expectations in the preface and rather grim reality breaking in at the end, where we see unproven figures and no arguments spelled out in which growth rates can be achieved in the earlier portions of the study.</P>
    <P>This is the production which the Taoiseach told us at the start of this debate has his full support.  The feeling appears to be strong in Government circles that one should read back to the White Paper and if the White Paper supports the Green Paper's assumptions that somehow proves it. We have the position in which the party of reality are beginning to confuse the facts of ordinary life with the rhetoric of their productions, whether they are green or white.  The reasons for thinking that a 7 per cent growth rate, that 22,000 new jobs, will be created on existing policies, are <Col N="2607" /> scarcely discussed in the Green Paper. It ignores the major problems facing our economy over the next few years. It could be said of the Green Paper that it assumes all of those problems out of the way.</P>
    <P>We had in the White Paper of six months ago the statement that there would be promotion of new sources of enterprise both in the private and public sector.  Some of us who thought that there might be some evidence of fresh economic analysis and proposals coming from this administration perhaps also thought that we might get some evidence of a new approach by the Government on the use of State enterprise to promote new employment. We were disappointed because if that promotion of sources of new enterprise in the private and public sectors was promised in the White Paper it gets no attention at all in the Green Paper.  We are simply assured that existing policies will bring us 20,000 new non-agricultural jobs each year. The Green Paper avoids how over a three-year period those 66,000 new jobs are to be provided.  If one assumes that existing policies will give a growth rate over the next three years of 7 per cent and 22,000 new jobs every year, then, just because this Government have 84 Deputies presumably, <i>ergo</i> all we are looking for is 7,000 non-agricultural new industrial jobs each year.  That is the attempt of the Green Paper but the reality&mdash; and this is my fundamental argument &mdash;which breaks through the Green Paper is that the Tánaiste, if he remains in that job&mdash;and some think he may be called to higher things&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>: Maybe so.  What the Green Paper proposes for the Tánaiste's tender attention in the next two years will amount to a major deflationary impact on the economy, because over the next two years, the Green Paper tells us, the borrowing requirement will be reduced as a proportion of GNP by 5 per cent and the bulk of this reduction will have to come from deflationary measures <Col N="2608" /> either by increased taxation, reduced expenditure or both.  The Green Paper does not address itself to the most important question from our point of view&mdash;how are the high growth rates, presumed to continue for the next three years, to be maintained with the Exchequer looking for the extra cash it will be looking for?  How is that to be maintained in the face of the severe deflationary policies which the Green Paper spells out will be followed by this Government?  The Green Paper says that the economic stimulus of increasing State expenditure has to be less generous than in 1978.  The truth is that there will be no economic stimulus at all from the Government over the next two years if the Green Paper prescription is followed to the letter.  That is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that though the reduction in borrowing may be necessary it will not affect the economic performance over the next two years, that that somehow will be miraculously maintained.  Since the publication of the Green Paper the Minister for Economic Planning and Development has been restored to life.  He had been preserving what for him was an unaccustomed silence but now he is back and he has been losing his temper regularly on radio and television. The adrenalin is flowing at its accustomed rate for the Minister.  It is a good thing for the Government that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development has returned to the fray to explain what is up, because he has some explanations to make.  There are some difficulties to be overcome, some things we do not understand.  In January, with the publication of the White Paper, he told us that we were embarking on a gamble with taxpayers' money based on foreign debt.  After the publication of the Green Paper his task becomes more difficult.  In January he outlined the measures that would lead to expansion in the economy&mdash;pump priming, additional public investment, increased public spending, cuts in tax.  These were to restore confidence, and more jobs would follow. Now his task is to explain how cuts in public spending, and increases in taxation are to be without effect on the <Col N="2609" /> economy.  How are jobs to be maintained when more is to be taken out of the economy than is being put into it by the Government?  That is the job of explanation that now devolves on the Minister.</P>
    <P>In 1978 the Government pumped something like £330 million more into the economy than they pumped in in 1977 but in 1979 some £68 million more will be taken out of the economy than will be put in.  There will be a further net withdrawal of £51 million, on their figures, in 1980.  It is the unhappy task of the Minister to explain how all these things can be done and the job targets set out here attained as well.  Far from trying to suggest that we are on the high road to the achievement of additional employment, the members of this administration should be explaining how their policies will maintain existing employment.  A press conference was held and it excited some comment that on so important a subject it could boast only one Minister present, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. The correspondents were able to pick up the Green Paper and, like most people, add and subtract, and they turned to the Minister and his officials and said: &ldquo;There is to be a reduction in public investment by the Government&rdquo; but the Minister replied: &ldquo;There will be no cuts.  My friend Charles Haughey, the Minister for Health, will suffer no cuts.  My friend John Wilson will suffer no cuts.  We are resolved that no cuts will occur despite the fact that the Exchequer will be on the prowl for more money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has a difficult task to explain these apparent contradictions, but I suppose contradictions are the stuff of political life and if you are in a Fianna Fáil Cabinet conflicts and contradictions should not deter you. If these are the policies on which we are pinning our hopes the conclusion is inescapable.  Unemployment must begin its sad upward march once more in the late autumn and winter.  There is no good news in this Green Paper for the youth of this country.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the biggest challenge facing us is unemployment. The Green Paper fails to confront the <Col N="2610" /> major task of finding answers to solve unemployment.  The major task is the reorganising of the economy for adequate growth and output.  The Green Paper fails to confront such questions.  Because of this evasion there can be no confidence that unemployment will be reduced significantly during 1978, even if account is taken of the improvement during the summer.  One must seriously doubt that the Government's responses, consisting of an almost total reliance on the capacity of existing industry to provide more jobs, will prove adeqate. On the basis of the policy options in the Green Paper, there can be little hope held out to the nation's youth that unemployment will be significantly reduced in 1978.  It is difficult to accept that the unemployment register will fall during 1978, by the average predicted by the Government of 20,000.  It gives me no satisfaction to be unable to support the idea that there can be hope for the nation's youth.  The point needs to be stressed that continued high unemployment here carries as lethal a threat to the cohesion of our society as actual physical violence has wreaked in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing the people in the next two decades is immense, if emigration is not to be tolerated and if we are to approach full employment. Membership of the EEC will be a continuing reality and there are, as yet, no significant regional or industrial development policies at EEC level to compensate for the reduced capacity in national decision-making.  Growth prospects in industry in the postrecovery period do not envisage a significant reduction in unemployment in the years ahead.  Third World countries will properly demand in-increased access to EEC markets for agricultural and industrial products. At the same time, in order to produce the 30,000 net jobs a year required into the eighties the economy would need to grow continuously from 7 per cent to 9 per cent a year.</P>
    <P>It was the perceived failure of the previous administration to bring forward convincing policies to ameliorate the unemployment crisis that largely accounted for the election defeat.  The <Col N="2611" /> core of the appeal for young people of the Government's programme was their commitment to a massive effort to reduce unemployment by specific targets over the four years of their administration. If they renege on their commitment, this administration will reap a bitter whirlwind.  If the members of the Government are as serious about tackling unemployment as they were in Opposition, I recommend that they reassess their current employment policy.  They could begin by discarding the Green Paper.  Policy initiatives, whatever their source, should be examined on their merits.  The trade union recommendation that a national development corporation should be established to revitalise the State sector is worthy of more than the cursory rejection it was given.  I accept that the expansion of employment is an effort that would call for painful decisions by the people.  But those painful decisions, those real sacrifices that need to be made by people at work if full employment is to become a reality, are not brought forward by the kind of platform which brought this Government to power and which they are still stuck with.  The simple equation of that platform is to abolish rates and motor tax and automatically you have 25,000 more people off the unemployment register each year.  That kind of equation does not get support for the action that is required.</P>
    <P>The available figures from the statistics office show that emigration has started once more on a large scale. The provisional figures suggest that emigration is running at an annual rate of 14,000.  Emigration on this scale has not occurred since the sixties.  It will be the prime objective of the Labour Party to ensure that emigration is not seized upon by the Government to conceal their failure to provide adequate employment policies. Already we have the evidence of one member of the Government publicly stating that emigration might be a satisfactory way of dealing with our surplus labour.  The Labour Party and the trade unions must build a working unity with our youth to defeat acceptance of the emigration option by <Col N="2612" /> the policy makers of the Government. To this end I hope our first annual youth conference in November will be the first step in such a national campaign.</P>
    <P>The only policy that is worthy of being described as a new feature in the armoury of proposals for dealing with unemployment is work-sharing. It is not a new idea elsewhere&mdash;it has venerable currency at EEC level&mdash;but the first time it was mentioned here was in this paper.  For the record, the most recent reference to work-sharing was in a leaked inner discussion document from the Secretary of the Department of Labour to the OECD.  In 1975 this correspondence found its way into the papers by a route not discovered at the time.  The secretary was blameless in the matter.  I only instance it as an illustration that work-sharing is not a new idea, that it was being discussed at OECD level in 1975.  It is a flagrant misdescription to describe work-sharing as a radical or new policy.  Presumably work-sharing will be discussed with employers and unions.  Have those who framed the proposals for discussion any conception of the realities of industrial relations?</P>
    <P>Do they know, those who advise Ministers Colley and O'Donoghue, that overtime is considered an integral part of the wage rate throughout the country?  The Green Paper was to be the repository of radical policies. What do we find at the end of the day?  The bedraggled survivor of all these new policies and the only one that we can see in the Green Paper is work-sharing.  Were those who sponsored the inclusion in the Green Paper of work-sharing aware that no union negotiator would accept a reduction in overtime for his members without monetary compensation?  I present these facts because if they look over any State industry they will find these statements true.  If that is the material of discussion with unions and employers I wish the Minister for Economic Planning and Development luck: I wish him <i>bon voyage</i>, but from what I know of the reality of industrial relations I cannot see that his <Col N="2613" /> efforts to get acceptance for the idea of work-sharing will be crowned with any great success.</P>
    <P>I do not know what else he will discuss with the social partners.  He has had some experience of such discussions. Usually they ask what I think is a fair question at such discussions. &ldquo;What are your proposals?&rdquo;  I presume the Minister will refer to the Green Paper and that the discussion will come down to work-sharing.  Perhaps he will even put forward the ideas on cutting the health services.  Perhaps very good material for discussion at that level would be cutting back on local authority housing&mdash;one can imagine the enthusiasm with which that proposal would be greeted&mdash;perhaps even the cutbacks in education. In any case, he has a difficult task ahead, made more difficult when one considers that his colleague much earlier in the year rejected out of hand the trade union proposals for a national development corporation. When they suggested it, there was no support for the idea.</P>
    <P>The White Paper, we are told, is not intended to be a detailed plan&mdash;no, the detailed plan will emerge from a planning cycle which the Government intend to introduce from February to October each year from now on.  It is the Minister for Economic Planning and Development who will go into these discussions.  It is not clear whether his instructions will permit him to go into the areas of financial cuts, but he will not find a great possibility of support on the work-sharing question.  It is regrettable that the Minister cannot meet the unions and employers with a willingness to consider new policies for work creation; regrettable that he must assert as the Green Paper asserts, that existing policies would produce 22,000 new jobs each year.  After all, the trade union movement has its experts and economists who will ask him very fairly if our industrial arm up to now has found it impossible to achieve such an increase on an annual basis, how he expects that it will achieve the rate hoped for by him in the future in the absence of new policies.  They will put, to him, as this party has constantly <Col N="2614" /> put to the Government, the proposition: why not re-examine the possibility of expanding the State sector, of using the State to create new employment? Is there not a necessity for so doing when you consider the extent of foreign ownership in Irish industry? Even if you were not convinced of the ideological rightness of so doing, is there not a case to be made, if we want to prevent a complete takeover of Irish industry, for expanding the State sector?</P>
    <P>The Minister will find himself in these discussions with the unions depending on the unproven assumptions of the Green Paper.  He will not find himself, presumably, talking about Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach spoke about Northern Ireland at the opening of this debate and said that the central aim of their policy was to secure by peaceful means the unity and independence of Ireland, an aspiration which everybody in the House can subscribe to just as we can all subscribe to the aspiration of full employment.</P>
    <P>Last Sunday the Minister for Finance was vainly looking for a political party which opposed the aspiration of full employment.  I said earlier that I did not think he would get any takers for that challenge.  Again, in this debate we have the Taoiseach talking about the unity and independence of Ireland.  There is the implication in the Taoiseach's contribution that somehow he speaks for the entire Opposition.  He does not speak for me when it comes to Northern Ireland.  He does not speak for me if he thinks that continued iteration from this side of the Border of our desire for a united Ireland brings that aspiration nearer attainment.</P>
    <P>The essence of the Northern question, as I see it, is how can we from this side of the Border improve the climate up there to the extent that political institutions in which both sides of the community co-operate with one another can be brought about and the two sides brought nearer?  They are not brought nearer by politicians in Dublin constantly calling for the unity of Ireland.  There is much work for us to do on this side of the Border before we start talking about the unity of Ireland.  Everybody here subscribes <Col N="2615" /> to the objective of the unity of Ireland. I do; I hope the day will come as rapidly as possible and by peaceful means.  Meantime, the job is to consider how we get both sides up there to work with each other.</P>
    <P>That is the essence of the problem. The relationship between the two sides is not helped by speeches from this side of the Border, offers to unionists and so on.  Instead, let us look at our Constitution.  What changes does it need?  Let us look at it without seeking gain from the Northern side of the Border.  Let us look at the changes needed for the benefit of our own people.  Let us see that conditions in our part of the country are improved and ensure that nobody on the other side of the Border can say that this State is the property of any one religion.  These are the things we may do to improve the situation.  Constant rhetorical references to the effect that we desire the unity of Ireland&mdash;everybody knows that&mdash;do not help.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke of &ldquo;the central aim&rdquo;.  Is it any more central to the solution of the problem that we should call on the British to make a declaration?  Is not the essence of the problem, of the relationship, the suspicion, the legacy of centuries of suspicion between the two communities there?  Do all of us not know that the British are ready to go from that area whenever a working political relationship can be devised for the people of the area?  Not long ago I belonged to an administration who resolutely set their face against making political capital out of the Northern situation. There are many things one may say on this side of the Border that are politically popular but they do not advance the cause of better relations between Protestants and Catholics in the North of Ireland.  Even in Opposition we must set our face resolutely against that bad habit of appealing to opinion on this side of the Border only and not worrying about the impact on the Northern side.  This is particularly the job of the Labour Party.  We are a secular party, founded on working people, and it is our role particularly to improve relations between Catholics <Col N="2616" /> and Protestants in Northern Ireland and we have political relations with working people of both those religions in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach does not include me in the kind of statements and policies he has been expressing on that question. The Government called for active consideration of the Green Paper.  We say the policies are not in it and they accuse us of being bad patriots.  The Minister for Finance has said that if a person does not agree with what is in the Green Paper it means he is for unemployment.  That was the simple message he propagated last Sunday on radio.  Of course, he is a man who believes in broad brush strokes.  In the sixties he discovered low standards in high places&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the sixties it was &ldquo;low standards in high places&rdquo; and last Sunday it was &ldquo;for employment or for unemployment&rdquo;. Presumably all those not enamoured of the proposals in the Green Paper are for unemployment. All we are saying is that we cannot agree with these proposals.  We are like the child looking at the emperor who had no clothes; we see there are no policies in the Green Paper.  What does the Minister want us to do?  Does he want us to refer to the White Paper? The White Paper told us to refer to the Green Paper.  I have spoken of the predicament of the conscientious citizen who put forward 90p for the White Paper and he was told what the next <Col N="2617" /> steps would be on page 67.  He turns to the Green Paper and he finds that the next steps are still later.  This is why we cannot have any confidence in the Government's policy on employment. We cannot find in it the material to support.</P>

      <P>: First, I would ask the indulgence of the House.  The content of my speech may annoy the Government but I am afraid the quality of my voice will annoy the whole House, including my own colleagues.</P>
      <P>This party, as Deputy O'Leary has been saying about his party, are positive towards economic development.  In so far as this Government's policies actually secure sustainable employment they will have our support.  The problem of jobs naturally transcends party politics.  There is nothing to be gained by trying to make a party political issue out of it.  The suggestion that one party has some monopoly of not just wisdom but of idealism in this respect is unworthy of any serious politician.  However, there can be&mdash; and in a democracy normally there will be&mdash;legitimate differences over the means of attaining specific goals, and in an area of economics as difficult as that of achieving full employment it is inevitable that there would be fairly deep differences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We laid the foundations for growth in the closing period of our administration. The Taoiseach and other Ministers have recognised this in what they have said of the economic situation in 1977 which, in the nature of things, reflected almost totally the effects of National Coalition policies and not perceptibly those of Fianna Fáil policies.  Indeed, given the time-lag in economic affairs between action taken and the ensuing consequences, it is probably fair to say that, with certain specific exceptions such as the Government action with regard to road tax last summer, virtually nothing that has happened in the period up to now has been the result of this Government's policies.  I recognise that there are certain exceptions&mdash;the road tax remissions and possibly some additional employment in the public service, although I should prefer <Col N="2618" /> to await the final figures for the numbers in the public service at the end of the year before I would be constrained to admit any faster growth in that area than was achieved under our administration.</P>
    <P>From now on Fianna Fáil are on their own.  The effects of what we did have worked their way through the system.  The effects of the actions taken by the Government since they came into office will be seen in what happens from this point onwards.  It would be wrong for us to claim credit for any major part of the economic events that are about to ensue.  It would be wrong for the Government to try to escape responsibility for any significant part of whatever may happen, or for us not to give the Government credit for achievements that may ensue in the period from now onwards.</P>
    <P>In the nature of things, this first year has been an interim year in which the carry-over effects of our policies have brought this country into a position that is unique in the EEC and almost unique in the industrialised world in terms of the rate of economic growth achieved and have brought us to a position that, in terms of the reduction of inflation, is extremely satisfactory. In his speech the Taoiseach referred to the reduction in the rate of inflation, and he mentioned some of the reasons for it.  He was, perhaps uncharacteristically, a little ungenerous in not giving credit to our Government for some of the actions which we took such as the special budget in 1975 which reduced the cost of living by 4 per cent. There was also the removal of VAT on food and clothing, tax remissions, and there were measures in relation to the tripartite talks which facilitated wage rounds that helped to keep down inflation and which probably played the major part in contributing to the reduction in inflation to the very low level that it has attained, at least for the moment.  The reduction in inflation, with the exception of one or two minor adjustments made by Fianna Fáil which affected the cost of living index, derives entirely from our policies.  The question is, where does inflation go from here?  Does it remain at 6.2 per cent, or will it rise in the months and years ahead?  That is one of the tests <Col N="2619" /> by which the Government will be judged.</P>
    <P>Before the last election we prepared our plans for further economic development. We put these plans to the people in our election programme.  The people chose otherwise because of the immediate financial benefits offered to them and because of the skill&mdash;and it was skill&mdash;with which the idea was sold to them that by the simple act of accepting financial largesse from the hands of a new Government they would, in some miraculous way, be helping to produce full employment.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper now published has destroyed that illusion.  It has shown that the price to be paid for these short-term benefits is a higher level of taxation than ever before by 1980.  On this point the White Paper perpetrates an inaccuracy.  I am not entitled in the House to use a stronger word.  Despite its name, <i>Development For Full Employment</i>, the Green Paper is not primarily about job creation, though it purports to be that. Of course, it produces figures for the number of extra jobs that would be created with present policies, although it offers no explanation as to how these figures are arrived at.  The White Paper says even less on that.  The only figure I can find for which there is any authority whatever as regards jobs to be produced by present policies is the 10,000 for manufacturing industry, which at least has the authority of the IDA behind it.  The Green Paper produces the figures that it says would be created with present policies and it tells us how many more jobs can be created by the White Paper policy without linking the policies to the figures in any meaningful way so far as economic analysis is concerned.  It tells how many more jobs would have to be created to end unemployment and offers, too, alleged options toward that end.</P>
    <P>All this playing around with job figures is dust thrown in the eyes of the public to ensure that when readers come to chapter 7, headed &ldquo;Financial Implications,&rdquo; they will not be able to observe clearly the con trick involved <Col N="2620" /> in this chapter.  This chapter is the key chapter in this report, the chapter around which this report is built, but has nothing to do with job creation. There is not one word on the subject in the whole chapter.  The nearest this chapter comes to dealing with the question of job creation, supposed to be central to this document, is in the tables towards the end where if you read the small print figures it emerges that this Government propose to restore in 1979-80 the ½ per cent&mdash;6 per cent to be precise&mdash;of GNP by which productive public capital expenditure was reduced by Fianna Fáil in the current year.</P>
    <P>That table shows that Fianna Fáil cut productive public capital expenditure from 5.5 per cent of GNP to 4.9 per cent in 1978; and it tells us that they are going to push it back to the figure at which we left it, which was 5.5 per cent, and to keep it at that in the years ahead.  Apart from that figure, which obviously has a relationship to job creation but does not suggest any additional impetus to job creation, there is not one word in this crucial chapter about employment or jobs.  I challenge Deputies and the public to read the chapter and tell me if I have missed something in it that relates these financial proposals to employment.  I can find nothing.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to generate 7 per cent growth in 1979 and 1980 in the face of the massive deflation proposed and spelled out in detail in this chapter. At least I give the Government credit for being frank about their plans.  This process, with no increase whatever in the proportion of national resources devoted to productive capital expenditure is nowhere alluded to here or elsewhere. There is nothing in this document that tells us by what process of investment and with what money derived from what source the new jobs are going to be created.  The fact that there is any connection between investment and growth is ignored throughout this paper.  Even the Minister for Finance will scarcely have the gall to tell this House that this Government's reliance on the private sector is so total that every bit of economic growth is going to come from that sector and none <Col N="2621" /> either from the public sector or through the public sector financing the private sector.</P>
    <P>Funds which are included under the heading of productive public capital expenditure&mdash;such as funds for the IDA, ICC, ACC, Bord Fáilte grants, SFADCo, and Gaeltarra Éireann&mdash;are raised from the public and channelled through the public sector into private hands, and the private sector derive a very high proportion of their total investment from them.  There is no provision whatever in this paper to increase this investment in the public sector or through the public sector into the private sector by one percentage point of GNP above what it was in 1977.  There is nothing in this Green Paper, and therefore, nothing in these figures, to make any provision whatever for the creation of employment. Even the Minister for Finance is not going to suggest that new jobs will be created without additional investment. If he is, he will be the first Minister for Finance in history to do so and will go down in the <i>Guinness Book of Records</i> accordingly.</P>
    <P>This chapter of financial implications is confined to the one issue of how Fianna Fáil propose to deflate the economy which they inflated in the current year.  To be fair, they are frank enough about what they propose at least in the main outlines and in their hints about the details.  You do not even have to read between the lines; in some cases you can read along the lines.</P>
    <P>First they propose to raise the burden of taxation by one-ninth from 31 per cent of GNP to 34½ per cent.  What does this mean in money terms?  On their own figures for 1978 GNP, given in reply to a Dáil question, this extra taxation will amount to no less than £285 million in two years.  Their estimates of GNP in 1978 and of GNP growth 7 per cent and inflation 5 per cent between 1978 and 1980, yield a GNP estimate of £8,100 million for 1980.  If that figure is in any way incorrect the Minister will correct me. The extra 3½ per cent of this figure which they propose to take in the current year is £285 million, by a coincidence almost exactly the amount <Col N="2622" />&ldquo;given away&rdquo;&mdash;very temporarily it now appears&mdash;in the manifesto. Deputy O'Leary mentioned £330 million as the manifesto figure.  I recall the debates at the time of the election campaign. Our first estimates were that the manifesto would cost £360 million. Fianna Fáil eventually came up with figures below £300 million.  They then did not spend the full amount, cutting, for example, the provision for youth unemployment by three-quarters from £20 million to £5 million.  Going back to the Green Paper and the budget documents I reckon that the amount they have provided since they came into office and in the budget is of the order of £285 million or just under that.  That is precisely the amount they propose to take back by extra taxation in the next two years.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper is, to put it politely, misleading on the proposed level of taxation.  It says in paragraph 7.6 that its proposals</P>
    <P>... Would accord with the objective of keeping the burden of taxation below the high level of recent years....</P>
    <P>This is false.  Taxation will be .7 per cent of GNP higher in 1980 than ever before.  That is on the Government's own figures, on their own assumption of growth and assuming that all their policies will be fully successful.  In that the Green Paper has misled the public, which is an unusual thing for a document of this kind to do.  I suggest that the restraining hands of the civil servants may not have been as heavily imposed on this document as has been traditional in this country.  When we were preparing our Green Paper we naturally, like any Government, sought to put the best face on what we were putting forward.  Civil servants made it very clear to us that there were certain limits to the figures that we could put down and that it would be unjustified on our part to make assumptions of growth or employment beyond a certain figure.  When we found that we could not sustain the argument and that they were right, we accepted what they said.  There is evidence in this Green Paper that the same self-restraint, in accordance with the best <Col N="2623" /> traditions of this country, has not been maintained in the preparation of this document.</P>
    <P>These tax increases of £285 million involve taking for each of the next two years total increase in GNP, one half of the increase in GNP in 1979 and one half of the increase in GNP in 1980.  The Government do not, of course, tell us where the extra taxes are to come from.  Some of the money could, of course, be squeezed out of income taxpayers by the old Fianna Fáil device, used year after year in the decade to 1972, or not increasing personal allowances, and thus squeezing more from income taxpayers without formally increasing the tax rates. That old dodge has, I am afraid, been blown.  It can only be used marginally, even by this Government, and most of the £285 million will have to come by actually putting up rates of taxation.</P>
    <P>Every figure I have used up to this point, and every figure I shall use throughout my speech, is based on Fianna Fáil's own statistics.  All my figures assume that GNP will grow by 7 per cent in 1979 and 1980, as well as in the current year, although no one but the Government believe, and I doubt that even they believe this target will be attained this year.  The Central Bank estimate is that it will be about 5½ per cent.  I will now deal with the question of the validity of the 7 per cent forecasts.  All I am saying is that the figures I have given of the tax increases required are based on the Government's own assumption of 7 per cent growth and, naturally, if that growth is not achieved, the extra taxation required from a smaller GNP to yield the sums to bridge the gap and to get borrowing down to 8 per cent will be correspondingly larger.</P>
    <P>For 1979-1980 the prospects of our economy have been set independently in a book on Irish economic policy published by the Economic and Social Research Institute consisting of papers by staff members of the institute.  Let me say at this point that the institute very properly disclaim responsibility for the views expressed in these papers, which are those of individual members of the staff.  In the paper by Joe <Col N="2624" /> Durkan, who carries responsibility for the institute's short- and medium-term forecasts, having reviewed the White Paper's industrial export projection, and having taken account of the changing relationship between these exports and GNP, exports forming a larger proportion of GNP and, therefore, of an increasingly dynamic element, taking full account of that, Durkan concludes as follows:</P>
    <P>The situation is thus that the target increases in industrial exports coupled with the target level for Government borrowing requirements would not lead to any major difference between the target future growth experience and that of the period 1968-1973.</P>
    <P>when, Durkan points out GNP growth averaged 4¼ per cent.  This particular expert, who is in his own area, responsible for short- and medium-termed forecasting and who has an excellent record in this respect, if I may say so, which is better in a number of respects than that of the Minister for Finance, forecasts for 1979-1980 a GNP growth rate of 4¼ per cent.  Now there is always some room for disagreement between economists on economic relationships, but the difference between the 4¼ per cent growth forecast by Durkan for 1979 on the basis of the White Paper policies, now spelled out in more detail in the Green Paper, and the White and Green Paper targets of 7 per cent strain credulity.  The divergence is too great to be explicable in terms of legitimate differences of appreciation of detail by economists.</P>
    <P>I should add&mdash;I have mentioned it already, but I will emphasise it again &mdash;that if the gamble fails, as this independent economic opinion suggests it may, then the tax increases will be all the greater, and their deflationary effect all the larger, thus risking setting off a cycle of recurrent inflation. These tax increases announced in the Green Paper are not, as Fianna Fáil have subtly tried to suggest, needed to create employment.  They bear no relation to employment and none of the money, as I have pointed out, is being put to increasing the share of GNP we devoted to productive investment <Col N="2625" /> in employment.  They are simply needed to pay the bills Fianna Fáil incurred in buying votes at the last election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: Moreover, these tax increases are only one half of the Fianna Fáil scissors.  The other &ldquo;F&rdquo; of the FF scissors is the proposal to make every section of the underprivileged, by cuts in benefits of one kind or another, pay for Fianna Fáil's give away to the rich, to the car owners, the house owners and the other groups on which their generosity was lavished last June, a generosity which did not include the underprivileged. Not alone will the lower paid workers and the small farmers have to pay through higher taxes&mdash; and small farmers pay taxes on everything they buy other than food and clothing which we exempted from taxation&mdash;not alone will they have to pay higher taxes, most probably on expenditure, but they are to be got at in every other conceivable way possible. All the schemes for cutting social services, which our National Coalition Government had brandished under our noses time and time again coming near a budget, and which time and time again we turned down, have been resurrected and welcomed with open arms by this most right-wing Government ever to rule this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chapter 7 starts off by warning there will be no more goodies in future budgets until the next election&mdash;paragraph 7.3.  It goes on to hint at spreading the burden of social assistance schemes from the Exchequer to some other source of funds.  To whom?  To the workers and the poor presumably. Who else?  It goes on to talk about standardising the means test which, in the context of the reference made, quite clearly means tightening up on the means test.  It talks about reviewing schemes for heating and for social welfare beneficiaries.  All this talk is in terms of tightening up, cutting back, reducing expenditure.  The temperature is to go down for social welfare beneficiaries. They are to be left in the cold by Fianna Fáil.  That is the plan put forward.  They talk about reviewing <Col N="2626" /> the operation of the school meals scheme.  Presumably children will be less well fed.  They talk about introducing selectivity into children's allowances and they say this will possibly be done by taxing the only source of income available to the great majority of mothers.  They talk about cutting back on disability benefits for women &mdash;for women in particular.  They talk about reviewing the position of the dependent spouse in the social welfare system.  More cutbacks here again, affecting for the most part women, because the majority of dependent spouses are women.  They talk about cutting back on access to the social insurance scheme by workers&mdash;paragraph 7.20.  Workers who are at present entitled to social insurance will not be entitled to it any longer.  They talk about taxing social welfare benefits&mdash; paragraph 7.21.</P>
    <P>At this point they introduce a further departure from veracity, if this is not an unparliamentary term, and they say there will be no reduction in the volume of public expenditure.  This is stated in paragraph 7.39.  But, if one examines Table 73, which gives in real terms the volume of expenditure under different headings, one will see that there is in fact to be a drop in social expenditure, a drop which I calculate in real terms in 1979 at 1½ per cent.  This incidentally raises a question which I raise with some regret but which, I think, has to be raised: it is the question of the relationship between the Department of Economic Planning and Development and the National Economic and Social Council.  How can the National Economic and Social Council be free to criticise a proposed cutback in social expenditure when the chairman is the secretary of the Department responsible for the Green Paper?  This double appointment creates an impossible situation.  May I say, knowing the official in question, that there is no one more capable, if it were possible to do it, of filling the two posts well and honourably, but it is asking more than one could reasonably ask of any public servant, to be on the one hand the secretary of the Department that produces the Green Paper and, on the other hand, the <Col N="2627" /> chairman of the body whose job it is to criticise it which, in this instance, if it is to do its job properly has to say bluntly that the Green Paper did not tell the truth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">
      <NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: How can the same man be responsible for drafting the paper and then sending out a report to say the Green Paper did not tell the truth?  This places an impossible burden on one person and it should never have been put on anyone, even someone of his exceptional ability.</P>
      <P>When we move from social welfare to health, the delphic obscurity of the paragraph suggests that the Minister for Health was more successful than the Minister for Education and the Minister for Social Welfare in postponing the evil day.  Rising health costs, we are told, cannot be allowed to pose excessive problems in the context of our general economic and public finance policies.  Ominously, for Deputy Haughey, Minister for Health, while hand on Fianna Fáil heart, there is no intention of departing from the objective in health policy expressed in the White Paper, the considerations expressed earlier in this Green Paper require that detailed study now be given to the possibility of adopting alternative measures other than those at present in use to meet some of the health objectives of the White Paper. So the Green Paper here is going to go back on the White Paper at the expense of the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>Later we are told that the number eligible for health benefits will be stabilised or decreased&mdash;paragraph 7.28.  These are delphic utterances indeed.  We on this side of the House have no difficulty in interpreting them. The knife is in, and barring an early &ldquo;off&rdquo; in the succession stakes and a particular outcome, it will be twisted with ill-suppressed pleasure in the months to come.  What a fate for the health services that they should become the plaything of Fianna Fáil internal politics regardless of the effect on the health of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for education, it is to be the fate of Deputy Wilson to preside over the destruction of much of Donogh <Col N="2628" /> O'Malley's achievements.  The doubling of fees for university students, paragraph 7.33, will make Donogh turn in his grave; and new charges for students at training colleges, paragraph 7.34. These are the only two cuts actually mentioned, but we all know that the Fianna Fáil Party are currently in travail over proposals to cut the school transport service which was on the agenda for a recent party meeting.</P>
    <P>Then there is the price of food from which the National Coalition removed VAT and in the case of key necessities we subsidised.  There is no mention yet in the Green Paper of restoring VAT on food and on clothing, from which we also removed it.  That, no doubt, will be part of the £285 million extra taxation package to come.  We are told the subsidies are to go, not &ldquo;abruptly&rdquo; but over a period of years.  We are told there will be 3½p more on milk, 30p more on butter, 5½p more on the loaf, 4½p more on the kilo of flour, not to speak of 17p more per therm of town gas.  These are not my figures but those of the Green Paper as set out in a table there.  These subsidies will be removed not &ldquo;abruptly&rdquo; but, it is quite clear from the wording, completely.</P>
    <P>How big in total are these cuts in spending going to be?  This is calculable from the figures given in the Green Paper, although they are not directly displayed.  The Green Paper figures in Table 7.1 applied to the Government's forecast of GNP allow for a £200 million increase in current spending in current money terms in 1979.  But in his speech the Taoiseach told us that £150 million of this is already pre-empted by unavoidable commitments: servicing the enormous extra debt incurred, which at the now rapidly rising interest rates could cost much more than was provided for in the budget, and the carryover effect of public service pay and social welfare increases.  Even if inflation raised the resulting bill of £2,518 million by only 7 per cent&mdash;I say &ldquo;7 per cent&rdquo; because public service pay is such a big factor that the inflation rate in Government expenditure is always more than the consumer price index&mdash;this means that the cost of existing services will be about £2,700 million in 1979 <Col N="2629" /> without any improvement in or extension of public services.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper tells us there will be 4,100 extra jobs per year provided for in the public sector which are bound to involve extra costs.  This figure of £2,700 million excludes those extra jobs and the extra jobs referred to in the chapter dealing with how to eliminate unemployment altogether. This £2,700 million is the minimum figure of the cost of these services in 1979 and is clearly an underestimate because it makes no provision for the 1,400 extra jobs that Government have promised to provide in that year.  The Green Paper says that the sum available when calculated will be only £2,574 million.  Therefore expenditure cuts must be at least £125 million in 1979 with an almost identical figure of £175 million in 1980.</P>
    <P>The stage is thus set.  The Government have announced in this Green Paper that they propose to deflate the economy by about £270 million in each of the next two years, namely, in total by twice the cost of the Fianna Fáil manifesto package.  They gave us the money with one hand and took twice as much back with the other.  In each year there are £345 million more in taxation and £125 million in cuts in expenditure on the social side, which added give £550 million of deflation in two years.</P>
    <P>In a recent report the OECD assessed the short-term effects of the Government's expansionary measures in 1978 as adding 2 per cent to GNP. No matter how the Government and the Ministers play around with the figures their attempt to retrieve the damage done by their manifesto and budget will involve a total 4 per cent deflation of the economy, a 2 per cent deflation in each of the years 1979 and 1980.</P>
    <P>How in the name of common sense could the Government imagine that after such a deflation, and having provided no higher proportion of GNP for productive capital investment in the private and public sectors in these years than we did in 1977, they are going to achieve a 7 per cent growth rate?  This would imply that there <Col N="2630" /> would have been a neutral, undeflated growth rate of 9 per cent in these years without any stimulus by way of expansionary budgetary measures or increased investment finance.  It implies that left to itself the economy would be expanding at twice the normal growth rate and the Government are cutting it back from 9 per cent to 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the Government cannot find a single independent economist to stand over their phoney figures?  In all this there is nothing, I quote the Taoiseach, &ldquo;to enhance the career prospects of a vibrant new generation of Irish people&rdquo;.  The proposals are novel all right and they are dramatic, but I wonder if the Taoiseach had the kind of novelty and drama in mind that most Irish people will find here&mdash;drastic deflation and its consequences on employment.  As for fuel to fire the imagination, to which he also referred, there is enough fuel here to fire social discontent of a high order as the ordinary workers and small farmers come to understand the price they are being asked to pay, not to put people to work&mdash;they would pay for that, but, as I have shown, that is not what the issue is about here&mdash;but to pay for the remission of the wealth tax, the road tax and the other Fianna Fáil promises.</P>
    <P>I will spend no more time on this document.  I was going to insert an adjective, but I remember my father gave an instruction to the Department of Defence that all adjectives were to be dropped from official minutes as they all represented expressions of opinion inappropriate for civil servants. Though not a civil servant I will avoid any adjective before the word &ldquo;document&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We shall let it rest until the Government have finished what the Minister for Education described as the &ldquo;fight&rdquo; to decide where the cuts are finally to fall and where the taxes are finally to be levied.  Let them get on with this fight, fight it to the finish and end the display of disunity and backbiting that has disedified our people during recent weeks as the leadership battle is fought through leaks to the papers on who is being chopped and who is fighting to the death.</P>
    <P>Then, when the Government on <Col N="2631" /> present promises, if they keep them&mdash; 18 months after their election on a platform of providing &ldquo;tens of thousands of secure jobs only waiting to be created&rdquo;&mdash;have decided on what their policy is, and have perhaps sorted out their leadership, we shall then give our considered views on that policy, when we know what that policy is.  It may well contain good things; I will not be surprised if it does.  There are good things even in this Green Paper if you dig deep enough, though they are few and far between.  If the Government policy contains good things we shall not hesitate to say so when they are finally revealed.</P>
    <P>On work sharing, I know the Taoiseach's scepticism about this idea of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development but I feel it should not be dismissed.  I recall what he said two months ago at the IMI meeting in Killarney.  He said there were no easy solutions and because of the difficulties there was a temptation to turn to other solutions which appeared to be less arduous.  For example, one suggested panacea was to share existing employment through such steps as shortening the working week, having longer holidays, curtailing overtime and earlier retirement.  He said that this posed many questions.  He must have been answered in a hell of a hurry in the intervening two months.</P>
    <P>This scepticism cannot be ignored, although I should add that I will not dismiss this idea out of hand.  What I must say is that, while keeping an open mind on the issue of work sharing&mdash;what is really involved is income sharing through the process of work sharing&mdash;this could work only if all groups in society were brought into the process.  There is no way in which our workers will share their income when they see the rest of the community who are not in the category of being employees not being asked to share for the purpose of creating employment.  When we talk about work sharing let us be clear that it means income sharing and that the burden must fall equitably throughout and not, as has been the policy of this Government to date, with the whole <Col N="2632" /> burden falling on the poor and underprivileged and with all the benefits going to the wealthy.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper shows no awareness of the need for equitable distribution of the burden and I am afraid that the idea of work sharing which I think has potential merit, although it brings great difficulties with it, is bound to fail unless this need is recognised.  We share the same aim as the Government although we differ on the means.  We can ignore the Taoiseach's uncharacteristically arrogant statement that Fianna Fáil are the channel through which the aspirations of the ordinary men and women of Ireland take solid shape.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the Taoiseach's speech on which I should comment briefly.  First, there is his deeply disturbing figure for the rise in the value of industrial exports&mdash;just more than 20 per cent in the first four months.  During our period in office the rate of growth of value of manufactures was well more than 50 per cent in the first half of last year.  That rate was sustained up to September, a month after our departure from office. Even allowing for some dampening of inflation since then, it is clear that under Fianna Fáil the manufactures export growth which perhaps was about 30 per cent in volume in the first half of last year, allowing for an inflation rate of just less than 20 per cent, has now been reduced to a tiny fraction of this figure.  Although the inflation rate has been reduced it is still significant.  Therefore, there has been a sharp falling off in manufactures export growth.  This is a danger sign and it was unwise of the Taoiseach to give this figure as if it were a great bonus or benefit achieved when in fact it is a very serious danger sign. It is a reduction from a value rate of increase of more than 50 per cent to merely 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the Taoiseach's figure for emigration.  While accepting his caution that past censuses have shown that actual net emigration has tended to be only two-thirds of the net outbound passenger movement by sea and air, we still find an estimated 9,000 net emigration figure for the 12 months <Col N="2633" /> ended January and we are told that the net outbound sea and air figure was 13,000.  By some coincidence this 9,000 figure is just the amount by which unemployment has fallen so that it seems that whatever jobs may have been created since Fianna Fáil came to office, there has been no apparent effect on unemployment.  This suggests that the jobs may be fewer than the Government try to suggest.  Certainly, they are no more than are needed to keep up with the growth in the labour force.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I wish to comment on the Taoiseach's reference to the £100 million job-creation programme.  Has the Taoiseach forgotten that in the budget £15 million was knocked off that by cutting to £5 million the £20 million youth employment programme with the result that there has been virtually no improvement in the area of youth employment?  We have had such excuses as there being more obstacles than were expected, that everything is slower than had been anticipated, but the fact remains that 5,000 jobs were to have been provided within one year in office for young people by way of special employment projects.  Where are these jobs?  They have not arrived yet.</P>
    <P>The employment action team put forward four proposals.  There was the community fitness programme which was supposed to yield 800 part-time jobs.  That passed to the Minister for Health but has disappeared since. Under the environmental improvement scheme, £4 million was allocated to provide 1,000 jobs of a temporary nature.  Where are these jobs?  There is also the work experience programme but that is not to begin until July.  The proposals for it are only being worked out now by the National Manpower Service.  This is a year after the Government assumed office.  There was the apprentice recruitment scheme to be operated by local authorities but at the end of April only five people had been recruited under this scheme.  For the Ballyfermot survey there was an allocation of £10,000 but the number employed was 33 for a period of one month at an approximate cost of £7,500.  Therefore, the youth employment <Col N="2634" /> schemes simply have not happened and they were a major priority of the Government.  What they represent is a major failure by the Government because this is the area where unemployment pinches most and where hopes were raised most by the Government.  It is the area in which failure to deliver will cause most unrest, most distress and which perhaps will be remembered longest in terms of the Government's failures.</P>
    <P>The fourth point of the Taoiseach's speech to which I wish to refer, and again this has not received any comment of which I am aware although it is a matter of major importance to the country, is his reference to&mdash;and I quote&mdash;&ldquo;Indications of a rise in the volume of consumer goods coming into this country, an accentuation of which could aggravate our balance of payments to the point where corrective measures would be necessary.  These could affect prospects for employment&rdquo;. This is a very serious warning. It led me to look at the figures.  We are a far distance from Fianna Fáil's proposal to create 10,000 new jobs by switching 3p in the £ of spending to Irish products during a period of three years.</P>
    <P>Since Fianna Fáil came to power we have been moving at breakneck speed in the opposite direction.  The figures should be told and told bluntly.  Between August and February last&mdash;the latest period for which retail spending figures are available&mdash; retail spending increased by 19 per cent while imports of consumer goods increased by 39 per cent or twice as fast.  While we have no retail sales figures later than February we know that the import trend has continued because for the nine months from August to May there was an increase of 38 per cent.  Therefore, imports of consumer goods are increasing twice as fast as consumer spending and given that in 1977 21p in the £ of all personal consumption consisted of imports of consumer goods ready for sale as distinct from products coming into the country for manufacture here, this means that the figure of 21p in the £ has been increased to about 24p in the £.  So much for the 3p in the £ that <Col N="2635" /> Fianna Fáil referred to in the manifesto. It is a loss to imports and not a replacement of imports and it has occurred in six to nine months rather than in three years.</P>
    <P>I endorse the Taoiseach's warning note that this is a most dangerous trend.  If the 3p in the £ of imports to be replaced was to yield 10,000 extra jobs as the Fianna Fáil manifesto stated rather simplistically, the first 12 months of Fianna Fáil rule have seen 10,000 jobs put in jeopardy by increased imports which the Government have done nothing to offset. Where is the great campaign for buying Irish or selling Irish?  Why have we not seen signs of it yet?  So much damage has been done already by the failure to take the action necessary that the job to be done now is a great deal larger than it was when the Government came to office.</P>
    <P>The other point I wish to make is the one to which the Taoiseach did not refer although it is very important. I refer to the fact that since the beginning of this year, under Fianna Fáil, this country's external reserves which almost trebled during the period from 1973 to 1977 to £1,200 million, have fallen by £150 million in four months.  This represents an annual rate of decline of more than £450 million. This is highly sinister and taken in conjunction with Central Bank data whose analysis suggests a significant outflow of capital from the country as the implications of Fianna Fáil policy for the few years ahead sink in to more sophisticated financiers, augurs ill for the period ahead.  It is a curious paradox that the autonomous net capital inflow considerably more than doubled in 1974 compared with 1973 with the announcement of the wealth tax at the beginning of 1974.  Contrary to the figures the Minister has given, all of which relate to the period after 1974, the outflow, if it occurred, would have taken place when the wealth tax was announced.  The people concerned were hardly going to wait until the tax was introduced and when they would be caught but so far as there was any outflow it must have occurred in 1974.  In fact, though, there was an inflow.  The reason for this is simple. <Col N="2636" /> In a brochure prepared by a Liverpool stockbroker he advised his clients that after the introduction of the wealth tax in Ireland, the new conditions of the abolition of estate duty and the substitution of wealth tax were so favourable that the flow of capital to this country in 1974 was on such a scale that the British Government before the end of 1974 would be bound to impose restrictions on the outflow of capital to Ireland.  They did not do so, so that the warning turned out to be unfounded but that was how English financiers saw the effect of wealth tax.</P>
    <P>Now Fianna Fáil have abolished wealth tax but the money is flowing out of the country.  Why?  Because, while there are short-sighted people who are willing to cash in on the immediate benefits of Fianna Fáil policy this year, anybody who has any economic knowledge or insight, anybody in the financial world and the more sophisticated people in the industrial world, know what lies ahead in 1979 and 1980 and are taking appropriate steps at this stage.  These are all worrying signs not to be glossed over &mdash;a sharp fall off in the growth of manufactured exports, the sudden and now very rapid replacement of Irish goods by imports instead of <i>vice versa</i> as promised, the fall in the reserves, the outflow of capital and, above all, the outflow of people, the new tide of emigration which is the real explanation for the 9,000 drop in unemployment.</P>
    <P>I believe the other evening on television the Minister for Economic Planning and Development asked Opposition spokesmen what we would do in these circumstances.  We are flattered to be asked, even if only rhetorically, for advice.  There is only one possible answer.  That is the answer the man gave when asked for directions in the Irish countryside&mdash; you should not be starting from here. We would not have the economy in the position it is in because we would not &mdash;and we made it plain in our election manifesto that we would not&mdash;risk the future of employment for our people by buying votes at the cost of £300 <Col N="2637" /> million which would then have to be recovered by deflationary measures which would leave the country in a far worse position than it was to start with.  We believe in continuous and accelerated progress and we were achieving it, leaving behind us to Fianna Fáil, God help us, a 5 to 6 per cent growth rate, inflation falling to 6 per cent and unemployment declining&mdash;though not, I will admit, as fast as we would have wished.  We rejected the idea of a mad rush linked to the election, followed by precipitate withdrawal from a worse position than we started from, which has been Fianna Fáil's recipe.  That choice was open to us.  It was a possibility before us in Government when we considered what we should do in the budget of 1977.  We decided against it.  We have suffered the political consequences. We are willing to take those consequences, but those who chose the opposite path must then take the consequences of that path as those consequences emerge in 1979 and 1980.</P>
    <P>Having said that I should like to say that we wish the Government luck and lots of it.  As an Irishman I hope they succeed even though my party would then find it more difficult to come to power.  But if Fianna Fáil fail the damage will be not only to them; this failure will spread cynicism about politics and politicians.  While it may be healthy that in future people should be more wary of promises of goodies now combined with jobs later, it would not be healthy that the credibility of our political system be put in jeopardy by irresponsible politics.  We do not seek to climb to power on the back of Fianna Fáil's failure, nor do we have any desire once again to come into office to clear up the economic mess left behind them.  We shall seek power on our own merits, our own plans, programmes and ideals&mdash;not on the basis of Fianna Fáil failure.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the Government should get on with it.  Most of the projects in the manifesto have never been heard of since.  I was glancing through it in the period immediately before this debate and made a most incomplete list of things which I had not <Col N="2638" /> heard of since.  Perhaps I missed one or two; perhaps there are one or two that are happening and escaped my attention.  There is a Buy Irish campaign&mdash;that certainly escaped my attention and I have told the House what are the consequences; the restructuring of the Prices Commission the investigation of middlemen's margins, for example, in fish and vegetables; the alignment of prices with Northern Ireland, steps to be taken to bring them into line; the State-owned smelter which was to yield and quote: &ldquo;tens of thousands of secure jobs only waiting to be created&rdquo;; all the various agricultural boards, too numerous to be listed; the Land Development Authority; the new body to co-ordinate agricultural export agencies; the domestic agricultural marketing council to set standards; the 50-mile limit; a central fish marketing agency; a scheme to lead to the abolition of ground rents&mdash;we all know where that ran into the ground.  There was a major road development plan; a children's service authority, an energy authority; a transport authority; legal aid in civil cases, first of all, on family law&mdash;what happened to that and where is it?  Eventually this Government will be dragged, kicking and screaming, to the point of introducing it because otherwise they will end up in the dock and possibly expelled from the Council of Europe for failing to carry out their obligations.  It is only when it is brought to that point, as far as I can ascertain, that they will introduce a scheme.</P>

      <P>: Then there was the amendment of the 1908 Children's Act &mdash;page 37 of the manifesto.  I will pass over the promises of improvements in Posts and Telegraphs staff relations because these do not require further development and comment.  There was to be a pupils' transfer committee and endless other bodies.  Where have they all gone?  Like the snows of winter they have all melted, but it was in summer that they were announced. Ministers have been doing little or nothing.  The House knows how little legislation has come before it.  If the <Col N="2639" /> Government would get on with the job of creating employment, stop talking about it, stop fighting about it, stop publishing papers about it, we would back action.  The country will not forgive a Government with 84 seats because so many of their Minsters are lazy or incompetent, or spending so much of their time nursing their constituencies that they do not do the job they were put in to do.</P>
      <P>Before concluding&mdash;with a distinct change of tone&mdash;I want to refer to Northern Ireland.  I want to welcome the Taoiseach's remarks about Deputy Frank Cluskey and myself.  I should like to say for my part that during my visit to the United States and the contacts I had there I was impressed by the amount of genuine interest there was in the United States and willingness to work for a solution of the Northern Ireland problem.  I think a transformation has come about in the situation in that country in so far as the Northern Ireland problem is concerned. I think that the efforts put in by our Government, culminating in the visit of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Liam Cosgrave, on the occasion of the Bicentennial, the extraordinary efforts of the Deputy Leader of the SDLP, and the backing of the present Government&mdash;strongly given in words we fully endorse, words the Taoiseach used both in writing to Mr. Biaggi and the United States&mdash;that these things together created in the United States a new situation in which there is a strong body of opinion in Congress and the administration genuinely concerned about this problem and anxious to help towards its solution.  The time could come when we could be very grateful for that constructive interest, so different from the kind of interest we have had from a narrow group of Irish-Americans in earlier years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us share a common concern for the future of our country.  The differences between us and Northern Ireland are now, as Deputy Cluskey said, only differences of emphasis on the recognition that the Sunningdale commitment by the British to support unity achieved by consent is an indication of support for a united Ireland <Col N="2640" /> from the British.  This the Government seem to be ignoring for tactical political reasons, which I can understand if it helps them in some of their particular difficulties.  But the differences between us come down to the interpretation of the adequacy of that statement at Sunningdale.  I am glad that the movement on the part of the Government on the position taken up in 1975 has brought the three parties in this House closer together on an issue which will not be resolved if we differ or in any way allow ourselves to be divided significantly.</P>
    <P>May I add that I share the Taoiseach's feelings about the attacks on us concerning extradition, which at this point, allowing for even the barest minimum of political intelligence on the part of those concerned, can only be <i>mala fide</i>.  The Taoiseach's statement on this subject some time ago was excellent.  Nobody having read it is entitled to continue to nag at this particular subject.  However, we must be wary of avoiding our own responsibilities by placing all the blame on British inactivity.  There is no doubt that the main problem lies there, especially because of the &ldquo;hung&rdquo; parliament, the dependence of both parties in that parliament on Loyalist support, or the possibility of Loyalist support, in this or the next parliament.</P>
    <P>But the failure of the British Government to take adequate initiatives at an adequate level, with sufficient energy, sufficient seriousness, cannot excuse inaction by us&mdash;and here I join Deputy M. O'Leary.  A response is needed on our part to the appeal of men of goodwill in the North to clarify what we mean by Irish unity.  We have never done that in 55 years, and it is to our shame that we have not done so. We should not expect whatever efforts we make in this respect to have a dramatic effect.  Nor must we allow these efforts to distract attention from the primary and urgent need for a skilful British initiative on internal devolution, with participation in responsibility in Northern Ireland.  But a duty does lie with us.  Every Deputy should read the current issue of <i>Studies</i>, a quarterly published by the Jesuit Order, in which there is an <Col N="2641" /> article on pluralism.  It is a publication which should stir the conscience, the interest and concern of every Deputy. There is food for thought for all of us in this publication.</P>
    <P>We should take initiatives.  I know that a recent poll showed a confused and disturbed public mood here; it showed an unwillingness to make financial sacrifices for the North, an unwillingness to make changes to make the thought of union with us more acceptable to the majority in Northern Ireland.  Our job as political leaders is to transcend this and build on the recognition that for the vast majority of our people union can only be got by consent, that the North must decide its own fate, and to do this by offering to northerners of both sections of the community, a vision of a different Ireland.  That will require from all parties qualities of leadership which will show that the situation here and in Northern Ireland could be transformed, not quickly but over a measurable period.</P>
    <P>Let us not, in placing the blame for the present stagnation where it primarily lies, on Britain, forget our responsibility.  Let us not forget the parable of the mote and the beam.  We have responsibilities and future generations will not forgive us if the violence continues or gets worse and the problem is not resolved, because we were unwilling to make the imaginative effort to show the kind of country we wish to create, to show the generosity with which we approach our fellow Irishmen in Northern Ireland. That is the challenge which is before us.  The willingness is there on our part and on the part of the Labour Party, as was said by Deputy O'Leary. There are many people in the benches opposite who wish to move in a similar direction and we should give thought as to how we can together take the steps that need to be taken here to create the conditions that would open up the minds and the hearts of those in Northern Ireland who hitherto were unwilling to contemplate working with us, who were blinded by past history and mythology and were unable to see the benefits to them of working with us externally <Col N="2642" /> and domestically in the interests of all the people of this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I can be as understanding as most people, and I know that when an Opposition who were ignominiously thrown out of office because of their multiple failure on so many fronts to deal with the problems facing the people, are faced with an Adjournment Debate on the performance of the Government over the past year in conjunction with a discussion on the Green Paper recently produced, one must, in all reasonableness, allow for the fact that they are facing a difficult task, especially when the past year has seen not alone the implementation of various promises made by the Government but also when one sees the indicators one after another showing that on target we are achieving what we set out to achieve for this year.  Given all that, the Opposition are in a very difficult situation, but even allowing for all that, I found many of the speeches, particularly that of Deputy FitzGerald, a grave disappointment.  The fact that his speech contained a number of misstatements of fact was bad enough, but the worst feature of it was what he did not say, and this was the most distinguishing mark of the contributions from the Fine Gael and Labour benches to this debate.  Not one speaker, except Deputy Barry Desmond, put forward any suggestion as to how the troubles facing us ought to be tackled.  Deputy Barry Desmond put forward a number of suggestions all of which except one, the ritual national development corporation, are in the Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot hope to deal with all of the mis-statements of fact but there are a few basic ones that I ought to deal with.  Deputy O'Leary, winding up for the Labour Party, laid great <Col N="2643" /> stress on, and the same point was relied upon to a considerable extent by Deputy FitzGerald in his criticism of the Government's proposals, the allegation that because of the reduction in public spending outlined in the Green Paper, in the election manifesto and before that in the Fianna Fáil economic policy statement in the autumn of 1976, there will be a substantial deflation in the economy in 1979 and 1980.  Nowhere is any allowance made for the fact that the private sector will do anything.  It is assumed that the private sector will be stagnant, including particularly the private sector activity induced by the IDA.  Apparently, none of that will operate.  One of the basic criticisms levelled from the other side of the House at the Government's proposals is apparently based on that assumption.</P>
    <P>The percentages given for alleged deflation are all based on the assumption that there will be no increase in activity in the private sector.  As has been clear all along, we do not go on that assumption.  I merely point out that the basic assumptions made in the criticisms by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties are mistaken.  Another fairly basic criticism that Deputy FitzGerald made seems to bear a great resemblance to a point made by Deputy Peter Barry previously, where he said that there was an inconsistency between the White Paper's reference to the desirability and the feasibility of limiting taxation so that the tax burden will be less in 1980 than in 1977, and the Green Paper which states that taxation as an estimated percentage of GNP will increase from 31 per cent in 1978 to 34½ per cent in 1980. The White Paper and the Green Paper are totally consistent on the likely evolution of taxation policy.  In the White Paper this policy was expressed in terms of taxation, measured in national income accounts terms, as a percentage of national income.  In the Green Paper the same taxation burdens are expressed but the relationship is between budgetary revenue and GNP.  The main difference between budgetary revenue and taxation on a national <Col N="2644" /> account basis is that budgetary revenue includes Post Office charges and other non-tax revenues, whereas the other definition does not. Secondly, budgetary revenue excludes rates and social insurance contributions whereas the other definition includes both.  If this is taken into account some of the basic arguments being made will be found to be unfounded. I would also remind Deputy FitzGerald that the various people appointed to the Garda and the new teachers, nurses and so on appointed were not all old or middle aged.  I also note that they omitted to make any reference to the youth employment scheme operated by the Department of Education which has been so successful that we have allocated another £500,000 to it.  Deputy FitzGerald omitted to mention when he quoted the increase in the reserves while he was in office, that the great bulk of that increase was due to the foreign borrowing by his Government which, of course, was recorded as increased reserves.  He may have noted that this Government have not engaged in foreign borrowing other than a Yen loan, which had been negotiated by the previous Government, some EIB Loans, which are in a special category and some recycling of foreign borrowing, which I will refer to later if I get an opportunity.  That does not represent any new foreign borrowing and, of course, does not affect the reserves.</P>
    <P>We again had the ritual National Development Corporation theme from Deputy O'Leary and others.  As far as the Government are concerned we are prepared to consider any approach to the tackling of unemployment, but would people stop trotting out the National Development Corporation, if that is all they can say about it?  Would they tell us what they propose in regard to it?  How many jobs do they suggest will be created by it?  How will they be created?  In what sectors, over what periods and at what cost? If we could get proposals in regard to the National Development Corporation which would give those kind of details then everybody could evaluate them.  The debate has got beyond the point where a ritual declaration of the <Col N="2645" /> value of the National Development Corporation is sufficient.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy O'Leary was surprised at something I said on the radio last Sunday, when I asked people to declare themselves as being for or against full employment.  I think he felt that I was really asking people to declare themselves for or against sin.  I can understand that reaction. The reason I put that question was that I overheard a Deputy from the Fine Gael benches in this House within the past ten days&mdash;I think it was Deputy Keating but I do not want to be tied to that because I was listening on the monitor and I cannot be absolutely certain&mdash;putting questions to the Taoiseach, the burden of which was that Fianna Fáil's preoccupation with job creation and full employment was an excuse for their expected failure in other areas and that this was a political gimmick by Fianna Fáil.  That is what the man was saying and this is why I put the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: This side of the House has no doubt that the first and major priority, from an economic and social point of view, is the creation of jobs. I was asking anybody who had doubts about it to say so so that we would know what their priorities were.  It may be legitimate for some people to argue that other priorities are more important. All I am saying is that, as far as we are concerned, other priorities are very important but they are not more <Col N="2646" /> important than that.  I cannot understand, when listening to the various people I have heard and, in particular, to the people winding up, Deputy O'Leary for Labour and Deputy FitzGerald for Fine Gael, how it happens that they are not even prepared to comment on the most radical proposals in the Green Paper.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary repeatedly referred to chapter 6; he spoke about work sharing and said there was nothing new in this, that it had been talked about in the EEC for some years, which is true.  Deputy FitzGerald spoke about work sharing.  The Deputies did not comment, even from the point of view of attacking or dismissing, on the other proposals in the chapter, the ones which are designed to get people to think and say: &ldquo;Do we agree we can get rid of unemployment?&rdquo;  We must remember that the projections in the White Paper, which are a filling in of the manifesto, fully achieved will not get rid of unemployment.  That point is brought out very clearly in the Green Paper.  The question is then posed: &ldquo;Do we want to get full employment?  If we do how do we go about it?&rdquo;  The chapter sets out various options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One set of options has nothing to do with work sharing or income sharing and the silence in regard to that has been deafening.  I believe the Taoiseach did not misread the situation when he said that the Opposition were stunned by the proposals.  They were so stunned by them that they have not been prepared even to mention them or to comment on them. What is wrong?  I do not know what kind of spectacles Deputy O'Leary was mentally wearing when he was looking at chapter 6 and could only see work sharing.  I am not just picking him out.  Deputy FitzGerald was the same and, to my knowledge, any of the other speakers from the other side were the same.  They studiously avoided any reference whatever to the most radical proposals in the Green Paper, probably some of the most radical proposals ever put forward by a Government, in this country certainly. There was no comment.  I consider this is a measure of the state of <Col N="2647" /> the Opposition parties when that happens.</P>
    <P>I was rather disturbed to note that Deputy FitzGerald, fairly recently in a television interview, on being asked for his view in relation to the operation of the Devlin recommended scales concerning the chief executives of State-sponsored bodies, dismissed it and said it was a ridiculous approach or words to that effect.  I do not purport to quote him exactly but that was the effect of what he said.  Some of his colleagues have taken the same line.  I was disturbed to note this because Deputy FitzGerald and his colleagues in the former Government made the decision on 28 June 1974 that they would accept the review body rates for chief executives of State-sponsored bodies subject to (1) sitting tenants keeping their existing rates if they were higher and getting standard national agreement increases but no more, (2) new appointees going on to the review body range and (3) boards continuing to have responsibility for fixing the chief executive rate within the review body range.  If that decision was right &mdash;I believe it was&mdash;then it really is not good enough to have Deputy FitzGerald now come out publicly and try to repudiate this, or for his colleagues to do it, unless he is prepared to say: &ldquo;We made that decision and we were wrong.&rdquo;  We can then argue about it.</P>

When we were in opposition we contended that as a nation we could not afford ourselves the luxury of waiting around in the hope that a revival in the world economy would materialise and help us to solve our most pressing problems, and on assuming office we acted on our conviction and we introduced a wide range of measures to get the country moving again.  The steps we took have been criticised but to my mind such criticism is ill-judged.  The key question to be asked about any policy is whether it reaches its aims at sustainable cost. Our policies, I suggest, pass that test because of the success attending them and also in regard to the cost.  It is precisely what was projected, precisely what we told the people it would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look first at 1977 we find that the economy achieved a growth rate of over 5 per cent, the highest in the EEC.  The rate of inflation was brought down to less than 11 per cent in the year to mid-November, compared with 21½ per cent recorded in the year ended mid-November 1976.  Manufacturing employment rose by 5,400, 3 per cent, in contrast to little or no change in 1976.  By the end of the year the number on the live register had fallen by more than 4,000 compared with December 1976, although I should add in parenthesis that when we assumed office in the middle of 1977 the seasonally-adjusted figure on the live register was getting close to the highest it had reached at the height of the recession.  It must not be forgotten, when we are listing these <Col N="2649" /> various advances, that they were secured at a time when the international environment was anything but propitious.  For instance, the combined output of all EEC countries expanded by only slightly more than 2 per cent that year.  Another significant thing was that even with our very high rate of growth our balance of payments position improved.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are of course entitled to some of the credit for what happened in 1977 although I should say a great deal of what happened was as a result of their belated conversion when they brought in the budget of 1977 and eventually, almost at the end of their term of office, paid some attention to what we had been telling them. A good deal of the improvement that took place due to internal factors was due to that.  They are certainly not entitled to claim credit for what is happening this year.  Despite the fact that the international outlook is worse for this year the portents are that as a result of our policies the economy is set fair for an even better year in 1978. Taken together, all the indicators that are available so far this year point to a strengthening of the better trends of 1977.  Manufacturing output is expanding rapidly as is activity in the building industry.  I think it can be said that there is a bumper year in prospect for investment.  The annual rate of inflation will be lower than ever it was in the past decade.  Our target for employment creation is certainly within reach and very significantly, the barrier of 100,000 on the live register has been breached.</P>
    <P>I do not think we could find a more striking endorsement of the policies that we have followed since we assumed office last year and I suggest that the success attending our efforts is a very good pointer to the likely success of our policies in 1979 and 1980 as outlined in the Green Paper because it is a logical extension of what we have done to date.</P>
    <P>The impact of the external world is a matter of considerable importance and it is a matter on which I have always contended one can find one of the basic differences between Fianna <Col N="2650" /> Fáil and the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition because the attitude of our predecessors was summed up by the former Minister for Finance when he said that our economy was like a cork bobbing on the ocean and that we had as little control over our economic destiny as a cork had over the direction it would take in the ocean.  That is what the man said and that is how they acted.  It is interesting that if you look at the international trends they improved very substantially during 1976.  In fact, in the first half of 1976 imports of OECD countries were increasing at an annual rate of 18 per cent.  That growth continued but into 1977 it began to peter out and we find that in the second half of 1977 there was not just a slow down in the rate of increase but an actual fall in the volume of OECD imports.  Yet, in the second half of 1977, the rate of growth in our industrial exports accelerated.</P>
    <P>That is after we came into office and that is when our economy took off because we did not adopt the fatalistic attitude that our economy was like a cork on the ocean.  We got cracking, we got our economy moving.  I do not think there is any doubt that our experience shows that we can achieve appreciable export growth even when the growth of foreign demand is sluggish. I know that there are time lags caused by the ebb and flow of trade and that they can distort matters and perhaps make it difficult to discern the underlying trend.  Nevertheless the export achievement in 1977, particularly in the second half of 1977, was so striking that no possible distorting factor can negate the message that although international trends are of tremendous importance to us they are far from being the only determinant of our economic performance.  A great deal can be done by us and any Irish Government worth their salt will do what they can do and will not simply throw up their hands in horror and say, as our predecessors did: &ldquo;We cannot control the international situation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our election manifesto, the White Paper and the Green Paper, all include the same figures on the intended level of borrowing as a percentage of GNP. <Col N="2651" /> I should like to comment on these figures as there have been some remarks on them in the debate and indeed in comments outside.  The borrowing requirement targets are set down, together with those for the reduction in unemployment, the growth rate and the reduction in the rate of inflation.  Unemployment, growth and inflation are easily comprehensible targets which in one way or another directly affect the lives of all of us.  A borowing requirement target is, however, different.  I suppose the man in the street cannot see directly how a borrowing requirement target affects him.  It is not a feature of the real economy and he could be forgiven for thinking that it is simply some kind of obscure item in the world of public finance.</P>
    <P>To some extent he would be right in seeing the borrowing requirement target as being different from the other three.  Setting out a borrowing requirement target in an economic plan is certainly new in Ireland.  For instance, such a target did not feature in the second or third economic programmes introduced by Fianna Fáil.  It certainly did not figure in the Green Paper: <i>Economic and Social Development 1976-1980</i> which was produced by the Coalition.  That Green Paper drew attention to the size of the public sector deficit which would result in 1980 from a continuation, broadly speaking, of the policies then in force and said that they would become a phenomenal 21 per cent of GNP but there was no way that the Coalition were going to set a target for borrowing as a percentage of GNP.  We did so.  I think we were correct in doing so.</P>
    <P>A number of useful things flow from setting a target borrowing requirement.  It is useful as a bench mark but it is not the only bench mark. A budget must be designed to meet the needs of the economy, which is a complex task.  It cannot be sidestepped by the mechanical adherence to any one number.  One has to begin somewhere and a target borrowing requirement is as good a point around which to sketch the general outline of a budget as any other.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2652" /> Earlier, I mentioned that I would be engaging in refinancing the national debt and perhaps I should give the House some details.  In the context of national debt management, my Department have made arrangements to take advantage of the favourable terms at present available to first-class borrowers on the Euro markets.  We have made arrangements for two new credit facilities totalling 325 million dollars which will be used to prepay four existing dollar facilities.  The existing facilities carry a fixed margin of 1½ per cent over the London inter-bank rate of dollars and are due for repayment before 1981.  The new facilities will carry a fixed margin of only ¾ per cent.  Repayments will commence in 1982 and conclude in 1988.  These arrangements will save the Exchequer some 2 million dollars in interest over the life of the original loans as well as lengthening the Government's foreign debt maturities, thus easing the burden of loan repayments in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>My Department have recently given notice of intention to prepay in August next a 150 million Swiss Franc loan, which is about £45 million, as well as two Deutschmark loans totalling 150 million, which is about £40 million. Negotiations are at present in train regarding the new facilities for refinancing these loans at lower interest rates and on longer terms of maturity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry said&mdash;and this theme was echoed by other speakers&mdash;that the Government had failed to act.  He did note, correctly, that the Green Paper is a document for discussion. He went on to say that it was indicative of the approach of the Government to the economy in the past 12 months.  The implication was that we have done nothing but discuss the economy since we took office.  This is far from the truth.  A minute later Deputy Barry himself admitted that it was not the case when he said that the 1978 budget helped in that it increased the amount of money available to consumers with a consequential beneficial effect on the economy.  Indeed it did and it was intended to do so.  That budget was framed directly on the lines set out in our election manifesto.  Over <Col N="2653" /> the past 12 months the Government have taken the economic action which was set out in the manifesto.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat the various details that were outlined in the manifesto, and were more detailed in the budget, regarding job creation measures, the form of the budget, the taxation changes I announced, the abolition of rates, road tax and so on, as these measures are well known. They reflect action not discussion and the economy shows this.  The fall in unemployment, the inflation rate and the increase in the growth rate were not achieved by discussion.  The Green Paper is primarily concerned with 1979 and 1980.  There is still time to discuss with the social partners what should be done in those years, but discussion about the future does not rule out action at present and it has not done so.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael and Labour approach to the problems posed by technology should be carefully noted.  They have abandoned any hope of creating full employment and they are beginning to talk despairingly of a leisured society. Their answer to the great challenge of our time is to tell the people that they must accept unemployment.  I would ask them to go a stage further and tell the people precisely who has to accept a future on the dole, what categories of persons are destined to live out their lives on social benefit.  Let them go to the employment exchange and say, &ldquo;Prepare yourself for a life of leisure.  You are never going to have a job.&rdquo;  Let them go to the schools and colleges and say, &ldquo;There are not going to be any jobs for a great many of you.&rdquo;  Will they ask them to draw lots for the privilege of working?  That is really what the despairing ideas we have been hearing boil down to.  Anyone who understands human nature knows that such a society would quickly erupt.  In the Green Paper we are holding out a better prospect to our young people.  We are telling them that it is possible to create a society in which every man and woman will have an opportunity of making a contribution. The Green Paper suggests some of the changes in attitude and in practice that will be necessary to achieve <Col N="2654" /> that goal.  It cannot be achieved without making a number of changes, some of which may be difficult.</P>
    <P>I thought it strange to hear a young man like Deputy Enda Kenny talking about unemployment going on until the end of the century.  The message from Fine Gael and Labour is that we should not change anything but should accept as a fact of life that hundreds of thousands of our people will have no prospect of leading a normal, fulfilling life in their own country.  Apparently that is what Fine Gael and Labour stand for to-day.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a specious argument which is being put forward by the Opposition, not least by Deputy FitzGerald.  I know there are psychological reasons for it.  It mentally absolves them from responsibility for what happened at the last election. They say that we promised a list of goodies and went on a spending spree when we got into office in order to honour our election promises, that that is how we won the election.  That kind of argument might be plausible to people who never heard of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto but the election manifesto is one of the most widely publicised and discussed political documents in our recent history.  The people know what is in the election manifesto.</P>

      <P>: During the election campaign we said that the economy needed a massive shot in the arm to restore confidence and to restore its centre.  The cuts in income tax, the biggest cuts in the history of the State, and the abolition of car tax and rates were all part of a package designed to revive the economy. Every voter knew that.  Because they appreciated what we were trying to achieve they supported us. Looking at the transformation which has taken place in the last 12 months, it is clear that our strategy was the right one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth stressing at this stage that if one looks at page 9 of the manifesto one will see it made quite clear that the heavy borrowing of 1978 would be a once-off operation and that borrowing in 1979 and in 1980 would be substantially <Col N="2655" /> reduced.  We said this as far back as the autumn of 1976.  I wonder do Deputies remember the time when we said there were three major problems facing the country&mdash;unemployment, inflation and the appalling state of the Government's finances.  We said that even we could not tackle the three of them together, that we would have to start with unemployment and inflation and then deal with the Government's finances.  If one looks at the bottom of page 8 of the manifesto one will see that that is set out there again. Do not come in here pretending that nobody knew what Fianna Fáil were going to do.  We are following precisely what we said we would do.  Whether the Opposition like it or not, it does not provide an excuse for their loss of the last election.  On some other occasion, if the Deputies wish, I will gladly contribute my view as to why they lost the election.  I do not think I should waste time on that subject at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to those opposite who have been accusing Fianna Fáil of indulging in a spending spree that they should examine their own consciences. During their period of office the Coalition Government in four years managed to treble the national debt.  When we left office in 1973 the national debt stood at £1,421 million; at the end of last year, the national debt stood at £4,210 million.  If you think about it that escalation of debt is a horrific figure because there is so little to show for it.  These thousands of millions were frittered away over four years by a panic-stricken Government which did not know how to cope with the recession.  They abandoned any attempt at a national plan; they jettisoned everything in an attempt to stay afloat politically.  We will not accept any strictures about spending from the billionaire borrowers who are now in their rightful place on the opposite benches.  Fine Gael and their Labour satellites left us three areas of growth, growing inflation, growing unemployment and growing debt.  In view of the massive amount of borrowing, more than £2,500 million, their performance was astounding.  It took a <Col N="2656" /> miracle of ineptitude to borrow so much and achieve so little.</P>
    <P>My overall theme borne out by experience is that what we ourselves do is at least as important as, if not more important than, what happens in the international economy at large. This is the central theme of the Green Paper.  There are many steps we can take here in Ireland to improve our economic and social position.  Not all of those steps are attractive or easy and this Government never pretended that they would be.  But they are there and the key question, which is not technical or answerable only by economists, is whether we as a community are prepared to take those steps.  That is what the discussions with the social partners which we will embark on in the coming weeks will be about, not on the details of growth rates, important though they are, but on the key question of whether a willingness exists to take radical steps to deal with what we all agree are major problems.</P>
    <P>Economic analysis is valuable and constructive comment on the economic content of the Green Paper is welcomed by the Government.  But the Green Paper is not all about economics, at least in the narrower sense of the term.  Economists as a profession would, I am sure, agree that economics is not yet an exact science able to pin down and quantify everything that goes to make up a nation's economic performance.  I do not think there is any economist's measure of the strength of a nation's will although cohesive national determination is undoubtedly a powerful economic force.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper was issued by the Government partly to test that will. Economists, I believe, would also agree that there is an area where there is very great room for legitimate differences of opinion; but while the area of such differences among economists can be revealing and constructive it can also generate doubt and uncertainty, more so perhaps among lay men than among economists themselves. This is where we should exercise caution in relation to the debate on the Green Paper, which the Government hope will be lively and nationwide, <Col N="2657" /> because we could all become obsessed with numbers.  We could all turn into amateur economists each with his own set of numbers.  We could all generate much confusion and much heat.  We could all forget that we are dodging the main question which is: do we really want to bring about full employment, not in the distant future but when children who are now at school begin to look for jobs?  If the debate concentrates on the issue instead of being sidetracked into a morass of figures, where even professionals advisedly tread warily, it could be very useful.</P>
    <P>The Government have put forward options in the Green Paper because we have not closed minds.  We know we have serious problems.  We have our ideas on how these could be resolved and we are putting these into effect with, I suggest, obvious success. But we do not think we possess a monopoly of ideas and we hope that the national debate which the Green Paper has sparked off will throw up many useful and practical ideas.  Anybody with a good idea will find that we will listen and, if we are convinced, we will act.  This, I hope, will be the outcome of the discussions we plan to have on the Green Paper&mdash;sensible, workable suggestions.  It would be only too easy for the discussions to consist of statements of already known entrenched positions, each group defending its own interests.  Some may say this is inevitable; I am hopeful enough to believe that they are wrong. I have real reasons for hope.  Everybody knows instinctively that we will not solve our problems if we keep on going as we have been going.  We might have some progress, but resolution of our problems would recede into the indefinite future.  Everyone also knows instinctively that obsessive defence of narrow group interests may be fine in the short run but that it is collective madness for the community as a whole.  Defence or self interest in the short run may not even be a sensible policy in the longer term for groups which thereby price themselves out of employment or destroy the job opportunities of their own children.</P>
    <P>It is part of the Irish tradition that <Col N="2658" /> a genuine call for worth while collective action rarely goes unheard. The Green Paper is such a call and I am confident that the response to it will be imaginative and constructive.  As I have said, I doubt if any Government in the history of this State have ever produced more radical proposals than the Green Paper has produced.  The discussion on the Green Paper so far has been most revealing.  On the one hand, the Government with a majority of 20 seats&mdash; and clearly not for electoral purposes because we are only a year in office&mdash; have put forward proposals for the complete elimination of unemployment. On the other hand, many self-styled progressives and liberals have shown by their reaction that they are truly conservative.  They are not prepared to contemplate any real changes in the pattern of public expenditure or any substantial change in the role of the State in the provision of jobs.  They are prepared to contemplate with equanimity heavy unemployment being always with us and growing emigration which Fianna Fáil had conquered in 1971 but which started up again under the Coalition.</P>

We are going to get rid of emigration and the way we will do so is by providing full employment.

The people who are prepared to contemplate with equanimity the prospect of heavy unemployment always being with us and emigration continuing will accept this rather than agree to any real change in the system they have known and perhaps grown up with.</P>
      <P>It is among politicians that the debate on the Green Paper has really shown up yesterday's men.  Faced with the most serious social and economic problem of our time&mdash;unemployment &mdash;the reaction of some of our politicians can only be described as pathetic.  It is perfectly legitimate for Fine Gael and Labour to criticise the Government's proposals although, as I pointed out earlier, to the best of my knowledge none of them even mentioned the really radical proposals in the Green Paper.  It would be legitimate to expect that if they criticise our proposals they would put forward alternative proposals for the elimination of unemployment, proposals which they believe would be more effective. They have not done so and since they have failed to put forward any proposals whatever for the elimination of unemployment I suggest our young people are entitled to conclude that Fianna Fáil are the only party who are trying to give them a future in their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2660" /> The last general election marked a watershed in Irish politics.  Traditionally, political parties talked in generalisations and did not commit themselves to specific targets because even the slightest deviation from these targets could leave one open to attack by political opponents.  For instance, if one set a target of 25,000 jobs one's opponent could say, &ldquo;Ah, you have created only 24,950 jobs&rdquo;.  That kind of thing was the norm.  Before the last election, having considered the matter Fianna Fáil came to the conclusion that our people had reached a degree of political understanding that would enable them to recognise that while there might be deviation from specific targets the setting of such targets indicated clearly the direction and thrust of major policy.  So, despite the conventional political wisdom, we issued our economic policy document in autumn 1976 and we issued our election manifesto.  The rest is history.</P>
    <P>Never again will the people be satisfied in an election with anything less than a coherent policy document to which a party are prepared to commit themselves.  Fine Gael and Labour, judging by their lack of reaction of any kind to the proposals in the Green Paper, have not understood this fundamental change in Irish politics.  They are reacting in the manner of old-fashioned Irish politicians and that is why I have referred to them as yesterday's men.  That is why they are becoming more and more irrelevant to any discussion of the major problems facing our people.  I hope they will use the opportunity of the coming recess to rethink their position.  If they do I wish them well in their efforts.  I suggest it would be in the interests of parliamentary democracy in Ireland.</P>

      <P>: At its meeting on 8 to 12 May the Council of Agricultural Ministers agreed to allocate 50 million units of account for further measures to help butter consumption.  Consultations have just begun between the Commission and the member states on drawing up such measures and, pending their finalisation, I cannot say how they will differ from the Christmas butter scheme of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am aware that some local <Col N="2456" /> problems arose in connection with the operation of last year's Christmas butter scheme, the fact remains that it did achieve its objective of increased sales of butter.</P>
    <P>My Department will in the normal way have consultations in due course with the appropriate interests on the operation of the arrangements for 1978-9.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, be a separate butter scheme for social welfare recipients.  As already announced, I have secured the agreement of the Council to the reintroduction of the social butter scheme and I expect that the Commission's regulations on this will be finalised shortly.</P>

Not alone do I support this proposal but it was on my initiative that it was agreed to in the first instance by the Council. It is intended to implement the scheme in Ireland when the necessary Community regulation has been adopted.  Pending the adoption of that regulation I cannot say with certainty what social welfare groups will qualify for inclusion.  The cost of the scheme will be borne entirely by FEOGA and no matching subsidy is required from the member states.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The discrepancy between grants approved and payments made arises from various factors.  In the first place about half of the £29 million was approved only in the last 18 months.  Most of the projects covered by these recent approvals would still be under construction and claims for payments would not yet be lodged in these cases.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, under EEC procedures, applicants are allowed five years from the date of approval in which to submit claims for payment. Some Irish applicants have been slow to lodge claims and my Department are continually pressing these and all other applicants to present claims as early as possible after grants are approved.  There has, in fact, been a considerable increase in the number of claims submitted since the beginning of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in other member countries is not materially different. At the end of 1976, the latest date for which I have full information, the proportion <Col N="2459" /> of grants covered by Irish applicants was 17 per cent compared with a Community average of 16 per cent.</P>

I understand that the texts of these regulations have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broadly, these regulations authorise continuance of certain functions of the UK Milk Marketing Boards&mdash;in particular <Col N="2468" /> their exclusive right to purchase milk&mdash;subject to certain prescribed conditions.  The authorisation is subject to the maintenance in the UK of specified high levels of liquid milk consumption, as compared with milk used for manufacturing.  There are various safeguards for individual milk producers&mdash;80 per cent of whom must support each MMB in its area&mdash;in their dealings with the milk marketing boards.  The regulations also prescribe conditions governing the sale of milk by the boards to prevent distortion of competition in the UK market either by price discrimination between processors of milk or between milk products produced in the UK and those imported from other member states.</P>

      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 72 together.  From time to time pressure on the accommodation in any particular prison or juvenile institution may best be met by releasing certain categories of prisoners or juvenile detainees <Col N="2477" /> somewhat before the completion of their custodial sentences.  The fact that some boys may be so released from St. Patrick's does not necessarily mean that they would have been transferred to an open centre if there was accommodation there.  In fact all of the boys who were accommodated in Loughan House when it was being closed for renovations were transferred to the other open centre for juveniles, Shanganagh Castle, County Dublin.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that one effect of the new scheme for the intensive supervision of young offenders in the community, which is planned to come into operation by the end of the year and which, incidentally, will relieve the pressure on accommodation generally, will be that no boy who is likely to benefit from being in an open centre or, in the case of some of the older boys, in the Training Unit or in Arbour Hill&mdash;where facilities for industrial training have been developed &mdash;need remain in a conventional closed institution.  There may be pressure on the accommodation in Shanganagh Castle from time to time until Loughan House reverts to being an open centre, but I hope that it will never be serious or prolonged.</P>

      <P>: There is at present no EEC policy on arms production.  The European Parliament at its plenary session in June debated the report prepared by Mr. Egon Klepsch, rapporteur of the Political Affairs Committee of the Parliament, on European co-operation in arms procurement.  It also adopted by a majority vote a resolution calling on the Commission of the European Communities to draw up a European programme of action on conventional armaments production. The Klepsch report situated the question of co-operation in arms production in the context of greater co-operation in the industrial policy of the Communities.  Ireland has consistently supported the development of a comprehensive Community industrial policy embracing, <i>inter alia</i>, the introduction of measures which would stimulate industrial investment in the weaker, less industrialised regions. Moreover we have insisted that sectoral policies for particular industries must not be applied without full account being taken of the regional impact of those policies.  There are many areas of both industrial and regional policy, where we feel urgent and much needed progress must be made and which call for early action on the part of the Community, but we would not consider arms production <Col N="2479" /> to be one of these areas.  We feel, therefore, that consideration of this matter is premature at present while further progress is still outstanding on the vital aspects of the balanced development of the European Community.</P>
      <P>Since there is at present no common policy of the members of the European Community on arms procurement, the second part of the Deputy's question does not arise.</P>

      <P>: I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 19 of 3 Novemeber 1977, which detailed the significant changes that had taken place since July 1977 in the area of housing finance, such as the introduction of the £1,000 new housing grant scheme for first time owner-occupiers, the raising of the loan and income limits for local authority house purchase loans and the abolition of the clawback on resales of local authority houses.</P>
      <P>Since then, I have announced details of a new scheme of house improvement grants, effective from 1 November 1977, providing for increased grants of up to £600 for reconstruction works, up to £200 for individual water supply installations and up to £150 for the provision of individual sewerage facilities. For applicants participating in group schemes the maximum grants for water and sewerage installations have been increased to £300 and £250, respectively.  Valuation limits for reconstruction grants have been abolished.</P>
      <P>I have also announced an increase from £400 to £1,200 in the amount recoupable by the State to local authorities who pay grants towards the cost of adaptation of dwellings for physically or severely mentally handicapped persons.</P>
      <P>Reconstruction loans have been increased to £600 in the case of an unsecured loan and up to £2,500 is now available where it can be adequately secured.  Both secured and unsecured loans are now subject to the same income limit of £3,500 a year as applies to the house purchase loan scheme.</P>
      <P>At the end of December 1977 I announced revised national rent and tenant purchase schemes for local authority dwellings which are operating satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial increase in the range of assistance from public funds to voluntary housing associations providing housing accommodation for elderly persons was also announced on 11 April 1978.  This comprises a provision <Col N="2481" /> to enable local authorities to borrow from the Local Loans Fund to provide loans to voluntary housing associations to meet up to 75 per cent of the net cost, and an increase in the grants payable for the provision of dwelling units for the elderly to £1,000 a unit and for the provision of caretaker accommodation to £200 a room up to a maximum of £1,000.  In addition, local authorities may also make an increased annual periodic contribution to housing associations providing housing accommodation for the elderly.</P>
    <P>The review of local authority housing referred to in the White Paper <i>National Development 1977-1980</i> and again in the Green Paper on <i>Development for Full Employment</i> has been under way for some time and will be completed as soon as possible.  This will practically complete the review of the whole system of housing finance, which was referred to in the Government's election manifesto.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 to 92 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that landscape damage resulting from arterial drainage schemes has been referred to in some recent press articles but I do not appear to have received any representations from individuals or organisations regarding such damage.  For reasons which I shall indicate, I have no immediate proposals to issue either a policy statement on the connection between arterial drainage and tourism or guidelines for local authorities, nor have I proposals to make specific grants available for the relandscaping of areas which have been subject to major arterial drainage works.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Deputy that arterial drainage works are not subject to planning control nor, indeed, to any control which may be exercised by local authorities or by me.  It is the Commissioners of Public Works who are charged with responsibility for execution of such works under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The commissioners are empowered to prepare a drainage scheme whenever they are of opinion that the execution of arterial drainage works is expedient in respect of any catchment area for the purpose of preventing or substantially reducing flooding of lands in that area or of improving by drainage lands in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2486" /> Furthermore, confirmation of a drainage scheme is a function of the Minister for Finance.  When the appropriate procedure has been followed and a scheme has been confirmed, the Commissioners are thereby empowered</P>
    <P>&mdash;to construct, execute and complete the specified drainage works with such additions, omissions, variations and deviations as may be necessary,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to enter on any land and there do such acts and things as may be necessary for or incidental to the works,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to acquire compulsorily lands, easements, water rights and other rights proposed in the scheme to be so acquired,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to interfere substantially with any land proposed in the scheme to be so interfered with,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to restrict, terminate or otherwise interfere with any easement, fisheries, water rights or other rights proposed in the scheme to be compulsorily restricted, terminated or interfered with, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;to divert, remove or otherwise interfere with any roads or bridges proposed in the scheme to be diverted, removed or interfered with.</P>
    <P>The Act provides for exhibition of a drainage scheme when prepared by the Commissioners, for notice to be given to a variety of persons, and for any observations received to be considered before the scheme is confirmed. The council of a county in which lands will be affected are allowed three months to examine the scheme and submit observations.  Any other local authority charged with the maintenance of any public road or bridge proposed to be diverted, removed or otherwise interfered with are allowed one month to submit observations. Given the nature of the scheme and the type of information which it provides, I think it will be readily understood that the local authorities would be expected to give special attention to such matters as roads, bridges, intakes for public water supplies and sewage <Col N="2487" /> outfalls or disposal works, not to mention the financial implications on transfer of the completed drainage works for maintenance in the future.</P>
    <P>The Act also requires that various Ministers, including myself, should be consulted by the Commissioners when they have considered the observations received.  In so far as my jurisdiction is concerned, it seems clear that the purpose of the consultation envisaged by the Act was mainly to obtain advice on matters raised by local authorities and, if possible, resolve any difficulties before the scheme was submitted to the Minister for Finance for confirmation. In any event, that has been the approach adopted when such matters were being dealt with in my Department. The commissioners have power to alter a scheme at that stage.</P>
    <P>Since the Government have recently conferred on me a general responsibility to promote the protection and improvement of the environment, I now have a particular interest in the environmental impact of arterial drainage schemes and I have made arrangements to ensure that this aspect will, in so far as the particulars in the schemes allow, be considered whenever I am consulted.  I do not have a landscape architect on the staff of my Department at present but advice of specialist staff which includes a landscape architect, is available to me.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear, however, that the primary responsibility for environmental impact of arterial drainage schemes does not rest with me. The Government Statement on Ministerial responsibility for environmental matters laid down the following:</P>
    <P>It will be the responsibility of each Minister to ensure that the environmental effects and implications of policies, programmes and projects undertaken by his Department, and by bodies for which he is the appropriate Minister, are fully considered before decisions are taken and that such decisions will take due account of environmental considerations, including national environmental policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2488" /> Finally, I would like to point out to the Deputy that it would be unreasonable to expect that the type of works involved in arterial drainage schemes could be carried out without any adverse effects, and that there are considerations of cost involved also.  The disadvantages&mdash;some of a temporary nature&mdash;must be balanced against the benefits.</P>
    <P>From inquiries I have made, I am aware that a reappraisal has been made by the Commissioners of Public Works of the traditional method of disposal of spoil, that unsightly features are kept to a minimum and that particular attention will be given to avoidance of any unnecessary damage to scenery in sensitive areas.  I am assured that any representations regarding special features such as trees, mills and weirs are considered sympathetically and there is no indiscriminate destruction of such features.  It may be of interest to the Deputy to know that a whole series of hydro-metric investigations were carried out to see if a water wheel at Mantry could be retained and that proposals have been submitted to the owner for his consideration, that in the Boyne scheme, also, the commissioners were complimented by local organisations on their handling of works and spoil through the town of Trim, that in the Maigue scheme special steps have been taken to restore the river architecture through Adare Manor and that an internationally recognised landscape architect has been employed to ensure that all reasonable works are carried out to restore pre-drainage features.</P>

      <P>: The principal functions of the Valuation Office are (a) to revise, in accordance with the Valuation Acts, the valuations of such rateable hereditaments as are listed annually for that purpose by the various rating authorities, and (b) estimation, at the request of the Revenue Commissioners, for various property tax purposes of the capital value of interests in immovable property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All valuer staff are liable to be engaged on either of these duties and are interchangeable in these areas. While particular blocks of staff are assigned to these duties, temporary transfer of staff from one duty to <Col N="2499" /> another is required on occasion to meet peak and pressure periods.  Apart from adapting to such occasional needs, there has been no basic alteration in the amount of attention devoted to capital taxes work.  It should be noted that the annual revision of valuations has to be completed and the results issued to the rating authorities by a statutory date, which this year will be 1 October next. Valuations dealt with on annual revision may be increased, reduced or left unaltered, each case being dealt with on its own merits.  Since revisions of valuations are carried out at the initiative of the various rating authorities or of the individual ratepayer it would not be open to the Valuation Office to itself initiate a revision of valuations of shops, business premises and offices.</P>

I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report a list of these projects, broken down by category of project and the year of approval for fund aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the second part of the question, I should explain that it has not been the practice to give figures for fund aid for individual projects. Applications for fund assistance in respect of individual projects costing less than ten million units of account (£4.17 million) are, in accordance with article 7 of the fund regulation, submitted on a grouped basis for the <Col N="2500" /> country as a unit and the Commission determines a single aggregate aid figure for the grouped application.  Accordingly, it is not feasible to specify the amount of fund aid approved or paid in respect of individual projects in this category which accounts for the vast bulk of the projects approved for fund aid in Ireland.  Moreover, as the Deputy is probably aware, fund aid in respect of approved projects&mdash; whether above or below ten million units of account&mdash;is not used to &ldquo;top up&rdquo; the national aid already given to individual projects.  Instead, it is applied at present to the financing of increases in certain services under the public capital programme and is expended as an integral part of that programme.  However, the figures for the overall amounts of fund aid approved and received in the various years are included at the end of the list of projects which I am circulating.</P>
    <P>The following is the list:</P>

    <P>(1) The receipt figure given here is for the financial year 1973-74.  The changeover to the calendar year basis took place in 1974.  The figure of £221.6 million includes income tax payable by companies which, at that time, were liable to income tax and corporation profits tax.  The corresponding figure for 1978 relates to income tax payable by individuals; companies are not now liable to income tax, being chargeable to corporation tax only.</P>
    <P>(2) The capital taxes in 1978 are estate, legacy and succession duties, wealth tax, capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax.  The capital taxes in 1973-4 were estate, legacy and succession duties.</P>

Because of the large numbers of directories involved&mdash;over 200,000 in the Dublin/Dún Laoghaire area&mdash;it takes at least a fortnight to complete deliveries.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>: There can be a number of reasons, apart from tax, why the price of a product in Northern Ireland may be less than that for a product in this country.  The difference in price may be due to such factors as the lower cost of distribution in Northern Ireland, differing green £ rates affecting the cost of agricultural produce, higher costs of production here, the operation of the special employment scheme in Northern Ireland, or the use there of price lists which are in operation in the UK and which do not take account of the transport costs from the UK and the smaller volume of sales in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In certain instances, where there was no obvious reason for the discrepancy between prices here and in Northern Ireland, the National Prices Commision carried out studies in an effort to determine the cause of the discrepancy.  Summaries of these studies, which refer to distribution <Col N="2522" /> costs in Northern Ireland and the Republic, the prices of wheat and flour, grocery prices and motor vehicle prices, were published respectively in the November 1977, December 1977 January 1978, and April 1978 Reports of the National Prices Commission.</P>

    <P>A system of dissemination of price information has been in operation for 34 weeks, since 11 November 1977, when RTE began broadcasting on radio the results of a weekly survey of the prices in Dublin of the most common vegetables.  This was later extended to cover the prices of popular fruits, and the price of chickens in supermarkets.  The survey now includes prices in Dublin, Cork and Limerick of the commodities mentioned and these prices are broadcast on each Friday morning.  Furthermore, the results of a monthly survey of the average price of meat in the larger population centres <Col N="2523" /> throughout the country are now being broadcast.</P>
