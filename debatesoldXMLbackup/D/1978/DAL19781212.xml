      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he agrees with the comment contained in the recently released statement by the Central Statistics Office that the increase of 137 people unemployed in national Government services in mid-August is due to &ldquo;general slackness&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;General slackness&rdquo; is the expression regularly used by the Central Statistics Office to describe the cause of the seasonal increase in many industrial groups of the live register at the peak holiday period.  I consider its use as appropriate in the case of school bus drivers, school cleaners and temporary teachers as it is in the case of industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, having regard to the contribution made by indigenous Irish circuses to the cultural and artistic life of the country and the threat posed by foreign competition to these bodies, he will introduce legislation to broaden the scope of the Arts Act, 1951 to include circuses, and thereby afford Irish circuses a measure of financial support by the Arts Council to ensure their survival; and if he is <Col N="1124" /> aware of the practice of State subsidies for circuses in other European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Amending legislation is not envisaged in this area.  I am aware that there is State assistance for circuses in some European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach regard circuses as a form of art&mdash;does he agree they should be put into a separate category?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that down through the years circuses have been of tremendous interest to local communities, especially young people?  Is he aware that we are now faced with the extinction of circuses unless some State action is taken to protect them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me to interpret the legislation.  In the original Arts Act of 1951, the expression &ldquo;art&rdquo; means painting, sculpture, architecture, music, drama, the cinema, literature, design in industry, the fine arts and applied arts generally.  Deputy Deasy is as free as I am to interpret that and to say whether a circus would come under that definition.  In reply to Deputy Collins, he will remember, as I do, that when he was young he enjoyed circuses, and we need not identify particular Irish circuses.  I am sure he knows that even then circuses came from abroad and there were no means&mdash;if there were they were not applied&mdash;to prevent them from coming in.  I can only ask the Deputy that if he applies the criterion of preventing that kind of competition in the circus area, would he apply the same kind of thinking in relation, for example, to drama, operatic singers and so forth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach will agree that circuses are a vital part of the life of any young child, indeed of any society, and that there is merit in the idea of State support for national circuses which have been operating in Ireland throughout the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a national circus over there.</P>

    <Col N="1125" />
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the major national circus: I am talking about the minor national circuses.  At least two companies have been operating here throughout the years.  Would the Taoiseach not consider them to be of national importance and worthy of help from the Arts Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would regard these native circuses, if one could so describe them, as being important in the general national life, in relation to young people in particular.  Whenever the circus season starts, they employ Irish workmen.  However, apart altogether from our membership of the EEC one of the principal problems we would have in relation to circuses is the danger of the spread of animal diseases.  The only remedy we would have in that respect would be to exclude animals coming from abroad.  Once these animals satisfy the animal disease regulations laid down by the Department of Agriculture there is no reason why they should be excluded. In regard to circuses coming from Northern Ireland, where the same disease regulations apply, there would be no exclusion of them if they comply.  I do not know of any other means by which we could exclude circuses coming from abroad.  As I have said, throughout the years they have been coming and there were no suggestions they should be excluded. Whether active assistance should be given to them by way of grants from the Arts Council is a matter entirely for the Arts Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Though I understand what the Taoiseach has said about difficulty in giving protection, can the Taoiseach say whether the Government received from the Irish Circus Owners Association the same formal representations as every Deputy in the House has seen, and if so whether his reply was that nothing could be done for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government as such did not receive formal representations but each member of the Government and each member of my party, in our representative capacity as Members of the Dáil, received the same kind of letter as Deputy Kelly received.  The matter <Col N="1126" /> has been raised also with the Minister for Labour in relation to the employment of workmen in connection with the setting up of circuses&mdash;a question on it is down for written answer today.  I have given as comprehensive an answer as I can.  If assistance is available to them it is only under the Arts Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it within the compass of the Arts Council to give some aid to circuses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Arts Council can interpret section 1 of the 1951 Act which I have read out in general terms&mdash;not being permitted to quote it, I did not do so exactly.  The Arts Council are entitled to interpret that Act as they wish.  If they fail to do that, there is always recourse to the courts where the interpretation can be argued.  Deputy Deasy will remember that when he was a Member of the Seanad and supporting the National Coalition Government, he made the same case to my immediate predecessor&mdash;to include circuses specifically in the definition of &ldquo;arts&rdquo; in the Arts Act.  My predecessor refused to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated it might be possible to take helpful action on health grounds.  Would this not involve quarantine for a fairly lengthy period?  But it might be the answer to the problem confronting circuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have got the impression from the Taoiseach's replies to supplementaries on this matter that he is sympathetic towards finding some means of helping Irish circuses and that he is conscious of the very valuable part that the circus plays in Irish social life. Therefore, would the Taoiseach be prepared to undertake to examine some means by which Irish circuses could be helped to continue to play that valuable part in our social life?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that we must establish instruments and institutions by which we can give the kind of assistance that is being <Col N="1127" /> suggested.  We have such an institution in An Chomhairle Ealaion and each year we vote a sum of money for that body.  The sum voted is by no means excessive. I admit that readily, being responsible for that Vote but it is a matter for the people to whom we entrust the disposal of these moneys to allocate them as they wish and as they consider right.  It is not the practice, and rightly so, that the Taoiseach interferes in any way with the distribution of these moneys.  If the Arts Council should decide to select circuses exceptionally&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education is trying to get here on a one-wheel bicycle like a bear on a tightrope. Perhaps that is the reason for the rather generous replies we are receiving from him compared with the usual reply of a few words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to treat this matter seriously but where does the circus begin when some Deputies try to put on a clowning act while an effort is being made to answer questions that have been put in good faith.  However, if Deputy Kelly wishes to put on a clowning act and to be subsidised by the State, he might apply to the Arts Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Were the Arts Council to interpret circuses as coming within their scope&mdash;and the Taoiseach has so readily acknowledged they are operating on inadequate funds&mdash;would such a decision be taken into account by the Government in future allocations to the Arts Council?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is correct in stating that my request to have circuses included by the Arts Council for the purpose of grants was turned down by the then Government in 1974 but it is not correct to say that the matter is entirely one for the Arts Council because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It arose from the Deputy's concern and also from the concern of other public representatives in respect of transport as affecting Edeninfagh national school.

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the whole country is accepted by the Community as one single qualifying region for EEC regional fund assistance.</P>
      <P>To limit, as the Deputy suggests, our assistance from the fund to projects in the west would be counterproductive. The exclusion of the rest of the country from fund assistance which this would entail would in time only encourage our Community partners to press for a reduction in our national quota from the fund as quotas were decided by reference to a number of criteria such as population, which in our case was the size of the national population.</P>
      <P>Our receipts from the fund, which I agree are limited, nevertheless are useful in financing a higher level of investment and job creation than would otherwise be possible.  In view of my responsibilities for regional development, I have paid particular attention to ensure that as many projects as possible in our areas of greatest need such as the west are approved for regional fund assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, while it may be theoretically so that the country is designated altogether as a single region, would the Minister not agree that the basis for this fundamentally arises from <Col N="1139" /> the disparity between the lack of prosperity in the western region of the country as against the rest of it?  That is fully recognised, but I would ask the Minister to consider that this is the underlying situation.  I have asked the Minister further to go back to the time of the decision to go into the EEC and consider whether in fact, to the voters of the western half of the country, it was not this promise of the regional fund benefiting them and their area particularly that carried that decision so very decisively in that part of the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree that the regional fund is the only vehicle by which the disadvantaged areas of the country benefit from EEC membership.  I point to the fact that many of the poorer areas of the country, including the areas to which the Deputy refers, have benefited greatly from the influx of new investment for example, and of course there are other Community funds from which these areas would benefit such as the operation of the social fund.  Therefore, while I recognise that there is a need to pay particular attention to the problems of these areas&mdash;and I said so in my reply to the question&mdash;I do not accept that we should modify our existing arrangements in the direction which the Deputy suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I can take it that the Minister has no intention of rectifying the situation so far as the western regions are concerned?  I would also ask the Minister whether he does not accept that the latter part of my question has not been answered?  In other words, I would now ask the Minister to admit to this House that the regional fund, wherever it is being used, is not being used for projects that otherwise would not have been funded by the Government. <Col N="1140" /> This is really the basis of my entire question and complaint about this matter.</P>

If I heard him properly, the Minister did say that if the pattern of application of the funds which Deputy Blaney wants was followed here there would be complaints from our Community partners.

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not use the word &ldquo;complain&rdquo;.  The relevant fraction of my reply was that in time it would only encourage our Community partners to press for a reduction in our national quota as quotas were decided by reference to a number of criteria.  My point was that I do not see why it is necessary to leave ourselves in any way vulnerable to any proposals for change which might arise at some future date from other member states.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the amount in total provided in each of the years since our accession to the EEC is niggardly and too small and that, to compound the problem there, that the Government have not been spending it on projects in the areas in most need and which would not have been provided for otherwise by the Government?  In other words, it is being shoved into the budget and being spread <Col N="1141" /> around and the west is getting no benefit out of it and the Minister knows that.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask one final question.  Is it not a fact that the whole purpose of the concept of the regional fund and our entry into the EEC is to try to bring the economies of all members as nearly as possible to the same level and that within the countries concerned it is even more vital that the prosperity and the economy of the various parts of it should be the same.  Is that not the purpose of the whole exercise?</P>

      <P>In relation to Question No. 16 which the Minister has just answered, I would ask what is the reason for the delay between the mid-autumn date, which the explanatory leaflet circulated with the Green Paper promised, and the early January date which the Minister has now substituted for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The original period of delay arose from the fact that the various responses and the proposals made after the publication of the Green Paper were not in fact received in time to permit of the preparation of a White Paper by mid-autumn.  We were therefore faced with the choice of whether to simply press ahead with the White Paper and ignore the various proposals which were submitted or to hold up publication in order to take account of them.  Since the Green Paper was published as a discussion paper <Col N="1143" /> naturally my preference is to await the arrival of these various submissions. That accounts for the first period of delay.</P>
      <P>The more recent period of delay would obviously be associated with the possibility of creating a European Monetary System, because while it is possible to prepare a draft of a White Paper on what I might call a pre-EMS basis, nonetheless, since there were signs that decisions could have been available by a relatively early date it seemed more appropriate to await the outcome of those discussions.</P>

    <P>As the official measurement of employment is based on a mid-April estimate <Col N="1147" /> a firm estimate of the net employment increase by end-1978 cannot be made until the mid-April 1979 figures are available.  However, taking the trend in industrial employment combined with the impact of the Government's special job creation programme, the 1978 target could be exceeded if the present rate of redundancy diminishes.  If, however, redundancies continue at their present level for the remainder of the year, there could be a shortfall in the range 2,000-3,000 from the 1978 target of 20,000. This possible outturn suggests that gross employment increases in 1978 will be in the region of 35,000.</P>
    <P>Options for extra measures to create additional employment were outlined in the Green Paper &ldquo;Development for Full Employment&rdquo; and the forthcoming White Paper will set out decisions on these.</P>

If emigration is introduced as a factor which affects the number of people looking for work, the fact must also be introduced that the population is growing and there are more young people leaving schools and colleges and looking for work.  If the Deputy wants a debate on the total seeking work and the total who have found work, let us have it.  I have given the best estimate available to me of the increase in employment which has taken place this year and this is the largest increase in any single year since the foundation of the State, an achievement of which to be proud.</P>

Government policy measures to date have created a favourable environment for the private sector to expand.

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this <Col N="1154" /> year I said in this House that the relationship between increases in employment and movement in the live register was such that for every increase of 100 in employment the fall in the live register was estimated at between 50 and 65, that is, a half to two-thirds.  Taking the lower of those figures, the reduction of 11,000 in the live register, seasonally adjusted, would imply an employment increase of 22,000.  Taking the two-thirds figure, the reduction of 11,000 implies an increase in employment of 16,500.  It can be seen that the estimate of 17,000 which I have put forward is closer to the bottom range of the possible estimates.  It could well be that the actual increase in employment using that relationship would be of the order of 22,000, but I have deliberately opted for the more modest and conservative increase in employment because I did not want to be accused by the Opposition of any exaggeration or overstatement.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £6,954,000 be granted to defray <Col N="1200" /> the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31 day of December 1978 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>

      <P>I wish to comment on this Supplementary Estimate.  I take it that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture will be replying to this discussion.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate the position in relation to the expenditure of moneys?  While I understand that the Department have so far been able to keep within the provision made in the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and that none of the £6,954,000 has been spent, I would like to know on which individual subheads extra money is being provided in this Supplementary Estimate.  To my mind there is not sufficient financial control in this House if the Department are able to get around the safeguards provided by spending more on individual subheads without authority simply by making savings on other subheads.  Has this happened? I would like the Minister of State to cover this point in his reply.</P>
      <P>The incorrect estimation made by the Department in the original Estimate is for £20 million.  Admittedly £6.7 million is all that is needed in this Supplementary Estimate.  This is part of a pattern of insufficient provision for Agriculture. The position is that in the 1978 Estimates there was an increase of £8.8 million over the amount provided in 1977.  This was much less than the average increase given to other Departments who were given an increase of 17.6 per cent.  It is no wonder that the Minister for Agriculture has come here looking for more money.  As we said at the time, the original Estimate was skimped.  Even with this Supplementary Estimate the additional amount being provided is only 14 per cent more than the figure for 1977, still less than was provided for other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> Agriculture has been lagging behind as a Department so far as receiving aid from the Exchequer is concerned.  From 1971 to 1978 the average increase in provisions for Departments was 359 per cent while the increase to the Department of Agriculture was only 113 per cent.  This means that on average for every £3 extra given to other Departments since 1971, Agriculture has got only £1 extra.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with specific points in relation to this Estimate.  I note in subhead B.9 that there is an additional provision for the Farm Apprenticeship Board of £2,000 on the £40,000 provided in the 1978 Estimate.  I understand that the board are in real financial trouble and are not able to meet their expenses. There is a strong case for an increase in the allocation for that board.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the cost of training under the farm apprenticeship scheme is very low to the Exchequer in comparison with other schemes. I should like to give a few examples.  The 1978 cost to the Exchequer of the Farm Apprenticeship Board is only £190 per student per year while under the farrier apprenticeship scheme the cost to the Exchequer is £2,172 per year.  The cost of the pig husbandry course run by the Department is £1,300 per year while the cost of a full-time student at AnCO is £3,500 per year.  The cost of the 100-hour EEC course, a four week part-time course, is almost twice the amount of the farm apprenticeship course.  A total of £350 per student per year is allocated for that course, a lot more than the meagre £190 per student per year being provided to the Farm Apprenticeship Board.</P>
    <P>I am aware from representations I have received that the board are in significant difficulty this year.  The meagre increase of £2,000 on the inadequate £40,000 is insufficient.  The Minister should have a close look at the finances of the board because we all recognise that they are doing valuable work in giving students who have a theoretical knowledge of agriculture after spending one year in an agricultural college, a sound practical <Col N="1202" /> knowledge by working on farms over a three-year period.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that there has been a saving of £4.2 million on the amount provided in the 1978 Estimate for the eradication of brucellosis.  I am sure Members will agree that when 36 per cent of an amount allocated in an Estimate is not spent the Minister has a question to answer.  We are told that the eradication of brucellosis is an urgent national priority but how is it that the Department who were given £11 million to spend on the eradication of brucellosis in 1978 failed to spend £4.2 million? There are a number of ways that money could have been spent.  For example, small store producers who suffer considerable hardship resulting from the introduction of the 30-day test could have been compensated by the payment of the fees for the carrying out of the test by the Department.  In view of the low density of veterinary surgeons per square mile in the west the cost of having these tests carried out tends to be higher for such producers and they could have been helped with that money.  There is a great need to help small producers meet the extra burden they must bear.  It is unfair that the Department have now to hand back £4.2 million because they failed to spend that amount on brucellosis eradication.</P>
    <P>The grants for compensation for reactors and under the hardship scheme in relation to brucellosis are not adequate and that is another area where the £4.2 million could have been spent.  There is also a need for an additional veterinary laboratory to be established in Munster and in Connacht.  At present all samples of blood under the brucellosis scheme must be sent to Thorndale in Dublin for testing.  There are considerable postal delays in this and for that reason there is a strong case for separate laboratories.  I should like to draw attention to a problem which has arisen in relation to the 30-day test.  To the best of my knowledge if animals are tested for brucellosis and tuberculosis the 30-day movement period for tuberculosis starts to run from the date on which the second visit of the vet to the herd takes place and the animals have been read. <Col N="1203" /> The reality is that the blood test result for brucellosis would not be back at that stage and may not be returned for up to eight days after the 30 days for tuberculosis has started to run.  Obviously, a farmer cannot move his cattle unless they are clear of brucellosis and tuberculosis but the result of the present situation is that the movement period is considerably less than the 30 days, perhaps only 20 days or less.  This is unfair and was not the intention of those who introduced the scheme.  Something should be done about it.  We should ensure that the 30-day movement period does not commence until the results of both tests are to hand.</P>
    <P>I notice that an additional sum of £10.3 million was provided for market intervention incidental expenses.  I understood that the cost of market intervention was recouped entirely by the EEC but I note that, under Appropriations in Aid, the recoupment by the EEC of incidental expenses is only £9.5 million. It appears that the Irish Government are being asked to spend £10.3 million but get only £9.5 in return from the EEC.  That is not the way the scheme was intended to operate and there should not be a shortfall of that sort.</P>
    <P>I note that there has been a big saving under the scheme for the promotion of horticulture.  Of the amount of money provided for horticulture in the 1978 Estimate 75 per cent remains unspent. Why was that money not spent?  Is there a policy of not providing money for horticulture on the scale it should be provided?  That saving is significant when one notes that under another subhead, a provision for horticultural producer groups, there was another saving of 29 per cent of the amount provided.  It appears that money is being provided for horticulture in the Estimate but not spent.  In view of the importance of horticulture to the economy this is regrettable.</P>
    <P>Under Appropriations in Aid I note that the receipts from poultry hatchery licences and blood testing fees increased greatly.  I should like to know if the fees were increased or if there is a greater <Col N="1204" /> usage of the facilities.  I note also that there is a deficiency of about £500,000 in receipts from the EEC under the farm modernisation scheme.  Many Members have expressed dissatisfaction about the way the EEC are providing money to us in return for money spent by us on that scheme.  There is an undue delay in the payment by the EEC.  Would the Minister explain that deficiency?  Are steps being taken to avoid a recurrence of this?  If we spend the money in 1978 and the EEC do not recoup us until the middle of 1980 we are out of our money for a long time.  At present high interest rates that is a serious situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister if in the areas he is looking for an increase he intends spending more money.  Will £7 million extra be spent or is the Minister seeking the approval of the House to spend money alloted to certain subheads under other subheads?  Is there an element of that in the extra £7 million? My second point is with regard to the increases sought under the various headings.  Are the increases due to inflation or is there an increase in the services in those areas?  If the increases are due to inflation, the attitude of Members and the Minister is at variance with the attitude of the Minister's colleague towards county councils.  They have to work within their original estimates.  I should like that point clarified.</P>
      <P>There is an increase with regard to subsidies on dairy products.  Does that reflect an increase in the consumption of such products?  Some time ago we were told by the Minister for Health when we pressed him here to introduce a levy for milk for schools and where some of the money would be provided by the EEC that it was not possible to increase consumption of milk and butter.  He told us that consumption of those products was at a peak.  Is the increase in the amount available here due to an increase in the consumption of those items?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the following point is not mentioned in the Estimate I should like to put it forward because this will be the only opportunity we will have to discuss <Col N="1205" /> agriculture, and in particular dairy products, before the recess and it may be too late to deal with the matter afterwards. I would ask the Minister of State to impress on the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that they should take a very strong line with regard to the GATT proposal to allow New Zealand to import cheddar cheese into the EEC.  The amount in question is small but it is the thin end of the wedge. If it is necessary for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use his veto on the result of the GATT meeting if it does not suit us, he should do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to give special attention to the Farm Apprenticeship Board, as has been mentioned already.  In view of inflation the sum being provided is not realistic. Everyone accepts that the board are doing wonderful work and it would be more realistic to double the amount. They are providing jobs and are training farmers as farm managers.  There is considerable demand at the moment for farm managers but there are not enough of them.  We see the work of AnCO and the high cost involved.  This is an area where we could spend a little money and obtain good results with regard to providing jobs.</P>
      <P>A sum of £20,000 was provided for horticulture and it appears we spent only £5,000.  This is an amazing situation.  I do not know if this could be diverted to commercial horticulture.  Companies such as Erin Foods and the potato processing company in the Minister's area are crying out for money for development, processing, market research and so on and I should have thought that a sum of £250,000 would be a much more realistic figure for horticulture. This is one area where we can and have competed.  It is a question of finance.  At the moment the sugar beet industry is trying to finance horticulture but that is not good enough.  Under the EEC regulations the sugar beet grower has to get the full EEC price for his beet and there is not much money left for development.  I should like the Minister of State to take note of these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to <Col N="1206" /> the apprenticeship board and to ask the Minister to consider this matter further. I was instrumental in setting up the board and in getting the first subsidies for them.  They are doing a very good job and I should like to endorse what has been said.  I know they are short of money and if anything could be done to increase the amount I would be very grateful.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the money saved on the schemes for eradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis.  If possible something should be done to help people in the isolated areas with regard to the 30-day test.  I heard of a case where a blood test was made, where the sample was sent away and was back within 14 days.  However, three cows in the herd had to be tested again.  There was no delay on the part of anybody but by the time the matter was finalised a period of 31 days had elapsed.  The man had to keep his cattle for another month or two. It is natural that in any new scheme there would be pitfalls but this matter can be very serious for people who do not have fodder.</P>
      <P>With regard to county committees of agriculture, in the breakdown of the Estimate there is no mention of clerical staff for the agricultural advisers. Everyone knows that these people are doing too much paper work and not doing enough of the work they are qualified to do.</P>
      <P>These are just a few points that I consider urgent and I should like the Minister to refer to them in his reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for their brief contributions to this debate.  We realise that in a limited debate like this it is not possible to deal in detail with all the matters we should like to discuss.  I shall confine myself mainly to replying to the points raised by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main Estimate for Agriculture amounting to £147.411 million was passed on 27 June last.  This Supplementary Estimate brings the total net provision for the year to £154.365 million which is £18 million over the total net <Col N="1207" /> provision for 1977.  The sum now sought takes into account savings amounting to about £4.761 million.  On top of the voted money, agriculture also gets very large sums from the EEC.  These are up by more than £100 million this year so it is wrong, as Deputy Bruton did, to talk about less money being provided for agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>From the EEC.  I was quoting from the Supplementary Estimate.  I did not take this off the top of my head.  On the last page under deficiencies in receipts from the EEC under the farm modernisation scheme the figure is £545,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only one scheme. I thought the Deputy was talking about the total allocation for agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that later. Under subhead A.1 provision is made for a further £1.1 million which is required mainly to meet the cost of the 1978 pay agreement.  Increases provided for under subheads B.2, B.3, B.4, B.7, B.9 and J. amount to £700,000 and are also due to the implementation of the national pay agreement.  At subhead A.4, an extra £150,000 is being provided mainly to meet increases in travelling rates which were decided upon during the year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the saving on the brucellosis scheme.  The saving is actually £4.2 million.  This reflects a substantial reduction in the number of reactors detected.  The percentage of reactor animals last year was 0.81 per cent of total and this year it is 0.52 per cent. Some of the saving from this section is going into the hardship fund at subhead C.5.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Farm Apprenticeship Board were mentioned.  They got £3,000 extra on the original Estimate.  They are now getting a further £2,000 which brings the total increase to £5,000 over the figure last year which, I understand, was £37,500.  This is a respectable increase.  The Farm Apprenticeship Board are doing a very fine job. If it is found that further funds are needed I am sure we will be able to satisfy them.</P>
      <P>On the question of horticulture, projects by two co-ops are not likely to be completed this year, hence the saving of £15,000 at subhead D.8.  The saving under subhead M.12 is partly due to the fact that claims have not been received from some producer groups so far.  I hope that explains the position with regard to horticulture.</P>
      <P>A sum of £1.2 million is being provided under subhead C.5, payment of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication schemes hardship fund grant-in-aid, in order to make additional payments to herd owners who suffer serious losses from having to dispose of a high proportion of their herds as reactors to tests for bovine TB or brucellosis.</P>
      <P>The 30-day test was mentioned.  I know there are many problems in this area but, by and large, the scheme is working out well.  Farmers now realise the importance of this 30-day test.  If there are problems which can be resolved we will do our best to try to resolve them.  It is in the interests of farmers that the incidence of TB and brucellosis in the national herd should be reduced.  I should like to sound a note of warning to persons who refuse to cooperate in the disease eradication effort, or who fail to abide by the regulations. No mercy can be shown to persons who undermine the eradication campaign by illegal movements of cattle, tag switching, forgery of identity cards, and so on.  There must be a total commitment by all concerned if we are to get rid of bovine TB and brucellosis quickly. We must do this to stay in business.  An additional £1 million arises under the lime and fertilisers subhead, D.1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> Deputy Bruton mentioned the shortfall in receipts from the EEC for the farm modernisation scheme and the disadvantaged areas scheme.  This does not mean we will not get the money.  It merely reflects the timing of the actual payments which are not now expected until after the end of the year.  That explains the position.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the points raised by Deputies.  I do not intend to delay the House any further.  Other Estimates have to be introduced.</P>

      <P>On the aspect of sea fishing I am very disappointed that the Minister has not agreed to implement the draft proposals placed before him by the Irish Fishermen's Organisation.  These proposals have been published for some three months.  They would really guarantee the future of the fishing industry if they were implemented, and the cost is not very great.  It would probably represent a saving on the cost of our existing fishery protection service if these proposals which have tremendous advantages were implemented.  A document on fisheries which goes into such detail and which makes such good sense has never been produced here and I hope that the Minister appreciates the work done by this organisation.  The idea of getting the Community to pay a portion of the costs and to get the countries <Col N="1211" /> whose boats are fishing in our waters to pay at least half of the cost is very good sense and it would eliminate a great deal of the hardship imposed on the Naval Service.  The same effort would not be needed to patrol our 200 mile limit as is needed now if a fishery protection officer placed on board each foreign vessel entering our waters was able to observe the fishing effort.  Not alone that but such an officer could observe the areas from which the various species come. This would save a lot of effort on the part of the fishery protection service and it would provide us with an immense amount of information about fish stocks around our coasts.  At the moment we are absolutely ignorant of the fish in the sea about us.</P>
      <P>I know that in recent years BIM undertook a series of surveys using Irish fishing boats whereby the boats were paid by the board for surveying the type of fish available in certain areas.  These have been reasonably successful.  Good fishing grounds have been found off the Donegal coast for instance, but such surveys would not be necessary if there were fishery protection officers on board the boats who could survey the catch as part of their duties.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the reticence of the Minister to acknowledge the worth of these proposals.  The Minister would be going a long way towards improving relations between himself and the fishing organisations if he implemented these proposals.  Those relations unfortunately have not been good in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like if they were greatly improved because that organisation represents the bulk of sea-going people here and they have a lot to offer. For the good of the country and the sake of fisheries it is necessary that the organisation and the Minister should be seen to pull together.  Even if the Minister feels he must climb down a little, I appeal to him to meet them half way.  Between the Minister and the organisation they could do a lot for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a grey area in relation to <Col N="1212" /> grants for boats and harbours.  What grants are available has never been sufficiently clear.  It may be quite easy to understand the grants available from BIM, but the EEC grants change so often and are so complex that it is not easy for a layman to follow them.  I believe that we are not getting the full benefit of the grants available because they have not been explained properly. Sometimes the grants available from the EEC come to light only when the closing date has arrived.  Would the Minister make sure that all information on grants for fishing boats is available at the first opportunity?</P>
    <P>We are not sure about the grants available for harbours.  In reply to a number of questions over the last 12 or 18 months the Minister indicated that such grants are available but we have never been told anything about them. The closest we have got to any concrete information is that grants are available under the regional fund.  Are these grants in conjunction with other grants for roads, water schemes and so on?  Are they funnelled into central funds and dispersed afterwards in whatever form the Government wish?  Can they be given out in social welfare, housing grants and a whole variety of things?  It is not at all clear how much is available for harbours, which are a very necessary link in our fisheries.  We have the men and we are in the process of getting an adequate fishery fleet, but we lack the coastal facilities.  While the project undertaken some ten years ago to build four major fishery harbours is near completion I am afraid that the smaller projects have barely got off the ground.  I would be glad it the Minister would clear that up. It is not clear what grants are available from the EEC or what grants are available from the Department of Fisheries for harbour development.</P>
    <P>In County Waterford we were told lately that we would get a 25 per cent grant for the improvement of an existing harbour.  In reply to recent Dáil questions I saw that a 75 per cent grant is available for certain harbour works in Donegal.  Would the Minister clarify the maximum grant available?  A lot more people could be working in the fishing <Col N="1213" /> industry if the harbours were of a proper quality.  At the moment a great deal of them cannot be used to moor boats in winter time.  It is not uncommon to have all-weather harbours at a distance of 70 or 80 miles from one another and we need all-weather harbours in strategic positions all around the coast.</P>
    <P>There is a great future for small boats. We have been thinking of middle distance trawlers too much.  There is a great potential for expansion for small boats which engage in drift netting for herrings and in fishing for white fish or shell fish close to the shore.  During the past few years there has been a tremendous increase in the value of fish.  While the catch has hardly increased in recent years&mdash;in fact it has decreased quite a bit since the early 1970s&mdash;the value has increased tremendously.  As a money product fish have increased in line with beef and other products.</P>
    <P>We could catch the fish if they were there.  It is unfortunate that herring fishery after herring fishery has been closed.  I appreciate that the Minister is trying to make the best of a bad job and that abuses by Continentals have led to this depletion which makes closures necessary.  I hope that the fishing plans the Minister has announced will be implemented to the full.  The last fishing plan which was introduced for the west coast expired on 15 October.  If we are to maintain existing stocks we must have new fishing plans.  Would the Minister tell us why he has not replaced the fishing plan which expired?  In regard to marketing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is surely a reflection on the marketing facilities that recently 10,000 tons of mackerel were dumped. They could not be used for human consumption because marketing outlets were not available.  I should like the Minister to tell us if he has any plans to ensure that that situation does not continue. If we have no outlets we must process at home.  We do not seem to be able to sell the raw material that we catch nor do we seem to be able to process it.  We understand that it will take a long time to build up processing facilities but in the meantime we should have a marketing outlet.</P>
      <P>Mariculture has been very much in the news recently.  There was a seminar on this subject in Leenane in County Galway.  It was illustrated graphically at the seminar by experts from all over Europe that we have the most outstanding climate and natural indented coastline for the expansion of the mariculture industry.  Mariculture is an obvious source of wealth and employment. Mussels, oysters and scallops can be cultivated in abundance.  There is a great demand for shellfish and the price is high.  I should like to ask the Minister if his Department are taking definite steps to bring about the type of expansion that is available in this sector of the fishing industry.  We know that Russia and Japan are advanced in this field.  By 1990 the Russians expect to produce more fish by the mariculture method than by deep-sea trawling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter is related to education and training.  Recently the Minister admitted that there is neglect in this area.  I know that he has brought about some change in that he has transferred responsibility for training from the Department to BIM.  This was a step in the right direction.  Does the Minister intend to set up another fishery school or does he intend to set up a series of fishery schools? I know that the setting up of such schools would cost a lot of money but it should be a primary consideration in regard to plans for expenditure in the next few years.  It is obvious that a great number of our fishermen are inadequately trained.  They are unable to use the advanced technology which should be installed <Col N="1215" /> in trawlers being built at present. The Minister should tell us what steps he is taking to ensure that the advanced technology is fully used.</P>
    <P>When we negotiated The Hague Agreement in 1976 with the other members of the EEC, we were assured that within three years we could double our fishing catch for 1976.  In 1976 the catch was 75,000 tons.  By 1979 we should be catching 150,000 tons, but as yet we have only slightly increased our 1976 catch.  The only way in which we can increase our catch is by fishing farther away from our shore.  The day when our fishermen fished within seven or eight miles offshore should be at an end.  We must endeavour to fish up to the 50-mile limit.  I should like to know if the Minister has any proposals for larger boats for fishing in this area.  There is an onus on the Minister to see that we double our catch within a short time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a few words to what has been said on the Fisheries Estimate, particularly under subhead E in relation to inland fisheries development.  Although I have had not had the time to do it recently, it has been my good fortune for some years to fish in some of the free rivers.  There are still, thank God, free rivers around the country.  I hope I will be given the protection of the House if I admit that a rod and line was not always the only way I took fish out of a free river.  For the most part, a rod and line was what I used.</P>
      <P>I note that we are making a payment of £40,000 under subhead E to the salmon conservation fund.  One must really express serious doubts as to whether this is enough because there may soon be no salmon to conserve in some of our waters.  I am grateful to hear the Minister say that he is publishing restrictions this evening and I should be grateful for a copy of them in due course, as I am grateful for his reference to the impending fisheries legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are dealing with salmon fisheries we are dealing with something that is a national resource, the exploitation, control and management of which should be at least above party politics.  It <Col N="1216" /> is already beyond dispute that the situation is critical.  No less a figure than the chairman of the ESB, Professor Dillon, has already pointed out that in the rivers overseen by the ESB the situation is critical.  In other rivers the situation may well be reaching the point of no return. A feature of animal species is that if stocks go below a certain level, regardless of the fact that there are still members of that species, there are not enough of them to overcome the downward slide.  Eventually the whole stock will become exhausted and will have to be replenished by expensive methods.  Now is the time to spend the money.  If we do not spend the money now it will cost us a great deal more in a couple of years time and our efforts then will be attended by a much slimmer chance of success than would greet them at present.</P>
    <P>It has been represented strongly to me that the only way to control the situation is at least to arrange a temporary moratorium on the catching of game fish, particularly salmon.  Another possibility is that the enforcement of the existing legislation and of the restrictions which the Minister is now proposing to introduce should be tightened.  It is quite possible that existing restrictions are not being enforced as adequately as possible. There are boats landing fish in ports with illegal nets lying heaped on their decks.  One guard standing at the end of a pier could probably make a severe dent in illegal netting practices.  There are fish being sold in markets and auctions through existing licences that could in no way have been caught by the operators holding those licences alone. They must have been caught somewhere else.</P>
    <P>At the very least the Minister should approach his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to ensure that the Revenue makes some attempt at estimating the revenue to the holders of these licences, which may or may not be used to follow illegally caught fish onto the market.  The ideal thing might be to have a State-controlled market for game fish in general and for salmon in particular and to control the issue of licences to part-timers in particular.  I do not mean the <Col N="1217" /> part-timers who are half-farmers and half fishermen and eking out a living on the western seaboard but the part-timers who already have full-time well-paid jobs and can afford to finance expensive boats and equipment to enable them to have an unfair advantage over those for whom fishing is an essential and basic part of their livelihood.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying that I hope we are not too late in introducing these restrictions, introducing the legislation which the Minister proposes to bring in. If the legislation goes far enough it will have the wholehearted support of people who have fisheries in general and inland fisheries in particular at heart.  It is important to remember that the inland fisheries business is not simply the preserve of the wealthy who in some cases have sole access to privileged parts of certain rivers; it is also a very substantial element in our tourist trade especially in the west and affords genuine enjoyment to many people who could not begin to think of affording the kind of money it costs to put a rod on some of our rivers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am highly critical of this Supplementary Estimate from the point of view of job creation.  We are talking here about the provision of a measly £10 extra for Fisheries: that is all the Supplementary Estimate amounts to and its only purpose is to allow money to be transferred from one subhead or set of subheads to another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reading it perfectly well.  It is important to analyse the changes.  In fact, what is happening is that under subhead C.3 there is a saving of £195,000 on main fishery harbour works, money which if it had been spent would have directly contributed to the creation of construction jobs in harbours. That money is not being spent on harbours.  How is it being spent?  It is being used for travelling expenses and I calculate that approximately £150,000 of it is being used directly for administration under subheads B.1, C.4 <Col N="1218" /> and F.  Most of that money additionally being provided under those subheads will be used for administration and £195,000 which was provided for capital works at harbours has not been spent. That is why we have a Supplementary Estimate&mdash;to enable this bookkeeping adjustment to be made.  That is the wrong sort of priority.  In view of the priority being given to job creation the Minister should have made sure that the moneys provided for harbour works were spent because it was job creation money.  The fact that the Minister has to admit here that he has failed to spend 13 per cent of the amount provided for main harbour works in the 1978 Estimate speaks for itself.  If that money had been spent it would have directly created jobs.  That is a bad situation of which the Minister cannot be proud.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister have a close look at the prospects for mussel fisheries?  I am particularly interested in this in my constituency.  I am interested in the provision of a purification plant for mussels at the Boyne estuary.  I hope the Minister and his officials will consider that matter sympathetically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister if he would re-consider this matter of the fisheries protection officer. This could go a long way to allay the uneasiness of Irish fishermen at present <Col N="1219" /> regarding the operation of overseas trawlers generally.  These trawlers come into Irish ports not necessarily to fish but to visit.  All that somebody going on board at that stage can find is a solid block of ice.  Nobody knows what is aboard.  It may be herring; it looks like mackerel but obviously there is no proper supervision of their operations.  A fisheries protection officer would allay much of the uneasiness in this regard.</P>
      <P>All the money that has been mentioned and more with it should have been spent on main harbour works.  A previous speaker pointed out that we still have many fishermen who operate small boats.  Most salmon fishermen operate with small boats and many traditional fishermen work from boats of about 18 feet.  They need all-weather harbours but they do not have them.  We have been told in regard to places like Ballycotton and Youghal it is the job of the Office of Public Works or of somebody else. Money that should have been spent in protecting these small harbours has not been spent.  As Deputy Bruton said, this would give employment and protect existing fishing boats.  In the storms over the weekend six of these boats were sunk in Ballycotton.  There are fishermen's boats at the bottom of the bay because the tides came over the breakwater and swamped the boats.  Yet we have a large sum of money unspent here.  I appeal to the Minister to spend the money where it should be spent.</P>

I mention that to bring an air of reality into the matter because this happens every year in regard to the harbours estimate, both in my Department and in my previous Department of Transport and Power, because of the indeterminate nature of harbour work.</P>

      <P>The Deputy thinks one can just trigger off harbour works by pressing a button.  It is not like that. They involve highly complex engineering. I am glad that Howth harbour works are now under way; contracts are being placed and the investment is proceeding.  As regards the sort of transfers that took place, one that was not referred to here is a very important one in which the Government take a certain pride.  After the acquisition under the capital Vote last year of the Galway Fishery we had to provide for the management of it.  We shall be reimbursed out of receipts over the next four or five years from the management which has been established but part of the transfer involved in the current Supplementary Estimate involves the management of the recently acquired Galway Fishery.</P>
      <P>I am glad to report that it has been an excellent investment in which the State will be reimbursed its capital investment inside five years from not only salmon receipts but also from the more than substantial receipts from eels&mdash;an unexpected bonus to the extent that it did arise.  I shall have further figures for the House at the end of the year on the total success of the operation.  As it was the first commercial fishery acquired by the State since the foundation of the State I am glad to report that progress has been excellent and that I intend to acquire on a regular basis more of these fisheries so that ultimately all the commercial fisheries will be within national ownership.  That is where some of the money to which Deputy Bruton referred has been transferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to enter into a full debate today on this matter because we are strictly confined to the matters before us on the Supplementary Estimate but certain matters were raised and emphasis laid on them and so, with the permission of the Chair, I shall deal with them, Deputy Deasy and Deputy Hegarty referred to the need to have fishery protection officers on board boats to ensure that the quotas are enforced <Col N="1221" /> within our waters.  This has been the subject of very serious debate between the IFO and myself.</P>
    <P>The Irish Fishermen's Organisation and myself had a very important meeting on this and a number of other matters yesterday week.  I should emphasise again that relations are excellent between us.  There are continuing meetings and discussions and a very real understanding between myself, the Irish Fishermen's Organisation and the other fishermen's Organisations and fish processors and export organisations within the State.  Therefore one does not mind the bit of shadow boxing that has to go on at every level in politics and in dealing with groups.  Very good and genuine relations exist between me, my Department, the Irish Fishermen's Organisation and all the other bodies concerned with Irish fisheries development. This aspect is one we are at present considering.  We have set up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee comprised of officers of my Department and the Irish Fishermen's Organisation to discuss ways and means of pushing this forward and having some sort of fishery officer and ancillary force to back up the navy in their protection work.</P>
    <P>I would envisage these men being placed on specific boats over a certain size, fishing out specific quotas in certain waters around our coast under fishing plans.  I should like to see them incorporated as an essential ingredient of any fishing plans we would make with any other member state within the Community. I mention that in order to emphasise that discussions are going ahead quietly all the time.  Of course, good news never makes news but that sort of discussion is continuing on a constructive and responsible basis.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to the Irish Navy for their work over the past few years, in particular last year, which was a difficult one because of the number of closures we introduced.  These brought a more complex element into the whole area of fishery protection.  The work done by the navy, in co-operation with my Department, ensures particularly that the legislation passed in the House in July last, together with the active <Col N="1222" /> presence of the Irish Navy, will constitute a very real deterrent as regards any illegal fishing by any other country within our waters, contrary to arrangements we have reached with those countries, or if they are fishing there illegally without any degree of right at all.  Either way, both in regard to other countries in the Community and in regard to Third countries, the presence of the Irish Navy and the sort of penalties we now have will act as a very real deterrent, and have been acting as such for the past six months. While one can never be satisfied or complacent, I am satisfied that by the presence of the Navy, allied to the very real legislation, with real teeth as regards penalties, we have now acted in a substantial way to reduce illegal fishing by other countries, both other Community countries and other Third countries, within our 200-mile limit waters.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity also of thanking the Navy for their work in dealing with our own illegal salmon fishermen on the Shannon.  This is our own fault; we cannot blame other nations for this.  It developed to an inordinate extent in recent years but suffered a setback last year, again due to the presence of the Navy.  The ensuring legislation, which is practically with the printer now, and which I hope to have for Members of the House to look at as part of their Christmas reading, because we hope to have it published next week, will have substantially increased penalties for illegal salmon fishing, increases of the same percentage rate for illegal salmon fishing as we introduced for illegal sea fishing in the legislation passed in July last.</P>
    <P>The important aspect of the fishery protection area is that this really would not have been possible were it not for the fact that we got substantial help in the way of direct grant transfer from the EEC, help of the order of £30 million. Approximately £10 million of that has already been paid in the current year, has been paid now in respect of commitments entered into last year and this year.  We hope to get another £20 million <Col N="1223" /> over the next two years from this source in respect of boats, all of which will be built in Ireland&mdash;again this is my colleague's area&mdash;some of them equipped with helicopter facilities, helicopter pads, to enable them operate a joint helicopter-naval protection service.</P>

      <P>I have sanctioned one already for the Shannon region; the Limerick Board of Conservators have bought one.  There is a proposal under way from the Cork Fisheries Board for the same purpose.  When we have the new regional boards properly funded under the new legislation we will have seven regional boards around the coast, under a central fisheries authority, dealing with salmon and inland fish.  My immediate target is to have under each of these boards at least one boat for a start to engage in this near water protection and enforcement.  This whole area of protection and legislation to back up protection, both in regard to sea fisheries and inland fisheries in the estuaries, has been the big lack in recent years and the reason that wholesale illegal fishing, both by non-nationals and nationals, has become almost a way of life until&mdash;and I might say with some justification&mdash;the past 12 or 18 months when we got down to really getting a grip on this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Horgan emphasised the whole area of salmon control and rightly so. Under existing legislation we are introducing salmon regulations which have gone to the media today and will be published tomorrow&mdash;we issued them today&mdash;dealing with a whole range of controls that will very severely limit commercial salmon fishing and rod fishing next year by cutting down the length of the season, cutting down the size of boat dealing in such commercial fishing, introducing a much longer closed season in respect of salmon fishing and introducing as near a uniform restriction as possible on the size and depth of net.  Those regulations, linked with increased penalties and the legislation which will be law next year, should <Col N="1224" /> lead to an enforcement regime which will be effective.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy&mdash;although he referred to many areas&mdash;was more concerned with the sea fishing side.  He raised the question of grant from the EEC towards the cost of boats.  These grants will operate from now on on the basis of a 50 per cent contribution from the EEC towards boats under approximately 90 feet.  That is the present limit of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara credit terms.  In effect, that applies to practically the whole of the present Irish fleet.  Of course, 50 per cent is a substantial grant&mdash;what the EEC call a grant towards restructuring fishing boats.  It was part of the package we negotiated in addition to the grant transfer for fishery protection boats.  As Deputy Deasy said, there was some difficulty about its introduction but the air is now clear on that matter.  It is now part of an EEC regulation and will be continued year in and year out.  It applies only to ourselves and to Italy. Included with that also is a 50 per cent grant towards mariculture, also to ourselves and Italy, on the same basis because there is very strong scientific evidence to bear out the point of view expressed here, that there is substantial hope in developing mariculture in all its forms&mdash;mussels development.  scallops development&mdash;we already have oyster development to a reasonable extent but we can have more of it&mdash;and sea salmon.  You will never have full replacement in the area of the natural or wild salmon but in the shellfish areas all the experimentation shows that you can farm mussels, scallops and oysters quite effectively.  I mention that because a number of proposals in regard to shellfish are coming through now and there is a 50 per cent EEC grant for this development in the under-developed areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to education and training.  We intend to spread these facilities around the coast and have them as on-going facilities and not just on the basis of training skippers or fishermen, full stop, but on the basis of maintaining regular contact in the ports all the time so as to have in-service training and courses available all the year round, year <Col N="1225" /> in and year out.  This sort of continuity has been lacking in the scheme up to now.  There was a cut-off point once a skipper or fisherman was qualified. What is needed nowadays in this constantly changing and developing industry, an industry which has become highly technological, is to keep the skippers and the fishermen up with developments. It is on that aspect of education and training that there will be the highest degree of concentration in the future.  I have apportioned all that area to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara as they are a State-sponsored body with a more flexible mandate, as it were, and would therefore be the more appropriate body to handle this.  There will be further announcements about this in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Landings were mentioned.  Here I would assure Deputy Deasy that our value landings have improved substantially and so have quantity landings.  The total sea fish landings in 1978, in volume terms, came to 43,650 tonnes as against 35,648 tonnes in 1977 and, in value terms, £13,200,000 as against £9 million. Value terms show a 50 per cent increase and quantity terms a 25 per cent increase.  There has been a change in the graph in recent years.  In the case of herrings, landings in 1978 in value came to £4.4 million as against £1.5 million in 1977, an increase of 200 per cent.  The tonnage doubled from 7,000 tonnes to 14,000 tonnes.  For the first time ever, and this is the best barometer of all, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara arrears in regard to loans are fully up to date.  I mention these few facts to emphasise that things are going very well.  If there are differences they are legitimate differences. Everybody concerned is anxious to do even better.</P>
    <P>As far as harbours are concerned, we are now seeking funds from the EEC under the Regional Fund for Greencastle and Clogherhead developments.  There is no reason why we should not get funds for these.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,891,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1978, for salaries and expenses in connection with Forestry and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather unfortunate that forestry is tied in with fisheries as a Ministry and as a Department because forestry merits separate attention.  There is hardly any sphere of development in <Col N="1227" /> which we have had such a colossal increase in output and that colossal increase will continue over the next 20 years.  In reply to some questions recently the Minister told us the output from State forests will be immense by 1998 and away beyond the capacity of our present timber processing plants.  I would like the Minister to let us know what plans he has to absorb this fantastic production.  We have a colossal amount of timber coming on stream and we do not seem to have the facilities to process it.  Due to dumping by a number of east European and Scandinavian countries our timber industry is unfortunately depressed, particularly the processing sector, and we depend on the processing sector for a really viable industry. If the outlets are not available it is not much good producing the raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subhead C4, we see that £680,000 will be provided to assist the Irish Board Mills in Athy.  It is a sad state of affairs when we have a raw material in such abundance that the industries involved in processing it should be in such financial difficulty.  I am aware there are four processing industries. As well as the one in Athy there is one in Scariff, one in Clondalkin and one in Waterford.  From time to time two, if not all three, have been in financial difficulties.  I know Munster Chipboard has been helped considerably by Fóir Teoranta in recent years.  It is a sad reflection that this should be the evolution. What are the Minister's views on the situation?  Is it solely due to dumping by east European and Scandinavian countries or are there other factors involved? Has the Minister's Department plans for the setting up of the most logical type of processing industry, namely, a chemical pulp mill?  In reply to a question recently, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy told us that to provide such a mill would involve capital in excess of £100 million.  That seems an incredible figure for a timber processing project.  Obviously we are importing tens of millions of pounds worth of items such as newsprint which we should be able to provide ourselves at <Col N="1228" /> home.  This is an obvious outlet for our vast forestry produce which will be coming on stream in the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell us if we will be able to maintain existing planting schedules?  Last year on this Estimate he gave a figure of 25,000 acres annually of new forests.  This does not now seem such a likely proposition in view of the increased value of land and the fact that it is increasingly difficult to get land for afforestation&mdash;people are inclined to hold on to land at all costs, and if it is not of good quality, to reclaim it.  I find it difficult to see how the figure the Minister gave last year will be maintained, and I hope the Minister will tell us of the Department's plans for the future.</P>
    <P>There are very few sectors where there could be such a number of new jobs provided as in the forestry line and in timber processing and we should have a vast increase in the numbers employed in this sector in the years ahead.  What plans has the Minister for the creation of more jobs?  We will be only too glad to give any advice we have to give and to listen to his views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Supplementary Estimate which represents an increase of 14 per cent on the original.  It is important to bear in mind that as far as Government investment is concerned, forestry has been neglected during the years.  Between 1971 and 1978, on average, Government spending in all Departments was increased by 359 per cent, whereas the amount of the increase in the provision for forestry was only one-third of that amount, 137 per cent.  Clearly, as far as Government investment is concerned forestry has been lagging behind.  I am glad to see that in a small way this Estimate redresses that imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Minister has failed to spend 11 per cent of the amount provided for forestry education in the original Estimate.  Why was all the money not spent?  He has failed to spend £50,000, or 21 per cent, of the total amount voted for game management. <Col N="1229" /> Why?  We would all agree both are areas where it should be relatively easy to spend the full provision.  I wonder if some artificial restriction has been imposed in relation to game management and forestry education since the original Estimate was introduced.  That seems to be the only explanation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Estimate. Our forests are a credit to the Department and I should like to see more facilities being provided for public access to our forests.  I know that the provision of roads and so forth would cost the taxpayers a lot of money but I suggest that we should provide deeper access to our forests.</P>
      <P>I should like to know if the Department have any plans such as our EEC colleagues have in regard to fast growing timber.  With possible energy problems, are we doing any development work in this respect so that we could meet possible energy needs in the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Deasy's first point concerning timber processing, consideration of this is essential if we are to utilise the thinnings coming from our forests&mdash;this is an essential process from the point of view of proper harvesting of our timber resources.  A detailed study has been undertaken by the Department, in conjunction with the IDA, and the report is coming to hand.  I have seen it in draft and it will be ready for publication in a matter of weeks.  It will set out the various options open to us in regard to timber processing in the future, not just short-term but long-term.  As Deputy Deasy said, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy O'Malley, told the Dáil of the very expensive capital investment necessary in regard to thermo-mechanical and chemical processing of timber, which would require very expensive equipment and energy input.  We are talking in terms of big money, of around £100 million.  We will have to lift our whole timber processing industry out of, if you like, first stage development into a completely new <Col N="1230" /> state of development which will require substantial sums of money.  We will have to do it if we are properly to utilise the volume of timber we will have coming on stream from 1982 to the end of the century.  That is why the study I have referred to was commissioned.  That report will be available for public discussion and Government decision in a matter of a month or so.</P>
      <P>Our real problem is that in the interim, before we establish such sophisticated processing of our timber products, the plants that we have, mainly in the wallboard and chipboard areas, are having very serious difficulties caused by the importation of such products from Sweden and other third countries into the EEC.  We have taken this matter up with the Community with a view to restricting such imports, which are causing difficulties not just in Ireland but in Germany, Belgium, France and in Britain.</P>
      <P>This has been causing serious problems for firms such as Munster Chipboard in Waterford, and the firms in Scarriff and Athy.  We have tried to help Athy out of it.  The problems are very serious and substantial.  We have on our plate serious problems affecting existing processing establishments.  The Government have put money into Athy to keep the firm going.  The factories in Waterford and Scarriff are at the moment under expert management and it is hoped to rationalise production and marketing.  The Department and the IDA are in the course of negotiation with certain private enterprise firms at home with a view to some sort of input of investment.  There will be action on this front.  It is essential, from the forestry point of view alone, to maintain an outlet for our timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have had discussions with another major firm in that area, the Clondalkin Paper Mills, in recent weeks with a view to ensuring continuity of supplies of timber to them right through next season.  An important firm in Aughrim and Arklow in County Wicklow are also big purchasers of timber from the Department.  We are seeking to devise a more flexible tendering and selling system to these firms so <Col N="1231" /> that we can guarantee them a percentage on quota supplies, so that they can be guaranteed supplies at a specific price, rather than the old-fashioned tendering method that applied in the past but whereby supplies could not be guaranteed on a permanent basis for these firms.  They are having a hard look at this whole area of timber processing and where it is unsatisfactory we must consider how the State can move on the matter with a view to ensuring a certain continuity.  However, there may be problems in that we may not be able to sustain some of these firms, but we must ensure that overall there are sufficient guaranteed outlets for thinning.  A fundamental principle of forestry is to ensure that when timber reaches a mature state it is of a proper quality.  It can only be of a proper quality if the necessary thinning has been effected and the thinnings can only be taken if there are outlets for them.</P>

At present we are recruiting new rangers, of whom we hope to appoint between 60 and 70 before January or February. These additional personnel will be an excellent asset in providing an essential protection service for wildlife and also in enabling the enforcement of the Wildlife Act which covers the whole area to which the Deputy has referred&mdash;game sanctuaries, management, habitats and so on.

      <P>The point made by the Deputy has been <Col N="1234" /> made on a number of occasions previously with regard to special allowances. It is important to emphasise that what is involved is an allowance and not an Old IRA pension and that it is paid solely on the basis of a means test. It terminates with the death of the recipient.  It has been suggested in the past that there should be some payment to widows of those who have been in receipt of those allowances.  Of course this is a matter that is considered prior to the budget decisions.  The Minister for Finance of the day and the Government are always anxious at budget time to try to improve in some way the lot of those who gave such loyal service during the War of Independence and in the setting up of this State.</P>
      <P>Down through the years there has been an improvement at budget time in existing schemes and from time to time some new scheme or the extension of an existing scheme has been introduced. However, the suggestion made by the Deputy will be borne in mind and we shall see whether it will be possible to do anything on those lines.  I am anxious to ensure that whatever benefits are provided for Old IRA men or their dependants will go principally to those in greatest need and that involves a means test system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Main Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs a sum of £1,595,000 was provided by way of benefit for the development of developing countries arising from our membership of the EEC but it appears <Col N="1235" /> from this Supplementary Estimate that £878,000 of that money has not been spent.  Therefore, I should like to know what happened to that money which was voted by the House for this very worthy purpose.  Can the Minister state whether other member countries who made similar commitments in their budgets for this year have failed to honour their commitments to the extent that apparently we have failed to honour ours by virtue of this very large saving of almost £1 million on subhead F in relation to payments to developing countries.  Additional money has been provided in this Supplementary Estimate for bilateral aid and for disaster relief, but this money is being provided only because apparently we have not spent the money that we intended to spend for aid under the aegis of our membership of the EEC.  So we are simply taking from one heading of aid to developing countries and giving it under another, and the total amount extra being provided for international co-operation under the Supplementary Estimate now before the House is £10. A very substantial saving has been made under one important heading of aid under our membership of the EEC and that has enabled the other improvements to be made.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of concern to me and to this House.  If we are saving under aid to developing countries which we should be giving as members of the EEC and if other countries are able to keep their aid under EEC aegis up to scratch and if, in order to meet other emergencies, we have to cut back on what we have already committed ourselves to in the Estimate for EEC aid, that is not going to do our representation in the Community any good.  I would like the Minister to explain how this saving arose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small Supplementary Estimate.  I would like to follow the questions raised by Deputy Bruton.  Am I right in assuming that the increase in the bilateral aid has taken the form of moneys made available to voluntary agencies?  There was some reference to this by Euro representatives <Col N="1236" /> at the Coolock seminar.  Certain increases were announced for the voluntary agencies at that seminar and while those increases were undoubtedly welcomed by the people involved, this raises the question of how unaffected, slow or bureaucratic the EDF is.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the money is being spent and that it is not simply going back into the central coffers.  First of all, is the way in which the money is being spent in the bilateral aid programme largely by grants to the voluntary agencies already in the field?  Secondly, is the reason for the non-spending under the Lomé heading&mdash;and the assumption is that it is the EDF money that has not been taken up, so to speak&mdash;the bureuacratic delays within the administration of the EDF?  If that is the case, has the Minister any proposal for streamlining the whole development co-operation programme run by the Community and will these proposals form part of the Minister's submission for the rehabilitation of Lomé?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn was very much nearer the reality than was Deputy Bruton.  If I can engage Deputy Bruton's attention for a moment I might be able to set his mind at ease.  In the first instance, I assure Deputy Bruton that it is not in any sense a failure on our part to honour our commitments.  It is very much the opposite.  As Deputy Bruton has perhaps understood, our contribution to the European Development Fund for 1978 was assessed on the basis of requests made to us from the European Community at 1,668,000 European units of account.  However, the Commission decided in the course of the year that only half of this amount would be required and this resulted in expenditure of £526,436.  That left a probable unexpended balance of £878,563.  First, I want to make it quite clear that this was not due to any failure on the part of this Government.  Secondly, we had honoured our commitments in indicating to our Community partners that we were prepared to make these funds available but coming towards the end of the year when we saw that this money was not <Col N="1237" /> being called up&mdash;and I share Deputy Quinn's concern about this&mdash;I again this year took the step that I took last year which was the first year that this was ever done.</P>
      <P>I got agreement from the Government and from the Minister for Finance to transfer the moneys which would otherwise have been lost to our development co-operation Vote, to our bilateral programme.  To that extent then these moneys, which would otherwise have been saved, would not have been mentioned in this House.  If one were to take note of Deputy Bruton's criticism, they would simply have gone back into the Exchequer, as happened in the years between 1973 and 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say, in fairness to my predecessor, that he acknowledged publicly recently that I had been able to achieve last year what he had not been able to achieve, and I presume he will also support what we have been able to do this year.  I do not want to make what we have been able to do a criticism of what was not done before, but it is only fair that before Deputy Bruton moves into battle talking in terms of our failure to honour our commitments, he might learn a little beforehand about the realities.  I am not asking him to change his opinion of it but he might change his tone in view of the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bilateral programme that Deputy Quinn touched upon covers a whole range of areas.  Among them is the assistance for voluntary agencies.  I would envisage that, while it has not all been decided yet, I will be making further announcements very soon on the allocations of the moneys now saved through our bilateral programme.  I assure Deputy Quinn and also those who are very much involved in this area, the voluntary organisations, the various non-governmental organisations and our own people in the field in the various countries where we are represented, that this will be used to support the programmes. I cannot give details yet, as I hope <Col N="1238" /> Deputy Quinn will understand, but I recognise the validity of what he suggests. The announcement already made, together with some further developments, will prove that we respect this contribution and see it as being very much an effective agency of our programme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the £250,000 of what was saved can be transferred without a Vote to disaster relief because that is not a grant-in-aid, and that has been done.  The balance is what concerns us now.  Not all of it will be going to the voluntary sector; some of it will be applied directly to our bilateral aid projects in the various countries in which we operate.  I need not go into details as to where they are.  I have been very pleased with the support from my Government colleagues which enabled me to use this very considerable sum of money this year and last year.</P>
      <P>I have to take Deputy Quinn's final very valid point.  It arises because under the Lomé Convention and through the European Development Fund the Commission were not able to call on the money that was made available to them. They were not, in effect, able to develop the project for one reason or another.</P>

To get the projects under way involves, first of all, preparation of the projects in the countries that would benefit, and to that extent it is sometimes found that the administrative machinery is not sufficiently strong in the recipient country to take advantage at that time of the moneys being made available.  The case was made to me very regularly during the course of <Col N="1239" /> my visit to Africa that what they see as being unduly restrictive bureaucratic procedures prevent them from meeting the deadlines and prevent the immediate application of aid.  This is the case that I have brought back to Commissioner Cheysson and to my Community partners.  It is vitally important because this has happened not only this year but also last year.  It is a matter of great concern that where Community moneys are committed by other partners as for us&mdash;and our partners find themselves in exactly the same position as we do&mdash;the moneys have not been taken up, so we are not quite sure what each of them are doing consequent on that.  This is a matter which the Community has to tackle. It is a central issue in the renegotiation of the Lomé Convention and I can assure the House that it is one that I certainly will be pressing very strongly because it is hardly short of a tragedy that moneys which are available for countries in such great need are not in fact being applied.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a second supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31 day of December 1978 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes and grants including a grant-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): We have now reached the fifth of the Supplementary Estimates having discussed them since 3.30. Between now and 6.30 we have to deal with 19 further Supplementary Estimates.  I would like to go on record as protesting against the manner in which the Government have ordered their business which results in something <Col N="1240" /> like 24 Supplementary Estimates having to be dealt with in three hours in the dying days of 1978.  It is not good enough. If the Dáil needs more time it should sit more time.  If longer sitting hours are necessary the Dáil should have longer sitting hours.  I do not propose to go further into it than that but I would not be discharging my duty if I did not publicly say that I think it is a disgraceful way to vote finances for the Departments of State and to deal with the performance of the Departments of State.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I do not want to find myself in trouble with the Chair, but the fact that we are voting an additional sum of £410,000 for salaries, wages and allowances to the Minister does broaden the scope of this Supplementary Estimate fairly extensively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to go into any of the matters in the Minister's Department at great length because I simply have not the time to do it.  But there are a few things I want to speak about.  I want to speak about housing and I want to put it on the record of the House that people who are in search of houses of their own have reached the stage now when they find it just impossible to provide themselves with a house.  I know that since this Government came into office a grant of £1,000 has been provided for a person who has not previously built or bought a house.  I suggest that, having regard to the very substantial increase&mdash;approximately 33? per cent &mdash;in the price of houses and in the price of building houses since this Government came into office, the £1,000 grant has faded into utter insignificance. Something will have to be done to encourage and to make it possible for young married couples to have a house of their own.  The day was when young people were prepared to move into flats, make-do flats, which were not built for that purpose and put up with them for some time.  But a young woman usually found that if she moved into a flat she was left there much longer than she wished and young people are not prepared to embark on matrimony now unless they can provide a proper house for themselves.  It is the duty of the <Col N="1241" /> Government, and particularly this Government who undertook on their going into office to make it easier to own a house and cheaper to keep it, to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that the price of houses has jumped by 33? per cent the Minister and the Government will have to provide more local authority houses instead of less because people who are earning £3,500 simply cannot provide a house of their own.  It is simply not possible for them to finance a loan of £12,000, £13,000, £14,000 or even £9,000, and we must face up to that reality.</P>
    <P>I regret to note that it is the policy of the Government, as appears from their various publications&mdash;white paper, green paper and other pronouncements&mdash;to look very critically at applicants for local authority houses and in that way pressurise people into building their own houses.  People can only build their own houses if they have enough money to do it.  The building societies' loans have dried up.  I know that is a fact and it cannot be disputed.  The conditions under which the building societies will advance money have tightened up and have become much more restrictive. It used to be that if a person had money on deposit for six months they would qualify for consideration by the building society for a loan but that time was extended, as we know, to 12 months and I think it is now at two years.</P>
    <P>Furthermore if a person can qualify for a local authority housing loan now, the interest rate is at an all-time high; it stands at 14.15 per cent.  That is a brutal rate of interest to ask any people of modest means to pay.  What can the Government do about it?  I believe that the Minister has a ready-made instrument by which he could assist people who want to build houses and that is the small dwellings loan fund.  I am quite aware of the fact that the Minister has increased the local authority loan to £9,000 and I will go further and say that he increased it twice since he came into power; it now stands at £9,000.  But there is an income ceiling limit of £3,500 which makes a complete farce of the whole thing.  The loans are there but one <Col N="1242" /> cannot qualify for them.  Anybody earning more than between £60 and £70 a week will not be entertained and that is simply offering a loan but making it impossible to qualify for it.  Therefore, I want to call on the Minister to increase the loans from £9,000 to a more realistic figure and to increase the income limit to a realistic figure because it is not a realistic figure at the moment.  The Minister knows, and I know, and anybody who stops to think, knows that a person earning between £60 and £70 a week simply cannot finance a loan of £9,000, cannot build a house of his own. The Government undertook to control prices and I assume that included the price of houses.  The price of houses has jumped out of all recognition by 33? per cent and it is still rising, though maybe not as drastically as it was.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): We are aware that prices have jumped by 33? per cent since the Minister took office and that is too high. Last night the Minister announced that he intended permitting local authorities to increase their rates by 10 per cent. That system of a blanket allowance across the board of any per cent is unrealistic and does not cater for the individual requirements of many local authorities.  That is borne out by the Minister's statement when we were last discussing a Bill dealing with local government.  He went to great lengths then to tell the House that 16 local authorities did not spend all the money they got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It is not my intention to labour any point but this system of percentage increases is unacceptable.  In telling us recently that 16 local authorities had not spent all the money given to them last year the Minister did not tell us the number of authorities who did not have enough money with the result that they had to cut back on their services and expenditure.  They did so because they were starved of finance by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that a sum has been provided for the register of electors which is to reimburse local authorities for the amount they will spend in updating the <Col N="1244" /> register of electors.  This year that will involve in some cases the splitting up of the register because the Minister proposes to revise some local electoral areas like Dublin county and city and others submitted to him for revision.  I appeal to the Minister to follow the good example of the Government in drawing up the Euro constituencies and the good example given by the Taoiseach when he announced that he intended to submit the redrafting of the Dáil constituencies to an independent commission.  The Minister's party had a fair innings in drawing up the constituencies since the foundation of the State and it is no great compliment to them to hand the task over to the commission.  I understood from a reply given by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment that the changes in local electoral areas may not be made by an independent commission.  If that is so it is a strange departure from the principle stated by the Minister.  The commission could be a simple one because it could be left to a county manager and another person appointed with him.  It is not necessary to have an elaborate or national commission.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that any changes made are made by a commission and not on a political basis.</P>
    <P>I assume that a fair amount of the additional £410,000 we are asked to vote for salaries, wages and allowances is in respect of the Minister's new Department, the Department of the Environment. The Minister is an overall watchdog for the environment.  I accept that other Ministers are involved but if the Minister's Department is to mean anything it must mean that he has overall responsibility for the environment. I should like to make a plea to the Minister to influence his colleagues in Government to save the national monument at Wood Quay.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I will not be allowed to continue and I bow to your ruling, Sir, much as I respectfully disagree with it.</P>
      <P>There is an item here relating to grants in respect of road works.  I would ask the Minister to increase these grants substantially and to make sure that money is made available for county roads.  These are the secondary roads throughout the country which are in a very run-down condition.  They are being neglected and the answer given to local representatives is that the local authorities have not the money to attend to these roads.  If further deterioration is allowed they will be beyond repair and the ultimate cost will be infinitely greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> There appears to be a saving of £1,850,500 on environmental works and dangerous places.  Such a saving is extraordinary in a year when so much money is required for these works.  The Minister could give much needed employment if he were to spend that money instead of saving it.  The fact that he requires only £10 by way of Supplementary Estimate seems to indicate that there must be a considerable saving.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to hold up the proceedings of the House because there are 19 more Supplementary Estimates to be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the principle of this Supplementary Estimate being moved because the Minister is effectively applying one law for himself and a separate law for every local authority. He is saying that his Estimate was incorrect partly because of his own fault and partly not.  At the beginning of the year he estimated the financial requirements of his Department and an excess amount in the region of £4 million is now being sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are confined to talking about the various areas in which the Minister or his Department incurred unforeseen expenses or increases over which they have no control.  Normally the House would accept that this is a reasonable position. There are things that cannot be foreseen and there should be the right to come back to the House to seek more money. However, the same Minister who is asking the House to adopt that principle intends to refuse it to every local authority.  As far as we can ascertain&mdash;and this is a rather difficult task in itself&mdash;the Minister is refusing this privilege to local authorities.  I would ask him to be consistent in that regard.  If it is reasonable for the Minister to underestimate either by genuine human mistake or because of totally unforeseen circumstances and if he has the right to get extra money, why cannot every local authority have the same right?  There is a fundamental principle here.  It is touched on in section 10 of the Local Government Bill which is putting into law <Col N="1248" /> something which is already a fact.  I formally object to the fact that the Minister for the Environment is seeking extra moneys.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what he is actually looking for.  An additional sum of £75,000 is required for travelling and subsistence expenses.  Could the Minister give some indication of what was so unforeseen in terms of travel at the beginning of the year?  On subhead F1&mdash;water supply and sewerage&mdash;to what extent do the additional moneys relate to interest charges?  Of the £250,000, how much was used for interest charges?  Alternatively, have extra water schemes been sanctioned?  I am not sure of the interpretation.</P>
    <P>On subhead H&mdash;Recoupment of Expenditure in Respect of Register of Electors&mdash;it is difficult to understand why there is an extra amount of £75,000. Has there been an increase in activity in this area?  Has the Minister given instructions to increase the number of registrations or is this normal practice? It would be understandable if a decision were taken later in the year to do a very comprehensive registration of electors.  I should like to know the reason for the shortfall of £75,000.</P>
    <P>There is an additional grant of £117,500 to meet the administration and general expenses of An Foras Forbartha. Is this amount needed because of increases in the cost of living and general running costs?  The increase is a little over 10 per cent.  Perhaps the Minister would give a breakdown of the general expenses.</P>
    <P>Presumably most of the money under subhead L is needed for the administration of the breathalyser.  Since the Minister assured the House that he had been working on the legislation for some time, what was the original provision for this in the Estimate?  How was it calculated?  Was any provision made before the Act became law during the summer?  If provision was not made, the Minister should tell us the reason.</P>
    <P>On a notional sum for private housing grants I would like to raise the question of the very narrow interpretation by the Minister and his Department in terms of the subsidisation under the low <Col N="1249" /> rise mortgage scheme for single parent families who have only one child.  The Minister has come back for an additional £4 million and a notional sum of £10.  I am saddened that he has not extended the definition of that scheme to include single parent families with only one child.  This is a very miserable and mean attitude, especially as the sum involved would be very small.  As the Minister appears to have been able to acquiesce to demands for extra money for certain other agencies and groups within his responsibility, to blanket out that scheme is totally at variance with the declared housing objectives of the Fianna Fáil administration in terms of encouraging people to own their own houses.  In many cases the Minister is effectively keeping people in local authority houses by refusing them this loan facility.  The numbers of people we are talking about now are infinitesimal.</P>
    <P>Under subhead A2&mdash;Consultancy Services&mdash;what was involved here?  A sum of £4,000 was provided for this service. I have given references to all the questions I raised.  Would the Minister tell the House why he thinks he should be treated differently from the local authorities in terms of bringing in Supplementary Estimates?  Does he have other problems in estimating costs which enable him to get it wrong first time but right the second?  What makes him different from every local authority who, under his new law, will have to get it right the first time or pay the cost?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>To facilitate other Deputies and Ministers I promise to be brief.  I have one specific point I want to put to the Minister in connection with private housing grants.  There is a grave shortage of available finance through our building societies.  I have two suggestions to make which might solve this problem.  Many building societies come in for a great deal of criticism. Nevertheless they fulfil one of the most important functions in the private housing sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons why there is a shortage of finance from the building societies is that they cannot compete with other lending institutes.  Building societies give a fixed interest rate, in <Col N="1250" /> other words, they pay 9 per cent at present. Other lending institutions, such as the banks and the ACC, can increase their interest rates in proportion to the amounts invested.  It would be in everybody's interest if the Minister allowed the building societies to increase their interest rates on, say, limits of £5,000, £25,000 and so on.  This would attract a very sizeable amount of extra money which would be to everyone's benefit.</P>
    <P>It would be in the interests of house building if arrangements could be made to allow greater tax free allowances.  This may be the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  I understand the Government are not prepared to subsidise housing at present.  I am making these suggestions not to be political but simply in the interests of the people throughout the country who are unable to obtain loans from building societies.  As I said, greater tax free allowances should be granted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is the season of goodwill and I am putting these suggestions in that spirit.  If the Minister and his colleagues consider my suggestion that could lead to extra money for building societies.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Fitzpatrick I believe the Minister, not the Office of Public Works, should have responsibility for Wood Quay.</P>

      <P>I was amazed to hear Deputy Fitzpatrick criticising us for the amount of time allocated for these Estimates. First, it was agreed between the Whips. When the Coalition were in power we were expected on two occasions to pass all the Estimates <i>en bloc</i> without any discussion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn asked why I would not afford the local authorities the discretion I afforded myself.  All that is happening here is a reallocation of money under different subheads within my Department. Local authorities have the same discretion to reallocate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick dwelt for a long time on housing.  We debated housing on several occasions recently.  I do not intend to go into detail except to point out that 24,217 houses were built <Col N="1252" /> in the first 11 months of this year.  It will now lead to a total figure of 26,000 houses in the current year.  This does not look as if the bottom is falling out of the building industry where housing is concerned as Deputy Fitzpatrick tried to imply.  Indeed, never at any time during the period of the Coalition Government did any member of that Government say that more than 25,000 houses were necessary.  This year we will have around 26,000 houses.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about a 33 per cent increase in the price of houses.  The facts are that in the first quarter of this year, January to March, there was an increase of 11.7 per cent.  In the second quarter, April to the end of June, this was 8.4 per cent and in the next quarter ending 30 September the increase was down to 3.4 per cent.  The 3.4 per cent could not take into consideration the effects of the steps we took with regard to the building societies and the allocation of their loans in September.  We will have to wait until the end of this quarter to find out what effect that had.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick acknowledged that there were certain improvements in the SDA loans.  There were very definite improvements as we doubled the amount from £4,500 to £9,000 since we came into office and the upper limit for salaries went from £2,250 to £3,500. This is kept under review all the time so we have not been too slow in dealing with the matter when we consider the four years when nothing was done about the upper limits.</P>

      <P>The Deputies can discuss this with the approriate Minister. Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke about the savings of local authorities with regard to subhead G. Local authorities are recouped their expenditure on schemes in arrears.  It therefore follows that payments made by the Department in 1978 fall short of the amounts expended by local authorities in 1978.  This accounts for part of the total savings.  Payment of the arrears to local authorities will arise in 1979.  The other factor contributing to the savings has been the industrial action by some engineering staff at local authority level and this has slowed down considerably the progress of the environmental works and it is not through any fault of mine or my Department that this has happened.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn asked a few questions about the different subheads.  With regard to subhead A&mdash;Consultancy Services&mdash;only a token provision of £1,000 was made for these services in 1978.  The additional £4,000 arises from a carry-over of consultancy fees which it was expected would have been paid late in 1977 but which did not mature for payment until the current year.  He asked a question on subhead B, Travelling Expenses. The extra amount arises because of two increases in the motor mileage rates, one with effect from 1 January 1977 and another with effect from 1 January 1978, together with an increase in subsistance allowances.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn also referred to the subhead dealing with An Foras Forbartha. In order to meet the cost of implementing the first phase of the 1978 National Wage Agreement a sum of £70,000 was allocated, £25,000 to meet the cost of five additional posts in the water resources division and £22,500 to eliminate a deficit of carry forward from the Road Fund account.  The cost of operating the roads division of An Foras Forbartha was hitherto met by the Road Fund but with the termination of this fund from 1 January 1978 this cost now falls to be met from the grant-in-aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The extra £250,000 in <Col N="1254" /> the Supplementary Estimate increases the 1978 provision from £8.403 million to £8.653 million.  This subhead provides for the payment of contribution towards local authority loan charges and public water and sewerage schemes, swimming pools, public sanitary conveniences and urban flood relief schemes.  The rates of subsidy range from 40 per cent to 60 per cent and the additional estimated requirements under the subhead are due to the amount of local authority claims for contributions to loan charges being greater than originally estimated.  There may be a few other points raised but time does not permit me to go into greater detail on them.  There are full explanations for all the subheads.  I hope the Deputies will accept that, as there are other Estimates to be dealt with.  With regard to the questions raised about the 10 per cent upper limit on the rates we will have three hours this evening.  We are at that section in the Bill so I expect there will be ample opportunity to raise it and for me to reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10,000,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31 day of December, 1978, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants.</P>
      <P>We could discuss the three Supplementary Estimates together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I would like to make on Vote No. 50. They relate primarily to the savings which have taken place.  Deputies will note there have been savings under subheads A.2, B.2, F, H and K.  Under subhead K there has been a saving of £479,000 on free electricity allowances. The money provided for this has not <Col N="1255" /> been spent.  I presume that that arises from a shortfall in the anticipated number of applicants for free electricity but it indicates that there is money to spare to improve the provisions of the free electricity scheme.  As the Minister is no doubt aware, there are a number of people who should qualify but are not qualifying because they are not deemed to be living entirely alone.  Those people may have some person staying with them for a few hours in the evening or at night but there is nobody there for most of the day.  Those people do not qualify because they are not entirely alone.  In view of the fact that the Minister has saved almost £500,000 on the money provided for free electricity this year it looks as if he has some room to extend the category of people who may qualify for free electricity.</P>
      <P>The same may be said in regard to the television licences.  The provision for aid for television licences was underspent to the extent of £335,000.  The same restrictive criteria apply in respect of this. There is a saving in regard to television rental of £125,000.  I realise that any change in the regulations is a budgetary matter but in view of the fact that there has been savings in the amounts it was anticipated would have to be spent in 1978 there is room for doing something about extending the category of qualification for the free electricity and TV licences in the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>I wish to turn to a more serious matter, namely, the saving of £280,000 in respect of social welfare allowances. Members of this House are aware that this allowance represents the income of the poorest of the poor.  They are the people who have the least resources and the least ability to fend for themselves. They are not able to get employment or disability benefit because they have not stamps or for some other reason.  They have to rely on the lowest income of anyone in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that almost 10 per cent of the money which is represented by this sum of £280,000 remains unspent is an indictment of everyone concerned with the Department of Social Welfare and the health boards from the Minister down.  It <Col N="1256" /> should be the priority of the Minister to make sure if he gets money for social welfare allowances for helping very poor people that every penny is spent to alleviate the hardship of such people.  The fact that he has come to this House with a saving of £280,000 on an item such as this is a very serious matter to which the Minister should give attention.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the responsibility is entirely that of the Minister.  Possibly there are many people involved in various agencies in the public service and in the health boards who must make decisions in relation to allocating money. However, in the coming year the Minister should make sure that any money he gets for supplementary welfare allowances is spent and that he does nor come back to this House with a saving in this area.</P>
    <P>I note also that there is a saving of £40,000 in relation to school meals.  All of us know that these school meals are not meals at all.  Really it only involves a glass of milk and an apple.  This is what most of the children in the urban areas who qualify for school meals actually receive.  The fact that the provision for school meals is so meagre surely indicates that the Minister should not come to this House with a saving of £40,000.  He should have used the money to improve the quality of the meals being provided for children in the urban areas where the scheme operates. As I illustrated on a previous occasion, there are hard statistics to indicate that many children go to school who have no nourishment whatever during the early part of the day.  Many of them do not have a breakfast and the first nourishment of any kind that they will get will be in the form of the school meal if it is operating in their school.  The Minister should not skimp, as apparently he has done, and achieve a saving of £40,000 in this area.  He should have made sure that the money was spent.  He should also make sure that any extra money he may get is used and that we make use of the aid available from the EEC for the provision of milk.  They are prepared to provide £ for £ for any money we spend on the provision of milk in schools.  The Minister should ensure that he provides <Col N="1257" /> money to match the EEC funds and that a milk scheme is extended to all schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister has succeeded in saving £500,000 in children's allowances&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>He will have a saving of £8 million next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume we will be told that the estimate of the numbers applying was not correct.  We may be told the Minister did not know how many children there were in the country when making the original provision in 1978, that he found out there were fewer children than he thought and that, consequently, he did not have to spend this £500,000.  Given the demographic information available, that explanation would surprise me somewhat but perhaps the Minister has a better one.  In any event he has saved £500,000 in children's allowances and he should make sure there will be a generous increase in these allowances in 1979.  This is particularly important in view of the fact that in the 1978 Budget there was no increase in the tax allowances for children although there were increases for married couples without children.  It is ironic that the Minister has been able to save £500,000 as well as the saving made by the Minister for Finance by not increasing the allowances for children under the tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the fact that there is an increase under other heads amounting to a total of £10 million.  Many people think that during the years the Department of Social Welfare have been getting more than their share, that money has been spent on social welfare in excess of that spent in other areas.  I should like to tell the House that is not the case.  The provision for social welfare from 1971 to the present&mdash;and a number of Governments have been responsible for this&mdash;has no more than kept pace with the amount spent by other Departments. On average the amount is about the same and, therefore, there is no question of money being spent lavishly on social welfare in the past ten years.  There have been increases in the provision for the Department of Health.  In fact, the increased provision for that Department <Col N="1258" /> has been almost twice as great during the past decade as the provision for social welfare.  I question if that is the right priority, given that male life expectancy is falling at the moment.  It seems unusual that we should be increasing very considerably our provision for health.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that in the time at my disposal I shall not have time to deal with the points raised by Deputy Bruton.  Of course, most of the savings to which he has referred are quite imaginary.  They are not the result of any economising on our part; it is that for one technical reason or another the amounts estimated were not needed subsequently.  I shall give the House an example, namely, the supplementary welfare allowances. There was no question here of any attempt by the Department to cut back on the amount provided.  This was an entirely new scheme.  The amount provided in 1978 was based on estimates submitted by the health boards as to what might be required.  That is all we could go on. Having no experience of the administration of the scheme, we asked the health boards for their estimate of what would be required and our Estimate was framed on that basis.  It was very much a <i>de novo</i> Estimate.  As it transpired during the year, the level of payment was less than what was estimated by the health boards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about this Bill.  It is not customary for the Dáil to spend a great deal of time discussing the Appropriation Bill.  Usually, however, there is a lengthy discussion on the Bill in the Seanad which provides that House with an opportunity to discuss the broad range of Government policy, an opportunity which it does not otherwise have.  There are a few points which should be made on this Appropriation Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the way statutory authority is provided for the spending of money by the Government.  This evening we have voted through Estimates but they are only Estimates.  They do not confer any statutory authority on the Government actually to spend the money.  This Bill confers statutory authority on the Government to spend money, 90 per cent of which they have already spent. In this Bill the House is being asked to give restrospective statutory authority to the spending of money by the Government. The amount involved is over <Col N="1265" /> £2,000 million.  Some of the constituents of that £2,000 million were discussed in the form of Estimates but, as I have said, those Estimates did not confer statutory authority for the spending of the money. They were merely resolutions of this House which approved of the policies and figures involved and so on.</P>
    <P>In fact, a substantial portion of that money, approximately £400 million, was passed on 27 June 1978 without debate. At that stage, half of the money had been spent already.  Approximately £400 million was approved in the form of Estimates without any debate.  This Bill will give statutory approval to that.  I am speaking from memory but I think approximately another £600 million was approved in the form of Estimates on 27 June in a very restricted debate.  I am sorry.  The figure was about £1,800 million. The vast bulk of the Estimates to which this Bill gives statutory authority were either discussed in very restricted debates or were not discussed at all.</P>
    <P>We have put down a motion which will be discussed in due course in Private Members' Time to the effect that procedures which allow money to be spent on behalf of the people of Ireland in this cursory fashion ought to be changed.  It is not satisfactory to have this type of procedure whereby millions and millions of pounds are passed on the nod in this House because there is no time to discuss policy.</P>
    <P>This Appropriation Bill, involving a sum of over £2,000 million, is being used under the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965, for the spending of up to four-fifths of that sum by the Government in 1979 under the various Estimates before they are discussed.  By approving a figure of over £2,000 million in 1978, in effect, by virtue of the provisions of the 1965 Act, we are allowing the Government to spend four-fifths of that sum in 1979 without obtaining any approval from the House for the Votes concerned.  Obviously, that is a very unsatisfactory position.</P>
    <P>It should also be mentioned that the Estimates for 1979 have not yet been published and will not be published until the year 1979 has already commenced. We will not even know the Government's <Col N="1266" /> spending plans for 1979 until some of the money has already been spent in the first weeks of 1979.  This Bill, when read in conjunction with the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, allows the Government to spend up to four-fifths of the £2,000 million here without having the Estimates discussed. That is a highly unsatisfactory position so far as financial accountability is concerned. Lest anybody should think this is inevitable, it does not occur in Europe. We are talking about money that is already spent for 1978.  In Europe the equivalent of this Bill would have been published in September 1977 and there would have been three months to debate the provisions of that Bill which would be called a budget Bill because it would contain both expenditure and taxation measures, before the year in which spending commenced.  There would be provision for it to be discussed in Committees of the House before money was spent and no money could be spent under the provisions of this Bill in these countries until the House had approved the entirety of the package.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why we should not have the same sort of procedures in relation to financial accountability.  There is no reason why we should not have the same control.  That would be to the benefit of the Government of the day and the Opposition of the day because both would have greater control over the way money was being spent.  Government backbench Deputies would have a far greater opportunity to influence the Minister in relation to the way money was to be spent.  At the moment the Estimates debate here is virtually meaningless because most of the Estimates were not discussed until 27 June, halfway through the year in question. Anything that anybody could say in a debate on that date could have no influence on the Minister because the Minister was already committed and half the money was already spent.</P>
    <P>If a Deputy indicated that the Minister should spend more money under one heading than under another there was nothing the Minister could do about it on that date because 50 per cent of the money was already spent.  There is <Col N="1267" /> no real opportunity to influence the Minister in any way by any debate which takes place on an Estimate.  For this reason we must look at the financial procedures of the House which are brought into full relief by this Bill which is asking us to approve the spending of over £2,000 million, 90 per cent of which has already been spent without this Bill having been approved.</P>
    <P>I have amendments for discussion on Committee Stage which I presume will take place immediately, and they are directed at some of the problems I referred to.  I will comment briefly on some of the figures contained in the Bill.  There are certain areas of public expenditure where over the years there seems to have grown up what I would describe as a wrong emphasis in terms of expenditure. I will use the Departments of Health and Social Welfare, and Justice as examples. The provision for social welfare from 1971 to 1978 has increased by only 329 per cent which is less than the average provision for the entire Government over that period, which was 359 per cent.  We have been giving less than we should to social welfare which provides for the poorest section.  In contrast, although male life expectancy which is an index of the sucess of the health programmes, has fallen during that decade, health expenditure has increased by 711 per cent, more than twice as much as the increase in expenditure on social welfare.  We are not getting the results from the health expenditure because evidently male life expectancy has fallen over that period, a period in which we increased health expenditure by more than double the average amount of spending in the Government as a whole.  In the area of Justice there is a remarkable contrast in relation to increases in expenditure during the last decade since 1971.  The provision for prisons has increased since 1971 by 1,158 per cent.  We are spending three times the average in keeping people in prison, but in detecting crime the increased provision has only been 354 per cent.  This compares very favourably with the amount being spent on prisons and it suggests that if we used non-custodial means in the treatment of certain <Col N="1268" /> offenders and reduced the prison vote, we would have sufficient money available to spend on extra gardai in relation to the detection of crime and on the improvement of court procedures to provide for settlement of family disputes and so on.  These are some areas where there has been a wrong emphasis.</P>
    <P>While this Bill does not allow a debate on the general merits of Government spending other than in theory, and anything I say on this Bill is entirely relevant, I could spend the next four hours talking about this, because one can speak about anything on the Appropriation Bill, I feel there is need for a means whereby this House can analyse Government expenditure properly.  I have suggested these improvements in the financial procedures in the House and in the House's control over Government spending to remove that sort of anomaly, or at least have it identified here.  I hope that although the Minister cannot respond positively at this stage, when the Private Members' Motion on the subject comes to be discussed next year, he will be in a position to respond positively on behalf of his party to the suggested improvements that we will seek to make.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Bruton's comments in relation to this Bill and in relation to the reforms suggested, particularly the need for estimates committees of the House which I have always favoured.  I am quite sure that a large number of Fianna Fáil backbenchers would dearly wish to be involved in such committees so as to have some participation in Government, even at that level.  For that reason I also strongly support this Bill.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that we agreed to take all stages of this Bill around 6.30 p.m. and since we have agreed to follow through before 7 p.m. with the grocery regulations, that time precludes us from commenting at any length on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>From everybody's point of view we have had a most unsatisfactory evening.  Ministers had different accounts and different Supplementary Estimates to put before the House and <Col N="1269" /> everybody has been rushed.  Deputies from this side have been trying to make comments.  The affairs of the country should be looked after in a businesslike and orderly way.  By saying that I mean no disrespect to the Chair; every Deputy must take a certain amount of responsibility for this situation.  The main burden of responsibility for this matter rests with the Taoiseach, who is the Leader of the House, and the Minister for Finance.  We should approach our work in the same manner in which a top company would approach its work. Towards the end of the year a top company prepares detailed accounts and estimates for the following year.  I cannot see why we, who are spending more than £2,000 million, cannot arrange matters in a similar fashion.  Ministers should prepare their Estimates well in advance of presenting them to the House.</P>
      <P>The present situation allows Ministers to evade responsibility.  It allows Ministers to avoid coming into the House when difficult and contentious matters are being debated.  A Minister who wishes to avoid coming into the House can have his Estimate shoved under the Appropriation Accounts or it can be left on the Order Paper.  Many important matters have not been discussed in the House this year.  For instance, we should have been given an opportunity to debate the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that he should make an honest effort to rectify the situation.  I believe that every Minister should come into the House and give the Opposition an opportunity to either praise or criticise the relevant Department.</P>

      <P>The contributions, particularly Deputy Bruton's contribution, were very interesting for two reasons.  First, Deputy Bruton's basic thesis was wrong.  Second, there seems to be a new-found crusading spirit on the opposite benches in regard to changes that are thought to be necessary in the handling of financial business.  That spirit was not obvious when the Deputies opposite were on this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be taken as saying that there is no room for improvement. However, I do want to be taken as saying that the Deputies opposite would have been more impressive in their arguments if they had done something about the matter when they were in a position to do so.  The fact that they did not is sufficient evidence that there are a number of difficulties in improving the situation and that some of the suggestions made would only make the situation worse.</P>
      <P>I want to explain why I said that Deputy Bruton's basic thesis was wrong. He seemed to base most of his case on the theory that the Appropriation Bill is giving statutory authority for the spending of the moneys referred to in it. That is not correct.  The statutory authority for the spending of these moneys is provided under the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965. Deputy Bruton explained, correctly, that it provides statutory authority for four-fifths of the amount of the previous year's money, but it also provides statutory authority in respect of the balance of the money as soon as the Dáil grants supply or votes the money.  The Appropriations Bill is simply appropriating, as indicated in the Schedule, the various sums of money to the various accounts.  To say that we are being asked to give statutory authority to the expenditure of approximately £2 billion is not correct.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that there is not room for improvement.  Some of the ideas expressed by Deputy Bruton in this regard are not feasible but I commend him for his efforts to try to improve the position and to get us to think about it.  He is overlooking something important in the comparison he made between the growth in expenditure on social welfare and health, that is, in 1971 about half of the health expenditure was met from local rates, which is not now the case.  A comparison between the two is not legitimate unless allowance is made for that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of how the situation can <Col N="1271" /> best be improved is not one that we should go into at this stage.  In regard to the suggestion that we should have special estimates committees, some members are responsible for deluding themselves and the public in regard to the usefulness of the committee system. We know how the committee system works on the Continent.  The basic difference between the way it works there and here is that most of the work is done in committee and plenary sessions deal with the results of committees.  What we are trying to do is to carry on the plenary work of the Assembly while carrying on the committees.  My experience is that our system does not work.  A few Deputies constitute the bulk of the membership of most committees set up by this House.  The demands on their time are such that it is not possible to work an effective committee system as long as we expect the House to carry on its business at the same time.  Until we face that fact we are never going to have an effective committee system.  That is the view of the Government on the matter and I believe it is true.  Unless we are prepared to make the kind of change that is implied, we are wasting our time talking about committee systems.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that there is no room for improvement or that the Government have closed their minds to the possibility of improvement, but we cannot discuss it on this Bill.  As Deputy Bruton said, there is a Private Members' motion coming up which may provide an opportunity for a detailed debate on those aspects of the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister if he would consider it a good idea to amend the provisions of the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965 and substitute some lesser figure than four-fifths.  I think the Minister will agree that it is undesirable that up to four-fifths of the money provided for the Government in the year could be spent, even in theory, before the Estimates containing it have been discussed and approved in this House.  I realise that in the early part of the year the Government have a good deal of business, including the budget, to get through and if they also have the Estimates to be dealt with in the first three months I agree there would be problems.  That fact, however, might mean that we would have to find a way to solve the problems and that might lead to an improvement of the position of the House rather than a disimprovement. I suggest a figure of one-third rather than the four-fifths which currently exists.  It would not tie up the Government completely but it would provide better control than we have at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy realises that the proportion one fixes determines the latest date by which all Estimates must be passed.  If one takes one-third as the appropriate fraction, one is saying in effect&mdash;it works out this way&mdash;that approximately one-third of the way through the year is the date by which all Estimates must be passed.  As the Deputy said quite correctly, the earlier part of the year is very much taken up with budget and Finance Bill debates and if at the same time or very close to it one were trying to get all the Estimates passed, the practical result could well be that the estimates would be passed without discussion at all so that the position might well be worse than it is at present.  The Deputy is probably aware that the change made in the 1965 Act was designed to give more time for Estimates and it did, to some extent, provide it, because by fixing a fraction of four-fifths it gave a longer time during which Estimates might be taken.  Once you fix a date by which in effect all Estimates must be passed, the earlier that is the more likelihood there is that <Col N="1273" /> Estimates will be passed without discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point but I think the problem could be solved if the Estimates were published before the year to which they applied had commenced.  There is provision in the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965 for that to be done.  I draw the Minister's attention to section 4 (b) of that Act which says that where in the financial year ... or any subsequent financial year supply is granted by Dáil Éireann for a supply service for the year ... or (b) for a supply service for the next following financial year ... So it is possible under existing law for us to consider Estimates for 1979 during 1978.  If the Government could succeed in publishing their Estimates for 1979, say, three months ago, we could perhaps have had most of them discussed before 1979 began.  That would require no change in the statutory provisions.  The only problem would be that of the Government in getting its Estimates published in time.</P>
      <P>In any case, if the Government make a mistake in their Estimates and if through having to get them out three months in advance they find they have made insufficient provision for one heading and too much for another, we know from what has happened earlier today that it is quite possible for them to mend their hand by bringing in supplementary estimates later in the year to make the necessary changes.  There is no real reason why the Government should not have published their estimates for 1979 three months ago.  Any difficulty which might arise through publishing them too early could be overcome later by supplementary estimates introduced during 1979.  It has not been the custom to do this under this or any previous Government but statutorily it is perfectly feasible.  I ask the Minister in respect of 1980 to consider publishing the Estimates, say, two months before the end of 1979 and have some of them discussed before the end of the year so that problems would not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If you fix a date for the publication of Estimates this year in <Col N="1274" /> respect of next year and say you fix it two or three months before the end of this year, those Estimates in practice would have had to be prepared five or six months earlier than the end of the year.  The farther back you go the more unrealistic the Estimates become.  It is true, as the Deputy says, that no matter how accurately they are prepared there will be changes up or down and there will be supplementary estimates. Nevertheless, I think that there is a danger about which the Deputy should think that if you make the procedure too unrealistic so that you are preparing estimates in June or July to cover the whole of the following year, it will become a very artificial exercise and the Estimates will mean little or nothing when so prepared.  I do not regard that as a desirable outcome or one that the Deputy would wish to see occurring.</P>

      <P>I could go a long way with the Minister in what he has said if it was not possible for the continental legislatures, France, the Netherlands and other countries to do precisely what the Minister says is not possible here, that is prepare estimates so far in advance. The continentals have been able to get over the problem which the Minister has put forward and I am sure we can get over it also.  I urge the Minister to ask his officials to look at how the continentals get over the problem he has mentioned and see if they can teach us something. When the motion I have referred to comes to be discussed perhaps the Minister will have some information about how they have been able to do it and if necessary he can either amend our motion or substitute another which would provide a better type of control which would be in both his terms and ours realistic and improve the present position.  If they are able to do it on the continent there is no reason why we could not do it.</P>

I think that there is an inclination on the Government's side to give this matter some consideration and I think if that is indicated to the House the Minister will have the backing of everybody on the matter.</P>
      <P>As regards the practice in different legislatures, some excellent examples were given, but if we look around at home we see some businesses are able to prepare estimates for the coming year.

      <P>With the best will in the world, there is a limited number of reporting staff from the national media available to attend all of these committee meetings.  When we talk about open democracy there is no point in subdividing ourselves between so many situations because it is a physical impossibility to have them covered by the media, to have them covered by our House staff, to have our civil servants getting around to different Departments. <Col N="1277" /> In my opinion that would be going from a bad situation to an even worse one.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In June of this year I addressed the House at the same stage of the Restrictive Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1978, which confirmed the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) (Amendment) Order, 1978.  In the course of the House's discussion on that Bill reference was made to an ongoing boycott of the products of a company by a group representing wholesaling and retailing interests. I acknowledged then that the boycott was a matter of concern to me and indicated that I was having the matter urgently examined to identify any remedial action that might be taken.</P>
      <P>The Examiner of Restrictive Practices, whose function it is to monitor the operation of orders made under the Act, was subsequently requested to intervene in the dispute in an attempt to bring together both parties and seek a termination on mutually acceptable terms. Under the chairmanship of the examiner an agreement was concluded to suspend boycott action for a three-month period to the end of November on the understanding that suppliers would withhold supplies from retailers who sold under cost.  It was clear, however, that the dispute ran deeper than the under-cost selling issue which was the immediate occasion of the boycott and, also, that the provision in the agreement concluded under the examiner's chairmanship relating to withdrawal of supplies had implications for existing restrictive practices legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, perhaps, opportune at this point to refer to the legislative background in so far as it affects the present difficulties. The first Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order made in 1956 provided, <i>inter alia</i>, that suppliers could withhold supplies of goods from a retailer if the later resold at or below wholesale price and refused to give an undertaking that he would desist from <Col N="1281" /> doing so.  The amending order made in 1973, however, repealed this provision in so far as it applied to grocery foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>One of the main considerations behind this amendment was the connection which was then seen to exist between advertising of below-cost sales and the practice of below-cost selling itself.  Without widespread advertising, much of the impact of below-cost sales tended to be lost.  The advertising of such sales had, moreover, undesirable features notably that it served to give to the buying public a misleading impression of the entire range of prices being charged in the outlet or outlets concerned. The bulk of prices must, of course, reflect a margin covering retailing costs and yielding a profit and advertising of this nature creates an unfavourable impression of the prices in independent or small retail outlets, resulting in serious losses in sales, thereby accentuating the tendency to domination of the trade by multiple organisations. In sum, therefore, it was considered that the prohibition of a practice which was seen to have a number of undesirable features, would also have the effect of eliminating the actual practice of selling below purchase price.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the events of last summer the agreement concluded under the chairmanship of the Examiner of Restrictive Practices had implications for existing legislation.  In view of this, and also of the temporary nature of the agreement, the Restrictive Practices Commission were requested by me to engage in discussion with all parties involved in the supply and distribution of grocery goods with a view to finding, if possible, a more enduring solution.  In short, the Examiner having negotiated a truce, I was anxious that the Commission should then try to find the basis for a permanent peace.</P>
    <P>A situation in which manufacturers were, on the one hand, threatened by a boycott from one group of customers and, on the other, were having to give to another group the sort of terms that enabled them to indulge in below-cost selling, would, if it were to persist, most assuredly not be in the economic interests of the country.  In the short-term perhaps it might serve to make certain <Col N="1282" /> products available at lower prices for some consumers, but this would be on a very limited scale.  In the long term it would almost certainly lead to the loss of jobs in manufacturing industry and the substitution of imported goods for the products of the firms which would have had to close.  And concurrent with such adverse developments, that minority of consumers who had earlier benefited from below-cost selling would be likely to find themselves paying higher prices for their groceries.</P>
    <P>The commission held a series of meetings with representatives of the suppliers, wholesalers, multiple and independent retail outlets.  It soon became apparent in the discussions that some months would be required to attempt to resolve the issues.  These issues centred around the terms of supply and they are the subject of ongoing discussion between the parties immediately involved in the sector.</P>
    <P>In view of the need for time to facilitate conclusion of these negotiations, the commission concentrated their efforts on getting an extension beyond end of November of the moratorium on boycott activity.  This they were successful in doing and the moratorium has now been extended to the end of March 1979. The agreement was concluded on the basis that certain action of a legislative nature would be undertaken.  In their report to me, the commission recommended that the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Orders should be amended to reapply, in relation to all grocery goods the provision in the 1956 order enabling suppliers to withhold supplies from persons who engage in below cost selling.  The commission also recommended that the prohibition on the advertising for sale of goods below cost should be restated so to apply this prohibition to the advertising of all grocery goods.</P>
    <P>I have accepted the commission's recommendations and an order giving them effect has been made and published.  As regards the various regulations relating to the supply and distribution of grocery goods, it is my intention that these will be actively and comprehensively enforced.  Future developments <Col N="1283" /> in the trade will also be closely monitored to ensure compliance with regulations.  A further matter arising at this time which causes concern is the practice of multiple outlet traders advertising goods for sale at specially low prices when such low prices are not available at all outlets.  This practice would appear to be in breach of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, and, accordingly, I propose to bring it to the notice of the Director of Consumer Affairs as soon as an appointment to this post is made.</P>
    <P>The recent unrest in the grocery trade has been a matter of grave concern.  I am confident, however, that compliance by the trade with the relevant regulations will serve to defuse the situation to an extent which will create a climate conducive to the early conclusion of negotiations on terms and conditions of supply.  It is my earnest wish that these negotiations will be brought to a successful conclusion as early as possible and I trust that the House, in confirming this order, will share in these sentiments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us is introduced for the purpose of confirming an order made by the Minister under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  If I might digress for a moment&mdash;I am sure the Chair will not mind since I have been digressing for the past hour&mdash;having all restrictive practices legislation under the one cover, as it were, is very commendable. It makes for the convenience of people like us and others directly involved, such as solicitors and traders.  I would appeal to the Minister to follow the same practice where orders are concerned. The principal order was made in 1976 and there have been many more since then.  These should be consolidated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State has said, the main purpose of the Bill is to foster conditions which will lead to a successful conclusion of the delicate negotiations now taking place in regard to conditions of supply between manufacturers and retailers.  We on this side are very conscious of the delicacy of the situation <Col N="1284" /> and we are very anxious that the negotiations should be successfully concluded so that no further interruption of supplies will take place.  We welcome a successful conclusion as a necessary safeguard for the small, independent retailer, the small grocery shopkeeper.</P>
    <P>The main provision concerns below-cost selling.  Section 5 of the order defines this to be a price that, after the deduction of the cost to the retailer of any discount or other benefit given by him on the sale of the goods, is less than the net invoice price of the goods, including any value-added tax payable by the retailer.  This practice of below-cost selling has been employed mainly by multiple stores and supermarkets in an effort to stimulate trade.  The problem here is that the items involved are basically foodstuffs.  It is not an unfair observation, I think, to say that the larger multiple stores are not interested in philanthropy to the extent they would wish us to believe.  In other words, philanthropy and trade do not mix very well.</P>
    <P>If a store is selling a commodity below cost and advertising it as such, we can take it the store will be selling many other products at prices which give them favourable returns, items which may be unidentifiable to the consumer. Therefore the whole thing is misleading the consumer, as the Minister has stated. Such stores employ a certain amount of psychology in regard to the location of items in the shop.  Below cost items would be deep in the store and the customer would have to wade his way through above cost items and the store would hope that he would purchase them <i>en route</i> to the below cost items. These are legitimate devices but there is a certain degree of exploitation involved by the traders.</P>
    <P>There is another point of importance. The practice of under-cost selling can be indulged in only by the bigger outlets because of volume and the capital involved. Small shops cannot avail of this device.  The danger is that if this were allowed to persist, in time the smaller traders would be squeezed out of business and we could have the unfavourable result in a small country like <Col N="1285" /> this that the whole grocery trade would be in the hands of a few multiple stores who could impose a virtual monopoly situation in which the Minister would have a tragic situation on her hands.</P>
    <P>The 1972 inquiry into the grocery trade, which was very comprehensive, did not elicit any broad support for under-cost selling from either manufacturers or consumers.  The commission did not recommend prohibition of below cost selling and this Bill does not prohibit it, but it does not encourage it in any shape or form.  It is something of a compromise in regard to the difficulties encountered earlier this year in the grocery trade.  We on this side are prepared to accept this process of conciliation and should like to be associated with it.</P>
    <P>I may have said something which might not sound too good to the larger stores, the supermarkets and multiple stores.  On the other hand, we must acknowledge that they have expressed their good intentions in relation to the phasing out of below cost selling, and we must give credit where credit is due.</P>
    <P>The proposed restrictions on advertising of goods offered for below cost sale is new.  I am pleased to see that it has been restated in paragraph 5 of the order and that it has been widened to cover all groceries, food and non-food items.  The order will serve to control this below cost selling which to the consumer might seem very attractive in the short-term but which in the long-term does not hold out any great benefit for the consumer, who should be told that this is so.</P>
    <P>Mention of restrictive practices legislation brings me to the functions of the Director of Consumer Affairs and I should like to put on record my appreciation of the excellent work the commission have done and of the excellent comprehensive reports they have published, including the evidence.  There was one recently in regard to the distribution of films which made very good reading for anyone interested in that area of activity.  Because of misleading advertising of goods, I should like to stress the vital role to be played by the Director of Consumer Affairs whose appointment <Col N="1286" /> is overdue.  I should like to express my disappointment because this person&mdash;I do not know whether it will be male or female&mdash;has not been appointed. There are rumblings that somebody is to be appointed, but nothing can be done until the appointment has been made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond and I were on a live radio programme a few weeks ago&mdash;the Minister could not be there because of commitment in the House.  At the end of the programme an announcement came on in blatant breach of the Consumer Information Act.  It was just when we had finished.  On came this special offer in blatant breach of the Act.  As the Minister knows, not a thing can be done until this appointment has been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome the Bill, but it is matter of profound regret that Dáil Éireann should have to produce an order in effect to provide fire brigade action to dampen down some of the more cut-throat and not very pleasant practices of some of the interests who went at each others throats in the boycott issue earlier in the year and who are now, to some extent, licking their wounds.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody would be particularly perturbed at healthy, tough but fair competition, but in a trade in which the margins are so tight and in which there is not that much profit to be made in the long run, in many areas of the grocery trade the kind of outbreak of retail warfare which we saw earlier this year cannot do the trade much good.  It certainly did not help the viability of many of the companies concerned, and in the long run it does not contribute to fair competition.</P>
      <P>There is a major side factor in this because some firms could be put out of business by others who in turn would be so seriously damaged that employment in their firms would have to be reduced. The kind of competition we saw earlier this year, with various retailers falling from their horses and getting injured in the process, was not of any advantage to the companies concerned and was not of any real benefit to the Irish consumer.  I would stress that strongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" /> One of the difficulties which has arisen in relation to this Bill and to other aspects of competition is the wide lack of public awareness of retail and wholesale margins, even in the grocery trade. Although such margins are notoriously slender generally in the grocery trade, this is not so in regard to one line, that of fruit and vegetables, where margins are outrageous and represent massive exploitation of the consumer, who gets miserable value.  But in other lines, margins are tight and it is inevitable that the Government should hold the reins.  I would hope that the National Prices Commission and the Director of Consumer Affairs would insist that manufacturers and suppliers will make a lot more information available to the public, not only in relation to the grocery trade but to a wide range of produce, particularly in relation to price differentials as between wholesale and retail outlets.  It always sticks in my craw when I compare the wholesale cost of a bottle of mineral water with the retail price.  Let us take a crate of &ldquo;7-Up&rdquo; and the price at which it enters the supermarket and that charged for it when it leaves.  The public are not aware that sometimes the price charged has been doubled in regard to that one soft drink product. There has been a great deal of outrageous consumer exploitation in a line where there is not a great deal of competition because householders do not discriminate to any great degree in the matter of soft drinks.</P>
    <P>These are areas in regard to which I have very strong views.  What happened in relation to the boycott was entirely regrettable.  In fruit and vegetables, particularly, there is not enough fair competition and the consumer in many areas is being taken for a massive ride because wholesalers and retailers have a huge profit margin.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the Minister's reference in her speech to the practice of multiple traders advertising goods for sale at specially low prices when such prices are not available at all outlets.  In Dublin, householders have one or two options in relation to supermarkets, but <Col N="1288" /> these advertisements in national newspapers, particularly in evening newspapers, are read by consumers in rural towns where there might be only one outlet and where the alleged specially low prices are not available.  This occurs even in suburban areas of the larger cities.  This is partcularly unfair where there is a lesser degree of consumer choice.</P>
    <P>I therefore urge on the Minister that the Director of Consumer Affairs should go on the consumer affairs programme of RTE and explain to consumers what can happen.  We men are unfortunately so lazy that we tend to impose the job of grocery shopping on our wives.  They tend to listen to RTE's morning consumer affairs programmes and I therefore strongly urge that the Director of Consumer Affairs should go on such programmes to explain what is meant by our restrictive practices legislation.  I hope that this Bill will strengthen the viability of many retailers throughout the country and that it will stamp out some of the cut-throat practices which have been developing.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies O'Toole and Desmond for the warm welcome they have given to the Bill and for their comments, which have been very helpful.  Deputy O'Toole asked about consolidation.

At the moment, as the Deputies will appreciate, the commission have a rather heavy workload.  I will consider introducing consolidation at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole spoke about the Director of Consumer Affairs, as did Deputy Desmond.  Deputy Desmond mentioned advertising of goods for sale at specially low prices and he pointed out that these notices appear in newspapers which go into nearly every home throughout the country, not just in Dublin.  Like Deputy O'Toole, I come from an area where the same prices are not available as in Dublin.  This would appear to be a case of misleading information <Col N="1289" /> which would be in breach of the Consumer Information Act and it is my intention to bring it to the notice of the Director of Consumer Affairs when he is appointed, I hope early in 1979.</P>

Deputy Desmond made similar points to Deputy O'Toole on the undesirable effects on manufacturers of below price selling, and the effects on employment in manufacturing industries. The areas of main concern to us when we asked the commission to investigate the situation were that the regulations now being made are complied with fully.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Beginning at 6.30 p.m. today we passed Supplementary Estimates amounting to approximately £70 million in about a minute without discussion. <Col N="1290" /> We are now moving to what must be the Final Stages of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1977, a Bill which will revolutionise the whole structure of local government as we know it. This Bill was introduced in this House on 14 December 1977 and we must now conclude it by 9.30 p.m. tonight as I understand the order of the House.  There has not been much time devoted to this Bill.  It got a Second Reading and we have not spent very long on Committee Stage having regard to the type of Bill it is and what is involved.  It is regrettable that the Government did not order this Bill in a more orderly way so as to give the House time to discuss it and put the Minister in the position that he could, if he wanted to, put down amendments on Report Stage after having heard the views of this side of the House on it.  This is a type of Bill which does not lend itself to amendments from the Opposition because they are ruled out of order either because they are imposing or could impose a charge on the Exchequer or because they do not come within the principle of the Bill as introduced.  That is a pity, and I am not going to labour this question any further beyond saying that it is all the more reprehensible when you are dealing with a Government who have a majority of over 20 seats.  It terrifies one to see £70 million in Estimates put through on the nod and in the same evening a Bill having such far-reaching effects as this Bill has on local government being put through all its Stages in an hour and a half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we last discussed this measure we were dealing with section 10.  Briefly, that is the section which enables the Minister to limit the amount of the rate in the £ which any local authority or rating authority may strike.  It is the section which deems the maximum increase permitted to be the rate struck if the rate struck exceeds the maximum permitted and in that way it ignores the local authorities.  Since we discussed this Bill last week the Minister has announced that this year the maximum permitted increase in the rate over last year will be 10 per cent.  I think 10p in the £ was announced over the radio and in today's newspapers.  That is an example of the type of blanket restriction imposed on a <Col N="1291" /> local authority.  I put it to the Minister that in arriving at a 10 per cent increase this year he did not go through the various local authorities, authority by authority, and discuss with them their permitted requirements for this year.  It would be a miracle if the same permitted increase would be the amount necessary to service all the local authorities in the country.  Speaking on the Bill last week the Minister pointed out that the 11 per cent increase permitted by him last year was more than enough in 16 cases and that in fact 16 local authorities did not see fit to strike a rate in the £ as high as 11 per cent over the previous year.  That demonstrates that local authorities can be relied upon to strike a reasonable rate that will be sufficient for their needs and nothing more.  I said earlier today on an Estimate that the Minister did not tell us of the number of local authorities who are under pressure for more money and have not enough money because of the 11 per cent last year.</P>
    <P>Other sections of this Bill, particularly the next section, 11, are equally objectionable if not more so and we have to spend some time dealing with that.  I want to summarise what I have to say on section 10 by stating that it is a section which is going to be operated by the Minister, as we have seen, in a blanket fashion without any regard to the individuality of the local authorities concerned. It is a section that will impose severe restrictions and hardships on various county councils and local authorities.  The Minister in his announcement today said that due to buoyancy in revenue&mdash;from rates presumably&mdash;this will be effectively an increase of something like 13 per cent rather than 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>I would like to know how that buoyancy is arrived at.  We had a long discussion here today under another section as to whether the people who applied for an apportionment of a valuation would have their valuation increased. The Minister assured us that there was no danger of that.  Since then I have been speaking to someone who has a mixed hereditament consisting of a <Col N="1292" /> business and a dwelling and I am told that without any request from the occupier of that mixed hereditament it was revised, presumably last year, and the residential portion of it separately valued and the business portion of it very substantially increased.  That is probably where some of the buoyancy is coming from and as the years go on we will have more of that and we will find out by way of parliamentary questions and otherwise the effect of that.  The Minister said that this section was necessary to protect the taxpayer, the ratepayer and the Exchequer.  He must mean that it is necessary to protect these people from the local authority.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to go on record as saying that the whole history of local authorities is that they have behaved in a reasonable way.  I want to emphasise that whenever councils were dissolved and councillors removed from office this was done because they had not struck a sufficiently high rate and not because they had struck an excessive rate, and that was only on very rare occasions.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister has told us that these 16 councils, including two in my own constituency, did not take up his offer of an 11 per cent increase last year.  I say that is abundant evidence that there is not likely to be any abuse but it seems to me that this intervention by the Minister for the Environment and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, in the affairs of local authorities and saying, without any effort to find out what is a reasonable budget, that they can have 10 per cent this year and take it or leave it, or they can have 11 per cent next year and can take it or leave it, is simply reducing the whole independence and discretion of local government.  It is really abolishing local government and centralising in the Custom House the last important function of local councils. It is doing a bad day's work for the system of local government that we have enjoyed here since the end of the last century.  There is no discretion being left to to them; no real function has been left to the authorities.  Already as a result of last year's operation we see county roads being run down, as I mentioned earlier today.  We will have a further run down in county roads this year.  The <Col N="1293" /> scavenging and refuse collections will suffer.  Many other services will be hit and curtailed as a result of this measure. I just wonder how the local representatives will react to this when we come to next year's elections.  Really the only function now left to the local authority seems to be the renaming of streets and townlands and giving some advice on the development plan.</P>

      <P>Time is obviously going to be restricted on the rest of this debate but I would just briefly remind the Minister of a number of questions I raised the last time we were talking about this section.  Rather than making any further points I would be interested to hear the Minister's reply to these questions.  The most relevant one at this stage is the legal interpretation of the word &ldquo;duty&rdquo; in the context of paragraph (e) of section 10 (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a couple of points on section 10.  I will not dwell too long on the fact that the section is clearly giving to the Minister powers which most of us fear and which many of the Minister's colleagues fear may be abused.  I do not suspect that anyone particularly wants to whittle away the power of local authorities but I am struck by the fact that in the last few days we have seen concrete evidence already that this section may very well leave itself open to abuse and may be abused.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister first of all if it is not an extraordinary precedent to issue to local authorities a letter in which he restricts their increase on last year's rate, in the context of the striking of the coming year's rate, to 10 per cent by assuming power in anticipation of this legislation.  The Minister's letter states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 (2) of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1977, which has had a Second Reading in Dáil Éireann, provides for the giving of a direction by the Minister in relation to the aggregate of the rates to be determined by a rating authority.  In anticipation of the enactment of the legislation and in accordance with the provisions of section <Col N="1294" /> 10 (2) the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, has directed that 10 per cent shall be the maximum amount by which the aggregate rate in the £ to be determined by each rating authority in respect of the local financial year 1979 shall exceed the aggregate rate in the £ determined by such rating authority in respect of 1978.</P>
    <P>I am relatively new to this House but common sense tells me that we are all wasting our time if there is some manner or means by which the Minister may act in anticipation of legislation which is still under discussion.  The reason we are discussing it, and I presume the reason the Minister is sitting here, is to make progress on this Bill, to have an open mind with regard to the possibility of having certain changes introduced, and indeed, if possible to have certain parts of the Bill thrown out completely.  I just wonder what the thinking behind this attitude is.  If we are to accept the implications of it we may find any Minister coming in here having made a decision in anticipation of legislation being approved. To say that it is undemocratic is being very charitable.  To say that it is a total and absolute negation of the whole parliamentary process is very much nearer the truth.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, first of all, to explain how that happened and what his justification for it is.  It is possible that this Bill will not see the light of day in terms of being enacted.  It is possible for any one of a number of reasons.  Yet the Minister, in a circular dated 8 December 1978 circulated to local authorities all over the country this very week, has said that in anticipation of the enactment of legislation the Minister has directed. Indeed, he is quite unequivocal about this because on a number of occasions throughout the letter he refers to the legislation which is before us.  Before we go any further it is very important to clear this point up.  Are we all wasting our time?  Has the Minister got the right to make directions in anticipation of legislation?  If he has, how prematurely may he make that anticipated judgment? Would it be reasonable for the Minister for Health, or the Minister for Justice or <Col N="1295" /> the Minister for Education or any other Minister to make judgments in anticipation of legislation which we have been promised?  This week the various local authorities are grappling with problems imposed by the Minister and he has presumed&mdash;in my view, quite wrongly &mdash;the enactment of legislation which has yet to be approved.  This is the Committee Stage of the Bill and it is not appropriate that we should go on making long speeches unless we get some response from the Minister.  I would like him to reply to us and then give us an opportunity of saying a few more words on other aspects of the matter.  Would the Minister like to comment on this?</P>

      <P>I will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The other points may be relevant.  I do not believe that a directive of this nature to local authorities based on a decision made in anticipation of legislation could be legal.  It is not ethical and I believe it is a bluff.  There is no statutory basis for such a directive. The Minister is trying it on and the local authorities are buying it.  It is perfectly clear that our worst fears about this section will be realised, that local authorities will become even bigger rubber stamps than they are at the moment.  We will have local elections next year and it is reasonable to assume that we would have the most lenient actions by the Government and the Minister.  I shudder to think what will happen next year if this is to be the good faith of the Minister, as indicated in the directive he has issued, in the light of section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has put a blanket 10 per cent on all increased expenditure.  I do not know why he had to waste the valuable time of decent officials up and down the country in preparing estimates in a total vacuum when the result of all that labour is a 10 per cent blanket ceiling. My young brother could have come up with that in half-an-hour.  I would say the wait was worth while if we saw some evidence that the Minister was interested in local sensitivity or in trying to understand the needs of local areas and particular regions and was responding to <Col N="1296" /> those in a comprehensive way.  There is no excuse for waiting so long unless the Minister hoped that a pre-Christmas euphoria would take away the sting of this blanket instruction.</P>
    <P>The limit the Minister has imposed is a national limit and does not take into account the needs of various areas.  He said in his letter that he appreciates that there are differences in the needs and resources of different local authorities and that their priorities may vary.  This is an indication that he appreciates the case this side of the House are making. He went on to say that he is satisfied that the application of an upper limit expressed as a uniform percentage addition to the existing rate in the £ of each local authority continues to be the most satisfactory method of aligning the programmes of local authorities with national policies.  That is another example of Government gobble-de-gook which nobody can make any sense of and is in total conflict with what the Minister said earlier.</P>
    <P>The Minister further said in his letter that the premature implementation of the power in this section represents the minimum of interference with the traditional freedom of action of local authorities but at the same time has due regard to the varying needs of individual rating authorities, the response of councils to those needs in previous years and the interests of non-domestic ratepayers. The Minister cannot have it both ways. He is either not interfering with the traditional freedom of action of local councils and authorities in which case they have freedom to raise money or he is.  It is perfectly clear that he is interfering with their actions because I have the estimates for Dublin city and Mr. James Molloy, the city manager, a hardworking and genuine official, spent many man-hours and a substantial amount of our money preparing estimates for a budget of £102 million for this year based on a proposed increase of 11 per cent on last year's rates.  That 11 per cent was on the basis of a continuation of services at existing levels and maintaining the existing work force.  Yesterday morning the traditional freedom which the Minister allows this city council resulted in a scurrying attempt to cut <Col N="1297" /> back £500,000 in Dublin city.  What does the Minister mean by saying we have traditional freedom if we are forced to do this?  If we do not do this the Minister says in the section that after we have talked about it if we do not accept his constraints he will strike the rate. There is one advantage for the Minister in this, as he will not be faced with political egg on his face, as one of his predecessors was, by having to dissolve the council.</P>
    <P>What will managers do next year as a result of this section?  They will decide that instead of having this annual débâacle of a cutback because the Government will not tell them in time what they will be entitled to and instead of their being associated with the odium of cutbacks in public expenditure, they will estimate very conservatively: they will probably decide that 8 per cent will do next year and perhaps they will get 10 per cent from the Government.  The result of the Minister's policy will be a whittling away of the calibre of local services. This will happen involuntarily because people will not want the annual hassle over cutbacks and the whittling away of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is extremely unfair to expect officials to become embroiled in this argument if they have an option, which is to estimate conservatively.  The Minister knows well that if he delays telling local authorities what they will get they will decide to estimate conservatively.  What will happen if the manager of Dublin city or Dún Laoghaire borough says that he needs 15 per cent more than he had last year?  There will be a much louder outcry than the relatively muted squealing yesterday if there are to be cutbacks of even 5 per cent on the proposed estimates. I guarantee that no local authority will estimate for a 15 per cent increase next year.  They will not chance even a 10 per cent increase because they reckon that the Minister's policies as implicit in this section and as explicit in the pronouncements of his Government clearly imply that local government expenditure is to be systematically, ruthlessly and dedicatedly cut back.  I leave it to others to conclude the reasons for this or the political ideology or philosophy behind it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> We are now in the throes of a systematic run down of local authority expenditure and, therefore, services. There is no denying that, I submit that the Minister seeks in this section to utilise power in a way which is fundamentally repugnant to the idea of local democracy.  He is in such a rush to do so that he has anticipated the legislators which, for a seasoned and hardened politician like himself, takes some neck and is a gross impertinence.  He owes this House an apology.</P>
    <P>Local democracy is the kernel of the question.  Many cliches are used in discussing this.  There is and must be room in a democratic system for a genuine forum from which local attitudes and opinions can percolate into the mainstream of our daily lives.  I have grave reservations about the way the local authority structure at present operates.  The work and dedication of the vast body of local councillors is very largely unappreciated and for some obscure reason they are the ready butt of any humourist, presumably because such councillors are not organised or articulate enough to respond in kind. These men will find that their role is an empty one; it is relatively empty already. They will find if they want to raise a few bob that they cannot do it.  It is naïve, simplistic and perhaps deceitful for the Minister to suggest that in some way the ordering of their expenses is their own business and they have ample room to lay emphasis here and there.  That is not so because statutory charges and demands on a council's budget make up the vast proportion of that budget.  There can be no suggestion of interfering and the Minister would be the first to start squawking if there were interference with such things as men's wages, refuse collection and disposal services.  The percentage of local authority expenditure which councils are free to manipulate is very small and is confined principally to areas relating to community grants, cultural grants and so on. That power is to be restricted.</P>
    <P>I would not be averse to a suggestion that the expenditure of local authorities should in some general way find itself in harmony with national economic policy. I do not believe that local authorities <Col N="1299" /> should have an open-ended honeymoon if they want to go on a spree and I am not aware that any of them are so doing. It is most unfair to insinuate in this highhanded way a paragraph of this significance into this Bill, which is allegedly designed to bring about an increase of largesse and to get rid of an anomaly.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister and his colleagues fully appreciate what they are doing.  The Minister has behind him more members of local councils than we have on this side of the House.  I do not believe Deputies Thomas Nolan, Liam Aylward, James Leonard, Seán French, Thomas Meaney, Barry Cogan, Jeremiah Cronin, Joe Walsh, Hugh Conaghan, Tim Killeen, Eileen Lemass or Tom Leonard or the other members of local authorities fully appreciate what the Minister is doing.  I would be extremely amused if I had the time to watch the contortions and acrobatics of the Minister's colleagues when they try to explain to local councils the effect of this Bill.  I have no doubt when the Minister gets the feedback he will be very interested in ameliorating this section. I suggest that he should do it now with all the grace and dignity he would wish.  He should reconsider this section and in some way try to marry local expenditure with national economic policy in a sensitive way which allows for local input.  Let him reform local bodies if he wishes but give them an opportunity to talk to him or his officials.  We need a flexible local expenditure policy and the section does not allow that.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for a joint approach by the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance.  I am not sufficiently experienced in this House to know whether there are many precedents for this.  Ministers for Finance through the years have been revered and feared as being, in some cases, the ogres of the Government.  A number of Ministers for Finance have reputations which are somewhat unfortunate and a bit harsh.  The present Minister for Finance does not escape from the attitude which beset and still besets some of his predecessors.  He is a <Col N="1300" /> man about whom it cannot be said as yet that he has given a great deal of largesse to any of his colleagues.  Going by the sounds one hears from various Departments, I see no reason for the Minister for the Environment to believe he will get a substantially greater purse than his colleagues in the Departments of Health, Social Welfare or Education or the other Departments which, for some extraordinary reason, are said to be &ldquo;Non-productive&rdquo;.  Perhaps it is time to re-define that phrase.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment had until now the same entitlement to operate and the same financial sovereignty as all the other Departments. For some reason the Minister sees a need to spell out in this section what he may now do with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  This is an unhappy section and it will inevitably mean that the Minister's powers to operate freely will be restricted.  I am more concerned about his successor.  The Minister for Finance will undoubtedly put the hammer on the Minister for the Environment when it suits him.  People throughout the country will be told, regardless of endless hours of debate, that they must take, say, 7 per cent.  The same blanket approach will be applied, giving no recognition to varying growth patterns and demands.  It will be clearly implied that needs in depopulated and depopulating rural areas are the same as those in fast growing areas, such as the County Dublin area with its new towns. I do not know how the Minister can justify that approach.</P>
    <P>The attempt in paragraph 6 of his letter to the local authorities of 8 December is a most ambiguous and irrelevant attempt to justify this blanket approach.  I suspect that the imposition of the 10 per cent limit was done without any great thought.  It does not reflect any kind of local concern or sensitivity and unfortunately is the thin end of the wedge.  If the Minister sees fit to do this this year I will be extremely worried about what he will do next year when there are no elections on the way.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by a <Col N="1301" /> direction given in writing to a local authority which is a rating authority, and so given before the adoption by the authority of an estimate of expenses relating to the local financial year specified in the direction, require that as regards that local financial year&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the aggregate of the rates required ... to be determined by the authority shall be limited by reference to an amount or in such other manner as may be so specified,</P>
    <P>The purpose of legislation is to spell out clearly, and explicitly the Minister's powers.  The effect of legislation is negatived if you include such a gesture as this, which is a form of words which sets at nought what goes before it.  If you say the Minister has the power to order an authority and their expenses in specific ways and then &ldquo;in such other manner as may be so specified&rdquo;, that generality makes ludicrous the earlier attempt to be specific.  That gives open-ended authority to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would not be averse to giving substantial powers to a Minister and hope he would use them and not continue to procrastinate about many of the areas in which he is doing very little; I am not unhappy to have an elected Minister having strong powers and doing the job, but in fairness there is not much point in having detailed legislation setting out specifics which are in some way set at naught by this kind of general paragraph.  That kind of worry underlines much of our objections to section 10.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (3) (c) reads:</P>
    <P>...the adoption by the authority of an estimate of expenses for the local financial year so specified shall not be thereby invalidated but such estimate shall be construed as if for any amount therein contained which is not in accordance with the requirements of the direction there were substituted the maximum amount permissible having regard to the limit specified in the direction or in case more than one limit is so specified, the relevant limit so specified,</P>
    <P>It seems unusual for a Minister to say he has the power to order authorities to carry <Col N="1302" /> out their &ldquo;duty&rdquo;, whatever that is, and to accord to his response while, at the same time, not setting out some ministerial response if they do not accord. If it is right for them to do as the Minister asks, there should be some sanction if they do not.  The Minister skilfully sidesteps that.  He says that if the councillors do not accept the 10 per cent limit, they should cross out whatever they propose and read it as ten.  This makes a charade of the whole process of local government and will tempt councillors to take less interest in their estimates.</P>
    <P>I have attended a number of these meetings and already there is an air of pointlessness and growing futility about the exercise, even more than in previous years when at least they had the hope that the Department would respond in a sympathetic way.  Now it will be even worse.  A local authority may spend a great deal of time working on a figure, but in the forefront of their minds they will have to accept that that figure, by the stroke of the manager's pen, may be substituted by a figure dictated by the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Minister for the Environment, who has substantial local authority experience and who knows more about local authorities than I do, can be happy about this proposed legislation which leaves itself open to abuse, and already there are signs that it is being abused.  Because of the lateness of the hour I will not delay the House too long.</P>
    <P>My main point is that if the example of Dublin city this week is anything to go by, we can anticipate a winding down of investment in, expenditure by and provision of services and jobs by local authorities.  We can also expect growing ingrained conservatism by the estimators. In all this there is not the slightest suggestion that the Minister might encourage or require the concept of zero budgeting, to start at nought and find out whether the vast sums being expended are being used usefully.  He is happy to accept the same traditional proportionality of expenditure, the same headings and subheadings, the same little increases on each heading over last <Col N="1303" /> year's figure.  The relevance and ratio of each one to the other is not of concern to the Minister.  He is only concerned about keeping a rein on local authorities.  If he was truly concerned about expenditure he would ask that a pound per pound evaluation be made of the way local authorities are spending their budgets and that we start afresh and look at the local authorities' total needs.</P>
    <P>He might even go further and suggest that local authorities could and should provide, perhaps, ten year social and economic programmes to which they would work, instead of reacting Pavlovian-like annually, depending on what figure emanates from the Department, which is what they are now forced to do.  They are forced to wait for the Minister to speak and then cut their cloth to measure on a year to year basis.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are involved in providing services which by their nature cannot be provided on a year to year basis.  If the Minister said that the local authorities over the next ten years would have £X million, they would have some idea of how to plan.  But how can one plan when from one year to the next one does not know what the Minister will say in relation to the amount of money to be spent.  How, therefore, can the local authorities provide services which they are statutorily obliged to provide because, as I said, they are by their very nature services which need long-term planning.  They are planning on a wing and a prayer, hoping the money will be there, but it depends on the Minister for the Environment, or may be, the Minister for Finance, or the Minister for Economic Planning and Development or the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>There are serious problems about the section and this Bill.  If the Minister were serious and earnest about his attempt to bring in the main benefits of this legislation, he would excise from the Bill these sections which any democratic person must find repugnant.  There are a substantial number of democrats in the Minister's party and I have no doubt that they are extremely unhappy about some of the provisions in this legislation which will mean that from now on future <Col N="1304" /> councillors will be saddled with legislation which will be on our Statute Book until kingdom come, legislation which does not give them any power to raise money and, allegedly, gives them power to order their finances but in reality it does not do so because the best part of that expenditure has to be made because it is a statutory demand, or because it is related to services which are so fundamental and essential that only a madman would suggest that there should be a cut-back on such things as refuse collection or sewerage services.</P>
    <P>The power in this Bill is repugnant to us.  I suggest that the Minister think about it again, discuss it with his colleagues who are members of local authorities and ask them what they think.  I suggest that he explain this extraordinary breach of parliamentary etiquette, this discourtesy to the House, this parliamentary impertinence, which allowed him this week to send a circular to local authorities in which he said that he anticipated certain powers under this Bill and that &ldquo;he was thereby directing&rdquo;. Inexperienced as I may be, common sense tells me that that could not be legally, ethically or morally right.</P>
    <P>The Minister acted unwisely and possibly arbitrarily.  If the propriety of this section were to be tested in the courts I believe it would be found to be without substance by reason of there not existing the legal base on which it rests.  There is not in force at this moment a Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1977.  Therefore, the Minister does not have the power to say that in anticipation of the enactment of the legislation and in accordance with the provisions of section 10, subsection (2), the Minister has directed that 10 per cent shall be the maximum amount by which the aggregate rate in the £ shall be determined by each rating authority.  Neither has the Minister the power to say that the directions set out in paragraph 2 are issued in anticipation of section 10 (2), of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should hope that this temporary lapse is not an omen of greed and lust for power and possibly an obsession with incipient dictatorship which might be brought about by the Government having an overall majority.  I would remind the Minister that this House remains <Col N="1305" /> a democratic institution, that he does not have the right to take powers which are not yet his and that this House deserves more respect than to be treated in this fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us here irrespective of party affiliations would wish very much that the limited time available for this very important and crucial debate would be shared as equitably as possible and that none of us would consume an unfair share of that time.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to sit down at this point and listen to the Minister because we expect him to reply to the very many serious questions that have been put to him.  We are dealing with a very serious piece of legislation.  Many of us on this side of the House have spent much time seeking to alert the House and the country to the implications of this Bill, to its effects on the structure of local government, on the rights of members of local authorities and on the fundamental democratic base of our local authorities. We have said that this is a piece of legislation that will have very serious repercussions which would virtually destroy the power of local authorities in regard to striking rates and to implementing the various services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has invoked section 10 of the Bill and by way of circular has informed the various local authorities that they may not exceed the expenditure for the coming year by more than 10 per cent of last year's expenditure.  This is the situation as we saw it all along, although some people may have thought that we were exaggerating.  This Bill is simply a take-over by the Minister for the Environment of the rights, duties and powers that are vested in local authorities.  It is an undermining of the local government procedures as we have known them down through the years. That is bad enough but the Bill is also a take-over by the Minister for Finance, as is very clear here.  That is one reason why I am prepared to sit down at this point and hear the Minister.  We are very concerned with his attitude to this legislation.  He is adopting a very dangerous stand.  He is adopting an attitude of indifference, of complacency and of silence in the knowledge that at <Col N="1306" /> the end of the day he will have a majority of 20 to help him push through this dictatorial piece of legislation.  That is a dangerous situation not only for the House but for the country.  Therefore, I am inviting the Minister to attempt to defend the measure.  He has failed so far to defend it.  He has shown himself to be either unable or unwilling to defend it but, as I have said, he knows he has a majority that will allow the Bill to be jackbooted through the House after a limited debate.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an unwarranted interference with the affairs of local authorities and members of local authorities realise now the extent of the interference involved.  We were told last week by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment that members of local authorities are retaining upwards of 99.5 per cent of the powers vested in them.  He told us that they will continue to have power to initiate various schemes.  They will not be able to initiate anything unless the necessary money is available but the power to provide money is being taken from them.</P>
    <P>The Bill pauperises local authorities. It makes beggars of our public representatives while it makes spies of our county managers.  It destroys the good relationship that exists between members and managers.  The dangers inherent in section 10 in particular are demonstrated amply by the Minister's circular in which he said that the 10 per cent increase is all that local authorities will be allowed in next year's estimates. We know that in respect of very many councils and corporations the 10 per cent increase referred to has been earmarked already to pay for goods and services and for salaries and wages incurred in the present year.  The Minister must know that this will mean there is little or no increase to most local authorities.  We know of the situation in Dublin Corporation.  At a time when estimates have been more or less finalised in many local authorities, members will have to reconvene and there will be cutbacks all over the country.  In some instances it is fair to assume that essential services will suffer and that the standard will be set back.  In addition, new <Col N="1307" /> schemes will not be initiated and employment will suffer.  Jobs will be lost as a result of this policy while such matters as the safeguarding of pensions and superannuation rights will be jeopardised. There is no provision in respect of an emergency situation that might be due to an act of God, to fire, to storms or to excessive rains which could ravage our roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister must answer these questions. What is the position in respect of expenditure that had to be incurred this year due to excessive flooding?  What will be the position next year with regard to essential over-expenditure to deal with emergency situations?  If councils want to borrow money for these purposes, will the Minister sanction money to carry out essential services and to keep men at work?  What is the position in respect of section 4?  Will the Minister sanction that section which has been passed democratically by a majority of council members?  The Minister cannot remain silent any longer.  He cannot sit there, aloof and indifferent, waiting for the bells to ring, the vote to take place and the feet to march through the lobbies.  It is not good enough.  This is a national assembly. Tonight we are talking about the retention of democracy.  Local government means exactly what it says, at least up to now.  We will not have local government any longer.  This is a take-over by the Minister and his party, making puppets of people in public life.</P>
    <P>I could speak on this matter for a long time but I realise that other Members are anxious to speak.  In particular we wish to hear the Minister attempt to defend this dictatorial legislation.  If he can let him do so now.  I invite him to do so.</P>

      <P>Like the previous speakers, last year I had fears when the 11 per cent figure was introduced that at <Col N="1308" /> the end of the year every county council would be in a bad way.  My fears have been realised to the full extent in my own county.  Quite a number of people in my county will be suing Limerick County Council in respect of damage to their cars because of the condition of the roads.  There are a few questions I wish to ask the Minister.  My first question deals with malicious injury.  This year my county is faced with a bill of £60,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>For what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in respect of malicious damages.  According to the present regulations that will have to be met within the 10 per cent limit and I ask the Minister to consider not taking that within the limit of 10 per cent.  Because of the local government elections we will be faced with additional costs that will come to 1½ per cent of our entire estimate. What will be the position with regard to the national wage agreement? If there is a new agreement, will the local authorities be called on to meet that cost also?  If that is the case we will be down to 8 per cent to meet the work we should be doing.</P>
      <P>Our county manager&mdash;and I am sure the same applies throughout the country&mdash;has spent many hours preparing his estimate.  The council will have to spend much time in trying to decide what services will have to be scrapped. County councillors have always displayed their interest on behalf of the ratepapers.  In fact, quite a number of councillors have been elected solely by certain groups as the watchdogs of the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to set a limit of 10 per cent.  I have never agreed with a flat rate.  There is no comparison with regard to counties because they vary to a great extent.  There should be some way of assessing what rate they should be allowed. I would ask the Minister to reply to the three points I made: firstly, with regard to malicious damage; secondly, the matter of local elections and, thirdly, the national wage agreement.  If the Minister can assure me he will make provision for these three matters I will be happy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Treacy referred to the Bill as dictatorial and he said that it was being bulldozed through the Dáil with our majority of 20 seats. One reason why we have a majority of 20 seats is because of our commitment to derate the domestic sector as well as secondary schools and community halls.  That is one reason the people voted overwhelmingly in favour of us.  Whether the Deputy wishes to describe the Bill as dictatorial or obnoxious, it gives legislative effect to what the people voted for, namely, derating.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such thing as destroying local democracy.  It was wrong of the Deputy to make the allegation that I have not defended this Bill.  I have defended it for several weeks but it may not have been convenient for the Deputy to have been here on all the occasions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn raised a question with regard to paragraph (e) (iii).  He seemed to be worried that this would take away some powers from elected members and put them in the hands of managers.  This cannot happen so long as councils observe the overall limit fixed by the Minister.  Paragraph (e) (i) merely requires managers to spell out clearly to members what is the ministerial direction. This is to ensure that councillors will have the direction properly conveyed to them and that they understand it as it affects their own areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main issue here is the 10 per cent or the upper limit on the rates which local authorities may strike. It is not the rate they have to strike but it is the upper limit within which they have to stay.  I justified this on several occasions but it is no harm to do so again.  We should remember that before domestic derating the State's contribution to the total rates income of local authorities was about 25 per cent and this was through the agricultural rates relief grant.  With the full derating of domestic and certain other properties as set out in this Bill, <Col N="1310" /> Exchequer participation in the total amount levied through the rating system has increased to slightly over 60 per cent.  This represents a liability of nearly £120 million this year.  It will cost even more in the coming year, about £133 million.  If no limit applied to rate poundages to the local authorities, without question through the domestic rate grant and the agricultural grant, the State would have to meet any demand which local authorities individually or collectively chose to formulate.  This would not be fair.  Local authority services would be alone in having an unquestioned and an unlimited claim on Exchequer resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>They did.  Other services equally vital to the country's well-being would not have the same privilege.  A major purpose of the limit on rate poundage is to ensure a fair alignment of local government needs with those of other sectors of our economy.  This limit affords protection in two other ways.  It protects remaining ratepayers against excessive increases in rates.  It also protects responsible local authorities from the pressure which would be caused if only a few local authorities began to resort to unreasonable rate increases in a free for all type of situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>Last year 16 did not.  Assuming they avail of the whole of that increase their income from rates and rates-linked State grants will increase by more <Col N="1311" /> than this amount.  This arises because of valuation increases on new properties including domestic properties in every local authority area.  This is what we call buoyancy.  The pattern of increases will vary from area to area but, in aggregate, it is estimated that local authorities will enjoy an increase of 13 per cent in rates income during 1979.  In areas of more rapid development, this increase will be greater.</P>

      <P>I have said certain authorities will come out better than others because of more development.  If there is more and more development in a local authority, they will be required to give more and more services.  We should not lose sight of that fact.  Local authorities will have an extra £26 million available to them in 1979 from rates and rates-linked State grants, bringing their income from these sources to nearly £220 million.  This will ensure that their programmes expand at a rate comparable to development in the other sectors of the economy.  The percentage increase in rate poundage authorised by me leaves local authorities entirely free within the overall limit to decide their rate in the £ and the priorities which should apply between their different programmes.</P>

Does the Minister know the number of local authorities which have already exceeded their limits this year and to what extent that may be so?  By what percentage have councils and corporations over-expended and are in arrears?  I also asked the Minister if he would be prepared to entertain requests for further money in any circumstances where grave reasons, due to an emergency situation, arose.  What is the Minister's stance where extra moneys are required for reasons that could not have been anticipated in the compilation of the estimates?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 203 to 206 together.</P>
      <P>The European Council decided on 5 December 1978 to request the Community institutions to make available, through the new financial instrument (Ortoli Facility) and the European Investment Bank, for a period of five years, loans of up to 1,000 million EUA per year to the less prosperous member states effectively and fully participating in the exchange rate and intervention mechanism of the European Monetary System.  I laid a copy of the resolution containing this decision before the House on 6 December.</P>
      <P>The Council did not decide on how much of the loans would be provided by the Ortoli facility and how much by the European Investment Bank.</P>
      <P>The Council requested the Commission of the EEC to submit a proposal to provide interest-free subsidies of 3 per cent for these loans, costing not more than 200 million EUA each year over the same period, that is, a total of up to 1,000 million EUA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> The interest-rate subsidies apply for the full life of the loans, expected to be 15 years.</P>
    <P>The following table details how an interest rate subsidy of 3 per cent for 15 years would work out on the basis of a moratorium of five years for repayment of principal&mdash;repayment being assumed to be by annuity, in accordance with European Investment Bank practice.  On the basis of the table the present value of the total interest-rate subsidy attracted by a loan of £100 million would be £20.1 million, giving a figure of just over £45 million for a loan of £225 million; if <Col N="1158" /> a moratorium of three years is assumed, the present value of the interest-rate subsidy for a loan of £100 million works out at £19.4 million or slightly less than £45 million on a loan of £225 million.</P>
    <P>The Council's decision stated that the funds were to be concentrated on the financing of selected infrastructural projects and programmes with the understanding that any direct or indirect distortion of the competitive position of specific industries within member states would have to be avoided.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> With regard to the number and type of each classified farmer under the farm modernisation scheme in each county and the number of applicants outstanding for classification, I refer the Deputy to my answer of 29 November 1978 on this subject.</P>
    <P>In relation to the waiting period for classification, it must be accepted that some waiting period is inevitable in processing applications.  While this may have been fairly long in certain instances I would not accept that in general the delay has been inordinate.  With the assignment of additional staff I would hope that the waiting period will be reduced considerably.</P>

Their terms of reference are to investigate the best possible uses of Bord na Móna cutaway bogs with a view to ensuring that they are properly developed and used in the best national interest, and to supervise and co-ordinate whatever technical studies are considered necessary in this connection.  The committee have met on four occasions, namely, 9 December 1977 and 25 May, 11 July and 6 October 1978.</P>

The agreement also allowed for pay increases in excess of this limit where, as a result of consultation, negotiation and agreement, exceptional changes in payment-by-results, piece-work, commission, productivity and flexibility schemes or new productivity schemes were introduced.
