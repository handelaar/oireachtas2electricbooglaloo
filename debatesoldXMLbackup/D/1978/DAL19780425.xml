      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the additional or new assurances that were given by him to Mr. Callaghan, which, according to Mr. Roy Mason, have now obviated what Mr. Mason recently declared was an urgent need for a joint meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to discuss, among other matters, cross-Border co-operation, security, and other similar questions of common interest to the two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the House in my statement on 11 April, my meeting with the British Prime Minister on the occasion of the European Council meeting in Copenhagen on 7 April, which lasted for 50 minutes, was an informal and useful one.</P>
      <P>We looked back to our discussion in September, reaffirmed the views expressed in the communique following that meeting, and reviewed progress since then in the political, economic and security areas.  While it is not customary to reveal details of such discussions, I can say that we agreed that there should be further meetings between Ministers, as necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some doubt as to what was actually agreed in the <Col N="1248" /> September meeting and the recent meeting.  The only discernible difference between this Government's policy and that of their predecessors was the Taoiseach's insistence that he would get Mr. Callaghan to agree to make a declaration of withdrawal from Northern Ireland as a move towards peace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Was this question raised at the most recent meeting and was any undertaking given in respect of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said to anybody that I would insist that Mr. Callaghan would make a declaration of withdrawal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We need not quarrel about the words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The words are important and the Deputy ought to realise that they are important and ought to realise that misrepresentation, even if not intended, can create damage.  I never used the words and never claimed the insistence attributed to me by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has not yet said if he raised the question with Mr. Callaghan that the British should, in the interests of peace, withdraw.  Did he raise it?  If he did, what was the reply Mr. Callaghan gave to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated to Mr. Callaghan the content of the Fianna Fáil policy statement issued in October 1975.  He was already fully aware of the contents of that statement.  I told him that remained our policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of the amount of penetration from the South there is a great difference between Mr. Mason's and the Taoiseach's version, both presumably based on British secret service information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the facts about the discrepancy between the <Col N="1249" /> Taoiseach's statement and Roy Mason's statement about the penetration by the Provisional IRA from the South to the North?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I already made a full statement on that in my speech at the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis. These are the facts as we know them and they were published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach should be prepared to repeat to the Dáil whatever he has to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position regarding talks about cross-Border co-operation?  Is it the case that it was arranged that there should be early ministerial meetings to discuss progress in this area?  If so, when is such a meeting likely to take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was mentioned in the course of my talks with Mr. Callaghan.  We referred to the fact that the talks that had been arranged, following our meeting in September, between officials had now reached the stage when they could be taken further by meetings between Ministers. We agreed that meetings between Ministers would take place as necessary. No firm arrangement has yet been made for such meetings between Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of that agreement between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister does not Mr. Mason's suggestion that no meeting was needed require some explanation or how does it fit in with the agreement to have a meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that was a misinterpretation of what Mr. Mason said in the British House of Commons, perhaps justified, on the part of some newspapers.  I believe he never said anything like that.  If the Deputy will consult Hansard he will see that he did not say anything like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of conflicting newspaper reports, he will clarify his recent comments during a speech in Mallow, County Cork on industrial relations; if the Government now exclude the possibility of unilateral legislation to solve labour problems; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks in Mallow were clear and require no clarification.  The principal point I made was that there can be no escape from the need to establish and to adhere to orderly methods for examining and adjudicating upon industrial disputes.  I indicated the drawbacks of alternative approaches.</P>
      <P>If, having considered the matter fully, the Government decide that new legislation is required in this area, it will, of course, be their responsibility to introduce such legislation.  We have not, however, reached any such conclusion. The present position is that the Minister for Labour is proposing to establish a Commission on Industrial Relations.  He has nominated a chairman and hopes to nominate the remaining members, including nominees of both sides of the Employer/ Labour Conference, in the near future. I would hope that the commission will help in finding the most effective means of overcoming our industrial relations problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the House be assured that there will be no legislation until the commission report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: If the Deputy had listened to my reply he need not have asked that supplementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that his position was unambiguous and clear.  I am asking him to give a clear and unambiguous answer to the House about the environment the Government want to create in order to progress towards industrial peace.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House if the Government are considering legislation before the commission report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated that no conclusion had been reached on the introduction of new legislation in the area of industrial relations.  Can he clarify for the benefit of the House if any examination is under way on the introduction of new legislation in that area?  Could he assure the House that if any such is under consideration at present there will be full discussions with unions and employers prior to any suggested implementation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They seem to be an extension of the question.  However, I can assure the Deputy that there is no legislation before the Government at present.  In the ordinary course of events I would expect that any legislation that would be brought forward would be discussed in advance with the social partners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will consider the recent suggestion, put forward by the Dublin branch of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, that a full-time Cabinet Minister be appointed with exclusive responsibility for child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will rationalise the present position whereby ministerial responsibility for child care services is at present divided between three separate Departments, namely, Health, Education and Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together. The Minister for Health has, in accordance with a Government decision in October 1974, main responsibility, including that of coordination, in relation to child care.  In pursuance of these responsibilities, the Minister has recently reconstituted the Task Force on Child Care Services, which has the following terms of reference:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> to make recommendations on:</P>
    <P>(a) the need for extension and improvement of services for deprived children and children at risk;</P>
    <P>(b) the updating and modernising of the law in relation to children, including a new Children's Bill;</P>
    <P>(c) administrative reforms which may be necessary to give effect to proposals arising from (a) and (b) above.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, it would not be advisable to pre-empt the final recommendations of the task force through major administrative reforms at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that charge by the Minister for Health's child care committee could it eventuate in the establishment of a separate Ministry as a proposition?  I am sure the Taoiseach, who has long administrative experience in Government, must know that three Ministers could not possibly be as effective as one Minister in charge of a particular question.  Is it possible that the Minister's committee could recommend the establishment of a separate Ministry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible but I would not like at this stage to indicate to the Deputy that a separate Ministry would be established.  It is only fair to say that there are many facets of administration which are common to a number of Departments and it would be impossible to set up a separate Ministry for every piece of administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but does the Taoiseach not agree that there is a special question now with the increasing proportion of youngsters in the population, with juvenile delinquency, youth drinking and so on, which is particularly shown in the Loughan House controversy where nobody seems to have responsibility or responsibility is divided among too many people with the result that we have the present sort of panic measures?  Does the Taoiseach agree that we have reached the point where something must be done with <Col N="1253" /> growing youth unemployment in addition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the problem is and has been for some years past more acute than it was ten or 20 years ago.  Obviously, the task force will put forward recommendations to which the Minister for Health and the Government will have due regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach indicate his Government's intention in relation to the interim report of the same task force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being implemented at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach mean by that that the establishment of Loughan House is in line with what was recommended in that report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a separate question.  It is hoped that the Loughan House project will go ahead as an interim measure to deal with what is a serious problem having regard to the safety of life and protection of property, especially in the built-up areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <P>I believe most people accept that they are logical, rational and commercial conclusions to draw in all the circumstances.  My own preference is to publish reports of this kind where I can, but this report contains a fair amount of detail about negotiations between BGE, on behalf of the State, and the Marathon Oil Company in relation to the price of gas.  It would certainly not be in the public interest if that information was published.  I hope the State will at some future date be in the position of having to negotiate a similar contract with some other oil company or perhaps a number of companies.</P>

The substantial increase in drilling activity in 1978 as compared with previous years is naturally a favourable development since it will result in a very significant number of structures in different areas being tested.  It would, however, be premature at this stage to attempt a definitive assessment of prospects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy the exact position regarding the various companies who have been granted prospecting licences for oil and gas off this country's shores with particular regard to (1) the nature of their exploration technique, (2) the conservation and environmental protection measures used in the process of exploration, (3) the safety regulations applied for personnel on any oil rig or any alternative form of exploration, (4) the total number of personnel employed in this exploration by these companies, (5) the total number of Irish people employed by these companies in this exploration, (6) the monitoring and inspecting processes employed by his Department to oversee the activities of these exploration activities, and (7) the system and method whereby the Government, through him, can have a full and accurate assessment of the finds produced by any of these exploration efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question presumably refers to activities under exclusive petroleum licences. The replies to the points raised by him are as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  The methods used in exploring for hydrocarbons are virtually the same all over the world.  Licensees commence by conducting seismic surveys of the blocks exclusively allocated to them.  The interpretation of the results of such surveys helps in the selection of the most favourable locations for drilling exploratory wells which is the only means by which the actual presence of hydrocarbons can be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The exclusive licensing terms provide that the licensee shall maintain all apparatus and appliances and all wells in good repair and condition, <Col N="1259" /> and shall execute all operations in a proper and workmanlike manner in accordance with good oilfield practice. In addition my Department have prepared Rules and Procedures for Offshore Petroleum Exploration which stipulate in detail the measures to be taken to guard against any possible conservation or environmental problems.</P>
    <P>(3)  The exclusive licensing terms provide that the licensees shall take all necessary steps for securing the safety, health and welfare of persons employed or undergoing training in or about the licensed area and shall comply with all regulations made and directions given by the Minister for Labour, after consultation with other appropriate Ministers, in this regard.  The Minister for Labour proposes soon to introduce specific legislation regarding standards for the safety, health and welfare of persons employed on offshore installations in the exploration and exploitation of our natural resources.</P>
    <P>(4)  and (5)  On average about 140 workers are employed on an offshore drilling unit and very roughly 50 per cent of these would be Irish workers. I cannot at this time say with absolute precision how many wells will be drilled in the coming season but it seems unlikely that the number will be less than 16.  This could involve up to seven drilling units operating simultaneously in Irish waters.  On this basis as many as 1,000 personnel, including about 500 Irish people, could be employed by offshore drilling contractors between mid-March and October of this year.  This does not take account of personnel employed directly by the exploration companies, shore base operators, catering firms, supply boats, standby safety vessels and general service companies.  I am not in a position to indicate precisely the number or proportion of Irish people employed in these diverse activities.  However, a reasonable estimate is that about 500 people would be employed in these areas, of whom something less than half would be Irish people.</P>
    <P>(6)  Drilling operations conducted by licensees are monitored by my Department on a daily basis.  During the <Col N="1260" /> period of drilling the licensee is required to submit daily progress reports by telex.  In addition my technical staff are in frequent contact with the licensees' technical experts and they also visit the various rigs during drilling operations.  After a well has been completed the data and information resulting from the drilling operations are the subject of a detailed analysis.</P>
    <P>(7)  I receive regular detailed reports from my technical staff of the results of all drilling operations.  I am also informed immediately of any potentially important developments arising from such operations.  I am satisfied that the arrangements adopted will enable me to make a full and accurate assessment of any finds which may be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  Is the Minister satisfied, now that arrangements currently exist in the form of regulations and standards, that in the event of any kind of environmental mishap there is a sufficient back-up emergency plan in order to minimise the impact that such a mishap might have on the marine environment and related industries such as fishing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy should bear in mind that the question relates to exploratory drilling and that the bulk of this takes place 100 miles or more from our shores in very deep water and the likelihood of some major environmental disaster is extremely remote.  The companies drilling in these waters observe the same high standards they observe in other parts of the world.  I am satisfied, taking into account the conditions under which they drill, that all proper and necessary precautions are taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain whether I was asked if there were any omitted matters.  The matters omitted are minor annexes to these agreements and were omitted because they refer exclusively to the commercial business of the company and it has never been the practice to publish any such documentation in relation to a private company. The fact that these annexes, a document and an account, had to be retained is proof that the agreement itself and all the other various annexes and so on were not commercial information the publication of which would cause any damage to the company.  In the case of the maps the reason that they were not published was because they were so physically large that it would not have been feasible to publish them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We will make the Minister a present of the maps, but would the Minister agree that in holding a Press conference to launch what was supposed to be a full disclosure he did not say to the Press or to the public that the accounts in the case of Bula would not be shown to them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not shown.  It is perfectly obvious to anybody reading the agreement that they were left out, because they were referred to in the agreement.  If I was trying to hide anything, the agreement where it refers to the accounts in some appendices could have been amended, and it was not amended.  It has never been the practice, as the Deputy should well know, to publish the commercial accounts of private companies without their consent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The effects, if any, of a zinc smelter on agricultural activity in the neighbourhood of the smelter were examined in the course of the smelter project study recently carried out by the New Jersey Zinc Company. The IDA and IIRS had provided information to the company on environmental conditions in Ireland with particular emphasis on the importance of agriculture and this information was incorporated in the study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the company have informed me that they could not now commit themselves to proceed with the project on a basis that the smelter would be fully commissioned not later than 31 December 1981 and I have asked the IDA to report to me on the possible alternative courses which may now be open.  In the circumstances I do not think it would serve any useful <Col N="1269" /> purpose at this stage to publish the information on the environmental aspects of the New Jersey Zinc project but the Deputy may be assured that these aspects have been and will continue to be given most careful attention.</P>
    <P>When, in due course, the question of planning permission for construction of a smelter at a selected site arises, a detailed environmental impact statement, including the impact on agriculture, will be prepared as part of the planning application.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together. Following the recent decision by New Jersey Zinc not to commit themselves at the present time to the construction of a zinc smelter in Ireland to be fully operational by the end of 1981 I have asked the IDA to review the position and to report to me as soon as practicable on the possible alternative courses which may now be open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> I think it is very important that, at this stage, all the options and possibilities for securing the establishment of a zinc smelter in this country should be fully reviewed.  Among the questions which I have specifically asked the authority to study are the implications of a smelter project which would be controlled, or substantially controlled, by the State.  A certain amount of work has already been done on identifying aspects where the implications of a State-controlled smelter would be particularly significant and these will be examined in depth.</P>
    <P>As regards the matters specified in Deputy Kelly's question, these factors have, of course, an important bearing on both the commercial viability of the project and the general State interest in securing the construction of a smelter.  They have been carefully analysed and taken into account in the studies of the project undertaken to date by the IDA and commercial interests. They will obviously be important ingredients in the review of options and possibilities which I have now asked the IDA to carry out.</P>
    <P>As was indicated in the recent statement issued from my Department, the Government remain committed to the provision of a zinc smelter in this country at the earliest date and, following the IDA review, consideration will be given to measures which would be necessary and appropriate to achieve that objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the long delay that has taken place and the abortive consequence of it in that we are not going to get a smelter, would not the Minister indicate to the IDA, who are notoriously hostile to State enterprise, that in the national interest this very valuable necessity should be considered as a State enterprise and that we should proceed on these lines instead of being at the mercy of market forces as in both the Tynagh case and the Spanish case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to limit the IDA's examination of the <Col N="1273" /> various possibilities and options.  I should prefer that they would consider all options which they consider might be feasible and report to me on their feasibility.  As I have indicated, the possibility of substantial State control of a smelter is one of those options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the rejection by the American company, which is one of the most powerful and wealthy in the world, is based on simple profit and loss considerations and that there are very much more important considerations of human resources and mineral resources as applied to the national interest?  In those circumstances is not a State enterprise obvious?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the implication that the State should move in where a commercial loss is indicated. There are more considerations involved than profit and loss but it does not necessarily follow that the State is the propor vehicle to carry out this undertaking.  The marketing difficulties in zinc are considerable, even if the price were at an adequate level, which it is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the study which the Minister has asked the IDA to undertake related purely to a smelter? A smelter is only one link in the chain. There are industries, particularly those supplying the car assembly industry, where the zinc would be used.  Are the IDA being asked to explore the possibility of getting these industries here so that if zinc smelting becomes popular in the future we could utilise it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They are, but subject to the fact that it is unreal for the IDA to plan downstream industrial activity until there is a certainty that there will be a smelter.  I would not say that they have done detailed work on that as yet.  There was in the New Jersey Zinc proposals some reference to downstream activity and certainly the IDA would take that into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree totally with the Minister.  Because the price of zinc is so low the smelter is not profitable but that makes other industries more <Col N="1275" /> profitable.  The IDA should seek such industries before we have the smelter and the smelter can be built afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority are in discussion with the owners of Tynagh Mines with a view to joint action to provide alternative employment for the mine workers.  I am also informed by the IDA that they are actively promoting the area in the vicinity of Tynagh Mines for new industry to provide employment for workers who will be made redundant at the mines.  The authority are in the course of constructing an advance factory of 24,000 square feet at nearby Loughrea, which is expected to be completed this year, and they are also negotiating with industrialists on the possibility of locating a new project in the premises in the town formerly used as a spinning mill.</P>
      <P>The IDA have also approved grant assistance for a number of major industrial projects, with substantial job potential, for location in Galway city and other towns in the county within commuting distance of the Tynagh area.  Some of these projects will provide employment opportunities for the redundant mine workers in due course.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy appreciates, the mine will close in 1980 anyway and it is a question whether or not it will close a year or 18 months earlier than it otherwise would.  I am endeavouring to ensure, so far as I can, that that earlier closure will not take place.  A great deal will depend on how zinc prices move over the next six to 12 months.

Molaim an t-Aire agus glacaim an deis seo comhghairdeas foirmeálta a ghabháil leis as ucht an deontais £300,000 i mbliana, ardú 140 faoin gcéad ar dheontas na bliana seo caite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is trua nach féidir dul chun cinn i labhairt na Gaeilge a thomhas sa chóimheas chéanna ach tuigtear do chách nach mbeidh aon tslat draíochta no conair ghearr mhín, bhláthuil ag <Col N="1343" /> éinne chun líofacht na teangan i measc na ndaoine a bhaint amach.  Cruaobair atá i gceist ach is flú cloí leis. Chuir mé an bord i gcomparáid le crann a bhfuil stoc tréan aige, agus cibé cúis nach mbeadh an toradh sa chorp ann nuair a chuimhnítear ar an bhfairsingeacht Ghaeilge atá ann ón mbéaloideas, na scéalta idir Rúraíocht, Fiannaíocht agus na rann scéalta; ón séanchas fairsing béil agus scríobhtha; ó Scoil na mBard agus Courts of Poetry; le hobair Chéitinn, Uí Rathaille, Uí Bhruadair, Uí Suilleabhain, Mhic Dhomhnaill, Ó Longáin, agus a n-aislingí, dánta grá, tír ghrá agus caointe. Ansin tá nua fhilíocht ár linne Ó Mac Liammóir, Ó Riordáin agus Máire Mac an tSaoi.  Chomh maith le sin, tá obair Chonradh na Gaeilge, Cumann Luthchleas Gael, Cumann na Sagart, Glór na nGael, Muinteoirí agus oidí scoile chun an Ghaeilg a leathnú mar mheán chumarsáide i measc na ndaoine.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an tAire cuid de na géaga ón chrann i ráiteas na Dara Céime faoi na cláir oibre a chum Bord na Gaeilge iad féin agus a chuireadar féin in ord d'fhonn an Ghaeilge a leathnú i ngnéithe éagsúla dár saol.  Tá súil agam go néireoidh go geal leo agus go bhféadfar an stór eolais cnuasaithe dá bhárr a úsáid go héifeachtúil.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím roimh an chomhchoiste atá bunaithe chun áiseanna a sholáthar agus seirbhísí comhairle agus oiliúna a chur ar fáil chun an Ghaeilge a leathnú i measc daoine óga.  Ba mhaith liom dá mbeadh cumann Gaelach bunaithe ag na scoláirí féin á fheidhmiú i ngach scoil agus ligint dóibh bheith ag gabháil le ceol a linne idir snagcheoil, ceol traidisiúnta is bailéid, popcheol agus popamhránaíocht ach é bheith ar fáil ar chéirnín nó téip.  Thosaigh Gael Linn ar sárobair roinnt blianta ó shin le ceol mar seo a chur ar fáil.  Léim i ráiteas an Aire go mbeidh Bord na Gaeilge agus Gael Linn ag obair as láimh a chéile i leith dianchúrsaí sa teanga.  B'fhéidir gur féidir leo chomh-fhéachaint a thabhairt ar na cúrsaí ceoil a luaigh mé.</P>
    <P>Aithníonn an tAire go bhfuil dlúth-chaidreamh <Col N="1344" /> idir an bhord agus Radio Telefís Éireann agus sin mar is cóir. Is mór é tionchar na teilifíse agus an radio ar na daoine.  Is cumhachtaí láidir iad agus caithfear iad a mhúnlú chun go dtiocfaidh na daoine isteach ar chaint agus cúrsaí laethiúil Gaeilge chomh éasca agus is féidir agus diaidh ar ndiaidh fásfaidh iontaobh iontu féin dul i dtaithí ar chleachtadh is úsáid cibé stór Gaeilge atá acu.</P>
    <P>Is mian liom tagairt do dhá chlár, ceann amháin, &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo;, agus an ceann eile ar an radio, &ldquo;Binneas&rdquo;.  Luaim iad mar feicim nó chloisim iad go rialta.  Is sár-chlar é &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo; ina bhfuil daoine páirteach ann, é spéisiúil, éagsúil agus an cumas ag an reachtaire an Ghaeilge a mhealladh ó dhuine go nádúrtha.  Tá súil agam go leanfaidh sé linn agus go ndéanfar cláir leanúnacha as abhair an chláir sin.  Ó thaobh an chláir &ldquo;Binneas&rdquo;, is mian liom, chun mo phointe a nochtadh, an leanúnachas a scarúint ón cheol. Cloisim saibhreas Gaeilge agus múnlai cainte ag teacht ó ghuth reachtaire na gclár seo go héasca, rithimiúil.  Is féidir le duine teacht ar úsáid laethiúil na teanga dá bhárr.  Deirtear gur úsáid na réamhfhocal i gceart ceann de na deacrachtaí i labhairt na teanga nó i bhfoghlaim na Gaeilge.  Molaim do dhaoine éisteacht leis agus ansan úsáid a bhaint as na múnlaí cainte atá á núsáid go rialta ag an reachtaire.  Tá súil agam go bhféachfaidh RTE agus Bord na Gaeilge ar an phointe sin agus go dtiocfaidh an dul chun cinn a theastaíonn uainn as.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go gcoimeádfaidh an Bord ina n-aigne na neithe seo agus iad ag smaoineamh ar sheifteanna chun an Ghaeilge a chur faoi bhráid na ndaoine.  Níor luaigh mé ach cuid desna daoine, comhlachtaí agus cumainn atá páirteach san ollghluaiseacht Ghaeilge, ach ba mhian liom mo chomhghairdeas a chur in iúl dóibh as a gcuid oibre agus guím ná laga  a ghéaga os iad géaga an chrainn sin a luaigh mé tamall o shin.</P>
    <P>Tá 20 bliain anois ann ó scríobh Seán Ó hÉigeartaigh a dhán &ldquo;Marbhna taréis Cóisire&rdquo;, in ar luaigh sé Fealsamh.  Ceannaí, File Fionn agus é féin.  Beidh daoine ann ar nós an Fhealsaimh chun iarrachtaí Gaeilge a <Col N="1345" /> lochtú, ar nós an Cheannaí a bhain saibhreas amach, ar nós an Fhile Fhinn a thosnaigh go dúthrachtach ar pháirt a ghlacadh i ngluaiseacht na Gaeilge ach ar ball a chúlaigh aisti, ag rá gur meilt ama é bheith ag gabháil leis, ach bímís ar aon dul leis an údar agus má chuidíonn an bord seo le cóir gaoithe ní chlisfidh orainn.</P>
    <P>Is mian liom traoslú freisin le baill an bhoird <i>ad hoc</i> a bhí ann.  Traoslaím don Aire athuair as ucht a cheaptha: tá fhios agam go neireoidh go geal leis ina chuid oibre agus molaim don daréag ar Bhord na Gaeilge a thiocfaidh as an Bhille seo gach beart a dhéanamh ar son na teanga.  Eistigí, nach mínic a moltar bheith ag gabháil le beart in ionad labhartha.  Bhuel, án tráth seo is í caint atá ag teastáil ó mhuintir na hÉireann chun an beart a ghnóthú.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire as ucht a cheapacháin mar Aire na Gaeltachta.  Ní raibh seans agam é seo a rá go hoifigiúil go dtí seo. Fear as mo chontae féin é, duine a bhí agus atá go dianoibríoch ar son a mhuintir agus é ina Theachta Dála. Toisc go bhfuil sé anois ina Aire na Gaeltachta, tá a fhios aige go rí-mhaith céard atá le déanamh aige ar son na teanga agus ar son a mhuintir féin. Guím rath Dé agus lorg an Aire Airgeadais ar a chuid oibre.</P>
      <P>Caithfidh mé a rá faoi iar-Aire na Gaeltachta, Tómás Ó Domhnaill gur, im thuairim féin, duine é de na daoine is mó a spreag agus a mhúscail meoin agus intinn na ndaoine i leith na Gaeilge le deich mbliana, mar duine é a d'fhoglaim an Ghaeilge don tarna huair agus chuaigh sé imeasc na ndaoine agus dlúthcheangail sé an bhaint idir an teideal Aire na Gaeltachta agus an Ghaeilge mar theanga bheo bhríomhar a choinneáil.  Is é cuspóir an Bhille ná úsáid na Gaeilge a leathnú agus a fhorbairt ar fud na tíre agus aontaím leis an gcuspóir seo. Tá gá de shaghas éigin ag beagnach chuile dhuine in Éirinn leis an teanga agus tuigtear chomh tábhachtach atá sí don tír agus don duine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is é sean teanga tromlach na <Col N="1346" /> ndaoine agus gnáththeanga cuid mhaith díobh faoi láthair.  Tá sí inár measc le fada agus is ann atá ár dtraidisiún agus ár gcultúr le fáil. Muna mbíonn fhios faoi seo ag chuile dhuine agus muna gceapann tromlach na ndaoine atá ag iarraidh aithbheochan na teanga a chur chun cinn agus chun tosaigh go bhféadfar labhairt na teanga a láidriú, tá baol ann go gcaillfear an spiorad íontach atá sa Ghaeilge.  Tá gá le tír mar Éire a teanga féin a bheith aici má tá gá atá níos tábhachtaí ó thaobh na hEorpa de agus ó thaobh muintir na hÉireann mar mhuintir scartha agus mar mhuntir dúinn féin.  Is é sin le rá, tá sé tábhachtach don idirnáisiúnachas Éireannach, mar adéarfa.  Gan teanga dúinn féin ní bheadh an ceangal le Éirinn chomh daingean agus a cheart dó bheith.</P>
    <P>Tá muid páirteach i gcomhar-chumann idirnáisiúnta faoi láthair agus ní féidir a bheith sásta leis seo gan náisiúnachas a bheith againn féin. Tugann eolas na teanga cead do dhuine dul isteach i litríocht na Gaeilge, litríocht atá níos sine ná litríocht aon tír eile san Eoróip ach amháin an Laidin agus an Ghréigis. Cinnte caithfidh an Béarla a bheith ann, ach mar sin féin tá gá leis an nGaeilge freisin.</P>
    <P>Tá níos mó Gaeilge sa tír anois ná mar a bhí le fada anuas ach tá níos mó Béarla sna Gaeltachtaí freisin ná mar a bhí, mar tá daoine ag filleadh abhaile arís ó Shasana agus ó thíortha eile agus tá clann acu siúd nach bhfuil aon Ghaeilge acu ar chor ar bith agus tá a fhios sin ag an Aire mar tá daoine sna Gaeltachtaí nach bhfuil ag fáil na ndeontas tí nua ó Roinn na Gaeltachta mar ní mheastar go bhfuil an caighdeán Gaeilge chomh hárd agus a cheart dó bheith.</P>
    <P>Faoi láthair ta scoileanna ann nach bhfuil iontu ach Gaeilge agus tá scoileanna ann a bhfuil an Ghaeilge agus an Béarla agus tá scoileanna ann freisin nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge ach mar ábhar múinteoireachta.  Níl mé ag dul isteach anseo ró-dhoimhin, mar adéarfá, ach tá mé ag ceapadh go gcaithfidh múinteoirí níos mó béim a leagan ar labhairt na teanga ná ar litríocht na teangan nuair atáimíd ag caint faoi leanaí óga.  Sa curriculum <Col N="1347" /> nua agus sa gcomhrá Gaeilge do na bunscoileanna tá mé ag ceapadh go gcaithfear níos mó béim a chur ar Chéim a 5 atá ansin, an béim a leagan ar gháthteanga agus na leanaí a mhúscailt agus a spreagadh chun gnáthchaint a dhéanamh leis an múinteoir agus leo féin.  Tá mé ag ceapadh go bhfuil an ceart ag an Aire faoin dhrámaíocht mar is ann atá cúis do dhaoine an Ghaeilge a labhairt.</P>
    <P>Thug sé amach cúig nó sé de áiteanna ar fud na tíre agus bhí mé féin i gCaisleán an Bharraigh leis an Aire nuair a d'oscail sé ceann acu siúd agus bhí sé thar barr, Iarraim anois air&mdash; agus tá eolas aige faoi seo&mdash;stuideo na Gaeltachta a chur i gCaisleán an Bharraigh. Ó phrionsabal na hinnealltóireachta tá a fhios agam agus tá a fhios aige go gcaithfidh an microthonn ó Bhaile Átha Cliath go Sligeach dul tré Chaisleán an Bharraigh agus ós rud é go bhfuil Roinn den Rialtas igCaisleán an Bharraigh faoi láthair agus go bhfuil Aerfort ansin d'fhéadfadh daoine dul ó Bhaile Átha Cliath go dtí an áit sin go scioptha.  Ba cheart dó smaoiniú faoin stuideo sin a chur ann agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh sé sin.</P>
    <P>Tá an bord seo cosúil le beagnach chuile bhord eile a tháinig isteach faoi chuile Rialtas agus ní le Fianna Fáil ná le Fine Gael ná le haon pháirtí eile eochair athbheochana na teangan. Caithfidh an tAire&mdash;agus tá a fhios aige ceard atá le déanamh aige níos fearr ná mise&mdash;intinn na ndaoine a mhúscailt chun caint a dhéanamh eatarthu féin tríd a ngnáth obair agus má dheineann sé é sin bíodh sé cinnte go láidróidh an Ghaeilge sna blianta atá le teacht.</P>
    <P>The success or failure of the board to be set up by the Minister will be judged on the level of Irish to be spoken in future years.  Its main function is to encourage the use of spoken Irish and to try to get people to speak Irish where they do not normally do so.  There is probably more Irish spoken in the country now than there has been for many years and yet many people for some reason appear to be afraid to speak it.  Perhaps they are ashamed of the quality <Col N="1348" /> of their Irish.  The board in their recommendations are trying to establish a desire to use more spoken Irish from the point of view not alone of an Irish identity but also of fostering the language.  The board do not seem to have a great deal of authority and I would have thought the Minister could have given them a little more than they have.  I am sure that when he does select the members of that board he will give due consideration to the quality of their Irish.  I do not mean that they should be all fluent speakers of Irish.  It might be a good idea if some of the members did not have very much of it.  They could learn it.</P>
    <P>The Gaelic Athletic Association have been mentioned.  From the Minister's experience, and indeed from mine, Irish is used at quite a number of their meetings and it is encouraging to see that practice extended.  It is also encouraging to note that my county council, of which the Minister was a member up to recently, at a recent meeting agreed that non-contentious issues would be debated in Irish for a start, and that at some future date they might proceed to discuss other items in Irish.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of that.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister the very best in setting up this board and I trust that their success in future years will be evidenced in the increase in the use of spoken Irish throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from the county with the largest Gaeltacht in Ireland, I welcome the Minister's proposals outlined in this Bill.  It provides for a realistic approach to the difficult problem of getting all sections of the community to understand that they have a duty to support measures like this which aim to provide financial and other necessary means to conserve and foster the language.  In recent years the Irish-speaking districts have become increasingly anglicised and the process continues.  Donegal is one county which has remained steadfast in support of Gaelic culture.  This has been a hard battle and success in it depends in great measure on the help forthcoming from Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> The Minister has shown himself deeply committed to the preservation of Irish and this wide-ranging Bill is of special help in this.  Saving the language is closely linked with economic wellbeing for the Gaeltacht, and the native speakers must be provided with jobs in their own localities to keep them at home and enable them to marry and raise families who will also have Irish as a first language. Over the years vast areas in Donegal were neglected and the living standards of the people there reached a pitifully low level, leaving emigration as the only outlet for a huge young population, many of them newly married. The emigration drain also dealt a severe blow to the language because many of those people who were forced to work in foreign lands had to speak English and to pass that language on to their children.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are committed irrevocably to doing everything possible to foster and propagate the Irish language.  I am glad to see the response this Bill is receiving from all sides of the House.  The new measures will play an important part in furthering Irish as a spoken language in this country. There have been many setbacks and disappointments in the past.  This Bill and it is in the vanguard in the revival campaign evokes new hope and confidence in the native speakers.  The amount of Irish spoken all over the country is amazing.  The only thing missing is some inducement to make better use of the language.  The aim of course is to be bilingual and for our own language to take its place alongside English and indeed on many occasions to be given preference. Wonderful work in this direction has been done in the Six Counties.  The summer colleges in Donegal depend to a great extent on support from those Ulster Gaels who were in the van-guard when the first such college was opened at Cloughaneely as far back as 1906.  Children must be inspired to make better use of the Irish language they learn in school and teachers can play a very definite role in stressing the vital place it holds in our Gaelic heritage.</P>
    <P>The measure before the House is another significant step on the road <Col N="1350" /> towards ensuring that the Irish language is not allowed to die.  The Minister is to be congratulated on realistic proposals it contains which are calculated to bring fresh vigour and dedication into ensuring that everyone has a reasonable knowledge of the language.  Any Irishman, or a man for that matter, who leaves this country should have his language a badge of identification.</P>
    <P>I hope that the measures which this Bill proposes to introduce will be step forward in the revival of the Irish language as the spoken tongue future generations in this country.</P>
    <P>It is said that the efforts made towards reviving the language have failed but the reason for the failure must rest with the people because never before have we had a high standard of education.  Young people leaving school or college should have a good knowledge of the language. What appears to be lacking is the will to further that knowledge.  However every encouragement must be given in order to rectify this situation.  I trust that the setting up of this board will lead to all our people appreciating the Irish language to a greater extent and to their realising that a national language is one of its greatest treasures.</P>
    <P>In the Minister we have a man who is sincere and dedicated so far as Irish is concerned.  He has close tie with the constituency I represent.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing in the Bill and I wish both he and the new board well in their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to pay tribute to the original board that were set up with a view to bringing this type of legislation before us as a prelude to Bord na Gaeltachta. That original board was headed by Dr. Whitaker.  It was somewhat ungracious of the Minister not to refer in his opening statement to the work done by those people.  Special credit is due to Sean de Fréine who was that board's chief executive.  He has retired since but he did a great deal of work in regard to the drawing up of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> Having said that I am not sure that the Bill is necessary.  It is not a lot of machinery that is necessary to get the Irish language moving but rather a change in attitude.  What has been lacking in regard to the language for the past 50 or 60 years is goodwill on the part of the people.  As a race we are well enough educated to be able to speak Irish fluently.  Any of us who has been through secondary school and obtained the leaving certificate should be well able to speak the language.  Unfortunately this is not so. Consequently, anything that the new board can do to motivate the people to speak Irish will be worth doing.</P>
    <P>The abolition of compulsory Irish for the leaving certificate has had a stimulating effect on the language. Because of that element of compulsion many people who were capable of speaking the Irish language were reluctant to speak it.  The change made by the former Minister, Mr. Burke, has had the desired effect because there has been a marked improvement in the attitude of the people generally to the language in the past four years.  Consequently, the new board will have a sound ground on which to build for the future.</P>
    <P>From statistics that are available it appears that only about 3 per cent of the population can be said to speak Irish in the normal course of their daily work.  I am sure that with the right will that figure could be increased to 50 per cent at least.  I trust that the Minister and the board will maintain the stimulus that is there already.  One welcomes the choosing initially of six areas as pilot areas.  Much of the credit for this idea must go to the former Minister, Deputy O'Donnell.  About 18 months ago he formulated one of these courses in the Lismore area.  Deputy O'Donnell generated an enthusiasm of a kind never known before in relation to his Ministry.  I trust that this Minister will keep up the good work.</P>
    <P>The Welsh people could teach us a lesson so far as their language is concerned because they did not have behind them the institutions of State as is the situation here.  We have the financial incentives, too.  It is said that in the 19th century the English tried <Col N="1352" /> to beat the Irish language out of us but it can be said also that in the 20th century some of our own people tried to beat the language back into us. That method failed abysmally.  The softly, softly attitude of recent years is proving much more successful.  There is now much more inclination on the part of young people to speak the language after they leave school.</P>
    <P>Although our language is an extremely important element if we are to have a national identity, it is not everything.  We must have regard too, to such other forms of culture as our traditional music and dancing.  We hear talk often of the different cultural heritages in this island.  If we go back some centuries we find that the differences are not great.  Scottish culture, for instance, is not very different from ours and I suppose that a couple of thousand years ago it was identical with ours.  There is much in the cultural heritage of the majority in Northern Ireland that is similar to ours.  Consequently, we should endeavour to find a common base for our common cultural heritage on which to work for the future. Traditional dancing, for instance, in both Scotland and Northern Ireland is similar to our traditional dancing. Our musical instruments are not very different from theirs either although I suppose there is a difference between a Lambeg drum and the type of drum that we would find in a traditional music band down here.</P>
    <P>I was sent by my party on three successive occasions to campaign for by-elections in Gaeltacht areas although I am not able to speak the language fluently.  That was bad management on somebody's part. May be it was that sort of management that led in some way to our losing the general election.  On the last occasion Deputy Kenny and I were sent to a Gaeltacht area in County Donegal.  I was surprised to find that the local Protestant community were fluent Irish speakers.  Their culture was our culture.  That might be a help to the Minister in a new campaign to bind the two cultures, North and South, where there seemed to be irreconcilable differences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> This question of national identity is extremely important.  If we do not have a national identity we are merely a pack of zombies in that section of the rat race known as the English speaking section, be it America, Canada, Australia or Britain.  We should retain our national culture at all costs.  Last week, when I visited the Russian Embassy for a reception at the invitation of the Ambassador, I was very interested to learn that in Russia, although it is one great union, all the individual States speak their own language with Russian as the second language.  The member of the staff to whom I was speaking was a Lithuanian.  The people of Lithuania speak Lithuanian as their first language and Russian as their second.  The same applies to Latvia and Estonia.  I was reading in <i>The Irish Times</i> a few day later that there were mass demonstrations in Georgia because their own language was to be superseded by Russian as the first language of that state.  As a result of the demonstrations the decision was reversed.  No matter how large these conglomerates are, the individual states retain their identity.</P>
    <P>That is what we should be doing. I doubt if we can get Irish as a living language because we are too exposed to influences from English speaking countries.  It is a nice aim, but it will not come unless the will is there.  Even if we do not have Irish as a living language it could live forever as a cultural subject.  It could be said that we should be directing our energies to speaking and teaching French or German in our schools.  There is a lot to be said for that because they are the utilitarian languages of the future. But we should not forget the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note that a number of Deputies have started night courses in Irish.  I read in the papers lately that a number of them rush to attend these refresher courses when the business of the House is finished.  It has been suggested that Irish language courses might be organised in this House to enable Members who do not have very much time at their disposal to avail of the opportunity to brush up their <Col N="1354" /> Irish.  Perhaps the Minister would look into that.  Deputies attending courses in this city are from the city.  City Deputies do not have to work as hard as rural Deputies and we do not have the same amount of free time.  We cannot attend courses because we have other things to do when the Dáil adjourns.</P>
    <P>This time two years ago Members were chasing out of the Dáil to do refresher courses in French, because they had their eyes on the European Parliament.  Unfortunately for some of them they did not get back in the last election, so that was a waste of time.  But they might have benefited to some degree.  Deputy Kenny knows more about that than I do because somebody in his own area was involved.</P>

      <P>Getting rid of the compulsory aspect of the Irish language has done wonders for the promotion of the Irish language, as I said.  However, I object to the Irish language being used as a qualification for jobs where it is not necessary. I cannot understand why a veterinary surgeon or a dentist must have a qualification in Irish before he is fully qualified.  This is a ridiculous type of qualification.  I will give a very graphic illustration of how unnecessary that type of qualification is and how it can be done without.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By profession I am a secondary teacher and should have passed an oral Irish examination to be fully registered as a secondary teacher. This can be a severe examination. The year I was to do that examination there was an industrial dispute involving the secondary teachers and the Department which resulted in secondary teachers refusing to superintend the intermediate or leaving certificate examinations or mark the papers.  As a result everything was thrown overboard in the Department. All the inspectors' time was taken up organising the supervision of the examinations and marking the papers. As I said, I was due to be examined in oral Irish.  I got a letter from the <Col N="1355" /> Department saying I had been registered and that my oral Irish examination had been forgotten about.  That might sound too ridiculous for words, but as a registered secondary teacher I am qualified to teach the Irish language to leaving certificate honours level.  That shows how farcical a qualification in oral Irish can be.</P>
    <P>To insist on such a qualification for veterinary surgeons or dentists is too stupid for words.  For a foreign expert who wants to teach a skill which has nothing to do with the Irish language to have to do an aptitude test in Irish is stupid and should be eliminated, because it causes resentment.  Last year a principal was appointed at the NIHE who came from Britain who had all the qualifications.  He resigned his job in Britain, came here and took up his post but was told he could not be retained because he did not have a knowledge of the Irish language, although that had nothing to do with the post.  I would ask the Minister to get rid of that irritating requirement which serves no purpose.  That would be a natural follow through to what I have spoken about already, that is, getting rid of the compulsory aspect of Irish in the leaving and intermediate certificate examinations.</P>
    <P>Another irritant with regard to the propagation of the Irish language is the fact that too many people from the Gaeltacht and people who are fluent Irish speakers are snobs as regards the language.  They are perfectionists. If you try to speak Irish and make a mistake or your grammar is not perfect they are insulted and let you know what they think of you.  That puts off a number of people who have a knowledge of Irish and would gladly speak it but are afraid to do so for fear of suffering this type of embarrassment. Snobbery is a form of stupidity. This type of attitude can do a lot of damage.  Fluent speakers should be more tolerant of how people speak Irish.  The more fluent they are the more tolerant they should be of those who cannot speak it.  We are not all linguists.  We are not all able to speak four, five or six languages at the drop of a hat.  Most of us find grammar a <Col N="1356" /> great obstacle to any language.  I imagine most people find grammar extremely difficult to manage.</P>
    <P>It might be an idea if the Minister were to see that the new board included some people who were not perfect in speaking Irish.  They could be people who have only a few words of Irish but who have ambitions to speak it.  It would be a good idea to have one or two people who saw the other side of the story, people who were not perfect Irish speakers.</P>
    <P>This debate might be labelled &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo; because English and Irish has been spoken in it.  I am afraid I am not bilingual and will speak only in English but I hope my points have been made clearly.  It is a good idea to have Irish programmes on television but it is an irritant to put on purely Irish programmes at peak hours.  When RTE 2 comes into existence I hope that what I call heavy Irish programmes, where the quality of the Irish is excellent but which is difficult for the man-in-the-street to follow, will be put on that station.  Many people share my irritation when purely Irish programmes are screened at 8.30 p.m. or 9 p.m. and which cannot be understood by non-Irish speakers.  All of us enjoy programmes such as &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo; and &ldquo;Amuigh Faoin Spéir&rdquo;.  These are easy to understand because the directors and those in charge of the programmes make sure that they can be understood by people who have little or no knowledge of Irish.  The programmes that are 100 per cent Irish should not be screened at peak periods but should be transmitted at other times.  When RTE 2 is established they should be screened on that channel so that people may have an alternative programme to view.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider some of the points I have raised.  I think he should pay tribute to people who were involved in the initial stages of setting up the board.  Credit should be given where it is due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an mBille seo. Seo an chéad seans a fuair mé fáilte a chur roimh an Aire mar Aire sa Teach.  Ba mhaith liom go néireodh <Col N="1357" /> leis mar Aire.  Táim cinnte go ndéanfaidh sé a dhícheall ar son na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge.  Ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire thar ceann Dáil Cheantar na Mí as ucht an iarrachta atá déanta aige Bord na Gaeilge a chur ar bun go reachtúil.  Ba mhaith an rud é dá mbeadh mo cheantar féin roghnaithe i leith scéime forbartha.  Tá argóint láidir in a thaobh sin nuair a fheictear chomh gar agus atá Gaeltachta na Mí do phríomh chathair na hÉireann.</P>
      <P>In County Meath we have some very well known active Gaeltachts.  Perhaps the two best known areas are Ráth Chairn and Baile Gibb.  There is another small area that could do with some of the assistance given to those districts, namely, Allenstown, where Irish is spoken.  In this instance a little incentive would be of considerable help.  Areas such as Ráth Chairn and Baile Gibb are getting along quite well but they must receive every assistance from the Department to ensure that the Irish language is preserved. These Gaeltachts were established many years ago to foster the language. At that time the language was dying but I am pleased to say that the project was a success and the language was preserved.</P>
      <P>Those Gaeltachts were established near the capital city.  This is important because it means that people from Dublin who are interested in the Irish language can visit the areas in the evenings or at weekends.  They can become familiar with Irish drama, singing and dancing and all the other aspects of Irish culture normally associated with the western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to some matters that I consider relevant.  It is probably true that in the long term the abolition of compulsory Irish will have a beneficial effect.  Nowadays it is becoming fashionable to speak Irish.  In my trips throughout Europe I often envied the people of other countries who could speak their own language. Our language survived centuries of suppression and oppression.  Now it is up to us to preserve our language.  We will be considered a very shallow people if we do not preserve it for <Col N="1358" /> those who come after us.  While it may be fashionable nowadays to speak Irish, some years ago in parts of the country people scoffed at an Irish speaker.</P>
    <P>Many of our road signs do not have the Irish name of the town or village. Few people realise that there is a provision in the Road Traffic Acts that names of places should be in English and Irish on our road signs.  I pointed this out at a meeting of Meath County Council.  Some road signs in my county are in English only and this is against the law.  It is just as easy to give the Irish name as well as the English.  This will ensure that our young people know the Irish place names.</P>
    <P>I agree with other speakers who said that too often the perfectionist Gaelic speaker, whom Deputy Deasy called &ldquo;Gaelic stars&rdquo;, look down their noses at those of us who cannot speak it as fluently as we should. Mar a deireann an Bille seo tá an Ghaeilge ag na daoine ach níl an cleachtadh acu.  Dá mbeadh an cleachtadh ag na daoine bheadh an Ghaeilge níos fearr acu.  Sin an scéal.  We do not always use the best grammar when we are speaking English.  In this House we do not hear very good grammar when English is spoken so why should some people look down their noses at others who speak Irish, perhaps not using very good grammar.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, because of the success of the Meath Gaeltacht areas, to consider appointing some person from one of those areas as a member of the board.  Those areas are doing a lot of good for the preservation of the Irish language and culture.  I believe those areas will in the end achieve the goal they were set up to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire na Gaeltachta (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh le chuile dhuine a labhair ar an mBille.  Is cuma ar labhair siad as Gaeilge nó i mBéarla, tháinig siad isteach sa Teach agus thug siad a dtuairimí anseo faoi dul chun chinn na teanga.  Sa díospóireacht féin labhair Teachtaí, b'fhéidir, ar rudaí nár bhain leis an <Col N="1359" /> mBille féin&mdash;thug an Ceann Comhairle cead dóibh leathnú amach&mdash;agus b'fhéidir nach ndeárna sé aon dochar. Glacaim buíochas mar gheall ar an bhfreastal ón dá pháirtí ar an taobh eile a thug isteach daoine a raibh smaointe maithe acu faoi athbheochan na Gaeilge agus faoin mBille féin.</P>
      <P>Dúirt an Teachta Begley go mb'fhéidir go mba cheart do na comhlachtaí stáit teacht isteach i gcuideachta le Bord na Gaeilge.  Ní fheicimse cén chúis atá leis an argóint sin.  An obair a bhéas le déanamh ag Bord na Gaeilge is mór an bhaint a bheidh aige leis an Ghaeltacht féin.  Luaigh sé na coláistí ullmhúcháin, agus gur mór an trua é go ndeárnadh dearmad orthu. Caithfidh mé admháil go mbeadh caighdeán na Gaeilge sna coláistí ann ullmhúcháin níos láidre agus níos fearr anois dá mbeadh na coláistí ann fós, ach tháinig tuairimí ó dhaoine ag iarraidh a chur ina luí orainn nach raibh cothrom na féinne dá thabhairt maidir leis an gcaoi a raibh múinteoirí náisiúnta ag teacht amach uathu agus nach raibh deis á fháil acu dul isteach ar mhúinteoireacht.  Tagaim leis an Teachta Begley leath-bhealaigh ansin.</P>
      <P>Rinneadh tagairt don laghdú atá dá dhéanamh ó 18 go dtí 12 i mbaill an bhoird, agus bhí an Teachta ag chur inár leith gur cúrsaí polaitíochta a bhí i gceist anseo.  Dá mba chúrsaí polaitíochta a bhí ann bheimís ag ardú an méid comhaltaí in ionad dá laghdú.  Mar tá fhios ag an Teachta Begley é fhéin, is iomaí uair a bhíonn ar Aire bord mar seo a bhunú agus b'fhearr liom féin gan aon cheist pholaitíochta a bheith ann.  Sílim féin gur fearr i bhfad bord mar seo a bheith againn ná bord mór leathan mar a bhí againn cheana.</P>
      <P>Dúirt cúpla duine go raibh mé ag caitheamh droch-mheas ar bhaill an bhoird a bunaíodh.  Ba mhaith liom é sin a shéanadh agus a rá arís anseo sa Dáil, más gá é, go bhfuil anmoladh tuillte acu agus go n-aontaím le go leor den obair atá déanta acu ó bunaíodh iad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labhraíonn an Teachta Begley chomh maith faoi ráiteas i dtaobh duine a bhí ainmnithe mar chathaoirleach don <Col N="1360" /> mbord úd agus go raibh mise ar cheann dá chuid clár cúig uaire.  Bhí mé, chomh fada agus is cuimhin liom, trí huaire ar a chuid clár agus ceann amháin acu go hoifigiúil.  Bhí mé ansin mar dhuine de lucht éisteachta ar dhá chlár, an chéad cheann i nGaoth Dobhair nuair a bhí Oireachtas Ulaidh ar bun agus nuair a bhí an clár seo ar siúl i gcaitheamh na seachtaine sin.  An ceann eile, thíos i gCill Dara, bhí me ansin mar dhuine den lucht éisteachta chomh maith, agus an uair dheiridh bhí mé ar an gclár, iarradh orm bheith i láthair le labhairt ar phainéal a bhí ann an oíche sin.  Ní mé an t-aon polaiticeoir amháin a tháinig isteach mar sin; sílim go raibh siad ó gach aon taobh den Teach. Mar gheall ar chathaoirleach a thoghadh, níl duine tofa go fóill, agus tá mé cinnte nach mbeidh tionchar ar bith ag cúrsaí mar sin ar cibé duine a thoghfar mar chathaoirleach.</P>
    <P>Os ag caint atáimid air, tá an clár sin, &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo;, molta ag 'chuile dhuine a labhair anseo ar an mBille.  Sílim gur clár taitneamhach é, go bhfuil an-spéis ann agus gur cláir dá leithéid sin is mó a chabhróidh leis an nGaeilge, meascán de cheol, amhránaíocht, rince agus Gaeilge.  Tá an cultúr ar fad ansin ar an chlár amháin agus sin an chaoi is fearr a dtaithníonn sé le muintir na hÉireann.  Labhair an Teachta Deasy faoi chláracha ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar fad iontu agus gur cuirtear ar siúl iad nuair a bhíonn deis ag go leor daoine éisteacht leo san oíche agus nach n-aontaíonn sé le na leithéidí sa chás seo.  Ní féidir liom teacht leis an Teachta Deasy ar fad san méid sin. Chun an fhírinne a rá, ní bhíonn ach dhá chlár Ghaeilge againn ar theilifís nó radio agus is cuma liom cén tam a thagann siad ach neart acu a bheith ann; sin an rud a theastaíonn uainn uilig, go bhfeicfimid i bhfad níos mó clár Gaeilge ar an dteilifís agus ar an radio, is cuma cén tam a thagann siad.</P>
    <P>Thagair an Teachta Begley do na cúrsaí samhraidh agus dúirt go raibh gá le leanúnachas maidir leis na cúrsaí sin, is é sin le rá nach raibh buntáiste ar bith do na páistí bheith ag freastal ar chúrsaí samhraidh agus ansin teacht ar ais go dtí a mbailte féin agus gan <Col N="1361" /> deis acu an Ghaeilge a labhairt tré cúrsaí a leanúint.  Thiocfainn leis sa méid sin, agus tá sé sin tugtha faoi deara ag cuid des na daoine atá i mbun na gcúrsaí, muintir pharóiste an Teachta féin, muintir Dhún Chaoin, ag an comharchumann ansin, agus ar a laghad ag scoil amháin eile nó dream amháin eile ag a mbíonn cúrsaí samhraidh acu.  Tá nós acu na páistí a thabhairt le chéile ar a laghad uair amháin sa bhliain anseo sa chathair, agus ar an gcaoi sin an spiorad a chothaíodh sna Gaeltachtaí nuair a bhí na cúrsaí ar siúl a neartú agus a choinneáil beo.</P>
    <P>Bhi an-áthas orm féin go raibh mé in ann bheith i láthair i mBaile Átha Cliath ag teacht le chéile agus shiúl mé isteach go Teach an Ard-Mhéara.  Ní raibh fhios acu cérbh é mé féin, cén áit as a tháinig mé nó cén bhaint a bhí agam leis an rud, ach Gaeilge ar fad a chuala mé ó na páistí agus caithfidh mé a rá gur thug sé sin an-sásamh dom, ach tá géar-ghá le tuille de sin. Tá gá le feicéail go bhfhaigheann na páistí a ghnóthaíonn an buntáiste bheith ag freastal ar chúrsaí Gaeltachta, teacht le chéile arís, is cuma cén áit den tír ina bhfuil siad, Baile Átha Cliath nó Corcaigh nó cibé áit a mbíonn siad.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta Siamsa Tíre agus an obair atá ar siúl ag an mbuíon sin. Tá creidiúint mhór ag dul don bhuíon sin agus tá aitheantas á fháil acu ó Roinn na Gaeltachta i ngeall ar an obair sin.  Tá deontais fhiala dá dtabhairt agus beimid ag leanúint leis na deontais sin, le cúnamh Dé, le cuidiú leo sna hiarrachtaí atá ar siúl acu.  Tuigim go mbeidh ceann-áras á oscailt acu i dTrá Lí go gairid agus go mbeidh siad in ann an ceol agus an obair atá ar siúl acu a chur os comhair an phobail go rialta agus go mbeidh deis ní amháin ag muintir Thrá Lí, muintir Chiarraí agus na gceantar máguairt a theacht isteach agus éisteacht leo ach go mbeidh an deis sin ag muintir na tíre ar fad.  Arís, tá an teanga, an rince agus an comhrá measctha le chéile agus ní amháin againn féin, muintir na hÉireann, ach ag strainséirí, cuairteoirí ón Eoraip agus chuile áit eile, tá an obair atá ar siúl ag an mbuíon seo le feiceáil. <Col N="1362" /> Feictear dóibh go bhfuil teanga agus cultúr dár gcuid féin againn, agus sílim gur cheart dúinn uilig bheith bródúil as sin agus tá Siamsa ag tabhairt an aitheantais sin dúinn agus molaim chuile dhuine atá páirteach ann.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta céanna téacs leabhair agus arís níl cúrsaí sásúil maidir le sin agus, go mór mhór ó tháinig an clár nua isteach sna bun-scoileanna, tá easpa téacs leabhair ann.  Is doiligh a rá cé ar a bhfuil an locht.  Ní ceal airgid é ó thaobh Roinn na Gaeltachta nó an Roinn Oideachais. Tá sé deacair daoine a fháil atá sásta teacht ar aghaidh agus aistriúcháin a dhéanamh.  Sin an áit is mó a fheic-imse sna deacrachtaí.  Cinnte tá gá le dul chun cinn níos fearr a dhéanamh maidir le téacs leabhair a chur ar fáil go mór mhór sna meánscoileanna.  Tá cuid de na comharchumainn ag tabhairt faoi agus tá mórán molta ag dul dóibh i ngeall ar an iarracht atá a dhéanamh acu, ach ní mór i bhfad níos mó dul chun cinn a dhéanamh le cuidiú leis na daoine atá ag iarraidh a gcúrsaí a dhéanamh i nGaeilge.  Caithfimid uilig súil a choinneáil ar sin agus féachaint le rudaí a chur chun cinn níos fearr.</P>
    <P>Dúradh chomh maith go mba cheart níos mó Gaeilge bheith anseo sa Dáil agus caithfidh chuile dhuine aontú leis sin.  Níl maith ar bith dúinne bheith ag tabhairt Bhille isteach agus ag rá anois agus arís go poiblí go bhfuilimíd ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn muna bhfuilimid féin sásta an dea-shampla a thabhairt sa Teach seo.  Mar a dúirt Teachta amháin, ní bhaineann an rud seo le páirtí amháin.  Baineann an teanga le chuile dhuine, is cuma cén páirtí politiciúil a mbaineann sé leis, agus, fiú amháin más gá é agus más rud gur cheart dúinn ranganna a chur ar bun&mdash;agus luaigh cúpla duine é sin chomh maith&mdash;sílim gur dheas an rud dá dtigfeadh linn eagar éigin a chur ar rud mar sin agus ranganna Gaeilge a chur ar fáil do na daoine a dteastaíonn uathu an Ghaeilge fhoghlaim sa Teach seo.  Baineann an scéal céanna leis na comhairlí contae agus is maith liom a rá gur ghlac Comhairle Chontae Mhaigh Eó, mo chontae féin, le rún le mí nó mar sin <Col N="1363" /> agus go bhfuil sé socraithe acu oiread agus is féidir den ábhar a dhéanamh tré Ghaeilge feasta.  B'fhéidir ar bhealach gur cheart a rá chomh maith go bhfuil tionchar ag an rud a thárla i gCaisleán an Bharraigh ar sin.  Ó thárla gur roghnaíodh é ag Bord na Gaeilge mar cheann de na háiteacha a mbeifear ag súil go mbeidh dul chun cinn le ceist na Gaeilge nó labhairt na Gaeilge ann, b'fhéidir go raibh baint aige sin leis an moladh a tháinig os comhair an chomhairle chontae agus mura bhfuil ann ach an méid sin is soiléir go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh ag an mbord féin más de bharr gur roghnaíodh Caisleán an Bharraigh a ghlac Comhairle Chontac Mhaigh Eó leis an rún le gairid.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta Begley chomh maith gur ceart dul ar ais chun an sean scéal a bhí ann fadó nuair a bhí Conradh na Gaeilge níos gníomhaí ná mar atá siad anois agus nuair a bhí siad ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a leathnú amach ar fud na tíre.  Ag an am sin bhí timire acu i ngach contae agus b'fhéidir níos mó ná gach Contae, go raibh timirí scaipthe ar fud na gcontaetha uilig a bhí sásta a dhul thart agus an Ghaeilge a mhúineadh. Tá in áiteacha ranganna ar siúl faoi na coistí gairm oideachais agus b'fhéidir arís gur cheart a rá go raibh an obair seo níos bríomhaire tá tamall ó shin ná mar atá anois ach rud ar bith mar sin a chuideodh leis an nGaeilge ba mhór an chabhair é agus sílim arís gur tugadh deontais do Chonradh na Gaeilge timirí a thoghadh &mdash;níl fhios agam go baileach cé mhéid bliain ó shin, b'fhéidir dhá bhliain déag nó cúig bliana déag ó shin&mdash;agus gur thogh siad timirí ag an am leis an obair seo a dhéanamh.  Arís níl mé cinnte an bhfuil sé sin ar siúl i gcónaí ach is maith an smaoineamh é.</P>
    <P>Rud amháin atá socruithe ag Bord na Gaeilge go bhfuil siad sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt do Chumann Lúith-Chleas Gael i scéim atá dá reachtáil acu i láthair na huaire, sé sin go mbeidh oifigeach amháin de chuid an chomhairle chontae nó an coiste contae de Chumann Lúith-Chleas Gael agus go mbeidh sé feasta mar obair aige <Col N="1364" /> agus mar chuspóir aige cloí le ceist na Gaeilge amháin ina chontae féin agus go mbeidh sé ag dul thart chuig na fo-choistí nó na cumainn le cuidiú leo le níos mó úsáid a bhaint as Ghaeilge i ngnáthchúrsaí an chumainn. Séard atá i gceist ag Cumann Lúith-Chleas Gael anseo ná go mbeadh costais taistil le fáil ag na daoine seo. Níl aon rud eile i gceist.  Níl aon phá i gceist ach amháin go mbeadh na costais taistil le fáil acu.  Sílim gur rud an-mhaith é a fheiceáil go bhfuil Cumann Lúith-Chleas Gael, a bhí i gcónaí go tréan ar thaobh na Gaeilge, ag gníomhú iad féin níos láidre anois leis an teanga a leathnú amach agus is maith liom gur shocruigh Bord na Gaeilge tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh don iarracht sin.  Is cinnte go mbainfimid tairbhe as agus go bhfeicfimíd dul ar aghaidh níos fearr dhá dhéanamh i gcúrsaí Gaeilge dá bharr sin.</P>
    <P>Thagair an Teachta Begley chomh maith do cheapacháin do na Gaeltachtatí, gur cheart go mbeadh an Ghaeilge ar a ndeis ag daoine a bheadh ag obair sna Gaeltachtaí.  Ní thioc-fadh le duine ar bith dul ina aghaidh sin.  Tá sé riachtanach go mbeadh an Ghaeilge ag daoine a bhíonn ag freastal ar na Gaeltachtaí agus tá sé sin ann i gcónaí, giúistisí agus a leithéidí sin, ach tá faitíos orm gur beag giúistí a bheimid in ann a cheapadh ar feadh scaithimh de bharr rud a rinne a pháirtí féin.  Ach daoine dá leithéid a bhéas sna Gaeltachtaí ba cheart go mbeadh siad in ann freastail ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus go mbeadh an Ghaeilge go láidir acu agus nach mbeadh d'iachall ar dhuine ar bith sa Ghaeltacht, má tá sé ag dul os comhair na cúirte ná rud ar bith mar sin, fianaise a thabhairt i mBéarla.  Is í an Ghaeilge an chéad teanga atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus níor cheart go mbeadh bac ar bith orthu i labhairt na teanga sin.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Horgan tagairt don Bille agus don aistriúchán.  Tá an Bille féin ar fad i nGaeilge agus cuireadh an t-aistriúchán ar fáil le cuidiú le daoine nach raibh an Ghaeilge ar a dtoil acu.  Nílimid ag iarraidh bheith ag cur brú ar dhuine ar bith, ach shíleamar ó thárla gur <Col N="1365" /> Bille faoi scaipeadh na Gaeilge agus dul chun cinn na Gaeilge a bhí ann gur mhaith an rud é a thabhairt isteach i nGaeilge, agus is maith liom nár chuir duine ar bith ina aghaidh sin.  Maidir leis an leagan Béarla, tá aistriúchán ann le cuidiú le daoine agus ní shílim go dtiocfadh le duine ar bith aon locht a fháil air.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Horgan faoin mbord féin agus neamhspleáchas an bhoird.  Beidh níos mó neamhspleáchais ag an mbord ná mar a bhí ag an mbord go dtí seo sa mhéid go mbeidh cead acu an fhoireann a thoghadh iad féin.  Ní bheidh bac ar bith orthu ar an gcaoi sin.  Ní bheidh siad ag dul os comhair Coimisinéirí na Státseirbhíse agus beidh siad saor ar an gcaoi sin daoine a thoghadh a shílfidh siad bheith in ann obair an bhoird a chur ar aghaidh go sásúil.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé sin níos fearr ná mar a bhí sé go dtí seo.  Sílim go bhfuil rialacha ag baint le na Coimisinéirí ag toghadh daoine agus go bhfuil sé fadálach agus, le bheith fírinneach, gur chuir sé sin isteach ar obair an bhoird go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta O'Donnell&mdash; thug mé freagra air sin&mdash;an ráiteas maidir le buíochas a thabhairt don bhord agus níl aon chall orm é a lua arís.  Dúirt sé gur cheart go mbeadh muintir na Gaeltachta ainmnithe mar bhaill an bhoird ach a fhad is cuimhin liomsa nuair a bhí sé féin ag togadh ocht nduine déag níor cuireadh duine ar bith ón nGaeltacht ar an mbord sin.  Cuireadh fear amháin gur ó bhunadh na Gaeltachta é ach níor h-ainmníodh go díreach ón nGaeltacht é agus ba olc an mhaise dó bheith ag teacht anseo ag iarraidh muintir na Gaeltachta a mholadh domsa nuair nach ndearna sé iad a cheapadh é féin.</P>
    <P>Luaigh sé na Breac-Ghaeltachtaí agus an tábhacht atá ag baint leo agus luaigh sé mo choláiste féin agus gur cheart don choláiste a bheith uilig sa Ghaeltacht.  Bhí sé sa nGaeltacht go dtí 1956 agus gearradh amach tuairim is leath den pharóiste nua sin, sin os cionn dhá bliain agus fiche ó shin.  Tá mé cinnte de bhun gur gearradh amach an méid sin i 1956 <Col N="1366" /> gur ar éigean gur tháinig mórán dul chun cinn ar Ghaeilge san áit sin ó shin, is é sin an chuid a fágadh amuigh, nach mbeadh sé ró-chiallmhar agamsa anois bheith ag iarraidh an chuid sin a thabhairt ar ais tar éis an tamaill fhada sin.  Tá tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis na Breac-Ghaeltachtaí agus beimid ag súil go mbeidh b'fhéidir Bord na Gaeilge ag díriú a n-aghaidhte ar na ceantair sin.  Tá an Ghaeilge beo iontu go fóill.  Tá neart Gaeilge ag na daoine ach níl siad sásta tabhairt faoi labhairt na Gaeilge.  Níl fhios agam cén fáth atá leis.  B'fhéidir an imirce, b'fhéidir ceal fostaíochta san am atá caite, gur thuig siad nach raibh aitheantas ar bith le fáil acu agus dá bharr tháinig laghdú ar labhairt na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Rud amháin a chuireann iontas orm nuair a chuirim na ceantair sin i gcomórtas le ceantair a cuireadh daoine ón nGaeltacht isteach iontu, abraimíd áiteanna cosúil le Rath Chairn agus fiú amháin áiteacha nach bhfuil ina nGaeltachtaí nó nach bhfuil aitheantas le fáil acu mar Ghaeltachtaí. Bhuail mé féin le daoine scaitheamh ó shin a tháinig ó Chonamara tamall ó shin agus atá thíos i gCill Dara, agus cé nach bhfuil ann ach cúpla clann le chéile tá siad sásta an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus a gclann a thógáil le Gaeilge, rud atá á dhéanamh acu go díreach mar dá mbeadh siad i gceart lár na Gaeltachta, agus nuair a fheiceann tú an rud atá ag tarlú sna Breac-Ghaeltachtaí is doiligh a thuiscint tuige nach bhfuil na daoine sin sásta níos mó Gaeilge a labhairt nuair a chuireann tú i gcomparáid iad le daoine cosúil leis na daoine atá luaite agam.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Woods faoi na deacrachtaí a bhí ag páistí scoile maidir leis an ard-teistiméireacht agus dúirt sé go mba cheart níos mó marcanna a thabhairt le haghaidh labhairt na Gaeilge san ard-teistiméireacht féin.  Fuair mise an moladh sin ó dhuine éigin nuair a bhí mé ag taisteal na Gaeltachtaí go mba cheart go mbeadh onóireacha i nGaeilge tughta le haghaidh labhairt na Gaeilge san ard-teistiméireacht.  Sílim gur smaoineamh maith é gur cheart go mbeadh níos mó marcanna le fáil do labhairt na Gaeilge san ard-teistiméireacht <Col N="1367" /> agus go gcuideodh sé le labhairt na Gaeilge sna meánscóileanna.</P>
    <P>Bhí smaointe an-mhaith ag an Teachta O'Keeffe, agus dúirt sé gurb é an rud a bhí i gceist ná muintir na tíre a ghríosadh le níos mó Gaeilge a labhairt.  D'aontóinn ar fad leis.  Sin an chaoi is fearr leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Más féidir linn muintir na tíre a thabhairt linn agus a ghríosadh le Gaeilge a labhairt, sin an rud is mó a chuirfidh an Ghaeilge chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Mhínigh an Teachta Briscoe deacrachtaí Béarlóir, duine nach raibh sé de dheis aige Gaeilge a fhoghlaim nó a labhairt nuair a bhí sé ag dul chun na scoile agus sílim gur cheart dúinn agus gur cheart don bhord cuimhniú ar na daoine sin agus na deacrachtaí atá acu.  Tá sé réidh go leor ag daoine a tógadh le Gaeilge a labhairt ach daoine dá leitheid seo, sin iad na daoine a gcaithfimíd ár n-aghaidh a dhíriú orthu agus a gcaithfidh an bord tabhairt futhu le cuidiú leo ar gach bealach.  Cé nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu tá meas acu ar Ghaeilge agus tá siad ag tógáil a gcuid páistí le Gaeilge.  I ndeireadh na dála, sin an chaoi is fearr a dtig linn an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn, má táimíd sásta í thabhairt don aos óg.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta O'Toole agus ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt don óráid an-mhaith a rinne sé faoi Ghaeilgeoirí atá ag plúchadh na teanga&mdash;na purists mar a thug sé orthu. Thiocfainn leis i chuile rud adúirt sé. Tá go leor dochair déanta ag daoine mar sin agus sílim gur beag áird atá orthu feasta, go bhfuil níos mó aitheantais á thabhairt anois do dhaoine atá ag iarraidh beagán a dhéanamh agus atá sásta le cúpla focal a labhairt is cuma an droch-Ghaeilge atá acu nó cén sórt Gaeilge atá acu.</P>
    <P>Luaigh sé na scéimeanna a cuireadh ar bun go dtí seo sna Gaeltachtaí maidir le cuidiú le muintir na Gael-tachta. Ní raibh mórán measa aige ar na scéimeanna sin agus ní thiocfainn ar fad leis sa mhéid sin.  Sílim nuair a tugadh na scéimeanna sin isteach, deontais bhreise do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, go raibh aitheantas á thabhairt don Ghaeltacht féin, go raibh aitheantas á thabhairt don Ghaeilge; <Col N="1368" /> go raibh rud anseo againn ar cheart dúinn a chaomhnú agus a chosaint agus gurb shin an fáth ar tugadh isteach na deontais sin.  B'fhéidir nár éirigh chomh maith leis na scéimeanna agus ar mhaith linn, ach san am céanna bhí an prionsabal ceart agus sílim gur chuidigh sé cuid mhaith le muintir na Gaeltachta go raibh na scéimeanna sin ann.  Má théann tó chuig na Gaeltachtaí agus na tithe atá acu agus a leithéid sin, feicfidh tú go bhfuil siad níos fearr ná mar atá i gcuid ar bith eile den tír de bharr na scéimeanna sin a bheith ann.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile ann chomh maith, go raibh siad in ann tairbhe níos mó a bhaint as scéimeanna cosúil leis na cúrsaí samhraidh agus as an turasóireacht de bharr tithe chomh maith sin a bheith acu.  Mar sin ní ceart a bheith ag tromaíocht ná ag caitheamh anuas ar Rialtas ar bith de bharr na cabhrach a thug siad do mhuintir na Gaeltachta sna scéimeanna sin.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta Killeen rud a bhí ar siúl aige féin, sé sin, na daoine a bhí ag obair leis san áit a raibh sé ag obair sul ar tháinig sé isteach anseo mar Theachta, gur ghríosaigh sé iad Gaeilge a labhairt chuile lá, agus gur íhág siad amach am faoi leith chuile lá le Gaeilge a labhairt.  Sílim go bhfuil an-thairbhe i scéim dá leithéid, gurb é sin an chaoi is fearr le Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Is cuma i monarchain, siopaí nó áit ar bith eile ina mbíonn daoine ag obair, má éiríonn linn iad a chur ag caint Gaeilge ar feadh scaitheamh an lá, tá éacht mór déanta ag duine ar bith a bhfuil sé ina chumas rud mar sin a dhéanamh. Treoraithe i measc an phobail sea daoine atá in ann rud mar sin a dhéanamh, agus beidh níos mó buntáiste ó rud mar sin ná a bheith ag dul chuig ranganna Gaeilge nó obair ar bith eile.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta White gur thuig sé go raibh sé bliana ró-fhada mar théarma ag ball don bhoird.  Ceart go leor tá sé fada agus b'fhéidir gur rud é sin go gcaithimid súil a caitheamh air.  Níl aon argóint agam leis ar an bpointe sin.  Luaigh sé chomh maith gur cheart rosc catha nó slogan de chineál éigin a bheith againn chun cúrsaí na teanga a chur ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> Bhí mé féin i Sligeach cúpla mí ó shin agus bhí buíon ansin agus sé an rose catha a bhí acu ná: &ldquo;Gaeilge má's féidir, Béarla más gá&rdquo;.  Arís sílim go bhfuil ciall i rosc catha den chineál sin agus go bhféadfaimid tuilleadh dóibh a fheiceáil.</P>
    <P>Bhí an Teachta Andrews ag cur síos ar Bhaill an Oireachtais, nach ceart go mbéadh sé de bhac ar dhaoine atá san Oireachtas a bheith in a mbaill den bhord.  Sin nós atá ann maidir leis na boird ar fad agus sílim gur fearr cloí leis sin.  Bheadh sé an dheacair an pholaitíocht a choinneáil amach as bord ina mbeadh Teachtaí agus Seanadóirí ina mbaill.  Táim sásta leis mar atá sé&mdash;ba mhaith liom an tOireachtas a fhágáil amach maidir le ballraíocht an bhoird.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha agus mar gheall ar chostas thais-tail, sílim gur ceart chuile cuidiú a thabhairt do dhaoine a bhfuil a gcuid páistí ag freastal ar na scoileanna seo, nár ceart bac ar bith a chur orthu maidir le taisteal nó rud ar bith eile.  Is maith liom fheiceáil go bhfuil na scoileanna seo ag leathnú amach ar fud na tíre agus is breá fheiceáil chomh maith nach le brú ó Rialtas nó ó eagras ar bith eile atá sé ag teacht ach ó na daoine iad fhéin.  Nuair a fheicimid an cineál sin sprid tugann sé misneach dúinn uile, agus tá mé ag súil go mbeidh tuilleadh de na scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha le feiceáil thart ar fud na tíre amach anseo.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Mitchell faoin dul chun cinn atá dá dhéanamh ina Dháil cheantar féin ag na scoileanna sin.  Táim cinnte gur cuidiú dóibh agus do dhaoine eile mar oifigí poiblí agus Teachtaí Dála an sprid sin a fheiceáil &mdash;go dtugann sé misneach dóibh i dtaobh na Gaeilge fhéin.</P>
    <P>Bhí an Teachta Kelly imníoch i dtaobh chuile short agus dúirt sé nach raibh dul chun cinn ar bith déanta againn agus go mb'fhéidir gur fearr dúinn bheith ag caitheamh ár gcuid ama ag múineadh Fraincíse agus a leithéid ins na scoileanna in áit bheith ag cloí le Gaeilge.  Is maith liom fheiceáil nach raibh mórán de na Teachtaí eile ag smaoineamh ar an <Col N="1370" /> gcaoi sin.  B'fhéidir gur fearr ligint don méid a dúirt sé.</P>
    <P>, nílimid sásta leis an dul chun cinn atá déanta maidir le labhairt na Gaeilge, agus is de bharr sin atáimid ag féachaint anois le cúrsaí a chur chun tosaigh níos fearr.  Ní féidir le duine ar bith a rá nach raibh iarracht déanta.  Muna raibh toradh air níor cheart dúinn bheith ag caitheamh anuas ar dhaoine a rinne iarracht.  Is cuma cé hiad, múinteoirí, Airí nó cé hiad féin, bhí bá i gcónaí ag gach Rialtas a bhí i gcumhacht don Ghaeilge agus tá cuid mhaith caite le cúrsaí na teanga a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Kelly caint ar thaighde.  Is de bharr caspa thaighde nach raibh an toradh ar a gcuid oibre go dtí seo, agus is de bharr taighde a moladh go gcuirfí Bord na Gaeilge ar bun.  Ní shílim go raibh duine ar bith ag iarraidh dallamullóg a chur ar dhuine ar bith.  Sin é an fáth go bhfuil an bord againn anois.  Beimid ag súil le toradh níos fearr ó obair an Rialtais agus na Rannóga Stáit atá ag plé le dul chun cinn na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá cuid mhór den méid a dúirt na Teachtaí eile luaite agam cheana agus ní chaithfidh mé níos mó ama chun freagraí a thabhairt orthu.  Ba mhaith liom arís a rá nach bhfuil mé sásta le cúrsaí maidir leis an Ghaeilge fhéin ach nach bhfuil sé fíor a rá go bhfuil teipthe orainn ar fad.  Bhí 789,000 duine a dúirt go raibh Gaeilge acu sa bhliain 1971 agus de réir na tuarascála ar Thaighde um Dearcadh an Phobail i dtaobh an Gaeilge, foilsithe i Mí Eanáir, 1976, is cosúil go bhfuil labhairt na Gaeilge go measartha, ar a laghadh, ag tuairim 30 faoin gcéad den den phobal, agus tá 9 faoin gcéad den phobal a bhfuil ar a gcumas an Ghaeilge a labhairt go maith.  Má théann an 40 faoin gcéad sin i mbun na h-oibre i gceart, ba cheart go mbeadh cúrsaí i bhfad níos fearr i gceann deich mbliain eile.</P>
    <P>Sin é an rud atá le déanamh againn ar fad&mdash;na daoine sin a ghríosadh chun obair níos fearr a dhéanamh maidir le labhairt na Gaeilge.  Tá litríocht nua-aoise tagtha chun cinn agus tá líon maith irisí agus tréimhseachán dá foilsiú trí Ghaeilge, cuid acu sa Ghaeltacht fhéin.  Ní thig linn bheith <Col N="1371" /> sásta go bhfuil go leor acu ann.  Ach ar a laghad tá foilseacháin dá chur chun cinn agus beimíd ag súil go mbeidh Amárach ag teacht amach arís agus tá Inniu againn.  Beidh an dá fhoilseacháin sin ag freastal ar dhaoine a bhfuil suim acu san teanga.</P>
    <P>Rud eile a d'fhéadfainn a rá, go bhfuil níos mó daoine ag teacht isteach ar Ghaeilge a labhairt go nádúrtha ina saol féin, ina gcuid oibre. Tá imeachtaí sóisíalta agus cultúrtha ag dul ar aghaidh níos fearr, agus nuair a mheasctar iad sin le chéile sílim gurb shin caoi chun níos mó daoine a ghríosadh le Gaeilge a labhairt.  Aontaím leis na daoine a dúirt go bhfuil níos mó measa ar an Ghaeilge anois ná mar a bhí le fada an lá.  Níl a fhios agam cén fáth atá le sin, ach is cuma.  Feicimid í ag dul chun cinn agus go bhfuil níos mó daoine sásta tabhairt fúithi.  Ní hé sin le rá nach bhfuil cuid mhaith le déanamh againn ar fad, agus beimid ag súil go ndéanfaidh Bord na Gaeilge cúrsaí a chur chun cinn níos fearr.  Ach ní orthu san amháin atá an obair seo.  Tá sé ar chuile dhuine againn, is cuma an Teachta Dála muid, múinteoirí nó cén obair atá ar siúl againn.  Tá Bord na Gaeilge ansin chun an treoir a thabhairt, agus ón méid adúirt na Teachtaí anseo sílim go mbeimid uilig sasta tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh sna cúrsaí atá idir lámha acu.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh le chuile dhuine a thóg páirt san díospóireacht seo.  Bhí sé suimiúil agus tá súil agam go bhfeicfimid de thairbhe na díospóireachta seo níos mó Gaeilge in úsáid anseo feasta.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh agus aontaíodh an cheist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> This Bill will improve the existing laws and should, I hope, reduce the incidence of accidents in industry.  It is an important Bill, therefore, in so far as it may help to reduce the suffering and losses of the victims of industrial accidents as well as helping to reduce the consequential economic costs to the community.</P>
    <P>I have considered the question of the replacement of the Factories Act, 1955, but I have decided that the balance of advantage, at present, lies in the improvement of the existing law.</P>
    <P>The enabling provisions of the 1955 Act have been used to augment the primary law by way of regulations; these have prescribed very detailed safety requirements for some industrial sectors and for some specific materials. In all, 82 regulations have been made which, taken in conjunction with the terms of the Act, result in a comprehensive piece of safety law which is much more up to the minute than the date of the Act, namely, 1955 would suggest.  However, changing technology and added knowledge as to safety practices dictate that some additions and changes to the primary legislation are now needed to help secure the safety, health and welfare of the persons who fall within its ambit.</P>
    <P>This Bill, while it brings in some innovative features, is nevertheless mainly concerned with improvements in existing legislation.  In considering the area generally, I have taken account of developments elsewhere. Our membership of the EEC has brought closer contact with European developments and thinking in this area of safety, health and welfare.  A draft Council resolution on a Community action programme on safety and health at work is being discussed in Brussels by a working party on social questions. Amongst the specific steps the draft council resolution mentions is the incorporation of safety features into the various stages of design, production and operation of plant.  In the Bill I am proposing to place a statutory obligation on suppliers of plant to ensure such plant is provided with all necessary safeguards for its safe operation prior to its being supplied.  This, I hope, will ensure that safety features <Col N="1373" /> will be incorporated at the most effective and economical time, that is, at the design and manufacturing stages.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, been associated with safety matters at international level since joining the ILO.  The ILO has for very many years been concerned with safety, health and welfare of workers and we have ratified 15 conventions in these matters.  In this Bill I am providing that if it is decided to ratify further conventions in these areas we will be enabled to do so without introducing further primary legislation. I am proposing that, with the assent of both Houses, the safety Acts may be amended by order so as to comply with any international obligations relating to safety, health and welfare of workers covered by these Acts which we may decide to assume.</P>
    <P>I now come to the changes in existing law proposed in this Bill.  In general, the Bill retains the essential provision of the 1955 Act which is that the occupier of a particular factory is responsible for the safety of those employed in it.  I think it would be wrong to maintain that the obligation for ensuring safety at work rests solely with occupiers.  Others bear a responsibility too.  I have already mentioned a new feature which this Bill introduces, namely, the placing of an obligation on suppliers of plant to ensure that it has all the necessary safeguards for its safe operation.  But the role the worker himself has to play in his own safety and in that of his colleagues is also of prime importance.  Safety is one area where the interests of employer and worker should coincide.  Workers have an obvious interest in it, and employers have an interest both from the humanitarian and efficiency points of view.  In the National Industrial Safety Organisation this shared interest is evident from the membership of this voluntary body which includes employers, trade unions and insurance companies.  It is, of course, grant-aided by my Department and is essentially concerned with the promotion of safety, working in harmony with the Department's officials.</P>
    <P>A disappointing feature of the 1955 Act in operation has been the limited <Col N="1374" /> extent to which workers have availed of their rights to set up safety committees. At present there are just over 250 safety committees operating in a total of 18,000 premises on the Factories Register.  It is generally agreed that active safety committees tend to reduce preventable accidents and can be a highly effective method of promoting safety at work.  It is evident, however, from the small number of these committees established and the ineffectiveness of some of them that the establishment of safety committees on a voluntary basis has not worked in its present setting. I am introducing accordingly, a radical new approach to this question and I will return to this point later.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, research into many industrial activities has shown up some potentially injurious or unhealthy aspects.  For instance, a great deal more is now known about the effects of excessive noise on health than was the case heretofore.  Much more is also known about the effects of toxic, flammable, corrosive or asphyxiant substances and the Bill will allow me to make regulations in the light of this knowledge.</P>
    <P>I also propose changes in the provisions of the Factories Act in relation to the protection of eyes, not only those of workers immediately engaged on particular processes, but also of those who work in the vicinity of, or who are likely to be affected by, such processes.</P>
    <P>The hazards of fire, especially in relation to modern materials and processes are highlighted occasionally by tragic accidents, and the provisions relating to fire safety, in particular those relating to fire alarms and fire drills, will be improved considerably.</P>
    <P>It sometimes happens also that in the course of their inspections, the inspectors of my Department come across activities the nature of which is such that they involve a risk of serious injury.  Up to now it has been necessary to go through the courts before such activity could be stopped.  Inevitably, the dangerous activity could proceed until the court had decided otherwise.  I now propose to change this position by taking the power to <Col N="1375" /> stop a dangerous activity immediately it comes to notice if it is considered necessary.  My decision can subsequently be challenged in the court. There are other smaller changes which I will detail as I go through the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that while the Bill is essentially an amendment of the Factories Act, 1955, I have decided to change the title to Safety in Industry Bill, which more accurately describes its main objectives.</P>
    <P>As to commencement, it is my intention to bring this Bill into law as soon as possible, but the provisions of section 1, which are normal provisions in legislation, will allow me to introduce different provisions at different times if this should prove desirable.</P>
    <P>I propose a few changes in the interpretations, in particular, defining what is meant by plant and by &ldquo;specified premises&rdquo;, which includes those premises not specifically factories but to which certain provisions of the Acts apply.  I also propose to amend the interpretation of &ldquo;factory&rdquo; to include types of premises not previously covered, for example, premises where cattle or poultry are being killed, for packing or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the power proposed in section 4 of the Bill to amend the Acts by order to comply with international obligations.  I have also included in this section a provision for amending the interpretation of &ldquo;factory&rdquo; in the same way.</P>
    <P>In section 5, I propose taking power, as I have said earlier, to make regulations regarding noise and other pollutants about whose effects on workers' health we have learned a great deal in the last few years.</P>
    <P>Section 6 would make provision similar to that in recent legislation for the serving of documents.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill provides for repeals.  In the case of the proposal to repeal sections 45 (18) and 45 (19) of the 1955 Act, in relation to means of escape in case of fire, I consider it essential that all factories irrespective of size, should have certificates <Col N="1376" /> of escape in case of fire, and in section 22 of the Bill I propose to further amend the provisions of section 45 of the 1955 Act to provide for examining and testing fire warning systems.</P>
    <P>I also consider it unnecessary to distinguish between factories constructed before and after the commencement of section 47 of the 1955 Factories Act with regard to other fire safety provisions and so have provided for repeal of section 47 (3) and of part of 47 (4) of that Act.</P>
    <P>The discriminatory provisions of section 68 of the 1955 Act, which prohibit the employment of female young persons where certain processes are carried on, are no longer desirable or necessary and these I propose to repeal.</P>
    <P>Section 73 of the 1955 Act deals with safety committees, and I propose &mdash;as I have already said&mdash;to replace it by several new sections.</P>
    <P>Section 119 (2) of the 1955 Act which relates to notification of the introduction of mechanical power to a factory, is now unnecessary in view of the small number of factories not now using mechanical power and I propose to repeal it.</P>
    <P>Both sections 26 (2) and 86 (3) of the 1955 Act contain now unnecessary sex-discriminatory provisions relating to males and females respectively which I propose to delete.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill sets out in more detail the general obligation on workers to protect their own and other workers' health.  As I have already mentioned, other people besides occupiers have a responsibility in safety matters and I should point out that, in line with such thinking, it would be an offence under section 100 of the Factories Act, 1955 for any worker not to have reasonable regard for safety in the workplace.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the proposed new provision in section 9 of the Bill regarding duties of those who supply plant for use at work.  This is a new provision in an area that is likely to increase in importance in future years&mdash;a type of user protection&mdash;and I am taking power to make regulations <Col N="1377" /> setting down standards of design and construction of plant where I consider it necessary.</P>
    <P>In section 10 of the Bill I propose to provide that if there is an accident involving plant or machinery I may require an examination of the plant or machine to be carried out and to have a report submitted.</P>
    <P>If I am not satisfied as to the examination or report I propose to take power to have a re-examination or test made of the plant or part of it.</P>
    <P>I have provided in section 11 of the Bill for the serving of prohibition notices in the case of particularly dangerous activities.  It is little consolation to an injured worker to know that an occupier who permits a practice to continue, knowing it to be hazardous, is going to be prosecuted and fined after the damage has been done, so a provision is necessary which enables the shutdown of such an activity while allowing recourse to the courts by both the occupier and the Minister.</P>
    <P>In section 12, I propose to amend slightly the provision in section 37 of the Principal Act relating to safe access and egress, and lowering the height, from ten feet to two metres, at which handholds and footholds must be provided.  Experience has shown that quite serious injury can be incurred by falling from a height of less than ten feet.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is a new provision which would lay a specific duty on occupiers to reduce the level or duration of sound where it might result in injury to the employees and would allow me after consultation with the Minister for Health to make regulations setting limits on such level or duration in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 14 would simply add to section 12 of the Principal Act the requirement that the method of providing the heating in factories should not be likely to constitute a fire hazard, or to result in injurious or offensive fumes being released into the workroom.</P>
    <P>It is important, I think, to ensure that facilities other than those directly <Col N="1378" /> relating to work are provided.  Meal-taking facilities fall into this category and I am setting down in section 15 of the Bill minimum requirements in certain premises where more than ten persons are employed.</P>
    <P>In section 16 of the Bill I have set down improved minimum facilities which should be provided for washing; from now on, these facilities should include either hot and cold water or warm water.</P>
    <P>Section 17 proposes to extend a modified section 32 of the Principal Act to all machines, and includes boilers, steam and air receivers and lifting machines.</P>
    <P>In section 18 I propose to confine section 31 of the Principal Act, relating to cleaning of machinery, to young persons only, rather than to women and young persons as heretofore.  This section would also provide for a safe system of work and for knowledge of that system to be communicated to the person doing the cleaning.</P>
    <P>Damage to eyes is not confined to those directly involved in potentially dangerous processes&mdash;so in section 19 I propose to amend section 60 of the Principal Act to ensure that the eyes of other persons employed and liable to injury will also be protected.</P>
    <P>Similarly in section 20 I propose to amend section 58 of the Principal Act which is designed to protect anyone working on the premises from the harmful effects of dust and fumes. However, this amendment is not enough I feel, and I have also in section 21 of the Bill proposed the amendment of section 38 of the Principal Act which deals with precautions where dangerous fumes are liable to be present.  There will obviously be situations where it will not be possible to remove such fumes and it will be necessary to provide breathing apparatus and suitable harness and ropes.</P>
    <P>I also feel we need to update our fire safety measures; by virtue of section 22 of the Bill I now propose to apply the measures mentioned in section 45 of the Principal Act to any factory; likewise the provisions of <Col N="1379" /> section 47 (2) of that Act, in relation to the construction of doors.  Section 22 of the Bill would also provide that where a sanitary authority, charged with certifying that a factory is provided with the necessary means of escape in case of fire, consider that alterations to the factory are needed before a certificate is given, they shall notify the applicant for such certification and the Minister of what is required, and of the time period in which the work is to be completed.</P>
    <P>Section 23 proposes a modification of section 48 of the Principal Act; in particular it would apply that section to any factory where more than 20 persons are employed.  It would also provide that fire drill be held at fixed intervals and that records of fire drills be attached to the general register.</P>
    <P>Section 24 proposes to extend the following amended sections of the Principal Act to docks, wharves, quays and warehouses: section 32 which relates to training and supervision of persons working at machines and section 45 which relates to means of escape in case of fire and means of fire warnings and section 58 which relates to dust and fumes.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Bill also proposes a modification of section 83 (3) of the 1955 Act by applying the section to all persons working at all machines.</P>
    <P>Section 25 of the Bill proposes an amendment of section 36 of the Principal Act.  It would require that floors, steps and so on, be kept in a non-slippery condition.  It would also require that, three years from the commencement of the section, the safe working load of any suspended floor must be displayed on a notice nearby.</P>
    <P>Section 26 of the Bill is new, in that it provides that working conditions in the workplace will be free from wet and dampness.  There is at present no provision prohibiting leaking roofs and damp walls which, apart from constituting a hazard in relation to electrical equipment, also seriously affect the quality of the surroundings in which work is carried on and are a danger to the health and wellbeing of the workers.  Workers are entitled to <Col N="1380" /> proper conditions in the work place and leaking roofs or damp walls should not have to be tolerated as they are an affront to the dignity of the workers.  We as a society should not condone or tolerate inhuman or substandard working conditions.</P>
    <P>Section 27 requires that fire-fighting equipment, sufficient for fighting initially an outbreak of fire, be provided. This new section would also enable the Minister to make regulations, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, prescribing the type of equipment to be used and providing for regular testing of the equipment; for means of alerting the local fire brigade to be installed and for ensuring that adequate numbers of persons are familiar with its use.  While the main purpose of the Factories Act, 1955, is undoubtedly to ensure the safety of workers and in case of fire to ensure their speedy evacuation, nevertheless, the provision of fire-fighting equipment to deal with an initial outbreak, particularly where highly flammable or explosive materials are used, is considered to be essential&mdash;for instance, it may be necessary just to clear an escape route.</P>
    <P>Section 28 of the Bill is new.  It refers to an asphyxiant, toxic, corrosive or highly flammable substance or one which is a &ldquo;regulated&rdquo; substance, that is, one which is a substance to which the section is applied. The occupier of a premises where such a dangerous substance is present would be required to post a notice to this effect setting out the safety precautions to be taken in using the substance, and the arrangements in case of injury or fire.</P>
    <P>It would also empower the Minister to make safety regulations regarding the use of the substance, and would provide for alarm systems and for investigations for the purpose of assessing the risk of injury, if any, to persons employed.  Section 29 of the Bill proposes an amendment of section 35 of the Principal Act.  It sets out in more detail the testing periods and training and signalling precautions to be taken when using cranes and other lifting machines.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> Section 30 of the Bill proposes to provide that a person who, in making an examination&mdash;required by sections 33, 34 and 35 of the Principal Act&mdash; of hoists, lifts, cranes, lifting machines, chains, ropes and other lifting tackle, finds a need for repairs to ensure its safe use, must notify the occupier and the Minister accordingly.  It would also require the examination and test, by a competent person, of any lift or hoist before it is taken into use.  A certificate of its safe working load would also be required.</P>
    <P>Section 31 of the Bill proposes to amend slightly section 29 of the Principal Act regarding fixed vessels containing liquids or other substances and is designed to ensure that they are sufficiently well protected to prevent any person from falling into them.</P>
    <P>Section 32 of the Bill proposes to amend slightly section 40 of the Principal Act which relates to steam boilers.  It requires that boilers should not be used until the statutorily required examination, due every 14 months, has taken place and would also require that Part II of such examination, when steam in the boiler is raised, will be carried out within three months of Part I of the examination, which is done when the boiler is cold.</P>
    <P>Section 33 of the Bill proposes to amend section 41 of the Principal Act. It would require the examination of any new or previously used steam receiver brought into use in a factory for the first time and the certification of the maximum permissible working pressure.  Where the maximum permissible pressure has been reduced or repairs are required for its safe working, a copy of the report would be required to be sent to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 34 of the Bill is designed to ensure that air receivers are properly tested before being brought into use at a factory and has requirements similar to those in section 33 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 35 of the Bill proposes to amend slightly section 74 of the Principal Act to provide that absence from work and not loss of wages <Col N="1382" /> should be the criterion for notification of an accident.  In the past some accidents may have escaped notification because even though there was absence from work due to the accident there may have been no loss of wages.</P>
    <P>The next part of the Bill relates to safety committees, safety representatives, safety delegates and safety statements.  As Deputies may be aware, the relevant provision in the old Act was not very successful in achieving the appointment of safety committees.  I feel that the time has now come when a more radical approach to raising safety consciousness must be attempted.  For this reason I have provided in the Bill for the appointment by workers of safety representatives where not more than 20 are employed or safety committees in any other case.  Where the workers fail to do so, however, I propose to place an onus on occupiers to appoint the committees or representatives. I would hope that the possibility of the latter happening would act as an incentive to workers to appoint the representatives or committees themselves.  Workers have not in the past shown sufficient interest in these matters and perhaps workers and their organisations may now be encouraged to get involved at shop floor level in the positive aspect of safety.</P>
    <P>In section 36 of the Bill I propose that in premises where not more than 20 workers are employed they may appoint a safety representative, unless a safety committee is in office.  The occupier is to consult with the representative to ensure co-operation in safety, health and welfare matters, as provided by legislation, and is also to consider any representations made to him in those matters.  The safety representative may accompany the inspector on a tour of duty of the premises other than one specifically to investigate an accident.</P>
    <P>Section 37 of the Bill proposes that in a premises where workers are employed they may appoint a safety committee of not less than three or more than ten, but not to exceed more than one for every 20 persons employed. <Col N="1383" /> Existing committees under section 73 of the Principal Act would be deemed to have been appointed under the new provisions even if their numbers exceed the new limits.  The functions of the occupier and committee are similar to those proposed in section 36 of the Bill and the occupier would be entitled to be present or represented at committee meetings. Committees may appoint a safety delegate to make representations on their behalf and to accompany an inspector.  Arrangements for meetings of the safety committee are to be the subject of consultation with the occupier and subject to limitations.  Meetings may be held in normal working hours, without loss of pay.</P>
    <P>In section 38 I propose that if the workers fail after six months to appoint a safety representative or a committee, an obligation is placed on the occupier to make appointments.</P>
    <P>Section 39 of the Bill is new.  It would provide that the Minister may cause an investigation to be carried out by an inspector, if a safety representative or safety committee request it.  The outcome of such investigation may be communicated to the committee, representative or safety officer.</P>
    <P>Section 40 is also new.  It would require an occupier to prepare a statement of the manner in which he proposes to secure the health and safety of persons employed.  It would also provide that the Minister may specify by regulation the matters to be included in the statement.  If a statement is inadequate the revision of such a statement may be required.  It is hoped that the preparation of a safety statement would prompt managements to crystallise their own attitudes towards safety matters, as well as raising safety consciousness amongst employees.</P>
    <P>By section 41 of the Bill I propose to extend the meaning in section 2 of the Principal Act of the term &ldquo;work of engineering construction&rdquo; and to revise the definition of &ldquo;young person&rdquo;. I also propose extending the meaning of &ldquo;factory&rdquo; in section 3 of the Principal Act to include, where appropriate, AnCO training centres.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> The purpose of section 42 of the Bill is to apply to electrical stations the amended section 37 of the Principal Act, which deals with safe work-places and means of access.</P>
    <P>Section 43 of the Bill proposes to amend section 39 of the Principal Act which applies precautions with respect to explosive or flammable dust, gas or vapour, by including &ldquo;liquid&rdquo; along with &ldquo;gas or vapour&rdquo;; however, where the plant is installed in the open air, the provisions would not apply to gas or vapour under pressure. Section 43 would also provide for the amendment of section 72 of the Principal Act and would permit the Minister to allow persons other than the State Chemist to conduct analyses of samples.  It would also make it an offence for a person to disclose the results of such anlyses to persons other than the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 44 proposes to extend section 88 of the 1955 Act which deals with building operations, and section 89 of that Act which deals with works of engineering construction, to provide that specialist organisations who design and control contracts for building operations and works of engineering construction should also be regarded as occupiers and thus share responsibility for the safety of persons employed.</P>
    <P>In section 45 I intend to remove any legal doubt regarding the Minister's right of appeal to the Circuit Court from the decision of a District Court.</P>
    <P>Section 46 proposes to amend section 112 of the Principal Act.  Amendment is necessary in view of the raising of the school-leaving age to 15 years and would ensure that, in the event of a further raising of that age, it will not be necessary to amend these Acts.  It is thus a more flexible definition than the one used previously.</P>
    <P>Section 47 of the Bill proposes to amend section 120 of the Principal Act to provide for amendments or extensions by other enactments. This would ensure that abstracts required to be posted under that section&mdash;120&mdash; would also contain amendments introduced <Col N="1385" /> by this Bill or any later legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 48 of the Bill would give legal effect to the metric conversions in the Schedule to this Bill.  The metric equivalents of the various imperial measurements in the Principal Act are set out in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>Section 49 of the Bill would amend the Third Schedule to the Principal Act relating to the making of special regulations to provide that it will not be necessary to republish draft regulations where minor amendments are involved.</P>
    <P>Section 50 of the Bill provides for the amendment of section 127 of the Principal Act by making formal provision for payment of remuneration or allowances to the chairman of the advisory council with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>Section 51 is new.  It would provide for the designation by the Minister of one of his officers, who is a registered medical practitioner, as industrial medical adviser and specifies that he must be a specialist in, with experience of, occupational medicine.  It also sets out his powers and duties.</P>
    <P>As we learn more about the effects on workers' health of various processes and working conditions, the need for specialised medical advice in this area increases.  I should mention that I have already an industrial medical adviser on my staff; this new provision would define his statutory functions.</P>
    <P>Section 52 of the Bill proposes to permit the Minister to allow registered medical practitioners, other than those appointed as certifying doctors under the Principal Act, to medically examine young persons and to certify them as fit for a particular type of work.</P>
    <P>Section 53 of the Bill proposes to amend the fee payable to medical practitioners who notify the Minister of a case of an industrial disease as provided under section 76 of the Principal Act.  It would permit also further fee amendments with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> Section 54 is new and would enable an inspector to take, in a factory, any samples, photographs, measurements and so on which he thinks necessary for carrying out the provisions of the Acts.  The experience of the industrial inspectorate of my Department has been that the power to take samples is needed to enable them properly to carry out their duties under the Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 55 is new and would enable the disclosure to a safety representative, safety committee, safety delegate or safety officer of any fact or matter which the Minister considers relevant to the safety, health and welfare of persons employed and would provide that such disclosure shall enjoy qualified privilege.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about involving workers in their own safety, we must give to them, or to their representatives, the sort of information which will enable them to become involved properly in safety matters; without the provisions of such information, we cannot expect their participation, hence the provision of this section.</P>
    <P>Section 56 would allow the initiation of proceedings for an offence under the Acts within one year after it has been committed, rather than the usual six months, as the offence may not come to light within a period sufficient to allow it to be prosecuted within six months.</P>
    <P>Section 57, the last section of the Bill, provides for increases in the maximum penalties for offences under the Acts.  It would permit also further increases by order, rather than by amendment of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>It is right that I comment on the incidence of industrial accidents in Ireland.  It is difficult to draw a direct comparison with other countries as different bases are used to determine industrial accidents.  However, taking this reservation into consideration there is no evidence that Irish workers are any more accident prone than are other workers and by international standards our record compares reasonably well.</P>
    <P>One statistic that is indisputable is the incidence of fatalities.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to the increase in this respect from 15 <Col N="1387" /> deaths in 1976 to 22 deaths in 1977. These figures give ground for concern. Between 1969 and 1975, 164 workers died as a result of accidents at work in this part of the country while in Northern Ireland the number was 112. This comparison was within work forces of approximately the same size. The comparisons of notified accidents in England, Northern Ireland and Ireland for the latest years are as follows: England, 36 per 1,000 employed; Northern Ireland 27 per 1,000 employed and Ireland 19 per 1,000 employed.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the beginning I have considered the question of replacement of the Factories Act, 1955, and decided, on balance, that the advantage at present lies in the improvement of existing legislation.  I am of course open to receive suggestions on any aspects of the Bill and if they appear to have general support I would hope to respond favourably to them.  In that spirit therefore, and having regard to the positive improvements indicated in the proposals in the Bill.  I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many areas within the responsibility of politicians which are of such a nature that an all-party approach is in order.  The area of safety is one such area and it is in that light that I have, together with my advisers, studied in depth the Safety in Industry Bill now before the House.  It should not be concluded that we on this side of the House will have no criticism to offer.  Indeed, I intend offering in a few moments very sharp criticism of this Bill, but such criticism will be offered in a non-party political way and I hope that is the spirit in which it is received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question I have to answer is: do I welcome this Bill?  And the reply I have concluded, after careful analysis and thought is no.  The House might wonder at this but I will explain.  This Bill is a half-measure, conceived impetuously, delivered prematurely with scant consultation and minimum advice sought and subsequently scorned.  The Minister, I am sure, is only motivated by the best intentions&mdash;a desire to produce something <Col N="1388" /> quickly from his Department to fill an obvious gap in safety legislation. A cynic might also say that the haste is not unconnected with the lack of an overall legislative programme from the Government or the apparent inability of the Minister to do anything in the industrial relations field. Swiftness in the area of safety law, it might be thought, would compensate, as far as the Minister's reputation is concerned, for inaction elsewhere. As far as my submission on this Bill is concerned these criticisms are not considered.</P>
    <P>The law on safety at work in this country is a veritable jungle of several Acts of Parliament, several more parts of Acts of Parliament, a litany of Ministerial orders and literally hundreds of regulations and exemptions, all having the force of law.  This Bill is but a further piece of the incomprehensible jig-saw.  That is my first and major criticism of the Bill and that is why my first and deadly serious submission to the Minister is to withdraw the Bill and start again.</P>
    <P>If I were to believe that this Bill was merely a stop-gap measure pending the early introduction of a comprehensive consolidating Safety-at-Work Bill, I would welcome it.  But this Bill will serve only to postpone and probably cancel, as the Minister's remarks indicate, any hopes of a single safety law covering all at work, which is what I believe is badly wanted.</P>
    <P>In support of that contention I would point out to the House that the principal Acts governing safety are the Factories Act, 1955, the Office Premises Act, 1958, the Boiler Explosions Acts, 1882 and 1890, and The Mines and Quarries Act, 1965. All of these cover quite different areas. Added to these are various Shops Acts and Public Health Acts, together with sectional provisions in other Acts, like the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, the Nuclear Energy Act, 1971, and several Acts dealing with conditions of employment, and so on. Under the Factories Act alone over 120 different detailed orders, regulations and exemptions are still current, <Col N="1389" /> all with the force of law.  International law and agreements have like force.</P>
    <P>One might be led to imagine that, given such extensive legislation, every aspect of work and safety is covered, but nothing could be further from the truth.  All this legislation, policed by the factory inspectorate, does not cover transport, agriculture, horticulture, fisheries, off-shore installations, research laboratories, hospitals, clinics, dental surgeries, canteens, hotels, restaurants, places of entertainment, pubs, portable shops and stalls, Army, Garda, and so on.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive Safety-at-Work Bill would not only consolidate and co-ordinate all existing legislation but it could and should be extended to cover, without unnecessary distinction, all persons at work.  In addition it could replace complexity and confusion with clarity and simplicity&mdash;surely both prerequisites for laymen to understand and implement the legislation.</P>
    <P>The principal Factories Act was passed in 1955.  Between 1955 and 1978 technology advanced more than in any previous period of 100 years.  What is now needed is the cover-all Bill, which I have proposed, to match the technological, cultural and social advances of the day.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister that I would prefer to wait two or even three years, if necessary, to get a proper Bill than to support this latest &ldquo;ad hoccery&rdquo;&mdash;<i>ad hoc</i> additions to present law add only to complexity which leads to unenforcement and is not the friend, but the deadly enemy, of safety.</P>
    <P>What is most surprising is that the Bill now presented to us is almost entirely lifted from the British Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act, 1974. That is an excellent Act of the cover-all kind that I believe we need.  Why then did the Minister, if he did not want to waste time consulting, not go the whole hog and lift that Act in its entirety?  As the House knows, that Act was the result of the Robens Committee set up in 1970, which was representative of employers and trade unions both of whose commitment and <Col N="1390" /> involvement are essential to the success of all safety law.</P>
    <P>Committees of this kind are normally associated with delay but the expeditiousness of that report and its consequent enactment should have been an example to the Minister of how to approach the problem.  A committee on safety-at-work with representation of the social partners may have been the best approach and the delay thus encountered made tolerable by the overall gains and commitment, co-operation, clarity and completeness.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to scant consultations.  This Bill has none of the advantages of the British Safety Act and the criticisms made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions give adequate testimony to their dissatisfaction with the consultations, such as they were, that did take place and which were subsequently almost totally ignored.  I was amazed to discover that other bodies which one should have imagined would have been consulted, were not consulted.</P>
    <P>For instance, I understand that the Faculty of Occupational Medicine at UCD and the National Association of Industrial Medical Officers were not consulted and, quite unbelievably, that the National Industrial Safety Organisation were not consulted.  However, the greatest omission was the lack of consultation with the trade unions. Does anyone doubt that the role and attitude of trade unions in matters of safety is of paramount importance? Yet, not only were their representations ignored, but in the welcome provisions in the Bill for compulsory safety committees, safety delegates and safety representatives, no arrangements for, or even reference to, the role of the trade unions is made.  The House will want to know, and I ask now, why this extraordinary omission, especially when the British Act, which is the source of this Bill, gives an important and leading role to the trade unions in the pursuit of health, safety and welfare at work.  That is my second major criticism which I want now to expand.</P>
    <P>It is well known that both ICTU and the leadership of individual <Col N="1391" /> unions are committed to a policy of maximum safety.  However, at local level&mdash;and I am now speaking with personal experience, both as a former member of a voluntary safety committee and as a former shop steward &mdash;there can be conflicts between the requirements of safety and the working ease or pecuniary advantage of workers.  This is where the need for strong trade union commitment to safety is required and for the further need of this commitment to permeate right down the organisation.</P>
    <P>Far from ignoring the unions, as this Bill does, there is a strong case to be made for requiring each trade union to have a safety officer or executive, paid if necessary out of public funds, to vet all agreements and practices both centrally and locally to ensure observance of and commitment to safety law by all union officials, shop stewards and so on.  Furthermore, it might have been worth considering requiring each trade union to draw up a statement of safety policy, in the way the Bill rightly requires of employers, for the guidance of its officers, shop stewards and membership.</P>
    <P>This leads me to my third major criticism of the Bill, that is, the lack of sufficient emphasis on the responsibility of the individual to himself and to his fellow-workers in matters of safety and health.  True, section 8 of the new Bill enlarges on section 125 of the Principal Act in this regard. It is also true that maximum fines on an individual, as provided for in section 101 of the Principal Act, are increased; but the following facts must be taken into account.  First, the proportion of accidents at work which is caused by man as distinct from plant is estimated by some sources to be as high as 90 per cent.  Secondly, it is estimated that up to 75 per cent of safety law is not properly enforced. It is simply not good enough to require employers to observe safety procedures and provide safety gear and equipment for the protection of workers who then proceed, against their own best interests, to ignore the provisions made.  The Bill is not nearly strong enough on this subject <Col N="1392" /> and is further weakened by the omission of any trade union mention, which I have already criticised.</P>
    <P>Admittedly very often there is understandable psychological resistance to the wearing of ear muffs and goggles where these are required. However understandable the resistance might be, it should not be tolerated nor should the omission to wear other safety gear or observe safety procedures be tolerated to any degree whatsover.</P>
    <P>I see here a role for the safety committee which could be empowered itself to impose fines, to sanction suspension or, in very serious instances, to sanction dismissal.  However, the lack of formal provision for trade union involvement in safety committees probably renders this suggestion a non-starter.  Nonetheless, I believe it would improve observance and reduce accidents and the beneficiaries would be the workers themselves.</P>
    <P>The whole area of enforcement is unbelievably weak.  That is not surprising in view of the small size of the factory inspectorate.  The latest inspectorate report available to the House is for 1976.  It showed that there were 45 inspectors actually employed. Given that the average working year for each inspector is 210 days, there were approximately 9,000 man-days available to visit 18,500 locations at least once.  It does not make for second and third visits to doubtful places.  When one takes into account administration, travelling, prosecuting, pursuing, report-writing, propagating and so on, it can be readily seen that the factory inspectorate can only be operating on &ldquo;a lick and spit&rdquo; basis for most premises.</P>
    <P>This is my fourth major criticism of the Bill.  It fails to make provision for an enlarged inspectorate.  It fails to make provision for an inspectorate with more diverse qualifications and it fails to make provision for the independence of the inspectorate from undue political or other outside influence.  The last-mentioned I will return to in a more general way later, but it behoves me to say at this point that no suggstion of undue influence in the past has been made to me, or I hope to anybody else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> However, in relation to qualifications, as I understand it the factory inspectorate is comprised entirely of engineers. I submit that other professions should also be recruited.  There is a clear case for strong medical representation, notwithstanding the appointment by the Minister of an industrial medical adviser.  In this regard we are fortunate in having at UCD the Faculty of Occupational Medicine and also having the National Association of Industrial Medical Officers, both of whom I shall refer to later in the area of non-consultation. I believe also there is a place in the inspectorate for industrial psychologists who might be able to help overcome worker resistance to safety measures.  Perhaps other professions should also be included.</P>
    <P>Given the absence of any law requiring the disclosure by companies of political donations, and given the wide powers to make orders, regulations and exemptions allocated to the Minister for Labour, I believe it essential that the factory inspectorate be constituted as an independent statutory body to implement safety law and to draft and assent to all such orders, regulations and exemptions.  In the whole area of safety, independence is most necessary.  The safety officer must be independent of his bosses and his union.  The safety committee and the factory inspectorate must also be independent.  I shall refer to this later.</P>
    <P>I further believe that the Bill is amiss in not providing for parliamentary assent for all such regulations, orders and exemptions in view of the fact that they are so many and that they have the force of law.</P>
    <P>The independent statutory body which I have just suggested might also be assigned the responsibility for advertising of safety matters.  I know the NISO do that already and I would not want to cross them, but I believe there is need for some statutory body to have responsibility for promulgating safety matters and procedures.  Such a body would have responsibility for arranging the provision of proper training courses for all inspectors, safety committees, safety officers and so forth.  I note in this regard that in the UK the University of Aston run a <Col N="1394" /> six month residential course in safety law and enforcement.  Perhaps one of our universities might be persuade to provide similar courses here.</P>
    <P>Training, of course, should be compulsory for safety committees so that their knowledge and standing would be such as to earn respect from both side in industry.  But, just like the factory inspectorate, it is most important that the committee should be free of undue outside influences.  I have already welcomed the provision in the Bill for compulsory safety committees but they could be rendered useless by hostile or uncommitted management and indeed an unco-operative workforce.  The provision needs strengthening so that safety committees will be powerful, independent, active and trained and always consulted by the inspectorate in relation to their particular workplace. Protection against undue influence or unfair treatment against safety committees and, equally, complaints by either management or workers ought to be provided.  This is another important omission from the Bill.</P>
    <P>Very often complaints against and resistance to safety measures are experienced, especially from management, on the grounds of cost.  Management have a basic and natural concern for wasteful expenditure.  I do not know if statistics are available to show the total cost of accidents as against the total cost of safety but I am certain that safety, far from costing money actually, saves it.  That is certainly true nationally and also, I believe within most companies.  One firm I know which introduced voluntary safety committees and other safety procedures after the passing of the Factories Act saw its major, that is, time-lost accidents reduce from 365 per annum to 50, from one a day to one a week.  There were huge consequential savings.  These savings were not confined to the company because the country was spared social welfare and hospitalisation costs.</P>
    <P>However, regardless of cost any company which cannot afford safety provisions cannot afford to be in business. A life or a limb lost is a very black mark or perhaps more aptly a <Col N="1395" /> red mark on any company's balance of accounts.  In relation to the updating of the penalties included in the Bill they should be adequate to be a deterrent.  I am afraid that such is not the case with the penalties envisaged in this Bill.  In 1955 the medical officers' fee for signing a certificate was 2/6d and it is now £1, an eight-fold increase.  Most of the penalty increases are threefold, although there are some exceptions.</P>
    <P>A major and welcome provision of the Bill before us is the sections dealing with noise and the effects thereof. Reference to noise in safety matters usually relates to possible deafness which, of course, is the major problem. Another acute problem is the effect on nerves, attitudes and personality of working people for a sustained period in a high decibel situation. I have no doubt that those who say that noise levels were a major factor in the Ferenka debacle are right.  I am not happy with section 13, which I consider too vague and too loose.  I feel, in view of the evidence available, that all employers should be obliged to maintain the minimum decibel level reasonably practicable whether or not present levels are under the recommended DB rate per eight hour working day.</P>
    <P>There are other non-physical safety and health factors in addition to noise which are underscored by this Bill. I am distressed to see no reference to the effect of unsocial and excessive hours of work on awareness and performance. I feel also there is too little research into the effect of such hours of work on behaviour outside the workplace.  Certainly, medical evidence suggest that for those over 50 years of age unsocial hours should be prohibited in most cases due to the rapid deterioration in general health thus occasioned.  This is another major criticism of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Piece-work is often desirable for productivity purposes but is too often the occasion of safety lapses.  Where workers remove safety gadgets to allow more efficient use of plant the accident rate is high.  Special enforcement <Col N="1396" /> is needed where piece-work operates and special provisions ought to be made for the registering of piece-work operations with the inspectorate to facilitate extra inspection. The Bill's provisions for chemicals, toxic materials, gas and explosives leave much to be desired.  Labelling requirements are particularly weak and I would like to hear much more expert evidence on this whole area.</P>
    <P>The Bill is full of major omissions and disappointments.  It continues to perpetrate the distinction between categories of workers, especially between offices and factories.  How many factories do not have offices? None.  How many officials have to work beside or often visit hazardous locations in their factory?  How many officials work in noisy computer rooms or offices beside noisy processes?</P>
    <P>Another galling omission is the failure to take into account the public at large.  How is the health and safety of a community affected by the persistent noise, or perhaps fall-out, of a nearby factory?  This was a most notable and enlightened inclusion in the 1975 British Act and is a regrettable oversight in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The part cleanliness and tidiness of a whole factory plays in maintaining safety procedures and discipline is not even referred to.  Cleanliness is referred to in the Principal Act and as far as I can gather it covers only where work is supposed to be going on.  It does not cover areas between where work is going on.  The Principal Act is vague and restrictive in this regard.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that we are a filthy nation with filthy habits which are a cause of accidents, ill-health and a diminished production.  I am deeply ashamed of this trait in the Irish character and I am deeply sorry that no attempt is made by this Bill to improve things.</P>
    <P>One further matter which has been drawn to my attention and is not covered, as far as I know, by any legislation is the use of micro-wave plant.  I mentioned earlier that pubs, <Col N="1397" /> among other places of work, are not covered in this Bill and almost every pub nowadays has micro-wave ovens which, according to the March edition of the magazine <i>WHICH</i>, are extremely damaging to the eyes and testicles.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier the area of safety law is a complex legal jungle made worse by this Bill.  Safety law is also a very complex technical subject on which the advice of experts in several fields is required.  In the short time since the publication of this Bill I have studied it and other safety legislation in great detail.  That is why I have asked the Minister to withdraw the Bill and bring in one cover-all comprehensive safety Bill.  The Minister may feel unable to consent to this because he and I are both bound by an over-rigid parliamentary system. He may feel that the provisions of the Bill are meritorious&mdash;which would be true as far as they go and on that basis they should be enacted.</P>
    <P>May I make a suggestion to the Minister if that be the case?  Let us process, and in due course enact, this Bill with the help of a committee of experts.  Let us break the rigid parliamentary norm and form an all-party committee of Members together with suitable technical assessors to amend and improve the Bill where possible. This is the sort of Bill which needs such technical and scientific help.  I make that suggestion on one condition, that the Minister undertakes simultaneously with the enactment of this Bill to set up a Commission on Safety at Work to draft, as soon as possible, a new single Bill (1) to repeal all others; (2) provide for adequate safety at all places of work; (3) to simplify and clarify safety, health and welfare law and (4) to protect the community at large from unsafe procedures. The end result should be a safer, cleaner, healthier, more productive but, above all else, a happier workplace for our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This initial Bill will be long remembered more for its omissions rather than for new and <Col N="1398" /> urgently needed up-to-date safety regulations for those employed in the ever-increasing industrial ring of our economy, which experts say will have increased its output by 28 per cent by 1982, exporting £3 billion per annum, and by that time will involve, we sincerely hope, a work force of 850,000 approximately.  The Bill, as published, totally ignores the submissions made by the ICTU, and the Factories Advisory Council on the original draft proposals.  The Bill only amends certain sections of the Factories Act, 1955, and totally ignores the need to update the Office Premises Act, 1958, and to safeguard agricultural and many other workers who are not covered by our legislation.  In this Bill the Minister takes no account of the major developments in the UK, and Northern Ireland since the introduction of the Health and Safety Act, 1974, or of developments in the EEC with the publication of a Draft Action Programme on Safety, Health and Hygiene at work.</P>
      <P>The figures issued annually speak for themselves, and clearly indicate the magnitude of the problems in this area. In the past five years over 13,000 accidents have occurred in our factories, giving an annual average of 2,500 accidents, with approximately 80 resulting in amputations.  Also every year approximately 25 fatal accidents occur in factories, mining and quarrying. Our worst year ever for man-days lost through industrial accidents and diseases.  This surely is a clear indication that this serious situation must be strenuously tackled jointly by Government and industry.  This Bill, as submitted to the House, today clearly indicates that the Government are not prepared to defeat this ever-increasing industrial problem in a genuine manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the humanitarian aspect of this scourge of industrial accidents, there is also an economic reason for introducing much more stringent measures.  It is reckoned that the annual cost of these accidents to the economy is £10 million.  No society or nation <Col N="1399" /> can accept, without concern, such levels of death, waste, disease and injury as the terrible price of being able to meet the national needs of services and goods.</P>
    <P>We must start at the beginning. Since 1955, the year of the last enactment, we have had revolutionary changes and developments in industry. Local resources have been developed, foreign investors have been invited in with grant incentives, and great strides have been made in creating industries based on these resources.  This challenge to our labour force has been met with courage and determination. However, their contribution to the economy, be it on the factory floor, or underground at mining, or at sea in oil exploration, must be met and appreciated by ensuring that, while they are thus expanding our industrial production, the maximum precautions are taken to protect them from serious injuries or the ever-increasing fear of industrial diseases.  For years the coal miners were scourged by the dreaded and oft-fatal disease, silococis.  Now, with modern techniques of processing of raw materials, the workers in many modern plants today are bombarded by side effects, and, unfortunately, our medical resources and knowledge have not kept pace with the resultant effect on the workers' health.</P>
    <P>This, in my opinion, is the most important and urgent area for the Government, through the Minister for Labour, and Irish industry.  They must face their responsibilities to the workers and their families by arranging immediate consultations with the medical profession and by including in the Bill, when finally enacted, stringent conditions protecting the workers from these health hazards and ensuring that the particular industry involved employs a proper medical service.  The present inadequate medical expertise and coverage, especially in the more recently established high-processing industries, is a matter of grave concern to the trade union movement, and ICTU is determined to have this serious situation rectified as soon as possible. I support their belief that it cannot <Col N="1400" /> be jobs at any cost, especially when it is the worker who suffers.</P>
    <P>As spokesman for my party, on behalf of ICTU and the trade union movement I say that this Bill as presented to us today is totally inadequate and far too restrictive.  In 1977, congress pointed out to the Department of Labour the need for updated comprehensive legislation, but this Bill is a grave disappointment to all and it in no way meets the needs of a modern developing industrial country.</P>
    <P>Surely on the important matter of updating an Act of 1955, affecting 700,000 workers, a fundamental process in the revision should have been prolonged consultation and discussion with the ICTU thus ensuring that a knowledgeable and concerned input from the body would be forthcoming and that at least the Bill before us today, while not final, would be the basis for a realistic and fruitful piece of legislation.  This was not to be, as apparently the Government, through their Minister for Labour, decided to go it alone.  This is a most unsatisfactory development, and contrary to the much talked of worker-participation in industry.  Why should the Minister shirk discussions with congress? Is he more concerned about the effect of a properly prepared Bill, showing genuine concern for the worker, on his friends in industry, many of whom are operating industries and plants with outmoded machinery in depressing and dangerous working conditions?  Why is the Minister completely ignoring the urgent need to update the Office Premises Act, 1958?  Is it because in many industries and indeed in very many semi-State bodies, and local authorities, administrative staff are working in conditions similar to those of the early years of the 20th century? Why this sham and charade?  Is it to meet the promises made to their 1977 manifesto, or is the Minister under pressure from big business not to squeeze too hard, despite all the tax benefits given to them in the January budget?  This effort is just not good enough and will not be accepted by the trade union movement.  Worker and employer must co-operate to the <Col N="1401" /> fullest to eliminate the drudgery and dangers of everyday work life, thus ensuring a fresh and enterprising attitude to productivity, contentment at work and for the employer, a much improved annual turnover.</P>
    <P>Every other day in this House different members of the Cabinet indicate the Brussels imposed need to adopt an EEC directive, affecting the lives of our people in some way.  Why then in the preparation of this Bill was reference not made to similar developments in the EEC with the publication of a Draft Action Programme on Safety, Health and Hygiene at Work?</P>
    <P>One outstanding omission from the Bill is the safeguarding of agricultural workers.  Surely in these days of sophisticated machinery in our agricultural sector the employee is entitled to similar protection.  Can the Minister honestly explain this serious omission? Is there some ulterior motive for ignoring agricultural workers interests? Surely it cannot be said that agriculture cannot afford to protect such a valuable and experienced body of workers.  They must not be excluded.</P>
    <P>This is an appropriate occasion to compliment a body which has been doing tremendous work over the years in the field of safety at work&mdash;I refer to NISO.  They have achieved good result.  However NISO unfortunately have not enough power to make the necessary impact on this problem. Perhaps in the eventual Bill greater recognition will be given to this hard-working organisation.</P>
    <P>AnCO must play a major role in work safety.  Boys and girls in their first employment, unless geared and trained for their responsibilities, are prone to injury at their place of employment. Substantial industrial grants to create industries must be accompanied by well-designed factories, conducive to maximum contribution by properly trained workers, thus ensuring industry's viability, permanent jobs for employees and mental and physical safety on the factory floor. With the ever-increasing involvement of female employees in industry, it is imperative that industries employing a bigger proportion of women should <Col N="1402" /> be kept under close surveillance to ensure that maximum safety precautions are taken.  Regular inspections of machinery and a close study of safety precautions on the shop floors of our industries will require a substantial intake of officers in the Department to ensure maximum efficiency.</P>
    <P>If and when inspectors discover discrepancies in standards, greater penalties than those included in the Bill should be imposed.  There can be no soft pedalling when lives are at stake.</P>
    <P>Because of all these shortcomings and the urgent need for a proper and realistic updating of all such legislation affecting workers, I am calling on the Minister to withdraw this Bill and to enter into immediate discussions with congress and other interested groups on the type of safety and health legislation we need.  This Bill is unacceptable to my party and to the trade union movement in its present form.  We demand that the Minister does not push it through against the wishes of the trade unions and the experts on safety and health at work.  The Minister must be prepared to amend the Bill radically to meet the wishes of the trade union movement.  In these days of serious industrial unrest it is important for the sake of all our people and for the future prosperity of our country, that there should be proper and continued liaison and discussion between the Government and the ICTU on all matters affecting the wellbeing of our work force.  I hope that the Minister will heed this advice.</P>

      <P>I am happy to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I welcome any legislation concerning the safety of the workforce but, like the two previous speakers, I had hoped for a comprehensive Bill.  This is only a makeshift, a patching up of an outdated Bill from 1955.  Surely the Minister should have looked at this with a view to introducing a Bill incorporating every aspect of industrial safety and health.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, noting the present inadequacy of our dental health services, calls on the Minister for Health and Social Welfare to introduce, as a matter of urgency, a new improved service that will (a) provide immediate free dental care for all school children (b) eliminate the present abnormally long waiting lists for treatment (c) introduce a choice of dentist scheme for medical card holders; and for this purpose to undertake a massive recruitment drive of dental surgeons, as well as initiating a programme for the training and utilisation of dental auxiliaries in a national dental service.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister has an important engagement tonight and I appreciate the courtesy he extended to me by informing me about it and by saying that he would pay particular attention to the points I am raising on this issue.  The motion I tabled says:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, noting the present inadequacy of our dental health services calls on the Minister for Health and Social Welfare to introduce, as a matter of urgency, a new improved service that will (a) provide immediate free dental care for all school children (b) eliminate the present abnormally long waiting lists for treatment (c) introduce a choice of dentist scheme for medical card holders; and for this purpose to undertake a massive recruitment drive of dental surgeons, as well as initiating a programme for the training and utilisation of dental auxiliaries in a national dental service.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his wisdom thought fit to amend this for reasons which I find it difficult to understand or to accept and he asks that all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; be deleted and he substitutes the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;accepts that it is the intention of the Minister for Health to undertake a comprehensive review of the public dental services and to embark <Col N="1404" /> on a programme to remedy such deficiencies as that review may bring to light, and is satisfied that the Minister will implement necessary improvements as soon as circumstances permit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like to explain briefly my reasons for bringing this motion before the House and what I hope to accomplish in the three hours we have at our disposal for it.  I brought the motion before the House because of the abysmal state of dental health in Ireland and the failure of successive Governments to make proper dental care a priority in our health services.  The result has been a history of neglect which has left this nation with a collection of the worst teeth in Europe and a standard of dental care which, in the words of the chief radiologist of the Dublin Dental Hospital, is comparable to that prevailing in Europe in the middle of the 19th century.  So, we have a nation full of dead teeth and a dental service that in the opinion of experts is 125 years behind the times.  My purpose in putting down the motion is to highlight in detail the facts and the statistics which will give us all a clear picture of the dimensions of our failure in this area and hopefully lift the lid off the complacency in Government and among the general public that has allowed dental disease to assume epidemic proportions in our community. We have tolerated a dental epidemic over the years.</P>
    <P>In many ways I view this debate in a much wider context than a merely political debate confined to this House; I view it as a means of awakening the general public to the high incidence of dental disease and the low standards of care which they have tolerated for so long.  I believe those in the dental profession and those in this House demanding a massively improved dental service cannot succeed unless public opinion is rallied in support, unless the public recognise the size of the problem and demand action.  I believe we will be unable to bring the dental service into the 20th century in terms of quality without public clamour and <Col N="1405" /> outcry and active public support for change in it.  We know that public interest in it does not exist at the moment; we can see that in the massive figures for those who never go near dentists and have little appreciation of the importance of dental health.</P>
    <P>I should like to make clear that I do not intend to make this a party political issue in the narrow, petty sense of the word.  I recognise that the history of neglected dental care is not the sole responsibility of any one Minister past or present.  The present Minister inherits a tremendous problem and so faces a tremendous task. I hope these two nights of debate will make his task easier, not more difficult, by highlighting for the public the scope of the problem and by putting forward concrete, constructive proposals for action.  I hope the Minister will approach the problem in the same light.</P>
    <P>Too often the precedent invoked in Private Members' Time is that the Government introduce their own amendment and oppose a motion merely because it emanates from the Opposition.  I think this implies that the Minister and the Department have a monopoly of wisdom.  I hope that in time we may change that attitude on this matter and I regret that the Minister's amendment is perhaps rather negative in not seeing the purpose of the motion and the intention on my part to have the matter debated so that we might realise the immensity of the problem and see how we can tackle it.</P>
    <P>I have placed a positive and constructive motion here and I had hoped the Minister would accept all that is embodied in it, most of which he should accept and some of which he must accept.  However, he has responded with a curious and in some ways paradoxical amendment which states that he intends to undertake a review.  I wonder about that.  It seems to imply that the problems and deficiencies are not apparent, that they are not there or certainly are not obvious but rather must be sought out and discovered.  The amendment says <Col N="1406" /> that the Minister will embark on a programme to remedy such deficiencies as that review may bring to light.  That phrasing suggests the strength of the interpretation that these deficiencies are lurking somewhere in the dark and must be brought to light for us to see.  The amendment goes on to say in a confusing and paradoxical way that the Minister will implement necessary improvements as soon as circumstances permit.  That seems to acknowledge that deficiencies already exist and are apparent but that time is needed to put them right in which case I and many others may ask: Why do we need such a comprehensive review of the problem? Why do we need a review of a health epidemic that has been staring us in the face for the past 30 years?  With due respect to the Minister&mdash;I do not think this was his own phrasing&mdash;the amendment is confused if not self-contradictory.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's main contribution to the debate is to propose this comprehensive review I hope he will be specific about it, say what the terms of reference will be, who will undertake it and if there will be consumer representatives.  Will there be a latest date by which they will report?  If we can be specific about all this we may achieve something by this debate. There is an ignoble tradition in the Department of Health of sweeping difficult problems and decisions under the carpet of &ldquo;a comprehensive review&rdquo;. We have work groups and task forces and so on and this has almost reached an absurd stage.  I do not mean to be critical of the Minister but I want to caution him against needless delay in tackling these problems because in my honest opinion I do not think this review is necessary.  In fact, I intend to give the Minister a comprehensive review this evening, the facts and figures of the neglect of dental care in Ireland, and to propose remedies.  It is not such a subtle, complicated problem; it is as blatant as any other health epidemic.  What will be required after this debate is not a comprehensive review but actual specific decisions by the Minister which he will have to implement and policies <Col N="1407" /> which we shall discuss and on which I think we can agree.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive review of our dental services was undertaken by Professor Kaim-Caudle in 1969 on behalf of the National Economic and Social Council.  The situation he outlined still exists today, a dreadful population-dentist ratio, advanced dental disease in the population, particularly and most ominously among children, insufficient dental preventive measures, gross regional inequalities in dental services available and restrictive laws inhibiting the use of dental auxiliaries as well as a crying need for a new Dental Act.  He also emphasised the overall low priority in terms of Government expenditure accorded to dental health.  At the time of the report he said that judging from surveys in the late sixties the situation had not improved from the fifties and it only remains for us to update his study with recent figures.  This I have done through parliamentary questions and other means in the past few months. The facts that emerge show that the situation has not improved since the late sixties when he issued this report with the exception of fluoridation of the water.  His comprehensive review and his recommendations are as relevant as they were when he issued them in the sixties.</P>
    <P>Let us look at these statistics of failure in dental health and services. Over 50 per cent of our population have gum disease and this insidious process attacks the tissues of the gum surrounding the teeth and makes future loss of teeth inevitable.  It results in significant costs for our dental services.  As well as that, 127,000 of our people suffer from trench mouth.  An even more appalling figure is that two-thirds of our people over the age of 40 have no teeth of their own and a high proportion of the remainder are heading in that direction.  What better witness have we of the history of neglect of dental health?</P>
    <P>There are 1.4 million people eligible for free dental care and there are only 222 full-time dentists providing that care.  The ratio is one dentist per 6,300 eligible patients in the public dental <Col N="1408" /> service.  What does that mean?  It is over three times the ratio recommended by the WHO.  They recommend one dentist per 2,000 of the population.  This is a terrible indictment of our service.  In the public sector alone there is a serious shortfall of nearly 400 dentists.  With 888 dentists currently registered the shortfall in the country at large is at least 700.</P>
    <P>The situation is as bad when one looks at the delivery of dental care to those eligible.  Only 10 per cent of the adults and 40 per cent of the children entitled to free dental care actually receive it.  I will admit that this is in great measure due to public apathy about dental health, but the fact that the service is so inadequate is a serious disincentive to public dental health. For those who are seeking it, the waiting lists are appallingly long.</P>
    <P>According to figures from the Department of Health in reply to a parliamentary question, on 1 August last year there were over 24,000 children covered by medical cards awaiting dental treatment and the average waiting period for these children, who are entitled by law to this treatment, was 9.9 months.  The situation for adults is not any better.  Over 27,000 adults covered by the medical card were waiting an average of 10.9 months for treatment.  These appalling waiting lists are adding to the tremendous cost. The whole policy and <i>rationale</i> of preventive treatment is such that early attention is essential.  These long waiting lists are inexcusable.  If the answer is that we have not the money, then it is false economics.  Costs in later years will be enormous and these costs could be avoided now, or drastically reduced, through preventive care.  We are not solving the problem by extending the waiting lists; we are adding to future costs.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of the paper entitlements, paper social rights which, in my capacity as Labour spokesman, I am constantly talking about.  Actual rights and rights on paper are completely different.  It is fine to say that the medical card entitles one to free dental treatment but it is hypocrisy to make such a statement without providing adequate funds to provide that care.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> In 1977 we provided a miserly 1.2 per cent of total health expenditure for the dental services, £3.9 million out of a total of £350 million.  The Minister this year raised that sum to £4.2 million and one could claim that this is an increase of 12 per cent.  Percentages can be extremely misleading.  As a percentage of total health expenditure, the percentage devoted to dental care this year has actually dropped. Last year it was 1.2 per cent and this year it is 1.1 per cent.  That is significant.  It means that dental care has assumed less priority this year than last year.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Department of Health to a proper dental service must be highlighted.  Let us consider, for example, the school health examination programme in child welfare clinics. According to the Health Act free dental treatment is available to children for defects noted at these sessions.  The Minister replied to a question of mine regarding the frequency of school health examinations in primary schools. He said that it is the policy of his Department to provide a full, comprehensive medical examination for each child towards the end of his first year at primary school and selective examinations for older school-going children.  He went on to say that it is considered desirable that schools with over 50 pupils should be visited each year and smaller schools should be visited at least every two years.  The phrase &ldquo;considered desirable&rdquo; is a bureaucratic euphemism used by the Department to say that this is their policy but they should not be expected to fulfil it.</P>
    <P>When I asked a question requesting information on the proportion of all primary school children who have received examinations and treatment under the scheme and how often these examinations have taken place for each child.  I was told that the information could not be extracted by the Department from the health boards.  The Department are not doing their job at all.  How do we know the scheme is working if we cannot get the figures? How do we know that all our primary school children are receiving examinations and treatments at least once a <Col N="1410" /> year?  How do we know that we have even a semblance of a preventive dental scheme, the minimum requirement of which is at least one examination per year?</P>
    <P>I did not receive any details about the number of children examined in the child welfare clinics and the frequency of these examinations.  As far as I can judge, they were feeble and ineffective efforts.  The only information I was able to extract from these stingy mandarins in the Department was that out of a total of 600,000 pre-school and national school children only 46 per cent received a dental examination under these programmes in 1976.  There are 320,000 eligible school children who did not receive any dental examination at all in 1976. This is irrefutable evidence that the Department's policy of a visit to every school on an annual basis is not being fulfilled.  It is pie in the sky to say otherwise.  The other problem is the examination of children at secondary school level.  This is virtually non-existent. This is a crucially important period when attitudes are being formed towards dental hygiene and regular check-ups are still of major importance. I have received many complaints about this total neglect of dental care at secondary school level.</P>
    <P>I recently received a letter from Oughterard in County Galway stating that from Cleggan to Galway, a distance of 56 miles, there is not a single dentist.  If a child gets a toothache in Oughterard he goes on a waiting list for a busy Galway dentist.  This is our country and there are people in Cleggan and Oughterard.  It is important that we pay attention to their needs.  The letter states that delays of up to three weeks are not unusual and pain must be endured because there is no dentist within 56 miles.  The child has to endure the pain and then, on the appropriate day, having waited for a private dentist, the child is taken to Galway and misses school.  It may require several such appointments.  Transport is an additional expense.  The situation is archaic and incredible in 1978.  These people count themselves fortunate because they do not live as far away as Cleggan.  Surely it is not <Col N="1411" /> unreasonable to demand at least a part-time dental service in this huge area. It is not being provided.</P>
    <P>All school children should be eligible and receive free and regular dental care.  This is the first proposal in my motion.  The school examination programme fails to reach 54 per cent of pre-school and national school children presently eligible, and merely extending it to secondary school level will mean extending an almost negligible service to the point of exhaustion. The service must be completely rehabilitated. There must be a significant influx of staff.  I shall deal with staff later.  The only point I wish to make here is the failure of the preventive dental care programme which fails to reach the majority of those children most at risk.  Even if a dental health officer visits the national school the onus is on the parents to follow up a recommendation to visit the dental clinic.  In too many cases this visit never takes place.  I do not say it is wholly the State's responsibility to care for the nation's teeth.  The parents also have an obligation and in many cases they are not living up to their responsibility.  The long waiting list is a disincentive to them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the facilities for dental education the President of the Irish Dental Association has gone on record as saying that a serious shortage of dental teachers is inevitable in view of the present unsatisfactory dental hospital facilities.  The staff of the Dental Hospital went on strike fighting for a feasible career structure.  About 60 dentists qualify each year but, because of the total lack of post-graduate training facilities and consultancy training, emigration amongst dentists since 1969 has been as high as 60 per cent.  Six out of every ten who qualify go abroad.  The Minister must realise that this is a very serious situation.  We train these people and other countries reap the benefits of that training.</P>
    <P>The Dental Hospital in Dublin, the major training ground, is incredibly outdated.  I will not accept that this hospital should be the responsibility of the Minister for Education.  It should be the responsibility of the <Col N="1412" /> Minister for Health and there should be close liaison between the two where dental health is concerned. The Dental Hospital was built in the last century to accommodate 15 students.  It now caters for five times that number.  It has a permanent staff of 11.  Compare that with the veterinary college.  It has half the number of students and over 100 permanent staff.  Bearing those statistics in mind I would not be too bold in asking what our priorities are.  It is absolutely wrong to allow that situation to continue.  The chief consultant in the Dental Hospital in Dublin said the Dental Hospital in Cork was outmoded even in the 1950s.  He also said that top priority for a dental service must be providing proper dental hospitals. There must be consultants within reach of the people, and dental hospitals without consultants are useless.</P>
    <P>We can provide these facilities.  A new teaching hospital has been in the planning stage for 20 years.  We had this division of ministerial responsibility, and the Minister for Education finally decided that the new facility would be on the James's Hospital site. Planning for this is proceeding at a snail's pace.  Unless space and staff are provided there is no good in our talking about dental auxiliaries.  It takes two years to train them.  The EEC directives provide for 18 months after the finalisation in autumn for a new dental Act and, therefore, any new dental Act will not come at the initiative of the Minister.  That new Act must be passed by order of the EEC within 18 months after next autumn and, if we are to fulfil our obligations under the EEC directive to provide auxiliaries, we should be starting now making elaborate plans for their training. This is where the Minister for Health should be stepping in with plans to provide the space and staff in the new dental hospital for the training of these auxiliaries.  I ask him to look at this aspect urgently.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Dental Hospital does not provide any care for the mentally and physically handicapped.  This is a scandalous situation.  It is another indication of the utter contempt in <Col N="1413" /> which these citizens are held by the State, the least advantaged in our society, who need expert care and for whom no attempt of any kind is made to provide that care.  It is relegated. It is not the responsibility of the Department and so the Department do nothing about it.  I raised this on previous occasions.</P>
    <P>In regard to emergency dental care, I asked a question about the emergency service available on a 24-hour basis all the year round in the Dublin Dental Hospital.  The Minister said the emergency service was available from 9.00 to 5.00 on weekdays and 9.00 to 12.30 on Saturdays.  No one could call that an emergency service.  There were loads of complaints from people over the Christmas.  These people could not afford the services of private dentists but they needed emergency dental care.  There is no such thing as emergency dental services, and if one is unlucky enough to need emergency dental treatment after hours or over a holiday period then it is just one's tough luck.</P>
    <P>There are gross regional inequalities. Within a 56-mile radius of Galway there is no dentist.  The ratio of prospective patients to dentist in Donegal is 11,000 : 1.  There are three times as many dentists in Dublin as there are in Connacht and the three northern counties.  We must provide some incentives so that dental surgeons will work in these isolated areas where the rate of patient population to dentist is excessively high.</P>
    <P>The biggest area of failure is in the field of dental health education.  With only 20 per cent of those entitled to free dental care availing of the service I do not think I exaggerate when I say the Government are getting things on the cheap.  They are providing a poor service because the majority entitled to it are not claiming their rights.  I am beginning to believe that there is a conspiracy in the Department to stop people knowing their rights.  That is very obvious.  The Department makes no effort to let the other 80 per cent know their entitlements, because that would cost too much.  The entitlements are there but the Department keeps quiet about <Col N="1414" /> them.  I believe there are those who will be annoyed at my highlighting this fact.  It is typical, of course, of the inward approach of the Department. It will not let people know their entitlements.  This is painfully obvious in all aspects of health.  It is in the interests of the Department not to let people know because, if they know, demand will increase.</P>
    <P>I am suspicious of the policy of the Department in the field of health education. The Minister talked about a comprehensive review to bring deficiencies to light.  The deficiencies are glaring and we would want to be blind not to see them.  A review is quite unnecessary.  I would hope now for constructive, specific and concrete proposals designed to improve the service. Eligibility must be extended to all school children under 16 years of age. If we provide the care at an early age we will cause less hardship to people and less cost to the State.  There is no other domain of health care where the benefits of preventive care, both personal and financial, are so obvious.  The Minister is a great exponent of preventive medicine.  This has been the underlying theme of his ministerial responsibility to date. That is why I put this proposal in my motion.  I do not think it is asking for much.  It is practical and realisable and I am asking that he consider it.  I know there are financial constraints on him and that he cannot provide everything.  I know the difficulties he has in establishing his priorities, that more money here means less money elsewhere.  What I am asking for is an extension of eligibility to start with for all children to secondary school age.  I think it is realistic and feasible and the benefits would definitely far outweigh the cost to the State.</P>
    <P>The second feature of my motion relates to the need to eliminate this diabolical waiting list for medical card patients.  With 50,000 people waiting a minimum of one year to receive the dental care to which they are entitled, we have an emergency situation which must be rectified immediately if our system of health entitlements is to hold any credibility.  I am asking for a choice of dentist scheme for medical card holders.  I believe this would be <Col N="1415" /> a rational and progressive reform in the service.  It is a disgrace that thousands upon thousands wait a year, in many cases longer, because a filling that is delayed for a year becomes an extraction, which is more costly and of greater distress to the people concerned. At the same time private dentists are crying out for work.  As the choice of doctor scheme has proved to be adequate and is working efficiently, there is an obligation on the State to provide a similar scheme for medical card holders.  If the State provided such a scheme the waiting list would be eliminated almost overnight.</P>
    <P>The main proposal in my motion, the one upon which all the others depend, is to call for a massive recruitment of dental surgeons and the training and utilisation of auxiliaries in the national dental service.  The shortage of dental surgeons in the public health service is almost 400, yet we have only recruited 40 dentists in the last four years.  If we are to continue at that pace we will be waiting 40 years to bring the number of dentists up to the required figure.  What we must seriously consider is the question of dental auxiliaries.  They not only could clear the waiting list for treatment but would also reduce the number of dental surgeons necessary to bring the public dental service up to acceptable minimum standards.</P>
    <P>There is much confusion over the terminology of what constitutes a dental auxiliary, but there is no need to go into the details of it.  The main point is that it involves a two-year course and it is embodied in legislation in other countries.  Call them what you like, dental hygienists, school nurses and so on, these people could provide fundamental dental care under the supervision of qualified dental surgeons.  This is a recommendation of Professor Kaim-Caudle and it is one that we should seriously consider at present.  The only way we can conquer the problem is to recruit and train people who could undertake work after a two-year course and thus relieve dentists of normal routine work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>If we could recruit these people and commence the course immediately we would have a number of dental auxiliaries to provide the necessary care and thus relieve the waiting list immediately.</P>
      <P>Another important aspect of the matter, which is not included in my motion, is that so many of those who qualify each year go abroad.  It is our entitlement as a State to ask new dental surgeons to contribute one year's service to the State.  After all, dental education is as highly subsidised by the State as medical education, and we should ask them to provide a compulsory year in the public dental service.  In this way we would have an extra 60 dental surgeons each year, which would immediately relieve this tremendous problem.</P>
      <P>The Director of the Experimental Dental Care Project at the London Hospital Medical College, Professor Harry Alfred, conducted exhaustive and complex studies into the efficacy and efficiency of different methods of providing dental care.  He concluded that the least expensive and most productive dental care schemes were those which included operating dental auxiliaries to carry out the drilling and filling of teeth in addition to other duties.  We should pay particular attention to him and forget about undertaking a review.  The information is all there and I think we should do it.</P>
      <P>Forty-five countries have already embodied in their legislation the question of allowing dental auxiliaries to work and I am positive that the dental profession would not object to it.  There is only one dental Act, the 1928 Act, and it is time we had a new one.  The profession is demanding it.  If the Minister is willing to enter into full consultation with the profession on these problems, I am sure arrangements can be made to solve the problem. Consultation there must be, and it should be done without fail and immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which should be considered is the fees being paid to dental surgeons in the social welfare scheme.  There are no fees being paid to dental surgeons for dental examinations. <Col N="1417" /> A full examination is necessary. If we are going to have proper primary dental preventive care we should provide fees for examinations.  The lack of dental examinations is responsible for spreading gum disease, so I think there should be regular examinations and that they should be paid for.</P>
    <P>Doctor Mageen, Director of Dental Caries and Fluoride Studies at UCC, said that the EEC subsidy on milk should be used for fluoridation programmes and that milk is the most economic vehicle for providing fluoride for those children who do not have access to piped fluoridated water.  We should seriously consider this matter and aim at providing milk for them. We know that the EEC could provide half the cost of such a scheme.</P>
    <P>Another area is dental care for pregnant women.  It is a crucial priority for the dental health of ourselves as well as that of our children.  All pregnant women should be eligible for free dental care which should continue for a full year after the birth of the child.  There should be communication between the medical and dental professions in regard to these things.</P>
    <P>I would like to add my voice to that of the Irish Dental Association in calling for Ireland to join the world teeth survey which is presently being undertaken by WHO in conjunction with the American public health service.  Such a review should be in addition to our own plan of action. We know the problem.  Fifty per cent of our population has gum disease; two-thirds have not their own teeth; only 20 per cent of those who are entitled to dental care actually avail of it; there is only one dentist to 6,300 eligible persons in our public health service; only 1 per cent of our total health expenditure goes towards the dental service; we have 50,000 people on the waiting list for treatment under the medical card.  These are the starting facts, and I am asking the Minister to forget his reviews and to start talking about taking action.  A genuine school visiting programme based on a dental health team, utilising dental auxiliaries, is necessary.  A new dental Act is urgent and there should be a <Col N="1418" /> compulsory one-year service for newly qualified dentists.  These are constructive and specific ways in which to overcome the backlog and bring our dental service up to the standards available elsewhere.  This is the only way we can do it.  There is no point in sweeping our problems under the carpet and having a review, which the Minister suggests.  I hope the House will support me in what I call for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Tunney) Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Tunney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;accepts that it is the intention of the Minister for Health to undertake a comprehensive review of the public dental services and to embark on a programme to remedy such deficiencies as that review may bring to light, and is satisfied that the Minister will implement necessary improvements as soon as circumstances permit&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are few Deputies who would take issue with Deputy O'Connell in the matters to which he has referred. For my own part, allowing for the characteristic mild exaggeration or hyperbole in which we indulge, I would accept that the case which he has made would be more or less in accordance with that which I find, and presently I shall be adding one or two categories to those which have been mentioned by him as areas that should qualify for early consideration in the review which the Minister has proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Deputy in the House is unaware of the many deficiencies in the public dental service.  This is not of recent date.  The service gives rise to a considerable volume of representations in virtually every constituency.  I have no doubt the Minister receives an equally substantial volume of these complaints.  The volume of complaints reflecting the inadequacies in the service varies greatly from region to region.  This regional variation is easily explained and is related to the key problem of the provision of dental <Col N="1419" /> services.  This is a topic to which I will return later.</P>
    <P>The sense of dissatisfaction with the service is widespread.  The Minister said in this House that he is not satisfied with the existing dental service and that he is anxious to proceed with the implementation of a comprehensive programme for dental health. Thanks to the development of clinical expertise, a wide variety of procedures is available to the modern dentist&mdash; to enable him to provide a better service for his patients.  Conservative procedures, however, still play a predominant part in the public dental service here as elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In practice, the objective of most public dental services is to achieve a state of dental fitness which enables a person first, to deal effectively with his usual diet and, secondly, to speak in comfort and articulately.  Strategic planning of the service in Ireland must be based on these objectives.  Under the Health Act, 1970, the regional health boards are obliged to provide dental treatment for those with full eligibility, that is, to medical card holders and their dependants, pupils in national schools, and all pre-school children under the child health services.</P>
    <P>This service is provided by a dedicated number of public dental officers. Every effort is being made by the boards&mdash;and they are encouraged by the Minister to do so&mdash;to provide first class clinical facilities for their dental patients.  However, as I mentioned earlier, the service is not without its difficulties and the unfortunate delays which occur in the provision of the service in no way reflect upon the ability and diligence of the staffs of the health boards.</P>
    <P>Here I propose to treat with a category who are deserving of our immediate attention especially in connection with the review.  In identifying this category I am mentioning those who, because of pressure of time, were overlooked by Deputy O'Connell.  I refer to a number of young boys and girls in my constituency and in other constituencies who are in need of orthodontic <Col N="1420" /> treatment.  It may be said that what is in question here is cosmetic.  I do not entirely accept that having regard to my earlier premise referring to diet, ability to articulate and comfort in utterance.</P>
    <P>We could add a third consideration especially in respect of young girls.  It is one of the tragedies of our time that we see girls on Sunday at Mass or in other places where young children congregate, girls aged 14, 15, 16 or 17 years, whose teeth have not been attended to.  If they had been attended to at the appropriate time, if they had not escaped the net, if they had been encompassed in the net, they could look forward to spending the rest of their days with an attractive set of teeth. Unfortunately, they now have teeth which are prominent or which do not function properly, and which are not as attractive as they might have been because they did not enjoy the service which is available in Ireland but not to the extent and not with the range which would cover all.</P>
    <P>We should all be ready to accept that improvements have occurred.  Of late&mdash;I will not say whether in the past nine months of the past year&mdash;there has been some improvement, but we cannot be happy that all children in need of the service will enjoy it.  The fact that children leave primary school and go on to post-primary education does not mean they will be deprived of the service.  But, unless they are detected at primary level, the service will be denied to them.  That is not in accordance with justice and I hope that, in the review, the special position of those children will be noted and they will get priority treatment.</P>
    <P>When discussing public dental services we must bear in mind that an extensive dental benefit scheme is available to insured persons who meet the contribution conditions laid down by the Department of Social Welfare. Over 800,000 people are entitled to this service.  Many of them would be relying otherwise on the health boards for the provision of dental treatment.</P>
    <P>I now propose to introduce my second category.  I am sure Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Boland will <Col N="1421" /> accept that the category to whom I refer are in need of special consideration. I refer not to medical card holders and not to persons covered by insurance contributions, but to the person called the middle-class housewife, the lady who in her middle-forties finds herself with four, five, six, seven or eight young children, most of whom are in need of dental treatment, and some of whom will get it only if it can be paid for privately.  The income in the house is such that surplus money is not available.  The good mother finds herself now in the appalling position that she must in the matter of dental care decide between herself and her offspring.  It is very poor acknowledgement of mothers.  Their contribution invariably is lauded by all, and having regard to the special position of the family in our Constitution, mothers must make that decision.  I hope that the review that will take place will have special regard to the position of those mothers and that we will not have that situation very much longer.</P>
    <P>I do not have to remind the House that private dental treatment is not the cheapest available.  When talking about mothers in the matter of payment of fees in question we cannot forget the fathers and husbands, but the special position of the lady has been overlooked.  I know that having been reminded, if reminder is necessary, the Minister will give to them the consideration which he has demonstrated since the duties of this office have been entrusted to him.</P>
    <P>The delays experienced by so many adults, including student medical card holders, before receiving treatment are the result of inability to supply public dental officers to match the demand from eligible persons for dental treatment.  This shortage is due not only to lack of money on the part of the health boards but also to shortage of manpower.  Bearing in mind the Minister's overall responsibility for the dental health of the community&mdash;not simply of eligible persons&mdash;I have no hesitation in saying that even if the Government were able to make an unlimited sum of money available to the <Col N="1422" /> public dental service tomorrow, the problem of promoting dental health would not go away.  I am attracted to the proposition by Deputy O'Connell in respect of the dental students.  I admit here to having a vested interest in so far as one of my family is pursuing those studies, but I have said in respect of other third level education that the beneficiary of the education does not pay for the service which he gets.  He does pay a fee but that fee does not cover the cost of the service which is given to him or to her.  The spirit of third level education, apart from the special course followed, should lead the student to an awareness of the obligation upon him to think of other people.  I am disappointed that there would seem to be a reluctance on the part of many professions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If that were so, <i>ab initio</i> we should be saying to all third level students &ldquo;You must pay entirely for that which you are receiving and that which you propose to sell in the open market.&rdquo;  I have said that before in respect of other disciplines.  I have been agitated to this thought by the proposition made by Deputy O'Connell. We cannot at any stage be accused of forcing any citizen to do anything.</P>

      <P>I am optimistic that when the opportunity arises we will see signs of improvements taking place.  The area we are discussing is not one that is responsive to immediate result.  There is the matter of preparing dentists.  Such training cannot be carried out overnight.  Rather, it involves a six- or a seven-year stint. There is also the question of accommodation and such other questions as the employment of lecturers and other staff.  As in other areas improvements can be achieved only in time, but I trust that in this case the desired results will be achieved with all possible expedition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I found both that profession of faith in the Minister for Health as enunciated by the Minister of State and the dissertation on whether the Department was of neuter gender to be rather interesting.  Perhaps, though, it is not particularly relevant to the matter under discussion. Last week, too, we had a motion to the Minister for Social Welfare and I said then that the amendment to that motion tabled by the Minister was the worst amendment tabled since this Dáil was formed.  However, this week the Minister has bettered that record by tabling an amendment to the effect that Dáil Éireann accept that the Minister intends undertaking a comprehensive review of the public dental service. This is in response to the relevant motion tabled by Deputy O'Connell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last week there are more surveys being undertaken by working bodies, review bodies, consultative councils and so on in respect of the Departments of Health and Social <Col N="1425" /> Welfare than there are problems in the Departments, and we know that those problems are numerous.  The time for talking is over.  The Minister has been in the Department long enough not to be able to point the finger at all his predecessors in office.  The Minister has had nine months in which to improve the service.  At least I can see no real improvement in the dental service in that time but in some areas I can see a disimprovement.  We are asked to accept this comprehensive review and to accept also that as soon as circumstances permit the Minister will implement the necessary improvements. In other words, live horse and you will get grass.  That amendment rivals only the amendment of last week in terms of inadequacy, inefficiency and an attempt to cover up the fact that no progress has been made either in the area of the motion we have tabled for this week or in the area of the motion that was discussed last week.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the uneven nature of the dental service, and take an example that was put forward recently by the Minister of State when he referred to the situation of a middle-class housewife in her forties whose husband is likely to be insured and, therefore, entitled to dental benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the case in which the husband is not insured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the case of the man who is insured.  His wife is not entitled to any dental benefit.  Let us say that the couple have three children, the eldest of whom is 18 and attending a third-level education institute. Legally that child is entitled to a medical card and consequently to dental benefit, but in effect what he qualifies for is a pain-only or an emergency-only service.  In that way the legal requirement is met.  There is no provision in the Act for orthodontic or other service for him.  If, say, the second child in the family is 14 and left primary school he has no entitlement to benefit although he is still attending school but at post-primary level.  If the third child is attending a <Col N="1426" /> national school he will qualify for benefit but this will only be available in some areas.  That is the situation of a typical Irish family in relation to dental services.  It is very unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>There is an obligation to have dental inspections carried out in respect of all children attending national schools. However, figures published recently indicate that in County Kikenny last year only 19.5 per cent of all children attending national schools there were inspected.  The indications are that the best inspection level is less than 50 per cent.  Having regard to the sort of service being provided in a county like Kilkenny one can only speculate as to the nature of the service provided in the more remote areas.  There must be many children attending national schools in those areas whose teeth are never inspected or, if they are inspected, the necessary treatment is not provided because of the delays involved.</P>
      <P>Because of the length of time involved between inspections and the provision of the necessary treatment the problem has probably reached the stage where restorative treatment is not possible.  There is very little preventive medicine.  There is no instruction in such matters as oral hygiene, diet control or fluoride therapy.  Such internationally recognised requirements are not met at school level. Another factor is that the service, hit-and-miss that it is, is available only to those children attending national schools.  Children attending private primary schools are not included.</P>

      <P>That situation is not satisfactory either.  The Minister has suggested that children who leave primary school at 12 are not debarred from dental treatment in the national school scheme.  I do not accept that to be the position.  My information is that only those children who leave national school and go into a school with a secondary top qualify for the service.  If a child moves from a national school to a secondary school <Col N="1427" /> that is not a secondary top he does not get treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the orthodontic service and I said what I know to be correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that not enough attention was given to orthodontics.  Let us look at the situation. Orthodontics are most needed during the adolescent years&mdash;between 12 and 16 years&mdash;when these children are inclined to have a high sugar intake. That is the very period when they are not covered by the State scheme.  The main cost of orthodontics is borne by parents who have to send their children to private dentists for treatment.</P>
      <P>Another unsatisfactory situation which needs to be changed is that the primary statutory responsibility for inspection rests with the chief medical officer of the health board, not the dental surgeon.  It is through his grace and favour that the surveys and inspections are carried out.  That is not as it should be.  Wherever the scheme is operating satisfactorily at national level, any good effect that has had achieved is to a large extent negated because children are not eligible for treatment between the ages of 12 and 16.  If they are still being educated at 16 they get a medical card but by the time they are eligible under the medical card scheme, a great deal of the work done during their formative years will have been negated because they have not had any treatment or care given during their adolescence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept it as satisfactory that children over 16 years who are full-time students and can prove they have no income and get a medical card are regarded as a low priority.  I accept the reason why this is so.  There are insufficient resources and we must have a priority list.  Therefore these <Col N="1428" /> children are listed as a low priority and are treated on a pain-only and emergency basis.  That is not right. I do not accept the suggestion that the scheme is operating satisfactorily in so far as adult holders of medical cards are receiving a satisfactory service.</P>
    <P>I especially reject the concept that there is an adequate public dental service operating in rural or remote areas for medical cards holders.  Many of these people have to travel long distances to dental clinics to receive the free treatment to which they are entitled. Then they must be on a list for a very long period for an appointment. I do not accept that they are getting the service to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 200 dentists operating in the public service trying to provide a service for approximately 1½ million people.  The figures do not add up.  One does not divide into the other and leave enough days in the week for these men to do the necessary work to provide a public dental service for medical card holders.</P>
    <P>I accept Deputy O'Connell's suggestion that a massive recruitment drive to, and a restructuring of, the public dental service is needed.  It does not appear to be an attractive profession because there are 40 vacancies at present and for a very long time past there have been even more vacancies. It has been impossible to recruit people into this service.  Why?  Because there are only two grades&mdash;a senior dental surgeon and a dental surgeon.  There are no promotional opportunities. There is no opportunity of getting involved in post-graduate work.  The attractions of the boat and the payments under the national health service in Britain and abroad are so great that a young man has a struggle to decide that he has a social obligation to the State which helped to educate him as opposed to the large sums of money and experience he can earn abroad. After some years he can come home and set up in private practice.  Until there is a complete change in the career structure and promotional opportunities in the public dental service, a sufficient number of people will not be attracted to the service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" /> I understand that in some rural areas, because of the lack of public dental clinics at accessible distances, dentists in private practice were asked to treat GMS card holders in return for payment by the health boards.  I know one man who did that.  He told me that he had washed his hands of it and would never do it again because he did not get any realistic payment for his work.  A pilot scheme was set up in Donegal and Kerry under which private dentists would provide a service for medical card holders.  All those dentists have pulled out of those schemes and refused to carry them out any further.  Why?  Because they were not paid adequately for their services.</P>
    <P>I have been given to understand that private dentists would be prepared to operate a service for medical card holders on a fee per item basis.  In other words, a choice of dentist could be provided or, if there were not a sufficient number of dentists in an area, the local dentist could provide a service for medical card holders on a fee per item basis based on the same scale of fees as is paid under the social welfare scheme.  Admittedly, the IDA are trying to negotiate for an increase in that scheme but they have indicated that they would be prepared to offer such a service.</P>
    <P>When the health boards asked private dentists to operate on their behalf they were paying one-third less than the social welfare scheme would have paid.  That is no attraction to a private dentist who is kept very busy with his private patients.  It is very hard to blame an over-worked dentist for refusing to take on such a task for the very low sum paid by the health boards.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful that under the social welfare scheme dependants of insured people are not covered for dental, aural or ophthalmic benefits.  This is an issue the Minister should consider. I was surprised during the last election at the number of people who made that kind of complaint.  Wives complained that neither they nor their children were able to obtain any of those benefits although their husbands <Col N="1430" /> were insured.  It is a silly state of affairs where a young man can go to a dentist for treatment after proving that he has six months' stamps but once he reaches 21 years of age he must have three years stamps.  If he started work at 20 years and worked for six months he would be covered for all these services for the next six months, but once he reached 21 he would go out of benefit because he had only one year's stamps and he would not be in benefit until he reached the age of 23.  That is not a comprehensive service, that is a cod.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell spoke about delays. What are the reasons for those delays?  There are a myriad of reasons: there are no auxiliaries or back-up staff, there are over-crowded and in certain cases non-existent facilities in some of the clinics and public general hospitals throughout the country, there is no specialist service at regional level, and in many cases there is not sufficient staff to operate the facilities which have been provided because there is no promotional structure.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Dental Hospital is primarily a teaching hospital.  It is under the control of the Minister for Education&mdash;although he will not fully accept that&mdash;and I think the building itself is under the control of the Minister for Health.  As the primary responsibility of the hospital is to teach the students, consequently there are long delays.  The hospital was taken over in 1963.  In 1964 there was an increase agreed in staff levels but 14 years later and with a larger population entitled to service the staff levels are the same, if not below the 1964 level.  In that hospital there is also the physical problem of space, and this leads to delays and complaints of inadequate treatment.  I am glad that the Minister of State at the Department of Education is present to hear this debate.  There is a division in ministerial responsibility in the Dublin Dental Hospital and this does not allow the proper operation of the service. The Departments of Health and Education should get together to provide a better service for the city.  I shall quote to the House the following comment from a letter:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> It now appears certain that some very highly qualified personnel with international reputations in their field will leave the Dublin hospital because of the Minister's failure to accept the Dublin Dental Hospital as a treatment hospital.</P>
    <P>The students also will seek the first boat out on qualification because the hospital is regarded solely as a teaching hospital.  Its equivalent in Britain is much better equipped.  The hospitals are much larger and they have dual staff for dual responsibility&mdash;one staff for teaching and another staff for treatment.  That is the kind of approach that must be adopted here.</P>
    <P>There is a divergence of opinion regarding the opening of a dental section in the new St. James's Hospital.  Will it be a teaching section solely, a treatment section or will it have a dual function?  In addition, will it have the capacity to train the auxiliaries whom Deputy O'Connell has urged should be introduced and whom I say will have to be introduced?  At the moment there are EEC draft directives in the course of preparation dealing with dental matters.  When they are finalised and published in autumn this year the Minister will be obliged to revise the 1928 Dentists Act.  He will be obliged to implement the EEC directives within 18 months of their adoption and those directives will state clearly that there must be auxiliaries.  It will take two or three years to train them but it will take much longer to provide the physical facilities and the teaching staff necessary to teach them.  Unless that planning is taking place now in the Department we will fail to live up to the EEC directives and we will not be able to provide a much needed service.  I hope that planning is taking place, but I suspect it is not.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Department are giving an undertaking now that in the physical planning of new hospitals&mdash; and in so far as they can in some existing hospitals where they are doing renovations&mdash;facilities will be included for dental treatment.  However, that does not operate in many of the public hospitals throughout the country. <Col N="1432" /> There is no emergency service in Dublin city after 5.30 p.m. each evening.  It is perhaps the only capital city in Europe where there is no emergency dental service provided in hospitals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no excuse for saying that it will still be the situation next year.  I am not saying it is the fault of Fianna Fáil.  I am saying it is wrong and needs to be rectified.  The Government can stand on their own feet now.  They have money to spend and they should spend it to improve this service.  I am not saying other Ministers did better, but if the present Minister wants to be known as the best Minister for Health he should do something about the matter.</P>
      <P>There is a suggestion that some dentists operating in the public service have not access to all eligible hospital patients.  They are obliged to work only with the physically or mentally handicapped or disadvantaged patients. Dentists are denied access to many people in general hospitals because the dentist must work under the director of community care who is normally a medical man.  Because of a strict interpretation of the report of the dreadful McKinsey people who ruined the health services and many other services of this country with all their reports, in some health board areas the director of community care does not allow the few dental surgeons he has to have access to some of the patients in specialised and geriatric hospitals.  That allegation was made to me by people in the profession, and if it is true it is a shame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that the Medical Protection Society in their report last year emphasised the fact that the State was not fulfilling its statutory responsibility in so far as emergency services and treatment services in some hospitals were concerned and they said the State was open to litigation.  The concern of the society was that the dentists involved in the scheme could be open to litigation, <Col N="1433" /> and it advised them to take higher than normal cover.  It it a damning indictment of our attempts to provide an emergency service that the insurance company covering the people working in the scheme are now concerned that they are open to litigation.  It appears that emergency services will be provided eventually only because people will have recourse to the courts because of the failure of the State to provide treatment for themselves and their families.  That is not the way the State should go about providing a dental <Col N="1434" /> service for citizens.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we use auxiliaries in the dental profession.  In most countries they extract baby teeth, they carry out fillings and they do scaling work, usually under the supervision of a dentist.  They do worthwhile work in this area.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy claimed disability benefit on 8 August 1977 and payment was made regularly up to 3 December 1977.  A new benefit year for women commenced on 5 December 1977 and title to benefit from that date depends on the number of contributions paid and credited in the contribution year 1976-77.  As her insurance record showed that she had less than 26 contributions in the 1976-77 year she was not entitled to benefit from 5 December 1977.  Inquiries made by my Department have established that further contributions in respect of employment in the 1976-77 year were due to her but these contributions have not yet been received.</P>
      <P>Where contributions have been deducted from pay and have not been paid over to the Department, there is provision in regulations to treat the contribution as having been paid on the due date.  The period of employment in 1976-77 mentioned has been verified and contributions have been treated as paid, as a result of which payment of benefit has been restored with effect from 5 December 1977. Arrears of benefit covering the period to 10 April 1978, after which date she was certified as fit to resume work, issued on 21 April 1978.  Inquiries such as were necessary in this case take time but every effort is made to minimise the inevitable delay.</P>

      <P>The hackney service at Shannon Airport is operated by hackney owners authorised as a result of advertisement in the local Press. Permits are granted after selection by interview by Aer Rianta Teoranta, who manage the airport on my behalf, and on payment of an annual fee of £53.  The criteria used in selection of applicants for permits include (1) the possession of an unendorsed hackney licence, (2) possession of a vehicle which will give a reasonable degree of comfort to passengers, (3) acceptance of the terms of the airport bye-laws which forbid canvassing for business, (4) willingness to accept frequent checks by officers of the airport security force as to condition of vehicle in use, (5) availability for service on a 24-hour a day basis, (6) general suitability, (7) agreement with Aer Rianta on fares.</P>
      <P>Up to 1969, the number of hackney cars authorised to operate at the airport was 15.  Three additional permits were granted in that year in the light of increased terminal traffic.  Since there was no significant increase in terminal traffic between 1969 and 1976 no further permits were granted.  As a result of a review of traffic patterns during 1977 Aer Rianta have recently advertised for additional hackney operators.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the service provided is adequate for normal airport operations.  In periods of abnormally high passenger traffic such as diversions of aircraft to Shannon, taxis can be obtained on call within 20 to 30 minutes.  There have been no complaints about the adequacy of the hackney service.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to answer Questions Nos. 343 to 348, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  On 21 April the number of boys in the special schools at Lusk, Finglas and Clonmel, which, of course, are not under the aegis of my Department, was 209.  No precise estimate of the number of boys who will be sent to Loughan House is possible since that depends on a number of factors, including <Col N="1299" /> the decisions of the courts and the recommendations of the assessment centre at Finglas: Estimates have been obtained from the Garda and the welfare service of my Department but they are of necessity very tentative.  Up to 90 boys could be accommodated at Loughan but I would hope that the actual number of boys there will not reach that figure.  The very existence of Loughan House as a special school may have the effect of ensuring that some boys who at present cannot be kept in Lusk and so on, will in future be amenable to control in these other places.</P>
    <P>2.  The number of staff in Loughan House will, to some extent, depend on the number of boys who are sent there and therefore, no precise estimate of the total number of staff is possible.  A total of 95 prison officers of various grades are being trained for the work and my intention is that a high ratio of staff to boys will be maintained. Prison officers are selected by means of an open competitive examination conducted by the Civil Service Commission consisting of a written test and interview and appointment is on order of merit.  Candidates who have a minimum educational standard of intermediate or group certificate obtain exemption from the written test.  The fundamental qualification required of any successful candidate is suitability and it is a complete distortion to suggest that the only requirement is a minimal educational one.  Every officer who is assigned to Loughan House will have had undergone the usual training course for prison officers plus a special 12-week course in child care.</P>
    <P>3.  The intention is to assign two welfare officers from the welfare service of my Department for full-time duty in Loughan House.  A psychologist is being recruited for the institution. Cavan Vocational Education Committee have already assigned four teachers&mdash;for English, Maths, History and Geography, Woodwork, Home Economics&mdash;to the institution and propose to recruit a further four&mdash;for Remedial Education Arts and Craft, Physical Education, Music.  All will be appropriately qualified.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for appropriate medical, <Col N="1300" /> dental and psychiatric care include the proposed recruitment of trained nurses.</P>
    <P>4.  I do not consider that it would be right for me to disclose the identity of persons or organisations consulted by me in relation to the Loughan House project and it would, of course, be contrary to what has always been the established practice for me to say what advice may have been given to me by my Department.  I am satisfied that I had appropriate and adequate advice.</P>

I am involved in this process only to the extent to which my sanction is required to the creation of certain permanent offices.

    <P>As regards employees other than officers, the 1978 financial allocations for the various programmes of local authorities will result in the creation <Col N="1305" /> of additional employment by them.

It would not be appropriate to have such recruitment effected through the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>In general the recruitment of employees other than officers is a matter for the local authorities themselves.

In the case of other schemes, such as roads, local authorities are requested to recruit through the local employment exchange.</P>

The holding of other elections at the same time is not precluded.  The question of whether the local elections should be held on the same day as the Assembly elections, or whether they should be held on another date in June 1979, or postponed, will be considered in due course.</P>

      <P>Water and sewerage grants are payable by my Department to encourage the installation of proper piped services in existing houses which lack these facilities.  While the amounts of the grants were substantially increased with effect from 1 November last, I do not propose to change the conditions governing the scheme in order to allow the grants to be paid in respect of new houses <Col N="1311" /> which do not qualify for new houses grants.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment why some Dublin Corporation tenant purchasers who are buying their houses under pre-1973 contracts have been informed that they will not be granted six years off their repayment periods.</P>

      <P>Tenant purchasers who bought their houses under pre-1973 tenant purchase schemes at higher prices than they would have paid under the July 1973 scheme and who are still making repayments on their houses are entitled to a reduction of up to one-quarter of the original repayment period to compensate them for the higher price paid.  This reduction may or may not amount to six years in any individual case depending on the length of the original repayment period.  Where the price under the earlier scheme was lower than the July 1973 scheme price, no entitlement to a reduction in the repayment period would arise.  Presumably the tenant purchasers referred to by the Deputy's question are in this category.</P>

    <P>I am having the information regarding the amount requested by local authorities compiled and will forward it to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Allocations totalling £19.960 million have been notified to local authorities for major water and sewerage schemes and new small schemes.  This leaves a balance of £9.275 million, the bulk of which has been earmarked for new major schemes for which loans had not been sanctioned at the time the initial allocations were being determined. Local authorities are to advise my Department when they start work on these schemes and to submit an estimate of expenditure on the basis of which an additional allocation will be made as required.</P>
    <P>Provision has also been made in this balance for the financing of contributions by local authorities to group water schemes, supplementary water and sewerage grants finance, commitments carried forward on the small schemes programme and supplemental loans on schemes in progress or completed.</P>

      <P>The allocations shown below absorb the total provision made for road grants in the Department's estimate for the current year.  As it is not the general practice for local authorities to submit requests for <Col N="1315" /> annual grant allocations, the latter part of the question does not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally to ascertain the domestic portion of the valuation of a property which has a non-domestic as well as domestic use, rating authorities assume one-third of that valuation to be domestic, subject to a maximum of £18 rateable valuation.  However, any rated occupier aggrieved at the application of this rule in his case may apply to the rating authority to have the domestic part of his valuation apportioned on a different basis.  On receipt of such application, the rating authority may, after consultation with the Commissioner of Valuation, determine differently the portion of a valuation to be regarded as domestic and domestic rates relief is then granted on this basis.</P>
      <P>The amount of the portion of the valuation in the example cited in the question to which rate exemption applies, depends on whether the rated occupier accepts the normal rule operated by rating authorities or receives a different apportionment as a result of an application to the rating authority.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of measures which will secure conservation and improvement of the existing housing stock.  This policy has been given practical encouragement by the abolition of domestic rates and the introduction as from 1 January 1978 of an improved scheme of house improvement grants and increased local authority loans for the purpose.  In the 13 weeks to 31 March 1978, the number of applications for house improvement grants was 8,209, compared with 4,578 in the same period in 1977. One of the objectives in introducing a realistic house improvement grants scheme was to increase employment in the building industry and it is estimated that employment on such works is now almost double what it was a year ago.</P>

      <P>I have no functions in regard to the control of dog numbers, and no information as to estimated numbers of unlicensed dogs.  As I stated in reply to a question on 21 February, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976 empowers planning authorities to provide shelters for stray or unwanted dogs and cats and to assist bodies providing such facilities.  A scheme of grants to assist local authorities to defray the costs of approved projects has now been worked out in agreement with the ISPCA and has been notified to the local authorities.  It is now open to the local authorities to avail of the scheme and in this way they can make an important contribution to dealing with the stray dogs' problem.</P>

      <P>The Government's decisions on the scale of the local authority housing programme, within available resources, are made from time to time, not on the basis of demand, but on the level of the ascertained genuine need for local authority housing.  The allocation of £80.77 million for local authority house building this year will ensure that activity on the programme will continue at a high level commensurate with ascertained housing needs. I am satisfied that, in the subsequent four years, full regard will be had by the Government in deciding the level of the programme to all relevant factors, including the current upsurge of private housing, and reconstruction.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my letter of 5 January 1978 to the Deputy the present method of calculating fees due to consulting engineers for the performance of services in connection with the design and construction of schemes is acceptable in both the public and private sectors and is in fact international practice.  The calculation of fees on the basis of costs actually incurred by consulting engineers in performing their consultancy function is normally reserved for work to which it would be difficult to apply a percentage scale such as work and advice in connection with litigation and arbitration.</P>

      <P>On the basis of an analysis of recent tenders for schemes submitted <Col N="1327" /> to my Department, it is estimated that the average all-in costs of one-bedroomed, two-bedroomed and three-bedroomed new local authority houses are £8,430, £9,160 and £12,640 respectively.  With effect from 1 January 1977, the Exchequer generally meets in full the loan charges incurred in the provision of local authority dwellings for letting.  Thus, the average annual cost to the Exchequer, at present, of providing a new local authority (a) one-bedroomed (b) two-bedroomed and (c) three-bedroomed house for letting, is of the order of (a) £950, (b) £1,032 and (c) £1,424 respectively.</P>

      <P>Separate estimates are not sought and separate allocations are not made to cover local authority house-purchase loan requirements.  The provision for such loans forms part of a combined allocation to provide additionally for requirements arising for reconstruction loans and supplementary grants.  The latter requirements, however, form only a small proportion of the overall amount.</P>
      <P>The estimated requirements of each local authority in 1978 for these purposes is set out in column (1) of the following statement.  As is established practice an initial allocation as set out in column (2) was made to each local authority in respect of the six month period ending on 30 June next.  A further allocation will be made to each authority in the light of expenditure to 30 June and a further assessment of their needs for the second half of this year.</P>

The main objective of the national differential rent scheme is to ensure that no one is denied housing by a local authority because of his inability to pay rent and that housing subsidies benefit those who most need them. Under the 1978 scheme, the principle of the earlier scheme that rents of local authority dwellings should be assessed on the basic income of tenants is continued and such rents are adjusted upwards or downwards to meet the changing circumstances of tenants as they arise.  In cases of hardship, however, local authorities may agree to accept from a tenant for a specified period a lesser sum for rent than that laid down under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The provisions of any national scheme of differential rents may appear to give rise to anomalies as between the rents payable by different tenants. I am satisfied that every effort has been made in the present scheme to ensure that the principle of assessing rent on basic income has been complied with while at the same time endeavouring to reduce to a minimum anomalies which might arise from the implementation of that principle.  The scheme was accepted as equitable by the National Association of Tenants' Organisations.</P>
      <P>The scheme is subject to annual review and if the Deputy will bring to my notice specific instances of anomalies, I will have these examined when the next general review of the scheme is being carried out later this year.</P>

      <P>No income limit has been specified by my Department for eligibility for rehousing by a local authority.  However, each housing authority are expected to consider at their own discretion, the circumstances of individual housing applicants, including the levels of their incomes, in deciding whether they should be approved for rehousing by the local authority, or whether they could reasonably be expected to provide accommodation from their own resources, assisted by the generous State aids provided for this purpose.</P>
