      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if for humane reasons he will now make representations to the British Government or to the United Nations that the British Army will not use CR gas in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>Our concern that CR gas should not be used in Northern Ireland has been communicated to the British authorities on several occasions and they are well aware of our feelings in this regard.</P>
      <P>As far as action at the UN is concerned, governments do not make representations in the sense meant by the Deputy but rather make their views known on specific subjects in debate and by their attitude on resolutions. The use of CR as such has not been discussed at the UN, but in debates in the disarmament context on the use of chemical weapons generally our delegations have consistently supported resolutions leading towards a ban on their use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>Over a year ago I asked a similar question and at that time the Minister assured us that the British Government had not CR gas in the Six Counties.  Since then it has been used.  According to the Press it has been used at least once in Long Kesh.  Over a year ago when I asked about CR gas I explained from what I I had read of the consequences of its use&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but in view of the seriousness of the matter and the fact that the British have acknowledged that they have used it once, would the Minister not ask them not to use such inhuman efforts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's concern on this point is supported by scientific and medical opinion in Great Britain which feels that the Government there have not published sufficiently adequate reports of the effects on humans of this substance to enable it to be properly assessed.  That is on the gas itself.  I think that there may be some misunderstanding on the part of the Deputy who seems to think the British Government had said they had used it once.  The position is that there was a suggestion that it was used at the time of the <Col N="1701" /> burning of Long Kesh of which we have no evidence.  The British have strongly denied that they used it on that occasion and that denial was reiterated in the House of Commons subsequently.  I do not think the Deputy is correct in saying that they have admitted its use.</P>
      <P>We have made our position clear. We regard it as a quite inappropriate weapon.  The Deputy mentioned that I originally said that I was informed that the British did not have it in Northern Ireland.  Speaking from recollection, my recollection is that on the occasion of a subsequent question I made it clear that later information had shown that they had got it there and we had put it to them that it should not be used.</P>

      <P>Tokyo: Ambassador: Mr. C.P. Fogarty; First Secretary: This post is at present vacant.  Third Secretary: Mr. R. Ryan.  In addition there are six locally recruited staff employed at the Embassy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I hope to be able to fill it over the coming months. Because of our current presidency of the European Community we have had to deploy staff on a temporary basis and quite a number of our missions abroad are understaffed for that reason at this time.  That position will be mitigated, although not perhaps completely remedied, at the end of the present session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>All chairmen of committees and working groups of the Council to be provided by Ireland in the period from January to June, 1975, are members of the public service. <Col N="1703" /> Ireland is providing 98 chairmen for some 189 committees and working groups.  Eighty-four chairmen are from Government Departments and offices, including one retired civil servant who is being employed on a fee basis.

      <P>I take it that the Minister has changed his mind on the composition and chairmanship of these committees since he was in opposition himself?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not recall ever discussing the question of chairmanship of committees when in opposition. Perhaps the Deputy can remind me of some occasions when I spoke on that subject?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that, from the Minister's mind as I understood it at the time, he did have a different view.  To pass on from that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I ever even considered the question of chairmanship in opposition; it was not exactly imminent in our time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has told us that there are approximately 200 subcommittees and 47 main committees, does the Minister not think it would be appropriate to have appointed to the chairmanship of some of these working committees some people who have special skill and special expertise in various areas?  You have special committees for lawyers, for the paper industry and for the various professions. <Col N="1704" /> Would the Minister not think it would be entirely desirable, if not necessary, that there should be special provision for chairmanship from outside the public service or semi-State bodies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to distinguish here between committees of working groups which are concerned with questions of government policy, in the context of the Community, and with putting forward the views of the Irish Government on matters, and other informal groupings that exist where the interests of different sectors of the Community are represented&mdash;the Economic and Social Committee and many other working parties; I do not know what exact title one gives them&mdash;and where expert advice is given by the representatives of different interests to those concerned with decision making.  The bodies with which I am concerned here are the committees and working groups of the Council of Ministers which represent governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from what the Minister has said that in fact there is no binding regulation which precludes the Government from nominating chairmen to these committees, in view of the fact that there are people there who were not in the public service, people outside the public service?  In view of that, might I suggest to the Minister, that, in some areas&mdash;in the area of the paper industry, I am giving some examples only out of 200, insurance, lawyers or any others&mdash;it would be more appropriate to have the profession or business organisation represented by chairmen for a number of reasons which must be obvious to the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is as simple as that.  It is very important that the views of these interests should be represented through their own committees which are providing advice to the Council and the Commission. We are talking here of committees which represent governments and putting forward government policy.  As far as that is concerned <Col N="1705" /> there is a danger in having somebody who represents a sectional interest putting forward a view for that sectional interest which may not be in consonance with government policy as a whole, so there is a practical difficulty there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Take, for example, the question of the legal profession. I do not know what would be the attitude of the Government to the right of establishment of lawyers under the European Community but surely it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a responsible and representative lawyer could in fact express, after consultation, the Government view, as chairman?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would not rule it out would the Minister not then consider that, in view of the lawyer's qualifications in the area&mdash;I am quoting it only as an example&mdash;it would be desirable to have a person who has such special skill?</P>

      <P>Ireland's trade agreements with the USSR, Bulgaria, Rumania and Czechoslovakia have, in accordance with our Community obligations, been terminated as from 31st December, 1974.  In assuring these countries of the continued grant of most favoured nation treatment with regard to tariff questions, taking account of traditional exceptions, the Council of Ministers has noted the need not to compromise the development of trade in any way, and has stated that it expects the State-trading countries to show evidence of the same concern.</P>
      <P>The Community presented to these and other State-trading countries in November, 1974, an outline scheme for Community agreements with these countries.  The outline scheme envisages the conclusion between the Community and individual State-trading countries of long term non-preferential trade agreements affording equivalent advantages and obligations.</P>

    <P>¹Figures quoted are for disbursements made, rather than loans approved.  Accordingly the long-term loan to the Irish Government of £208,335, approved by the Commission in December 1973, does not appear in the above table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are concerned here with the amounts actually disbursed in 1973.  As far as that goes, there was no disbursement to us.  Of course, the other thing is that this <Col N="1709" /> country, by comparison with some of the others mentioned, is not notably a large scale steel or coal producer. Therefore, one would expect that, at any time, the amount coming to this country would be relatively small, by comparison with the proportion we would get under other headings, such as agriculture, social policy or regional policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it to be a fact&mdash;the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs gave me this information in reply to a previous question&mdash;that the only application we submitted this year was in relation to a programme for re-employment of workers in the Ballingarry area, a total of approximately £1 million. That was for 1973.  That was what the Minister for Post and Telegraphs told me some time ago in the House. Is the Minister satisfied that we have considered all the possibilities of assistance out of these funds?  We may not be a major coal and steel producing country but there are, as the Minister must know&mdash;and I mentioned this at least three or four times in the House last year&mdash;many schemes, such as harbour developments and so on, re-employment of workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, it has to be detailed to some extent because the Government do not seem to be aware of these schemes.  In view of what is being made available to other countries, is the Minister satisfied that we are making a serious attempt to benefit from these funds which are not determined by way of national allocation as is, for instance, the regional fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is perhaps confused with regard to the question of years.  I have tried to explain this but I do not think I have quite got the message across.  The reference to Ballingarry refers to a <Col N="1710" /> loan for which we applied in June, 1974&mdash;two million units of account to support four industrial enterprises in that area.  The figures I have available, and the only ones that exist at present for the Community as a whole, are for 1973, disbursed in 1973, many of which were applied for in 1972.  Therefore, we are talking about different time periods and this is where the confusion arises.  When I referred to the loan for which we had applied and which was approved in 1973, but was not paid in 1973, that related to the construction of houses in Haulbowline and Arigna which considerably ante-dates the Ballingarry one.</P>

When I mentioned in the House to the Minister for Local Government, on an Adjournment debate, that there were a wide range of schemes that would qualify I did mention Ballingarry.  I am glad at least that that much has been noted.  But it is very obvious that the Government have not been pursuing our applications&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The concern of the Irish Government about the system of detention as it operates in Northern Ireland has been made clear to the British Government.  Since 14th March, 1973, various aspects of the question have been raised, on 12 separate occasions, at meetings between Irish and British Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of the release of all internees in the event of an indefinite ceasefire in Northern Ireland, the Government's view is that internment in the way it was introduced <Col N="1713" /> and the way it has operated was politically counter-productive. The continuation of that system of internment is making it more difficult to improve the political situation but the calculation of the rate at which the system can be dismantled involves security as well as political considerations and is, therefore, a matter primarily for those who have full information about the security as well as the political situation prevailing in Northern Ireland.  It is, however, our hope and the British Government know it, that in the very near future there will be both a permanent ceasefire and an end to internment in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of a permanent ceasefire, would the Government request the British Government to put an immediate end to internment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrases &ldquo;permanent ceasefire&rdquo; and &ldquo;immediate end&rdquo; are rather difficult to reconcile. A &ldquo;permanent ceasefire&rdquo; is something that one would have to see operating for a period before one could be sure of its permanency.  I should not wish to give a precise yes to the Deputy's question although the general tenure of the Government's position would be along the lines the Deputy suggests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let there be no misunderstanding regarding the word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo;.  An argument could arise as to what point it is clear that a ceasefire is permanent.  That is the only distinction I would make but in principle the Government's position would be along the lines the Deputy has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question on 7th November last.  As I told him then, agreement in principle was reached on a joint approach to the Commission on the financing of cross-Border studies during the meeting of the Taoiseach with the British Prime Minister Mr. Health at Baldonnel in September, 1973.  The agreement was reiterated at subsequent meetings with Mr. Health on 18th November, 1973 and with Mr. Wilson on 21st November, 1974.  The matter remains under discussion at official level with a view to reaching agreement on the terms of reference proposed by us for a joint approach to the commission.</P>
      <P>Time is needed to reconcile certain differences in approach between the British Government and ourselves.  I can say at this stage, however, that we are and have been for more than a year ready and willing to go ahead on an approach to the commission.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that such a submission can only be made jointly by the two Governments.  Agreement has to be reached on the proposals.  It is our concern that the proposals to be submitted to the Commission should be broadly based and review the situation with regard to the economic development of the border areas, both the north west and the north east, the latter having been suggested at one point by the British Government. Our concern is to secure agreement on that and I would prefer to keep discussing with a view to securing such agreement than to have a more narrowly based circle which would be less useful and less satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The Minister must appreciate my concern, nevertheless. This matter has been hanging fire since September, 1973.  He is now less optimistic than he was on the 7th November, 1974.  In November, 1974 the Minister said that rapid progress would be made.  On what grounds did he make that statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic principles of the Government's policy on marine environment matters in connection with the UN Conference on the Law of the Sea were set out in the Attorney General's address to the conference in Caracas on 11th July, 1974.  In his address the Attorney General indicated that Ireland considered that the recognition of coastal State jurisdiction over a wide area of sea would constitute the most effective way of ensuring compliance with international regulations in this field. Ireland would, therefore, support the concept that coastal States should have the right to enforce such regulations in the proposed economic zone which the Government consider should extend 200 nautical miles from the baselines of the territorial seas. The Attorney General also said that the Conference on the Law of the Sea should state the common conviction that States have the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The Conference will meet again in Geneva from 17th March to 10th May, 1975.

The existing sub-post offices, at Finglas and Cappagh, are still considered to cater reasonably for current needs.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree of course.  The Deputy is well aware that in the Metropolitan area distances between post offices vary widely. However, the majority of the occupied houses are within a radial distance of three-quarters of a mile from an existing sub-post office.  The three surrounding offices are regarded as catering adequately for the needs of the area at its present stage of development. We do not, of course, rule out provision of a sub-office to cater for the general area in the future.</P>

Will he also accept that 99 per cent of the families there have four or five children?  It is all right to talk about a radial mile.  A radial mile can mean an amount of hardship to a lady who is walking a mile and a half with two or three children hanging out of her.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's proper concern for his constituents. I will keep the situation under review.  Unfortunately it is not possible to ensure&mdash;though everybody pays the same, as the Deputy says, in terms of postal charges&mdash;that, for example, residents in a thickly populated old urban area do not for a time get better services than inhabitants of a newly populated area or of a thinly populated rural area.  Any Government would try to spread the benefit as well as they could but you cannot ensure immediate identity of service.  My understanding is that the number of occupied houses <Col N="1725" /> in the area went up since May last, which was the date of the Deputy's previous question, to the present figure of about 1,000 occupied houses, but that building progress there seems to have slowed down considerably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of repairs for the year ended 31st March, 1974, was about £101,000&mdash;£84,000 in Dublin and £17,000 in the provinces.</P>

      <P>I do not exclude consideration of such measures. I will mention some measures which my Department have taken to combat vandalism.  Of course those incidents which are much more numerous in Dublin city than anywhere else are mainly due to vandalism.  A total of 187 new specially designed reinforced coin boxes have been installed&mdash;185 in the Dublin area and two in the provinces.</P>
      <P>These coin boxes are proving very successful in combating vandalism.  In case the success of such measures should be contested, I might give some comparative figures.  The present figures, which Deputies may well find a bit alarming as I do myself, represent 23 per cent out of order in Dublin and 7.8 per cent in the provinces.  The comparative figures for June, 1973, were 26.6 per cent in Dublin and 7.85 per cent in the provinces.  Therefore, there has been a percentage decline although the situation is still of course far from satisfactory.  We have also fitted in about 620 kiosks steel plates to which the coin box can be bolted with the object of preventing removal of the coin box.  We have installed continuous fluorescent lighting in over 2,000 kiosks and an alarm system has been fitted in 97 kiosks which alerts the local manual exchange by lighting a special lamp if the coin box is being interfered with.  The operator then notifies the Garda.  Further alarm systems will be installed and I will be glad if any Deputy who has further ideas in this matter will communicate with my Department.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that our concern is not alone the cost to the Department but also the fact that, if there are 300 public telephones out of order throughout the State at present, they are not much use to people in an emergency.  Therefore the Minister might consider, in addition to what he has outlined, the possibility of a better security system which would be looked after by residents if kiosks were sited beside the hall doors of private residences rather than out on the street.</P>

      <P>Yes, the great majority of them I understand, were out of order as a result of vandalism. In 1974 there were 8,085 recorded incidents of vandalism in Dublin and 400 in the provinces.  These figures do not include frequent short interruptions of service caused by misuse or minor interference with the coin box &mdash;for example, the insertion of bent coins, stuffing of slots with paper or other material.  Unfortunately the incidence of vandalism in the city at least appears to have been increasing.</P>

I should like to make to the Deputy what is a constructive suggestion, which I would make also to other Deputies concerned here.  There is a scheme under which the Department would be prepared to provide a kiosk at a place like Meelick, that is under guarantee by the local authority. <Col N="1732" /> Many other local authorities have availed of this scheme, details of which will be furnished by my Department on request by the appropriate local authority or to any Deputy who may request it.</P>

I appreciate that the Castletownbere area is an isolated one and that the exchange there serves many important services including seven lighthouses, three doctors, hospital, ambulance and fire services.  I should like to say something of how this matter occurred.  The postmaster of Castletownbere was one of 15 postmasters in west Clare, Kerry and West Cork <Col N="1735" /> who ceased telephone exchange service from 6 p.m. on 24th May until 8 a.m. on 27th May, 1974, in support of a claim by six other postmasters involved relative to the amounts being deducted from their remuneration in respect of the loan of departmental telephonists.  That claim, which was under discussion with the Postmasters' Union before the postmasters concerned stopped service, was subsequently settled by agreement.  Each of the postmasters who ceased service on that occasion was warned that if he ceased to provide the service again the question of the termination of his employment would arise.</P>

At 11.30 p.m. on 24th December the postmaster withdrew normal services.  Over this Christmas period it would not have been practicable for the Department to send staff into the postmaster's premises to staff the exchange.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to hazard any guess as to what people might regard as a local authority, nor do I think it would be relevant in this debate.  But it is better, as the Deputy will appreciate, to be precise in our definitions, and it is for the purpose of having precision that we are defining it in this way.  The Bill could, I suppose, have been drafted by defining &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; in section 2 rather than putting it into section 23, and relating to it 23 rather than 23 to 2.  However, it has the same effect and it says precisely what &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; means.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to incorporate into the Bill a definition which so far has been contained only in section 23 for the purposes of section 23.  It is to give that precision to the whole Bill that we are moving this particular amendment. When I say the term &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; lacks precision I am talking about the general application of the term.

How would capital gains tax affect this in any way?  The practice will still continue of writing off the previous year's investments and things like that against the following year's profits.  What is the necessity for the amendment?</P>

      <P>The full definition to which this amendment is an addition says that capital allowances means any allowance under the provisions of the Income Tax Acts which relate to allowances in respect of capital expenditure and includes any allowance under section 241.  That would seem to indicate that unless it was already a capital allowance for income tax it would not be allowable for capital gains, which would hardly seem fair because the capital gains concept is much wider than the income tax one.</P>

      <P>That particular definition will have to be applied to different sections of the Act used in different ways and it is impossible to say in what specific way it will operate in relation to any particular section. The terminology in relation to wear and tear allowances is quite frequently wear and tear allowances, not wear and tear capital allowances or the wear and tear element in relation to the value of capital and so forth.  It is to remove any area for argument that we are being specific.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1745" /> To add to the section the following subsections:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(9)  In this Act, a reference to a gain shall be construed as meaning the relevant gain appropriately reduced in accordance with the calculation of the Central Statistics Office relating to the reduction, if any, in the value of one Irish Pound during a period commencing on the date of acquisition of the asset in respect of which the gain accrued and ending on the date of disposal of the asset.</P>
    <P>(10)  In this Act, a reference to a loss shall be construed as meaning the relevant loss appropriately reduced in accordance with the calculations of the Central Statistics Office relating to the reduction, if any, in the value of one Irish Pound during a period commencing on the date of acquisition of the asset in respect of which the loss accrued and ending on the date of disposal of the asset.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to build into the Bill a provision that will allow for inflation.  When we discussed this on Second Stage, it seemed to me that some of the arguments advanced by the Minister were not relevant to the question of allowing for inflation.  He will recall that I suggested to him at the end of that debate that he might consider this matter further.  I had hoped he would do so and we would have an amendment from him designed to achieve that objective.  However, I have not been able to discover this in the Minister's amendments unless it is very heavily disguised.</P>
    <P>The Minister argued that he could not produce an indicator that would deal with inflation because one asset may increase in value at a certain rate and another asset may increase in value at quite a different rate, or may even go down in value.  I suggested to the Minister, and I repeat my suggestion now, that this is totally irrelevant.  The rate at which the value of an asset increases is totally irrelevant to what we are trying to do here. Particularly with regard to a capital gains tax, the application of a tax to a gain in capital, the objective should <Col N="1746" /> be to tax the real gain.  If one can do that, if one can build in an indicator &mdash;as I have attempted to do in this amendment&mdash;it does not matter at what rate, or differing rates, assets may increase or decrease in value because the real gain or loss will be reflected.  That will be the item on which tax will be levied.  In other words, there will be a built-in adjustment for differing rates of increase in value of different assets.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated on Second Stage that there was no perfect indicator available in regard to the fall in the value of money.  From a purely academic point of view that is correct. There is no known system that one could stand over and say it was 100 per cent accurate but there is a system available that is considered sufficiently accurate to enable successive members of successive Governments to reply to parliamentary questions in this House and to give figures, as they do from time to time, regarding the value of the £ on a certain day with a base of two years ago, ten years or some other period.</P>
    <P>All of us have heard such replies in this House.  There is a method of calculating this used by the Central Statistics Office, considered sufficiently accurate to be used in reply to a parliamentary question and frequently used in that way.  Therefore, I suggest that what this amendment is proposing to do is feasible.  I am not suggesting in relation to this, or in relation to any other amendment in my name, that it is perfectly drafted and covers every possible angle of repercussion in other parts of the Bill.  It is not my job to do the work of the parliamentary draftsman.  Indeed, I can point out some snags in this amendment. The aim of the amendment is to bring before the House the principle involved, to suggest a method by which the objective could be achieved and, hopefully, to get the Minister to accept that principle and the method of achieving the objective.</P>
    <P>In my amendment I have suggested that where a gain is referred to in the Bill it will be taken to mean the nominal gain, suitably adjusted in accordance with the calculations of the <Col N="1747" /> Central Statistics Office as to the value of the Irish £.  There are two dates involved in any calculation of this kind.  To calculate even a nominal gain it is necessary to know the value on the date of acquisition and on the date of disposal.  If it is possible to get from the Central Statistics Office a figure that will show the value of the £ on the date of acquisition and the value on the date of disposal then one has a method of calculating the fall in the value of money in that period which I venture to suggest all but the most academically-minded person would cheerfully accept as accurate.</P>
    <P>In order to illustrate the necessity for a provision of this nature, I should like to point out a simple example to the Minister of what may happen if this is not done.  I am taking this example in order to clarify the issue and, in doing so, I am ignoring exemptions and particular years and dates that are referred to in the Bill. If one ignores them one can see more clearly what is involved.  Assuming an asset has been secured for £1,000 and that it is disposed of one year later for £1,100 then, on the principle enshrined in the Bill, there is a gain of £100.  I am suggesting that this is a nominal gain.  Let us assume that during that year inflation had been running at 20 per cent, as it was in 1974, then in real terms the sale price of £1,100 is £880.  Therefore the individual suffered a loss of £120.</P>
    <P>Unless this amendment, or something similar, is accepted in the Bill the individual involved will be paying tax on £100 which is his nominal gain, while in real terms he has suffered a loss of £120.  That example illustrates precisely what will happen unless we have built into this Bill a provision against inflation.  A few of the remarks made by the Minister on the previous stage suggested that in his opinion a capital gains tax was analogous with income tax and was a kind of a substitute for income tax in the case of people who were making capital gains.  I suggest that that is a mistake, that there are many aspects of capital gains tax that are not comparable with income tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1748" /> One thing I should like to say in relation to this amendment and that argument is this: if people are not taxed on their loss of income they should not be taxed on capital losses. Unless we can build in some provision of this nature, that is precisely what will happen.  People could be taxed on their capital losses as though they were gains.  I cannot see how the Minister can purport to justify that kind of procedure or to claim that it is equitable.  I urge the Minister to accept the principle involved in this amendment because it goes right to the root of any capital gains tax.  Failure to build in a provision of this nature will <i>ab initio</i> make the Capital Gains Tax Bill an unjust instrument of taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley makes the same mistake in his amendment as he made on the Second Stage of the Bill.  There is no such a thing as a calculation of the value of the Irish £ by the Central Statistics Office, and no question in this House has ever been answered on the basis of the calculation of the value of an Irish £ by the Central Statistics Office.  Questions have been answered about movements in consumer price index which is the only reference the Central Statistics Office has.  Therefore the basic weakness remains about the consumer price index as the proper index of the movement in the value of a capital asset.  I had hoped that Deputy Colley would have accepted that capital assets can vary in value for many reasons which do not relate to consumer price index. Indeed the value of the £ as a monetary unit can vary for many reasons which are not related to the consumer price index either.  It can happen domestically and it can happen internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Colley, with his experience as Minister for Finance, knows that internationally there is no settled way of determining the value of different currencies.  We could have a situation in which domestically there was no movement in consumer price index and yet the value of the Irish £ could vary considerably up or down in relation to a multitude of <Col N="1749" /> other currencies.  The value of any capital assets in Ireland could be a reflection not simply of Irish conditions but of demands made by foreigners on Irish assets or the acquisition of Irish assets.  The more one contemplates this thing the more one sees the multiple difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>Nobody should be in any doubt about my anxiety to ensure that people are not required to pay capital gains tax on real gains which are not a reflection of actual gains but merely reflect changes in the value of money. We had the same trouble as many other countries have had in trying to find a suitable regulator.  With the exception of Denmark and Belgium, in the EEC no countries make any attempt to provide a proper regulator. In the case of Denmark and Belgium the rates of tax are much higher.  If there was to be a sophisticated regulator built into our legislation then the argument for a low rate of tax comparable to the lowest rate of income tax would quickly evaporate.  Notwithstanding Deputy Colley's objection of the relationship between capital gains and income tax it is well established that there is a distinct connection between the two.  It is a connection which is very real indeed for people who have means surplus to their normal requirements, who are able to postpone gain on that surplus for several years in order to make, under the old code, a striking tax free gain.</P>
    <P>As we are introducing the capital gains tax the opportunity to make such a substantial gain as in the past will no longer exist.  Considering that we are proposing a low rate of capital gains tax of only 26 per cent it is still quite obvious that people with substantial means will be able to make considerable gains by investments which are designed to produce at the end of a certain period a substantial gain which will not be caught by progressive rates of income tax.  Bearing all these things in mind what we have done is to produce a low rate of tax which will take some account of the perplexities of the situation and the probability of inflation.  We have provided exemptions and thresholds <Col N="1750" /> which will ensure that in any given year people of average means will not be involved in the payment of tax. Deputy Colley's illustration does not take account of the exemptions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill any gain which was less than £500 per annum would not be subject to tax, gain on any chattel of a lesser value than £2,000 would not be involved in tax liability.  Under sections 26 and 27 sales of farms and businesses can be exempt up to £50,000 or £150,000 if the sales are on retirement to members of the close family.  I accept that Deputy Colley has said that he is not offering a waterproof amendment which would not be capable of being abused.  The Deputy is not suggesting that his amendment is a perfect instrument.  I want to assure the Deputy that I looked very carefully at this because I was anxious to achieve the objective which he had in mind.  What we have done in the Bill meets fairly well most of the problems which will be likely to be generated by any inflationary moves within a year.  It is my intention to have a frequent look at the thresholds and exemptions to see in what way they should be adjusted to compensate for inflationary developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, one has to look at several different indicators and not, as Deputy Colley has suggested, just one.  Certainly I should not merely look at the consumer price index, which in itself might not at all be related to movements in the value of capital assets.  We must try to achieve in this legislation some degree of certainty and finality.  This is necessary in the interests of fair play to the taxpayer who is entitled to know, as far as it is possible to know, what his tax liability will be.  It is also necessary, at the time when liability to tax can arise, that we have such <Col N="1751" /> machinery as will enable liability to be assessed fairly quickly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley's suggestion here would involve quite an amount of complex steps which would have to be taken by people at the time of calculation of assessment.  I am not aware that the Central Statistics Office have a day to day calculation of even what the consumer price index is.</P>

      <P>A person would require two certificates, one saying what the consumer price index was on the date of acquisition of an asset, and another saying what the consumer price index was on the date of disposal. What would happen if the items in the consumer price index had varied in the interval I just do not know.  Furthermore, the consumer price index does not determine what is the value of the £.</P>
      <P>The Germans, who are a very wise and prudent people, have a saying which is apt in these circumstances.  It is that a bad end is better than no end at all.  Nothing would be worse for the taxpayer than to live in a situation in which his tax liability, for a multitude of reasons, was uncertain and very difficult to assess.  Applying what I said on Second Stage, this is a ready and not too rough rule of assessment and a modest rate of tax is the way to overcome these difficulties, certainly in the short-term.  That, together with regular revision of the thresholds and exemptions, will deal with the problem adequately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is splitting hairs in his effort to seek to reject not just Deputy Colley's amendment as it stands but the very principle of the amendment.  As Deputy Colley has said, there may be drafting defects <Col N="1752" /> in his amendment but the principle in it is very clear.  If the Minister is to act equitably in connection with this proposed new tax, he should accept the amendment in some form or other.  The Minister is arguing against its acceptance in any form.  The only real argument he puts up is that it is too difficult to find some indicator of inflation which is universally valid.  I do not think that is so at all.</P>
      <P>As he said, one indicator of inflation, such as the consumer price index, may be misleading, but a combination of indicators would not be misleading. The Minister took issue with Deputy Colley when he referred in his amendment to the value of the Irish £ and said that questions had not been answered in this House with regard to the value of the Irish £.  Very technically that is right, but questions have been answered umpteen times over the past 30 to 40 years&mdash;and I answered them myself as Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach&mdash;on the purchasing power of the Irish £.  There would be no difficulty in this amendment in changing the word &ldquo;value&rdquo; to &ldquo;purchasing power&rdquo;.  This is purely a matter of semantics.  The Minister knows perfectly well what the amendment means and what Deputy Colley means.</P>
      <P>We have often heard questions to this effect: &ldquo;What amount of money would be needed now to purchase the same amount of goods and services as £1 purchased on 1st January, 1960?&rdquo;, or something to that effect.  That type of question is asked in this House every few months by every Opposition. The principle involved is clear. The Central Statistics Office must have a long succession of these calculations made out over a lengthy period of years.  Subject to correction I think that such a table appears in the appendix to the annual report of the Central Bank.  I am not 100 per cent certain about that but it appears in one of these annual documents.  It is an easily ascertainable figure at any given time: what is the purchasing power of the £ now as compared with ten or 20 or whatever number of years before?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Colley, I believe that, for the purpose of trying to counteract <Col N="1753" /> the effects of inflation in this Bill, this is probably the most accurate single index or indicator you can take. If the Minister wants the consumer price index, or some other one, I do not see any reason in principle why he would not agree, provided he will specify that he is prepared to put that into the Bill.  Since the Second Stage or, indeed, even in the drafting of the Bill he has not made any effort at all, in our view, to allow for the ravages of inflation.</P>
    <P>Again I would take issue with him when he says there is a direct analogy between income tax and capital gains tax.  That could be a valid statement if you lived in a situation in which there was little or no inflation, because every capital gain would be as justifiably taxed on the full gain as income is.  Of course, last year inflation ran at 20 per cent and we are given to believe that it will run even higher this year.  The example Deputy Colley gave is perfectly valid.  I know that, in a very technical way, because the amount of money he mentioned was too small, it is exempt in the Bill but the Minister should not make petty little points like that.</P>

      <P>It did not matter what figure Deputy Colley took.  It was just to show the calculation.  That calculation is valid if you take £10,000, or £50,000, or £100,000, instead of the £1,000 which Deputy Colley took.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I could give another similar example which has the same effect. If I have a farm in 1970 worth £10,000 and if in 1980 that farm is worth £20,000 and I sell it, not on retirement&mdash;I am aged under 55 years to stay outside the provisions of the Bill&mdash;I will have made a capital gain on paper of £10,000, of which £6,000 would be referable to the post-April, 1974, period.  Therefore, £6,000 would be subject to tax at 26 per cent.  I would pay £1,560 tax.  In fact, in real terms that farm was worth more to me in 1970 at £10,000 than it was in 1980 at £20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have obtained no real gain at all. <Col N="1754" /> In fact, in that sentence one could justifiably leave out the word &ldquo;real&rdquo;. I have obtained no gain because my asset value in real terms is no greater in 1980 than it was in 1970.  Even though I have obtained no gain in real terms due to inflation, I am asked to pay £1,560 in capital gains tax.  I believe that is wrong.  It is unfair. It is not a question of believing that a capital gains tax is unfair.  That is not so.  I believe that to levy a tax on a nominal paper gain, but nonetheless an acknowledged unreal gain, is inequitable. It is not just.</P>
    <P>This is an effort by Deputy Colley, on behalf of this party to write into this Bill some provision which will prevent that injustice which will otherwise take place.  We are not saying that the amendment in Deputy Colley's name should be accepted word for word.  We are saying that the principle should be accepted.  The Minister has argued against the amendment, not on the basis that the principle is wrong or unfair, but simply on minor points about differences as to what wording should be used in the amendment, and on the example given by Deputy Colley being already exempt, and so on.  These are only minor things which do not matter.</P>
    <P>The principle is there that this Bill is seeking to tax nominal but not real capital gains.  As I understand the position in other countries, there are provisions built into their corresponding legislation to overcome the injustice of what is proposed in this Bill. This Bill lacks any such provision. Deputy Colley has sought to put it in.  While the amendment may not be 100 per cent perfect from the drafting point of view, that does not matter. The draftsman, if so instructed by the Minister, can redraft it and we can recommit the section or we can deal with it on Report Stage.  The Minister, if he wants to approach the imposition of this new taxation fairly, should acknowledge this principle and accept it and say that he will have drafted an alternative to Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has a right to say it and I am not arguing <Col N="1755" /> against the desirability of having a system which would protect the taxpayer against paying tax on inflationary values but I am saying that there are several different ways of trying to do this and that our Bill achieves a compromise by having a rate equal to the lowest rate of income tax made applicable to gains.  If Deputy Colley's suggestion were feasible it could only be entertained if simultaneously all gains were to be subjected to normal rates of income tax. Let us deal with the multiples that Deputy Colley used.  I shall use them in larger figures so as to bring them outside the exemption.</P>

      <P>Yes, but you cannot introduce one principle and ignore the results of its application.  If a person were to acquire an asset for £10,000 and sell it for £11,000 a year later that person would have made a profit of £1,000 in that year.  There is no justification if that were to be corrected for inflation, for not subjecting that profit of £800&mdash;let us say&mdash; to the full rigours of income tax which at present operates from 26 per cent up to 80 per cent.  It is because we have not available to us a suitable, sophisticated corrector which can be applied with some degree of efficiency and speed that we have said we would not go for different rates of capital gains tax.  We have gone instead for the lowest rate.  That in itself provides a compensation, some relief for people who, otherwise, if they had their capital gains treated as income, would be subjected to the total rigours and, as the people who would be most liable are people who would be in the upper regions of tax rates, they would find themselves being taxed at rates up to 80 per cent under the existing code, or 70 per cent as we propose when we introduce wealth tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a number of countries.  In the short-term they treat all short-term gains as income and subject them to the full rigours of income tax.  In the countries I mentioned earlier, Denmark and Belgium, they have a not very sophisticated way of trying to compensate for inflation&mdash;they have higher rates of capital gains tax and treat them differently. One could go for different ways for treating long- and short-term gains.  One could provide, as Deputy Colley will be suggesting later, exemption for assets held over a long period or one could try to do as he suggests here, provide some form of correction by a co-efficient related to the value of money.  Or you could go for a low rate of tax and a simple system.  That is what we have done and I think it is the right thing.</P>
      <P>I remind the House of what I said on the Second Stage, that Britain in 1965 introduced a very complicated system of capital gains tax.  It was an attempt to achieve the kind of correction that Deputy Colley had in mind.  They had to abandon it five or six years later because it crumbled in their hands and, although in some cases the tax was more severe after they made the changes, the taxpayers were generally grateful for the changes because they had been driven out of their minds trying to work the complicated system which had existed before that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And they had to abandon it.  Deputy Colley tabled an amendment which he mentioned on the Second Stage which would involve 16 different rates of capital gains tax &mdash;15 plus the zero rate.  He is persisting with further amendments on this Stage to deal with something similar. If this amendment here were to be accepted and others were accepted we would end up in a ludicrous situation in which, once the rate of correction was different and went above the rate of tax, the State would find itself obliged to recognise notional or fictional losses.  Within a short time we <Col N="1757" /> would have the ridiculous position in which the capital gains tax would be a system under which the State would be obliged to subsidise the well-to-do because, taking one year with another, they would be able to show by the introduction of items of this kind that they had suffered a loss and they would seek compensation for that.</P>
      <P>I am not against the principle of not taxing increases in value which are directly related to inflation but we have adopted a system which will give very generous exemption and which will apply only the lowest rate and I believe that is the fairest way of doing it.  If, in the light of our experience of working the capital gains tax system and in the light of further examinations which are going on here and in other countries we can find a suitable regulator and indicator, we can certainly amend the law but it is preferable when we are introducing a capital gains tax for the first time that we should go for a system which is easily understood and is not too severe and which can be readily and expeditiously applied with the least undesirable economic and social consequencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we are making some progress when the Minister says that he accepts the principle involved in this.  First, I should like to disabuse him of an idea he appears to have.  He said that if one were to accept the principle of this, then the 26 per cent rate should not apply and that, in fact, ordinary income tax rates should apply.  That is a matter we can certainly discuss but may I suggest that it is totally irrelevant to this debate.  It does not matter to a man whether he is taxed at 10 per cent or 80 per cent&mdash;it matters of course&mdash;but what really is of concern to him in this discussion is if he is being taxed on a loss.  It is worse if the tax is 80 per cent and somewhat less bad if he is taxed at 10 per cent. But that is not what is at issue in this amendment; the rate of tax is not at issue.  But what is at issue is the principle of whether a taxpayer should be taxed at any rate on what is in fact a loss, with the State alleging that <Col N="1758" /> it is a gain when it is demonstrably a loss.</P>
      <P>The Minister has accepted the proposition that what appears to be a gain can, in real terms, be a loss and therefore he has accepted that you can end up under this Bill applying whatever rate of tax you like, whether the one proposed by the Minister or that proposed by us in a later amendment, to what is, in fact, a loss.</P>
      <P>I suggest again to the Minister that this is an indefensible position.  Might I pursue a little further one of the arguments the Minister made in trying to justify this position, where he referred to the differing rates at which assets can increase in value?  I should like to disabuse the Minister of an idea he appears to have about this. Might I ask the Minister to consider the position where an asset increases in nominal value by 50 per cent and inflation is 20 per cent?  If one makes the adjustment for inflation, what is the position?  Are you not then taxing the taxpayer on the real gain?  If, on the other hand, another taxpayer has an asset which increases 300 per cent but you adjust for the fall in value of money 20 per cent, then of course you are going to tax that man much more, but you are taxing him on the real gain he has made.  That is what the object of the exercise in this Bill is supposed to be and should be, the taxing of the gain.  If one man has a particular asset, which for some peculiar reason of the market&mdash;scarcity or something else&mdash;shoots up in value as compared with most other assets, then if you adjust for the fall in the value of money you automatically take in and catch that unusual and exceptional gain because you are taxing that man on his real gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister to disabuse himself of the idea that different rates of increase in the value of assets have any relevance whatever to this.  What is relevant is the real value of the gain made by the taxpayer, and that is what should be taxed.  If this principle is accepted, then the question of the rate at which it should be taxed is another matter which can be discussed; but, strictly speaking, <Col N="1759" /> it is not relevant to this at all.  I would suggest it is only really a sufficient answer for the Minister to say that the Bill proposes the lowest rate of income tax, 26 per cent.  I suggest to the Minister that that is irrelevant.  If one applies 26 per cent to what is really a loss, one cannot say that by and large one is being equitable.  One is not being equitable to the person who suffers the loss.  And thresholds, at whatever they are set&mdash;26 per cent rate of tax as against an existing top rate of 80 per cent income tax&mdash; do not alter what is involved here if one applies a tax to a loss.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to forget those things; they are not relevant to the principle involved here.  The Minister pointed out that as far as he knows the Central Statistics Office do not produce day by day the kind of figures I had in mind.  I think he is right, that they do not.  Indeed it was a matter with which I was going to deal in the amendment, but I decided it was not worth my while. There are plenty of officials at the Minister's disposal who are paid to do that kind of work.  That is not my job.  My job is to draw attention to what is really involved here, which is what I am trying to do.  But if the Minister sees some difficulty in that, it seems to me to be quite easy to relate the figures to whatever period for which the Central Statistics Office do produce them.  Then whichever of those dates is nearest to the date of acquisition and nearest to the date of disposal can be the one to be used.</P>
    <P>There is no practical difficulty involved in this.  The Minister did talk about the fact that the Central Statistics Office do not produce figures to show the fall in the value of the Irish £.  As Deputy O'Malley said, perhaps technically this is correct.  But, as Deputy O'Malley also said&mdash;re-echoing what I had said earlier&mdash;over the years parliamentary questions have been answered in this House indicating the fall in the purchasing power of an Irish £.  Whatever technical arguments one may make that this does not represent precisely the fall in the value of an Irish £, I would suggest there are very few people who <Col N="1760" /> would not accept that measure as a reasonable attempt by the Minister and by this House to deal with the problem of inflation I have been outlining.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not advance that argument; it is not a perfect answer in the academic sense.  He should not advance that argument in answer to the case made here for a very important principle, one going to the root of the Bill and one which the Minister has accepted.  I would suggest that if the Minister accepts the principle, as he says he does, then what he ought do is devote his attention, ingenuity and that of his officials to devising a workable method of dealing with this problem.  It may be one that some academic can point out that that does not deal precisely with the fall in the value of the £.  But the Minister can rest assured it will be one that the vast majority of people would accept as a genuine, worthwhile, reasonable effort to meet the problem.  I repeat that the effort to say this really cannot be approached because differing rates of increase in the value of different assets is, as I tried to demonstrate, totally irrelevant to the issue involved in this amendment.</P>
    <P>I would again urge the Minister, since he accepts the principle, not to let some practical difficulties, which are by no means enormous, stand in his way.  We have outlined sufficiently the practical way of doing this for the Minister to be able to agree he will approach it on some such basis if he really has the will so to do.  If he does not have the will so to do I would regard it as a very serious matter because, as I tried to point out, I believe this is fundamental to a capital gains tax and to reject it either on the grounds that it is not workable or on the grounds that the Minister has tried to do something about it is simply not sustainable.  As I have said, what the Minister has tried to do on the questions of exemptions and the particular rate of tax is irrelevant if one is taxing a man on a loss which, without the acceptance of this principle, is what this Bill will do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister accepts <Col N="1761" /> this principle and admits that it is fundamental, as he must, surely he must find the mechanism by which he can make the necessary adjustment in relation to what I think is a simple matter.  Everybody knows that a house built six years ago for £5,000 will cost £10,000 to build today.  Later on in the Bill the Minister has made provision for an allowance in respect of replacement&mdash;it is not chargeable where there is going to be a replacement of the assets for the time being until the owner ceases to use them.  Of course, this is tantamount to death duties, and we shall come to that later in the Bill.  But in the example I have given, of the increase in the cost of housing, it is obvious to every child in the street at present that if a man sells a house today built six years ago he will show a capital gain of £5,000 or £6,000 which would not be sufficient to replace that house at present-day costs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving an example of an asset increasing in value which in fact is not increasing in value; it is merely costing more as a result of the drop in the purchasing value of the £.  A house is as good an example as any other, despite the fact that it is one of the things that comes under the exemptions provided for in the Bill.  The same applies to any other asset.  This Bill is inequitable enough without leaving this provision unadjusted.  The Minister is doing well out of inflation already in so far as he reaps extra VAT on increased prices.  It looks as if he is to have a vested interest in inflation.  It would be necessary to adjust so as to take account of inflated prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is not prepared to accept the principle inherent in this amendment and to have available the necessary mechanism for making adjustments, he is being very naive.  The loss in the purchasing power of the £ is calculable, if not from month to month, certainly from year to year. Frequently this figure is given in the <Col N="1762" /> cost-of-living index.  Are there not sufficient inequities in the Bill without having at the beginning this inequity in relation to the devaluation of money?  The point being made in this amendment relates to the whole issue of capital gains.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept the principle in the amendment, he should withdraw the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give three examples to show precisely what we are arguing about and I shall base these on examples used earlier.  Let us take an asset acquired for £10,000 and sold for £11,000, thereby giving a profit of £1,000.  It has been argued that that profit should be reduced by 20 per cent to take account of inflation. This would reduce the profit to £800.  However, by having in the Bill an exemption of £500 in any one year, the element on that transaction that would be taxed would be £300.  Therefore, according to the Opposition's case, the tax that would be paid on that gain of £1,000 would be £78 although the £10,000 had been invested for the purpose of producing a gain of £1,000.  Nobody gets away with the low rate of taxation that the Opposition are advocating in this instance but it would be nice to think that such a rate of tax would be sufficient to provide the revenue required by the Government.</P>

If instead of doing that we were to do as other countries do in relation to gains of that nature and subject the gains in the case of a taxpayer who is liable for the top rate of income tax, the tax would be £640.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I support the amendment. In bringing in a Bill of this kind it is of vital importance that we should be clear what exactly is involved.  There is something indefinite about the proposals before us.  The Minister agrees with the principle of a corrector and, as there is no urgency in relation to this Bill, I suggest that he withdraw it and come back with other measures later.  A few days ago we were told that before Easter we are to have a Wealth Tax Bill, a Capital Acquisition Tax Bill and a Finance Bill.  This type of hurried legislation is bad.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Bill before us it would not be possible for people to know where they stand.  At least in the case of death duties, for instance, it is possible to assess the amount that would be involved and, consequently, people can have their properties valued and take out insurance policies on the basis of the valuations.  But in regard to what we are talking of here one could not assess what he would have to pay in tax if he were selling his property.  This is very bad for the economy generally.  In particular it would be detrimental in so far as foreign investors are concerned because people from America, Japan or elsewhere who might be prepared to invest here on a large scale with a view to disposing of their property after, say, 20 years, would not be encouraged by not knowing how much capital gains tax they would have to pay at the end of that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that very little revenue would accrue to the Exchequer as a result of this tax.  He said that all the capital taxation envisaged would bring in only about £15 million or £16 million per year. If the Minister does not adjust the threshold at some stage the amount that will accrue to the Exchequer by way of capital gains tax in 20 years' time will be about £100 million when one considers the rate of inflation.  On that basis, too, a property bought today for, say, £100,000 will have doubled its value in five years.  There is every indication <Col N="1765" /> that the rate of inflation will continue to increase and that next year it will be as high as 25 per cent.  The Minister said he would have a look at it but he gave no indication how he would adjust it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley's proposals should be seriously considered.  The Minister does not seem to take them into consideration. He appears to have no consideration for the taxpayers.  In his Second Reading speech he said he was concerned to ensure that there would be no difficulty in administering the Bill.  I know the Revenue Commissioners fairly well.  In my opinion they are the most competent section of the Civil Service and will be quite capable of working the Bill if Deputy Colley's amendment is accepted.  We are all here to protect the taxpayer. No individual has the same protection when he is up against sophisticated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): What I am saying is relevant.  We should build in an escalator clause to take inflation into account.  That is why I am speaking along these lines.  The average taxpayer would like to know exactly where he stands, how much he will be liable for and how much he will be allowed for capital gains in four or five years' time if inflation continues at its present rate.  The Minister should think seriously about building such a clause into the Bill and he should spell out how he will do it.  If he does that the Bill will be more acceptable.  At present it is very vague.  It says &ldquo;at some time&rdquo; and &ldquo;at the Minister's discretion&rdquo;.  It does not say when he will do it, every 12 months, every two years or every three years.  He does not say when he will adjust the thresholds.  If the Minister said he would not adjust the threshold for 20 years there is nothing in this Bill to stop him.  The Revenue Commissioners will operate the Bill as it is passed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister said in the Bill that <Col N="1766" /> he would adjust the thresholds every 12 months that would be some consolation but there is still no indication how he will do it.

Anyone who sells within the first two or three years must take the good with the bad because he is gambling.  I do not see how the Minister can give the Revenue Commissioners so much trouble.  The value of shares can be up today and down tomorrow.  Therefore, control will be impossible.  I agree with Deputy Colley when he says that the person who has a premises for five years did not set out to make a capital gains tax but it happened because of inflation.  There has been inflation throughout the world every year since 1940.  This was usually at the rate of 6 or 7 per cent but that has increased considerably in the last year or two. There should be an abatement for the person who has a property for five or ten years.  He did not set out to make capital gains tax; he was in it for business.</P>
      <P>A company in England had to sell a section of their business to keep another section going.  If that section had made a capital profit they would have been taxed.  If a man has a premises for ten years or even longer he should have to pay 10 per cent and not 26 per cent for that period.  In my view, 26 per cent should be maximum for this country.  There should be an abatement after a ten-year period.  I do not agree with Deputy Colley that the Minister should adjust the thresholds every year because we would need more Revenue Commissioners and civil servants.  That would be like the tax on dance halls which cost more to collect than it was worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at shares.  They can be bought this week and sold next week. What will be the rate of inflation for that week?  Who will work it out?  We should allow abatement for a reasonable <Col N="1767" /> period.  This will help the Revenue Commissioners catch those who are gambling on the stock exchange.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. Ministers are inclined to look at their budget every year to see what money they want.  The Minister said he accepts the principle and would like to review inflation from time to time. In this year's budget he granted old age pensioners a shade above the rate of inflation.  That rate was 20 per cent and he granted them a rise of 22 per cent.  When he was granting the tax-free allowances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister gave 15 per cent on tax-free allowances.  It could happen that in one year he was short of money, so he would not have a review until the next year.  When the next year came he might say that he would allow 10 per cent.  Another year he might allow 12½ per cent.  The rate would always be decided at the Minister's discretion.  There would be no rule of thumb.  It could be written into the Bill that on 1st January each year the Central Statistics Office would tell the Minister the rate of inflation for the past 12 months.  If it was 20 per cent that rate would stay in all capital gains for the next 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of a farm which for death duty purposes was valued at £6,000 32 years ago.  Today it is worth between £150,000 and £180,000.  It is the same farm and inflation is responsible for the difference in price.  Can anyone imagine a Minister in that 32 years not taking inflation into account in the valuation of that farm?  If we do not include something in this Bill to give people an idea of what they can expect as regards their rates of tax, we will be doing a bad day's work.  Whether one is a wage earner <Col N="1768" /> or self-employed one expects to make a gain.  Otherwise one could not live. People who invest money in property in most cases give employment.  They would like to know, before they invest their money, what would be their position if, after five or ten years, they wanted to get out.  I would say a bank manager, when deciding how much money he will lend, would like to know what tax the borrower will be liable for.</P>
    <P>To get back to the farm, that is just a life expectancy of a generation. If that farm has to be sold because the breadwinner dies or if the owner for health reasons cannot keep it on &mdash;the same would apply to the owner of a business or factory&mdash;there should be some stipulation that at least inflation is taken into account, particularly when the Minister has accepted the principle of it.  He should tie his hands and provide that on 1st January each year the inflation for the previous 12 months will be calculated on all sales for the following 12 months.  The Minister may have the idea of granting this but I know, from my 14 years here, that a Minister is always tied by the amount of money he needs and cheese-paring will go on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Belton thinks the suggestion in this amendment is cumbersome and would not be easily administered.  I would like to point out to him that leaving aside the amendment altogether the Bill envisages, in relation to each transaction which comes under the scrutiny of the Revenue Commissioners, the calculation of the cost of purchase of the asset at the date it was purchased and the value of it at the date of disposition whether by sale or, if it has to be valued, say, shares in a private company. Those two calculations are involved anyway.  The only additional <Col N="1769" /> thing that is imported by this amendment is to take that figure that they have to arrive at and adjust it by a certain percentage, whatever that percentage is depending on the inflation over the particular period.  That figure, whatever the percentage involved is, will be readily available from the Central Statistics Office.  I would suggest that the administration of this would not present any undue difficulty.</P>
      <P>We have heard the Minister describe, in certain instances that he put forward, the amount of tax that would be payable but what I would like to hear the Minister tell us is, what is his approach in the kind of case I outlined and, indeed, he outlined a similar one but in larger figures, in which there is a nominal gain but a loss in real terms.  How does the Minister apply his arguments of the rate of tax, the threshold or anything else, to a case in which although there is a nominal gain there is a real loss?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the benign system we are providing of a low rate and generous exemptions the situation visualised by Deputy Colley would not arise; there would be no calculation of loss in such a situation.  The Deputies are overlooking the tremendous exemptions that are given in the Bill.  For instance, the private residence which is the only kind of property the overwhelming majority of people have and all cash possessions are not involved because cash possessions by their nature do not involve capital gain.  We are really dealing with a very limited number of assets held by a limited number of people and even they will enjoy exemptions which will bring the vast majority outside liability for capital gains tax in relation to the ordinary management of family fortunes and family affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What you are left with then are a number of people&mdash;one does not say this with envy or wanting to generate envy&mdash;who are comparatively better off than the vast majority of citizens <Col N="1770" /> who are being asked to pay a small tax, much smaller than what people with comparatively tiny incomes have to pay in income tax.  They are being asked to pay a tax at a time of disposing of an asset when they have cash available to them which enables them to pay the tax without hardship. That is the reality of the situation. Then they pay tax at a comparatively low rate.  If they are selling off an asset which is a business asset and they decide to re-invest the proceeds of the sale in business, which is something that economically and socially we should want to promote, then no liability to tax arises.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan proceeded to illustrate the hardship that could arise where house property had increased in value.  Until I reminded him I think he was prepared to wax indignant about people who bought a home for a modest sum and then found because of inflation that the house had achieved a much greater capital value. When I reminded him that such an asset, being occupied by a person as the family home, was not involved, he said he was just illustrating what would happen to any asset.</P>
    <P>If you take land, house property, offices and so on the increase in the sale value is very often many times in excess of movements in the cost of living.  Suppose 20 per cent was the increase in the inflation rate between the time of acquisition and the time of disposal it would not be proper to say that 20 per cent of the gain was attributable to that depreciation in the value of money when, in fact, 99 per cent of the gain could be attributable to some other cause, such as the location of a shopping centre, a school or university.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept you would catch that gain if you applied this amendment?  The only adjustment you would make would be for the fall in the value of money.  If it was near a shopping centre and there was a particularly large gain you would catch that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because, in fact, 99 per cent of the gain might be attributable to location.  It could be <Col N="1771" /> attributable to scarcity of supply or it could be due to the sudden increase in the fashionability of an area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that every time questions have been asked in this House in relation to the value of the £ the reply given by successive Ministers, Taoisigh and the Parliamentary Secretaries always opened with the words: &ldquo;An estimate based on the consumer price index&rdquo; resulted in a certain figure. It has always been the consumer price index and not the value of the £ which has been involved.  I do not want to get into too much detailed argument about the particular instrument which Deputy Colley has accepted.  In his opening statement he accepted it was not the perfect instrument and that he saw the imperfections and the difficulties of administering it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not faulting him on that account.  I am saying the rates of tax and the exemptions we have given are sufficient in the short-term certainly to cover any notional loss or any real <Col N="1772" /> loss which might arise by reason of movement in the rate of inflation.  As this Bill is not the last one dealing with this or any other tax, these matters can be adjusted in the light of experience which I think is the right thing to do rather than that we should make the mistake here that was made across the water.  They started with a complicated measure and tried to deal with all the kinds of situations which have been pictured here and then they had to go back to some instrument, such as we are now proposing.</P>
    <P>In Denmark, where they have made an effort to have a regulator in respect of inflation, any profits made in the first two years of holding an asset are treated as income.  They are, therefore, subject to the full rate of income tax and as the Deputies know that could mean going up to 80 per cent.  I am not quite certain what the top rate is in Denmark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies had not.  That amendment was to start at 50 per cent and keep on going down. In Denmark they provided that all gains after the first two years would be subject to a rate of 50 per cent. This supports what I have been arguing earlier that economists, financial commentators and tax experts have been forced ultimately to the conclusion, which we have enshrined in this Bill, that the proper way of dealing with these anomalies and difficulties is to go for a comparatively low rate and to have exemptions.</P>

It would certainly not encourage the confidence Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke about.  He said that these people would know their position five, ten or 15 years ahead.  Nobody can look into the economic crystal ball today and <Col N="1773" /> say what the economic position of the world will be in 20 years' time or, indeed, on the path to 20 years' time. That cannot be forecast with any certainty. Whatever value there is in the argument for certainty it is contained in the Bill as proposed and not in the amendment.  This amendment, together with other amendments put down, would involve a multiplicity of very difficult taxation.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to a point mentioned by Deputy Colley. He spoke about £1,000 and a person making £100 gain.  I think he said that a person could do this two or three times.  I know he was talking about companies but this could be done with individuals.  A profit of £300 could be made on £3,000 and this could be called capital gains.  This is really a direct tax and income tax could be taken off it.  A person who makes capital gains has got to buy a property and sell it for profit.  If he makes a profit, it is treated as a kind of income and he makes capital gains. Surely the Minister admits that a man with a family who buys a property and after about 20 years sells it should not have to pay capital gains tax?  It would be fair enough if there was half the capital gains on it.</P>
      <P>Can a person with four or five businesses sell one and put the money into another?  If you have three different types of business, say a factory, a shop and workshop, and you put the money into the drapery business, how will the Revenue Commissioners prove that?</P>

Suppose you are in the pub business and tomorrow morning you sell out and buy a hotel, do they count the bedrooms as an addition to the pub or is it a new business?  If you sell one business and you put the money back into your other business and give employment it is nonsense to have capital gains on that.  If a small company keep a business for up to 15 years they should not have to pay a large sum in capital gains tax.  A person who is very lucky might buy a property, the situation might change or a CPO might be put on it and the value on it rocket so that that man makes a profit without doing any work so he should have to pay on it.  A family or a small business should not have to pay capital gains after a certain number of years.  A property kept for a considerable period should not have to pay any capital gains tax but if it does it should be at a lower rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat alarmed at two things the Minister said when he spoke before Deputy Belton.  The Minister, when he spoke about an asset increasing in value because, for instance, it was located in or near a shopping centre, said that 99 per cent of the increase in value could be due to this exceptional thing, and we are proposing to allow, say, 20 per cent of that to be deducted because of the fall in the value of money. That thinking suggests that the Minister is mentally discounting the whole question of the fall in the value of money.  The 20 per cent, or whatever increase in the value was due to the fall in the value of money was only a nominal increase.</P>
      <P>Therefore to talk about 99 per cent of it being due to its location or some other outside factor and that you are making the person a present of 20 per cent suggests to me that the Minister has not yet mentally faced up to what is really involved in this amendment.  That is why I am so much alarmed about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1775" /> The other thing that concerned me was that I did ask the Minister if he would explain his thinking in regard to applying capital gains tax to a situation which we have described in which there is a nominal gain but a real loss.  The Minister replied at some length, and talked about thresholds, and about rates of tax, he talked about various exemptions in the Bill and about what happens in other countries, but he did not answer my question.  The nearest he got to answering the question&mdash;and this also alarmed me&mdash;was to suggest that certain kinds of people who are well-to-do should be taxed and should not object to paying a low rate of tax in cases such as this.  I am not saying the Minister said specifically that such people should not object to paying tax, but that was the implication of what he said.  I do not want to prolong this discussion unnecessarily, but it is so important that I should like again to ask the Minister if he would tell us how he views the situation, leaving out all the questions of thresholds, rates and so on, because they are not relevant to the man who is being taxed on a real loss.  If a man has a nominal gain but a real loss, how does the Minister propose to justify doing that? That is my question to him, and it is not enough to say that, on average, it works out because other people are getting away with a lower rate of tax or they get exemptions and so on. That does not answer the question in relation to a specific case where a nominal gain is a real loss.</P>

Out of other comparable countries which, you may recall, were referred to in the White Paper, 12 countries were listed other than EEC countries, and of those, ten of them had a capital gains tax.  What we have produced is a form of taxation which, by and large, is reasonable and is not going to hurt anybody, which gives very generous exemptions and in so far as it imposes tax it imposes it at the lowest possible rate at a time when a person has a substantial amount of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what matters, that a person is in a position to pay. There have been many people under the old and only form of capital taxation in this country who suffered real loss and who were not in a position to pay the tax without severe hardship at a time of family bereavement. We are getting rid of that and we are imposing instead a tax which will be paid only if the asset is disposed of.  Death duties are payable even if families require to keep the asset.  The tax will become payable only where there is a deliberate decision by the taxpayer, knowing his liability to tax and the rate of tax, to dispose of the asset.  We are giving maximum freedom of choice.  There is the knowledge of what the exercise of choice will cost, and there is a comparatively low rate with generous exemptions.  I would remind the <Col N="1777" /> House that what we are doing is taxing capital gains since 6th April, 1974. We are not going back five, ten or 20 years.  I am not so conceited as to believe that this is the last Capital Gains Tax Bill for the next 20 years. In the light of experience of many things, fiscal, economic and social, Dáil Éireann will have further opportunity to attend to the various problems which are being identified, and I can assure the House that I will be the first, if the ideal solution presents itself while I am in the office of Minister for Finance, to come back to Dáil Éireann to deal with some of the real situations that have been identified here.  But if new methods are used they will have to look not merely at the indicator in relation to inflation but at everything else in the capital gains tax package, including the rate or rates, the exemptions and the thresholds.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1779" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, in view of the crisis in the private sector of the house building industry, provision should now be made for</P>
    <P>(a)  an increase in the local authority maximum new house loan limit to £6,000 and in the income limit to £3,000;</P>
    <P>(b)  a 50 per cent increase in new house grants;</P>
    <P>(c)  the abolition of liability for income tax on interest paid by building societies on deposits up to £5,000;</P>

    <P>(e)  the charging of fixed interest rates on building society mortgages.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Faulkner.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to emphasise that I am not accusing the Minister of doing nothing for the house building industry.  He did increase the SDA loans to £4,500 and he raised the income limit to £2,350.  This was in May, 1973.  We are now in February, 1975 and massive inflation has taken place in the interim.  We are now asking for an increase <i>pro rata</i> with the increase in inflation from £4,500 to £6,000 with an increase in the income limit from £2,350 to £3,000.  The merits of the case for the increase were made abundantly clear by Deputy Faulkner last night and also by various sectors of the building industry, local authorities and manufacturers and suppliers to the building industry.  Indeed, a factory in my own area has recently laid off 74 men and women because of the fall in the demand for their products occasioned by a decline in house building.  Today the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs admitted in reply to a question that a certain development <Col N="1780" /> in the Finglas area had slowed down recently.</P>
      <P>I shall confine my remarks in the main to parts (c), (d) and (e) of our motion which refer to the abolition of liability for income tax on interest paid by building societies, to the granting of trustee status to such societies and the charging of fixed interest rates on building society mortgages. The 7-point plan drawn up by the combined residents' associations included many of the things we are asking for in this motion, the abolition of liability to income tax, the granting of trustee status and the charging of a fixed interest rate.</P>
      <P>Young people who bought houses were faced at the time they bought with an interest rate of 8 per cent or 9 per cent.  They are now paying 11¼ per cent.  This imposes a severe burden on them.  I attended many meetings organised by ACRA and at every meeting I made the point that I agreed <i>in toto</i> with the aims of the 7-point plan but I emphasised that the way in which they secured these aims was a matter for each association individually and each individual in that association.  It was for each to decide whether or not to go on mortgage strike.  At all times I supported the 7 points.</P>
      <P>If this motion is accepted by the Minister&mdash;the merits of it are obvious &mdash;it will bring to a speedy conclusion the present unfortunate strike which nobody wants because it has caused untold hardship.  When it is finally ended there will be further hardship because these people will have to find the money to pay the societies.  Owing to circumstances outside their control many of them had to dip into the money put aside for mortgages.  I hope the Minister will intervene as he intervened in the NATO strike at the time of the change of Government and ask the building societies to give a breathing space to these young couples in which they will be enabled to catch up on the repayments they have been withholding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of an unchanging rate of interest over the mortgage period is, I am sure, one that commends itself to the Minister.  That is one thing <Col N="1781" /> we are asking for in this motion.  The abolition of liability for income tax on interest paid by the societies should result in a reduction of interest rates.  Trustee status should encourage extra finances into building societies.  All these things, if accepted, should result in an improvement in the present situation.  Mortgage interest rates have been a contributory factor to inflation.  We want to ensure that people will not again be in the position of not knowing from week to week or month to month what financial burden they will have to face in repayment of house building loans. I appeal to the Minister to increase the SDA loan from £4,500 to £6,000 and the income limit from £2,350 to £3,000.  I appeal to him to accept our motion.  If he does so, there will be an immediate fall in unemployment because both the industry itself and the suppliers of the industry will be back to full production.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of one factory in my area and, in fact, many of the workers are his constituents.  I am referring to the factory of Wavin Pipes at Balbriggan.  This company is directly affected by the cutback in the building industry.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to accept this motion so that we may get the factories into full production again.  Despite the comments of Deputy Desmond, this motion was not an ill-considered measure put down by Fianna Fáil for mischievous reasons. Our party were fully aware of the problems facing young couples who are trying to buy their homes or who are facing massive mortgage increases. We are aware of the problems of the people directly and indirectly employed in the building industry, we know the worries of those who have lost their jobs or who are on a three-day week.  If the Minister accepts the motion we can look forward to a more enlightened private housing market in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to welcome Deputy Faulkner as shadow Minister for Local Government and I hope he will continue to occupy that <Col N="1782" /> position for many years to come.  In particular, I welcome the way he made his case in this House.  It was a pretty weak case, as was evidenced by the fact that he did not sign the motion but, nevertheless, he made the best of it.  He stated hs points well and did not do it in a contentious way.  As long as he is there and I am Minister for Local Government I shall treat him with the courtesy he showed me when he was Minister and I was on the other sde of the House.</P>
      <P>All of us are aware of the very high employment content in the building and construction industry.  There are two aspects to this matter: first, the question of housing people, building factories, hospitals and schools and secondly, the employment content. Because of this the Government have seen fit to give unprecedented financial support to the industry since they took office.  In the nine-month period, April to December, 1974 we provided a total of £189 million.  This is equivalent to about £240 million in a full year.  We made this provision for a public capital programme in order to generate work in the industry.  In order to maintain employment and to secure continuity in the industry, in 1975 the provision was increased to £300 million.</P>
      <P>As usual, Deputy Burke gave half the picture with regard to employment. His limited research was apparently confined to one Press cutting and did not reveal the fact that the latest provisional figures of employment in the private sector of the construction industry show it has remained quite stable in recent months. According to the Central Statistics Office the provisional figure for employment in the industry in November, 1974 was 61,177.  This was the same as in the previous month and slightly higher than when I took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly these figures do not suggest a crisis situation in the building industry as Opposition Deputies would like us to believe.  In the last week we carried out a certain amount of checking on building around the city, particularly local authority housing schemes, and we found that the reason given by some builders for <Col N="1783" /> not making as much progress as we had expected was that they were finding it difficult to get labour.  This does not tally with the argument that there are hordes of unemployed building workers roaming the city and the country looking for employment and pulling at the coat tails of Fianna Fáil Deputies in the hope that they might take an interest in their lot&mdash;something Fianna Fáil never did in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke made great play of the fact that the previous Government in their last year of office recorded an output of 21,500 dwellings.  This figure does not compare with our housing output figure of 25,365 in 1973-74.  In any case, if Deputy Burke casts his mind back to my speech on the Estimate for my Department on 20th November, 1973, he will find I commented on this figure.  At columns 37 and 38 of the Official Report of that date I said that the output figure recorded for 1972-73 was distorted by the failure of the previous Government in 1971-72 to provide adequate finance to pay housing grants promptly when they were due.  The £3 million provided by Fianna Fáil in 1971-72 fell short by no less than £626,000 of what was needed to pay grants on houses completed that year. In turn, the figure recorded as housing completions in 1972-73 was correspondently inflated and the probable total number of houses completed in that period was 19,650.  For the record, during the last five years in office of Fianna Fáil the average number of houses completed was 15,600 each year.  Nobody shouted &ldquo;crisis&rdquo;, nobody said the building industry was falling flat on its face but now, when we are building 10,000 houses extra each year, we hear a lot of talk about a crisis.</P>
    <P>Among other things, the motion before the House deals with the question of increasing the loan and income limits for local authority house purchase loans.  Opposition Deputies have very short memories when it comes to giving the Government credit for their efforts.  I should like to put on record again the fact that when I <Col N="1784" /> came into office I immediately increased the loan limits on local authority house loans.  The increase I gave represented more than 18 per cent for the county boroughs of Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and Galway and almost 33 per cent for the rest of the country. I have increased the income limits on two occasions from £1,800 to the present level of £2,350, an increase of 31 per cent.  I increased the loan limit to £4,500.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested here that it is quite easy to increase the limits. Deputy Faulkner made a good case for people who were borrowing £4,500 and who were paying £7,000 for a house.  He was concerned about what they would do to obtain the balance of the loan.  He also made the point &mdash;one made by other Fianna Fáil speakers in the last few months&mdash; that because the limit was £4,500 people were not looking for loans. Nothing could be further from the truth.  In fact, the number of people applying for local authority loans has increased and is continuing to increase. If the local authority loans are of no use to people if the income limit is too low why is this happening? What is suggested by the Opposition is that we should put up the income limit and the amount of loans, but in my view if we do that we will be squeezing out the people at the bottom of the pile and allowing in quite a number of people who possibly should be able to find their finances elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In 1972-73 the value of loans paid by local authorities amounted to almost £11 million and in the calendar year 1974 the value of loans paid rose to £39 million, almost four times as much.  Regard must also be had to the continuing high demand for local authority loans.  At 31st December, 1974, the total value of approved and unapproved loan applications on hands of the local authorities amounted to £56 million. The number of applications on hands was 16,500.  These figures certainly do not suggest any slackening off in demand for loan facilities from the local authorities.  I wonder if the Fianna Fáil Party have gone to the trouble of checking on <Col N="1785" /> this or have they made any effort to find out what the figures were or what the effect would be.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil say that we should produce £30 or £40 million extra and put it into the SDA loans fund for the purpose of giving loans to people other than those already covered. Those already covered are people earning up to approximately £46 per week.  In reviewing the operations of this scheme I must take into account the fact that limits have encouraged builders to design houses and schemes appropriate to the needs of the persons who qualify under the scheme. Experience has shown that if the loan limit is increased the builders tend to add a bit on the top.  Because of the fact that the loan has not been increased we have had over the last few months something which was going out of fashion with builders &mdash;we have had builders advertising fixed price houses.  In other words, they do not sell houses at one price and add on bits over the period of time the houses are being built until eventually the figure which is being asked when the houses are completed bears little relation to that on which the bargain was made.</P>
    <P>During my speech on the budget I referred to reductions of £1,500 in the price of houses which builders accepted in order to get a certificate of reasonable value from my Department.  I have since discovered that there are instances of builders who reduced the price by £2,000 per house and still made a profit on the deal.  This sort of thing shows that the motion introduced by a Member of the Fianna Fáil Party is ill-conceived.  I am not surprised that Fianna Fáil have concentrated their attention on the private housebuilding industry only because the record of the previous Government on local authority housing was a very sad one.  Not alone was the number of houses being built by the local authorities very small but the standard of house being built was of very poor quality.  We still have repercussions in the Department and in this House of the ill-fated low-priced, low-cost housing schemes which local authorities were instructed to build by the previous <Col N="1786" /> Government.  They have cost much since then in having repairs carried out and in misery for tenants who went into new houses only to find that they were in many cases not a whole lot better than the ones they had left.</P>
    <P>When I took office I substantially increased the capital provision for local authority housing.  Deputies are aware of my declared intention to raise local authority housing output to a significant level as soon as possible.  In the current year the Government are providing, through the public capital programme, a total of £51 million for this type of housing.  That is double the amount provided by the former Government in their last year in office. It may be said that that has occurred only in one sector, but it is evidence that this Government are prepared to keep their promise and ensure that those unable to house themselves will be housed by the local authorities and that the State will make the necessary money available.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the public housing programme is going well.  Final figures from housing authorities are now available for the calendar year of 1974. They show 6,760 completions for the 12 months, of which 4,663 were completed in the nine-month financial period of 1974.  I hope that by the end of March we will be well on target.  The high completion rate for December means that the figure for work in progress at 10,862 by the end of December, 1974, is only slightly less than that for the end of November, 1974; but the employment figure on local authority housing was still at the high level of 6,750 men or 30 per cent greater than the employment figure at 31st December, 1973.  The number of local authority houses in planning at 18,871 also showed a significant increase on the previous month and a substantial increase of the order of 19 per cent over the previous year.  No less than 46,522 reserved sites were available for the continuance of the programme.</P>
    <P>In speaking on this motion it is natural that I should concentrate on programme output, actual and potential, but I regard the quality of output <Col N="1787" /> as important as its quantity.  Under our programme there are no shortcuts being taken.  Instructions were given by me that there should be a progressive improvement in the quality of local authority housing schemes resulting in soundly constructed houses with the emphasis on traditional skills and construction in a good environment which will encourage the developer of happy communities.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at length on local authority housing although the motion is mainly concerned with private housing because I believe we must look at the housing construction industry as a whole.  It is Government policy to raise the share of its construction programme allotted to the public sector.  The aim remains the establishment of a basic output of 8,000 public housing units per year. The main bottleneck of availability of sufficient land reserves and essential water supply and sewerage services have been, or are being overcome. Our aim now will be to build up steadily to the 8,000 figure and then maintain as far as possible continuity of output and employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner said that local authorities should build in rural areas where people want to live, instead of forcing them into towns and built-up areas.  I am glad the Deputy shares my view on this, and I hope he was influenced by what I had to say in my contribution to the debate on the budget on 21st January, as reported in the Official Report, volume 277, column 612-613:</P>
    <P>Some time back it was decided by one of my predecessors that in so far as possible people should be forced to live in settlements or villages rather than that isolated houses would be built for them in rural areas.  Being a countryman I know that people who are born and reared in the country see life in a different light from those who are reared in cities or towns.  This policy of not building isolated houses was a bad one because country people were not happy to live in built up areas.  It was their hope <Col N="1788" /> to marry and raise their families in country areas but it was only in exceptional circumstances that isolated cottages were built by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I changed that and I am glad that Deputy Faulkner agrees with me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Deputy has said I am quite happy that he is, as in many other things, in agreement with me on this matter.  I am in agreement with a number of things he has done in this regard.  County Louth is one place where the relaxation of planning permission resulted, following my taking over in this Department, in beautiful houses being built all over rural Louth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the fact is that they were being built all over rural Louth before the Minister became Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have evidence before me&mdash;because of the number of appeals which have come in from Louth &mdash;which shows that permission was refused for 100 or 150 houses because the strict planning laws which were being administered prevented them from building there.  Deputy Faulkner referred to somebody who got planning permission for 460 houses and built only 130 and then stopped.  If he is thinking of the same builder as I am thinking of, perhaps it would not have been a bad thing if he had stopped before he started building the 130.  I am not surprised that he had difficulty in selling them.  I do not think Deputy Faulkner would live in one of them at the price.  I would not. I do not think that can be used as an arguement that the building industry in doing badly.  In County Louth in particular the building industry is doing extremely well.  In Drogheda and Dundalk there is a scarcity of building workers, despite the fact that a number of people from other industries are unemployed in both towns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A new planning Bill is under consideration here and, when that Bill becomes law, somebody other than the Minister for Local Government will deal with planning appeals. I believe there is a human factor involved in the whole question of giving planning permissions and I am proud to say that in my time as Minister I have taken that into account to the best of my ability to ensure that people who want to supply themselves with houses on what I consider to be reasonable sites were given that option. This Government have provided the necessary money to enable them to be built, and they are being built and have been built.</P>
      <P>The motion calls for particular measures to be adopted in regard to building societies.  I was interested in Deputy Burke's comments about the ACRA dispute.  He did not say he tried to settle it.  He said he encouraged them not to continue on strike. There are approximately 1,000 young people around County Dublin who would have qualified for an SDA loan but, when they applied to the local authorities at the time, there was no money available because the then Fianna Fáil Government had not made the money available.  In an effort to help those people, the local authorities agreed to guarantee them to the building societies and they got building society loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite frankly, I have great sympathy for those people.  I hope it will be possible this year to do something to relieve the burden which has been placed on them.  They should never have been put in the position of repaying building society loans which they would not have got, or would <Col N="1790" /> not have had to apply for, if the Government of the day had been doing their job.  Many other people are involved in the ACRA dispute and I have had numerous discussions with them.  Despite what Deputy Burke said about telling them that they should not be on strike because they would run themselves into heavy debt, I am quite sure that he also told them about the wonderful things Fianna Fáil would do for them if they ever got back into office, but which they never thought of doing for them during all the years they were in office.</P>
    <P>I agree that many people who borrowed money at a much lesser rate than they are paying now are on strike but very many of them have fairly substantial incomes and because they are paying income tax they are getting a fairly reasonable rate for the loan.  Many of them who borrowed bridging loans from the banks at 15 or 16 or 17 per cent complain when they find that the building societies are charging 11¼ per cent.  These are the people who were on strike.  I am glad to say that a very big number of them have now decided, as they should have decided a long time ago, that there is no purpose in continuing the strike, because the only people they are doing harm to are themselves. These people have publicly stated that they propose to start paying their rates again.</P>
    <P>To suggest, as has been suggested in this motion, that there should be a fixed interest rate for building society loans is a bit of a joke particularly because the previous Minister for Local Government issued a document before he left office in which he had something to say about building society loans.  In his document &ldquo;Housing in the Seventies&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;The societies' interest rates will be matters for determination by the societies in the light of practice and the urgent need to further attract funds for new housing.&rdquo;  There is not any suggestion there that there should be a fixed interest rate on building society mortgages. If Fianna Fáil would only look at it, they would realise that it would be rather ridiculous to suggest that <Col N="1791" /> there should be a fixed interest rate. This is further evidence, if further evidence is needed, that the whole thing is a gimmick introduced in an attempt to embarrass the Government, but it is back-firing in a pretty big way.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the suggestion that the maximum loan and the income limit should be increased.  The second point in the motion is that a 50 per cent increase in new house grants should be given.  Those of us who know anything about housing are aware that, as Deputy Desmond said last night, the number of things given to the new house builder or buyer as a result of Government action is quite substantial.  This was the case when the previous Government were in office and they did not increase the loan over a long number of years.</P>
    <P>On the question of the grant, it is quite true that in many cases builders make no reference whatever to this grant but simply collect it and put it in their pockets when the price of the house is being fixed.  I should like to have a good look at this to see whether it could be passed on to the man who is buying the house, as I believe it should be.  He should get credit for it.  It should not be covered in a blanket figure which will move neither up nor down as a result of what the builder gets.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that there should be the abolition of liability for income tax on interest paid by building societies on deposits up to £5,000 is one which the Fianna Fáil Government could have dealt with during the 16 years they were in office.  Sensibly they realised that it was not a good idea.  They now have it in this motion as a gimmick. If ever by any mischance they got back into Government, I am quite sure they would conveniently forget this suggestion and we would never never hear of it again.</P>
    <P>The granting of trustee status to building societies is coming.  Shortly I will be introducing a very large volume of legislation, dealing with building societies.  They are now covered by legislation which was introduced over 100 years ago.  I propose that if the building societies are to be <Col N="1792" /> granted trustee status, as they will be &mdash;and the Minister for Finance has announced that he proposes to introduce it&mdash;there will be certain terms under which they will operate.  Fianna Fáil just thought up the idea of granting them trustee status and put it in the motion, but I should like to inform them that it has been discussed with the building societies on a number of occasions and they are well aware of the Government's approach to it.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the charging of fixed interest rates on building society mortgages.  Not only was this not agreed to by the former Fianna Fáil Government, but it was evident that they had nothing of the sort in mind.  If they were in office I would hazard a guess that, instead of the interest rate of building society loans being 11¼ per cent, which it has been since 23rd May, 1973 it would be at least 12½ per cent and, perhaps, more. I should like to warn Fianna Fáil that this sort of gimmickry does not get them anywhere, because people, particularly those affected by it, are very conscious of the assistance which the Government have given to the building societies.</P>
    <P>I should like very much to make a number of other points but as I have only two minutes left I shall have to be very brief.  The rates of mortgage interest charged by building societies are the lowest rates offered by any comparable financial institution lending money on a long-term basis.  It is remarkable that as a result of attacks made on building societies, attacks by people in the Opposition benches who should have known better, for a considerable period the net inflow of money to building societies dropped considerably.  I am glad, and I hope they will be glad to know, that position has now been reversed and the building societies are again getting in very substantial sums.  This will result in much extra money being available to those who could not qualify for an SDA loan and who will be borrowing from building societies.</P>
    <P>I repeat what Deputy Desmond said last night that while our building societies may not have been perfect <Col N="1793" /> and while many things they did in the past perhaps should not have been done, they are reputable organisations and are entitled to the full support of the public.  Any money invested with them is secure and is doing a very good job assisting in the building of houses now.  No longer are building societies able to lend money to speculators who buy pubs, hotels or large tracts of land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has failed to indicate whether he is accepting our motion but listening to his approach to this discussion I think it is quite obvious that he is not accepting our motion and intends to oppose it.  That is regrettable and the building industry and those employed in it will be greatly disappointed by the Minister's attitude and approach here tonight.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil motion suggests measures that could and should be taken by the Minister to ease the crisis in the private sector of the building industry.  Consideration of the merits of the proposal can only be justified if one accepts that there is in fact a crisis.  The Minister has steadfastly maintained that there is not a crisis in the private house building sector.  He has maintained all along that more houses than ever are being built, that more people than ever are employed in the industry and that the building societies have more money than they can lend.  We have seen these ministerial statements subsequently denied by the Construction Industry Federation, by the Building Societies Association and the Central Statistics Office records of unemployment in the building industry can be seen as a further denial of the Minister's claim that more people than ever are employed in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this adds up to a very confusing situation and the confidence of the investing public in the industry must be further eroded.  I suggest that the Minister should have availed of the opportunity presented in this debate to tackle the problem head on.  A frank admission of the true position and a programme to remedy the situation could restore much-needed confidence <Col N="1794" /> in the industry and would do much for his own credibility, factors which I consider an essential ingredient if we are to pull ourselves out of this depressing situation.  Unfortunately, the Minister did not avail of this opportunity tonight.  Instead, he has fallen back on the use of selective statistics, statistics which were never devised to monitor the up-to-date progress of the industry.</P>
    <P>It is on this that I seriously challenge the Minister's argument.  I am sure he will agree that the industry is far too important to the economy to have its future dependent on any political numbers game.  There are too many people dependent for their livelihood on the industry and too many anxious to have homes of their own for this matter to be treated in a cavalier fashion.  The statistics of completion recorded in the Quarterly Bulletin of Housing Statistics published by the Minister's Department do not record when a house was physically completed. In fact, the records merely show when the final grant was paid on a new house by the Department of Local Government.  Builders usually delay weeks and often months before applying for the grants.  An inspection must then be made and further delays of weeks and often months are involved. Later the grant is paid.</P>
    <P>We do not know the exact time lag. I should like to quote a letter in the <i>Evening Press</i> of 9th January, 1975 when somebody wrote to &ldquo;The Experts&rdquo; as follows:</P>
    <P>Why has the Local Government grant not been paid on my house in which I have been living for 13 months?</P>
    <P>The reply was:</P>
    <P>We have been informed that your builder did make application and the grants have been approved and are in the process of being paid.</P>
    <P>One might ask is this typical.  I would say it is.  If this is correct most of the 25,000 houses built in 1973-74 were actually finished during the Fianna Fáil term of office.</P>
    <P>I put it another way to the Minister: if new house grants were to be terminated at the end of a financial <Col N="1795" /> year he would have to make provision to meet commitments outstanding and I suggest&mdash;this would be quite reasonable&mdash;that three to four years later he would still be making an allocation in the Estimate to meet outstanding commitments. I have had experience of that type of situation in the Department already and I believe that example could not be challenged.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the system of collecting statistics be changed.  We in Fianna Fáil are interested in the physical completion and occupation of houses and in the financing of them.  As a suggestion, the ESB wire houses when they are completed and ready for occupation which is the last stage in a very long process.  Could the ESB supply the Minister with the number of houses that they have connected?  I do not know if that could be accepted.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there would be faults in that system but it would give an indication, especially in cities, of the number of houses actually completed and occupied.  We are anxious to get the true facts.  We believe these are required quickly so that action can be taken.  The important thing is to have an accurate, up-to-date picture of the real position in the industry at any time.  The size and importance of the industry demand that such a service be made available.  Corrective action could then be taken by the Minister at a time when such action could help to avoid or alleviate a crisis period.</P>
    <P>The Minister said last year that one of the best indicators of the level of activity in the building industry was the amount of cement being purchased. We have accurate figures on cement sales and these indicate a continuous decline in cement sales since 1973.  To illustrate that I give some figures showing the changes compared with the same quarters of the previous year. These figures are for the quarters in 1974.  In the second quarter sales were down by 1,000 tons on the same quarter in the previous year.  In the third quarter sales were down 23,000 tons and in the fourth quarter they were down 19,000 tons.  That represents a drop of roughly 5 per cent in overall cement sales.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> On the question of employment in the industry I would challenge the selective figures the Minister quoted here this evening.  I would quote to the Minister and onto the record of the House&mdash;if it has been done already it is worthy of being repeated&mdash;a cutting from <i>The Irish Independent</i> of Tuesday, 4th February, 1975.  It is an article headed &ldquo;Building Industry Has Biggest Job Losses&rdquo; by John Maddock:</P>
    <P>More people are unemployed in the building and construction industry than in any other industrial group apart from agriculture, according to figures issued by the Central Statistics Office yesterday.</P>
    <P>That would be Monday of this week. The article continues:</P>
    <P>The industry showed the biggest increase in the number unemployed for the year ending mid-December&mdash; up by 3,280 to 15,572.  Of this total 11,475 are in the &ldquo;general building construction and repair work&rdquo; sector and the remainder are in the construction and maintenance or roads, bridges and railways category.</P>
    <P>That is the truest and most accurate reflection, indicator and barometer we can look to for an accurate picture of activity and the employment position in the building industry.  Those figures are quite damning and indicate the large number of persons who have become unemployed in the building industry in recent times.</P>
    <P>Most of the building material manufacturers and merchants supplying the trade are on short time at present. Why is this so?  If the industry is booming, as the Minister says, why are the unemployment figures the highest we have seen recorded for many years?  If this boom exists, as the Minister says, or even if the building industry was holding its own, why is this so?  Why are the manufacturers of building materials and merchants supplying the trade on short time? Most of them, the larger ones, are on a three-day week.  A number of them have let off staff and, generally, the position is very depressed.</P>
    <P>The headlines on the building industry and housebuilding in recent <Col N="1797" /> times have listed sites closing down and referred to unsold houses&mdash; perhaps completed, according to the Minister's statistics, but not lived in and to builders letting staff go and to large numbers of workers in the building industry being on short time.</P>
    <P>Might I quote a principal officer in the housing grants section of the Department of Local Government, who stated at a housing conference in UCD in October last year:</P>
    <P>..., the inflow of funds to building societies dropped seriously.  This has resulted in reduced loan activity in the housing field and gave rise to concern for the housing programme and for employment in the house-building industry.</P>
    <P>That statement was made by that gentleman last October at a time when the Minister was saying that the building societies had more money than they could lend.</P>
    <P>I should like now to quote from a news release, a comment by the Construction Industry Federation, of 23rd January, 1975, which said, among other things:</P>
    <P>(a)  The live register for mid-November, 1974&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I have already given the more up-to-date figures, so there is no need to quote those.  But the federation quotes figures showing the high rate of unemployment in the building industry.  They have risen higher since, as has been illustrated by my quotation from the newspaper.  The federation's comments continue as follows:</P>
    <P>(b)  The Small Dwellings Acquisition Act loans, which supply the majority of finance for low cost private housing, have not been increased since 1973 from their present levels of £4,500 (loan maximum) and £2,350 (income limit) despite unprecedented inflation.</P>
    <P>The construction industry, representing employers in the house-building industry, are expressing concern about the effect on their volume of work caused by the level of the grant.  This is the grant we are recommending in our motion should be increased.</P>
    <P>The federation's comments continue:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1798" /> (c)  The majority of builders' providers, timber suppliers, house joinery firms, brick-making firms and some of the block-making firms are on a three-day week; in addition, most have let staff go.</P>
    <P>That is a statement from a federation concerned about employment in the building industry.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the 5 per cent drop in the sale of cement.  Much more significant is the fact that the sales of ready-mix concrete used for foundations are down by approximately 50 per cent compared with last year.  From inquiries made, it is clear that the sales of blocks and bricks are down by approximately 20 per cent to 25 per cent on last year, that is, to the private housebuilding sector in the Dublin area.  As I have said, reports from the construction industry speak of 2,000 to 3,000 unsold houses. There are no accurate figures available of the number of completed houses lying idle, but one thing is certain: the cash flow position in the building industry constitutes now a serious problem.</P>
    <P>Two years ago houses were sold before construction started.  The intending purchaser made financial arrangements well in advance of actual completion and the cash flow to the builder often commenced before work on the house had started.  It is easy to imagine the financial difficulties of builders who have to carry the cost of financing a house to completion stage until a suitable buyer arrives on the scene.  The cost of financing 2,500 completed houses, at an average cost of £7,500 at a 14 per cent interest rate is equal to £2½ million per annum.  That is equal to about £217,000 per month. If those houses were idle for say, a period of two months, the cost of building over 50 new houses would have been wasted on interest charges. The builder would legitimately add those increased costs to the overall cost of the house and so we continue on the merry price rise and contribute to further inflation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner has outlined already the main arguments in favour of our motion.  I am merely painting in <Col N="1799" /> other aspects of the problem in giving the House a full picture.  Other speakers after me will deal with other aspects. In general the purpose of our motion is to draw attention to the difficulties at present being experienced in the building industry and to suggest ways of dealing with those difficulties.  The Minister's approach has been to deny that the problem exists and then to support that argument with official statistics.  In reply to that we say that the statistics are unreliable as an accurate indicator of present-day activity in the industry and that a new system should be devised to record accurate or up-to-the minute progress reports.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister has had the benefit of a committee set up some years ago to meet regularly and record progress in the building industry.  That committee, which operates under the aegis of his Department, has representatives from the trade unions, representing the workers involved in the building industry, representatives from the employers' side of the industry, the federation, and representatives from the Department and I understand these groups bring in independent economists and statisticians to work with them.  Generally that is the type of personnel that constitutes that committee.  In the course of this important debate no reference has been made here by the Minister to the views expressed by that committee on the current position in the industry.  I would ask the Minister why?  I would consider the views of that committee much more important, more relevant to the present-day position than any statistics the Minister could quote from any source. Yet the concerned views of that important group of persons have not been referred to by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would submit to the Minister that there may be a reason why he has not done so.  If this committee has not been disbanded by the Minister, I would suspect that it cannot but be recording to him the depressed state of the private sector of the house construction industry with which we are dealing this evening.  They would <Col N="1800" /> be a much greater authority than any statistics emanating from the Department, because of the unreliability of the statistics and the fact that they are recording only grants paid which refer to houses which may have been completed and lived in for as much as two to three years.  It is well known that this has happened.  If the Minister is basing all his arguments on the fact that statistics do not record crisis, the industry is in for a very poor time and we can expect very little action from the Minister to correct or avoid further serious deterioration.</P>
    <P>Our motion is specific.  In it we refer to the maximum local authority new house loan.  This loan was fixed in May, 1973, at £4,500.  The gross price of new houses for which loans were made available by all agencies was £6,892 in June, 1973 and, according to my estimate, £9,200 in January, 1975.  This increase represents one-third on the average price in those houses during the period mentioned, and to keep pace with this situation we are suggesting that the maximum limit of the loan should be increased also by one-third.  Therefore the loan should now be fixed at £6,000.</P>
    <P>In May, 1973, the Minister was satisfied with the level of £4,500 but because of inflation and the increased cost of houses, as I have outlined, he can hardly defend the maintaining of the level at the 1973 figure.  The building societies as a source of home loans have dried up seriously, and consequently there is greater dependence on local authority loans as they are the only means by which money can be obtained for house purchase.  The problem is that the loan is not sufficient to meet the requirements of those purchasing homes&mdash;young married couples&mdash;and this situation is placing an intolerable burden on them because they must make up the balance by way of bank loans or loans from other financial institutions at interest rates of 16 per cent or 17 per cent.  We are opposed to a continuance of this situation.  If the Minister was satisfied with the level of £4,500 in 1973, he should be prepared now to increase that amount to £6,000 and in <Col N="1801" /> that way restore the level of grant to its real worth.</P>
    <P>We request also a 50 per cent increase in the level of new house grants.  Speaking at a housing conference in UCD in October the principal officer of the housing grants section of the Department said that in recent years the amount of even the maximum State grant had lost its significance in relation to the spiralling cost of houses.  He admitted that local authority grants had lost their significance. During the time the Minister has been in office there has been an unprecedented increase in the cost of housing, but he has made no move to restore the level of the grant.  In view of the low level of grants at present it is our opinion that the 50 per cent increase we are advocating would not represent a serious imposition on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I should like to query the Minister regarding the provisions in the Estimates for public expenditure for 1975. Under the heading of private house grants there is a provision of £5 million for new houses.  In 1973-74 the Department provided £6.75 million.  In the nine-month financial year of 1974 the amount provided was £4.9 million. One could say that for the nine-months last year almost £5 million was provided and for the 12 months this year only £5 million is being provided. What is the reason for this cutback in the current year?  The amount of the grant has remained unchanged and, according to the capital budget, 25,000 houses are to be built in 1975. On that basis the amount for new houses should be £6.75 million.  There has been a cutback of £1.75 million in new house grant provision in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>It is forecast that the number of grant-aided houses to be built in 1975 will be 16,000 and, given an estimate of £5 million for this purpose, the average grant for a house will be £312.5.  In the nine-month year referred to £4.9 million was provided for new houses and the number of grant-aided houses to be built was 12,602.  This gave an average grant of £388.8.  In the year 1973-74, £6.75 million was provided while the number of grant-aided houses was 17,380, the <Col N="1802" /> average amount of the grant being, therefore, £388.4.  In the year 1972-73 the average amount of the grant was £383.2.  The average amount of the grant appears a little high for the years 1972 to 1974.  The average grant for a standard size urban house is £325 and up to £450 in the case of the agricultural grant.  Because of the fact that there is an overlap between the years that the grants are paid in instalments, the average figure is higher than the £325 level.</P>
    <P>The figure of 16,000 in respect of private grant-aided houses for 1975 is calculated from the capital budget figure of 25,000 less the local authority target of 7,500 and less the 1,500 non-grant houses.  If the average grant remains at £388 the number of houses which could be built in 1975, on the basis of the £5 million that has been provided, is 12,837.  That is a drop of more than 3,000.  There is a big question there to be answered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner referred briefly to this question but the Minister avoided mentioning it in his reply.  The State has shortfallen on the amount of money <i>vis-á-vis</i> the targets it has set.  I trust that the Minister will make some statement to clarify this situation and to relieve the anxiety in relation to the financing for next year.</P>
    <P>If the amount of the grant is increased by 50 per cent, as we suggest, the additional amount required will be £2,500,000 and, according to the Minister's figures, £7,500,000 should be provided.  An amount of £7,500,000 is only £750,000 greater than the provision made in 1973-74.</P>
    <P>At some stage I should like the Minister to inform the House whether it is not true that the State are collecting more in VAT on building materials than they are paying out by way of new house grants.  If that is so, this is a serious position which should be rectified immediately, if not through the abolition of VAT or a change in the rates, then certainly by accepting this motion.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach has been to deny that this problem exists and to support this argument with official statistics.  In reply to this we say that the statistics are unreliable as an accurate indicator and we have highlighted <Col N="1803" /> the problem in the private housing sector here tonight and on other occasions in the past.  We did appreciate the Minister's response to our call for action on those occasions in the past, the £6 million from the banks to the building societies followed by another £5 million in July last.  This money was more of an admission of the facts that the difficulties existed than a genuine attempt to solve the problem.  The loans, being short-term from the society who lend on a long-term basis, must surely interfere with the allocations of loans by building societies again next year when those loans come to be repaid. However, the fact remains that we got some response to our call to action. We hope our call will not be without some response on this occasion also.</P>
    <P>As I said before, we in Fianna Fáil will not play the numbers game with the Minister.  We believe in stability, steady increase in output and security of employment.  In the November, 1973, Estimate debate I stated that it was possible that the Department statistics could record over 26,000 house completions in 1973-74.  In the event, that figure was not reached. Department statistics can record over 26,000 completions in 1974-75.  Such figures mean little in an industry where purchasers cannot obtain loans, completed houses lie idle and thousands are unemployed in the construction industry and ancillary trades.</P>
    <P>Our motion if implemented will instil confidence, restore cash flow, re-employ the unemployed and give the economy the greatest boost it got since depression set in nearly 12 months ago.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  Deputy Molloy spoke about statistics.  One important statistic in 1972-73 was that £11 million was paid out and in 1974, £39 million was paid out.  This is a relevant fact of life.  Moneys have been increased. <Col N="1804" /> Unfortunately, I have a very short time but I will deal with a few points.</P>
      <P>Deputies spoke about raising the limit to £3,000.  Do they intend to cut back the number of loans available or do they want more taxation?  They all complained about the high deficit of the budget.  Do they want the old age pensions reduced?  What do they want?  They are not making anything clear to this side of the House.  They want building societies' interest rates fixed.  If you tell a lie often enough you will believe it.  They are talking about a housing crisis since we came into government, not two years ago. In that time the construction industry has built more than 50,000 houses. There are more at work in the building industry now than there were when we took office.  They are the facts of life.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In the very short time at my disposal I want to make a few pertinent points without quoting statistics <i>ad nauseum.</i> The Minister has made a cardinal error.  He has become complacent.  He refused to accept the Fianna Fáil motion which was put down with the intention of showing that everything is not well with the construction industry.  Anyone who is involved in this industry knows that there are always problems. They will not be removed if we ignore them.  They are there, no matter which Government is in power.  We want the Coalition to admit this and deal with it.  Unfortunately, the Minister has set out to bat on a sticky wicket and in some cases he has even made a good job of it.  At the same time, he has not helped the building industry nor will he help it until he faces the truth that at the present time the industry is deteriorating.</P>
      <P>As I said, I do not want to use a spate of statistics because Deputies Molloy, Faulkner and Burke have shown clearly that this industry is deteriorating.  The Minister also brought forward convincing statistics which, I suggest, were selective.  They may well try to knock down our arguments. I am interested in the young couples and families who call on their local Deputies and queue at the local housing offices because they cannot get houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1806" /> I will quote just one statistic which was supplied by the Central Statistics Office.  Surely no one can suggest that they are fiddling with figures.  They say that there are 15,000 people unemployed in the construction industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 15,000 unemployed who could be put to work building more houses.  Unless we approach the problem in this way, we will never build the number of houses wanted.  That everything is lovely in the construction industry seems to be the thing for Ministers to say.  But if the Minister takes time off I will show him around the building sites and bring him to the builders' providers and ask them what is the state of the industry now.</P>

      <P>The Minister says there are plenty of applicants for SDA loans.  Of course there are, but there would be many more if the loans were sufficient to help people to buy houses.  The Minister says all the money that is being given is being used up.  Of course it is but enough is not being given.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Brien followed the same line as the Minister and said the loans were being taken up.  They are, just as scarce goods in a shop will be taken up and the price will rise.  That is no indication of a plentiful supply.  If the Minister would accept this motion and raise the loan limit he would bring in a whole new category of workers to avail of that loan.  Let us take the case of a young couple who have saved £1,500 which, even today, is quite a respectable sum to save.  If the house they want to buy costs £7,000 and the local authority will give a loan of only £4,500, they are still short and cannot avail of the loan.  Therefore, the loans go to a higher income group.  These are simple facts about people and if the Minister will not accept them I despair of any improvement in the industry. The Minister says they put more money into housing than the last Government but he forgets about the rampant inflation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the amount of money put into the industry is not keeping pace with the rampant inflation.  An extra million pounds looks great on paper but it is very cold comfort to the unfortunate families who are looking for houses. <Col N="1809" /> The Government have not put enough money into housing.  They say we are saying there is a doomsday situation in the building industry.  We are not saying any such thing.  The building industry will keep going, but at a slower rate.  With our increasing population we need an acceleration in the building industry.  People today demand a higher standard of living.  We must build more houses and better houses.  The Government must stop talking about statistics.  The only statistics worth bothering about are the number of families being properly housed.  The Minister says they finished X number of houses last year but many of those houses are still vacant.</P>
      <P>Both the Minister and Deputy O'Brien have convinced themselves that everything is lovely and they are very sensitive when we point out that everything is not lovely and take it as a reflection on themselves.  We are not making any reflection on them but we are telling them to face facts and not to be complacent.  It does not matter much about a Deputy becoming complacent but when a Minister in charge of housing becomes complacent we are in for a lot of trouble. The raising of income limits would also help.  It would, of course, increase the demand on the Minister's resources. We will not complain about taxation for housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is unworthy of the Minister.  The ordinary man in the street looking for a house is not terribly worried whether it comes from the present Government or from <Col N="1810" /> a Fianna Fáil Government.  We have been sent in here to deal with problems and we must ensure that we have a real increase in housing.  Anybody can build houses on paper but we want to see the houses built.  When we can tell young couples they have a reasonable chance of getting a home and when we can re-house overcrowded families then we will be seeing the beginning of the end of the housing shortage.  We must not become complacent at this stage when there are 15,000 people unemployed in the building industry and a growing demand for houses.  If we are to deny hope to young couples and families it is time we threw the job there and let somebody else do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I have said everything I had to offer.  I think I have given a very good answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to hear the Minister feels he has nothing more to offer on this amendment, because I would have thought that in the discussion earlier it had been demonstrated quite clearly&mdash;indeed, it had been agreed by the Minister&mdash;that the principle involved in the amendment was one he would support and that it was one that was capable of execution. Unfortunately, the Minister has not, despite a number of efforts from this side of the House, answered the question we put to him as to how he proposes to justify the application of capital gains tax to what is really a loss.  He did say shortly before we adjourned that he regarded what we were suggesting as an effort, I cannot remember his exact words but the sense of them was, to benefit the wealthy taxpayer.</P>
      <P>I do not know how the Minister arrives at this conclusion, considering that the amendment is trying to adjust both gains and losses in accordance with the fall in the value of money as far as one can achieve that.  That is demonstrably fair and equitable, and I am at a loss to understand what tortuous form of thought process brings the Minister round to interpreting that as trying to aid wealthy taxpayers to evade or avoid liability for tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister, having accepted the principle involved and listened to the arguments put forward on both sides, would have found it possible to say he would have his <Col N="1814" /> officials produce a scheme, as effective as they could make it, to achieve the objective of this amendment.  I can assure the Minister that, if he did so, his officials would produce a scheme which would be very acceptable to both sides of the House and to the public in general.  I am still not without hope that the Minister will do that.</P>
    <P>What he has said so far has indicated the contrary but I am hopeful that on this, the first major issue of principle involved in our discussion here, the Minister will try to set the tone for a reasoned and reasonable debate by accepting the validity of the points put forward.  He has accepted the validity of the principle involved. I do not think he can seriously suggest that it is beyond the ability or ingenuity of the officials available to him to implement that principle, a principle he says he would like to see implemented.  I would ask him again to consider approaching the matter in that way and, in particular, to bear in mind the impossible and untenable position into which he is putting himself in relation to applying capital gains tax to what are real losses as distinct from real gains.  There is no possible justification for that and the Minister has not attempted to justify it.  I do not believe it would be possible for him to justify it.  He has not attempted to do so, possibly because it is not possible, but that does not sweep the problem under the carpet. Neither is it sufficient to talk about what happens to other people or to the average taxpayer.  The fact is that the Bill, as it stands, proposes to apply taxation to losses.  While they are nominal gains they are still losses and the Minister has admitted they are losses.  This clearly is unjustifiable and the Minister has an obligation to ensure that this does not happen.  Whatever other objections he may have to the other possible consequences of accepting this amendment, I believe he must devise a method whereby tax will not be applied to real losses.  I would again urge him to assure the House that he will get the resources available to him working on devising a method of ensuring that capital <Col N="1815" /> gains tax will not be applied to what amounts to real losses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): On Second Stage we accepted the principle of capital gains. We accepted it on the grounds of real capital gains, not capital gains consequential on the devaluation of the £.  I was quite convinced at that stage that the Minister would take inflation into account.  This is something he has failed to do.  I understood at that time that he would take the fall in the value of the £ into consideration.  The Minister argues that he is going in at a low level of 26 per cent.  What will the consequences of that be in five or six years time?  In five or six years time we will see how realistic this 26 per cent is on real capital gains.  It will be running at about 40 per cent.  If the Minister fails to take the depreciation in the £ into consideration that will have a detrimental effect on the economy. He should have devised a method of adjusting values.  If he does not have such a method he will find himself in a very difficult situation and economic expansion will be detrimentally affected.  I hope he will give some indicaton that he will make an adjustment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he is starting at a low figure and he cited Denmark where they take the first two years of capital gains as actual income tax.  The Minister knows that in the second last election in Denmark the people were sick and tired of the Government and he should not have cited Denmark as a classic example.  With inflation, a property valued at £100,000 becomes in four years a property valued at £200,000, but there is no real gain.  It is not fair to tax people when there is no real gain.  On £100,000 the Minister will take £26,000 despite the fact that there was no real gain in that four years.  We want to see capital gains tax on real profits.  It is not fair to tax on a net loss.  If that property were sold some years later for £150,000 the Minister would collect a hefty sum by way of capital gains tax despite the fact that there was no gain but, <Col N="1816" /> rather, a net loss.  Some provision should be made to cover inflation.  It is difficult to prophesy with regard to the future, but we will certainly have inflation.  A specific date should be taken and the value of the £ on that date should be the rate of inflation built in for the following 12 months. That would ensure taxation on real gains.  The longer the Bill is in operation in its present form the more the Minister for Finance will collect unless some specific provision is written into the Bill.  No allowance will compensate for inflation.  In his budget recently the Minister gave an increase of only 15 per cent but inflation is running at 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>People who are prepared to develop their businesses and to invest money should know what the taxation will be.  They should not have to wait for each budget to know what allowances will be taken into consideration.  The Minister has accepted this in principle but he should tell the House that between now and Report Stage he will consider bringing in an amendment to insert in the Bill a clause dealing with inflation.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister understand that when Fianna Fáil <Col N="1817" /> were in office inflation was never like it is at the moment?  That is the root of the problem.  Unfortunately the Minister is giving the impression that he does not understand what is involved. If he does understand, his position is quite indefensible.  If he does not understand I am afraid there is nothing more we can do because we have tried our best to explain the position.  All I can say to the Minister is that this amendment goes to the root of the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  The Minister has persisted either in misunderstanding or ignoring the reality of inflation and its effect on capital gains.  He is now trying to justify the imposition of tax on a loss. If that is his approach to capital gains it is not ours.  We do not accept any responsibility either for the moral thinking behind the Bill or for the <Col N="1818" /> economic consequences mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  In those circumstances there is no question of our withdrawing the amendment.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 2 there are a few questions I should like to put to the Minister.  In relation to the definition in paragraph (b) of the word &ldquo;lease&rdquo; could the Minister give us an example of the kind of thing he has in mind in that paragraph.  That paragraph reads:</P>
      <P>... in relation to any description of property other than land, means any kind of agreement or arrangement under which payments are made for the use of, or otherwise, in respect of, property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The meaning of lease is extended to cover interests in land outside the State corresponding to a lease and also interests in other forms of property&mdash;for instance, a lease of plant.  An extended definition of legatee is also given for the purpose of dealing with assets passing on a death and it includes a <i>donatio mortis causa.</i></P>
      <P>Definitions of unit trusts and units in relation to unit trusts follow section 1 of the Units Trust Act, 1972, and the definition of &ldquo;year of assessment&rdquo; ensures that it has the same meaning for capital gains tax purposes as it has for income tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the definition of &ldquo;legatee&rdquo;.  If he will refer to line 13 on page 5 he will see that in the definition of legatee it says: &ldquo;...under a testamentary disposition or on an intestacy or partial intestacy or by survivor-ship...&rdquo; May I take it that that refers to a joint tenant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Further on in that definition there is a reference to &ldquo;...property taken under a testamentary disposition or on an intestacy or partial intestacy includes any asset appropriated by the personal representatives in or towards the satisfaction of a pecuniary legacy...&rdquo;  Would the Minister say whether the effect of this definition, together with a provision in another part of the Bill excluding money as such, or cash, from the operation of the Bill, is that in the case of an estate in which there is sufficient cash to pay a legacy without realising any of the other property the legacy being in cash is exempt from liability for capital gains tax, but if there is not sufficient cash and some of the property has to be realised in order to pay the legacy, the legacy becomes in effect liable to capital gains tax because some property had to be realised in order to produce the <Col N="1821" /> money to pay the legacy.  Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because it would be cash and this is a disposal on death. We are specifying certain definitions. We do not say in this section how transactions of this kind will be dealt with.  That is dealt with in another section. We have to specify here precisely what is meant by these different transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When looking at the definitions we have to have regard to the provisions which arise later on in the Bill.  I think I am correct in saying that while the position is stated by the Minister that a passing of property on death is not deemed to be a disposal for the purpose of this Bill, nevertheless is it not also the case that, if somebody receives a property by way of legacy, while that transaction is not deemed to be a disposal, if the legatee in due course should dispose of the property he becomes liable to capital gains tax calculated on the basis of the gain arising, taking the cost price as being that to the person who left him the legacy up to the date of disposal and the figure he gets for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, the position would appear to me to be that, if a person were entitled as a legatee to, we will say, £1,000 cash, and there were sufficient cash in the estate to pay it, that would be the end of the matter so far as the legatee was concerned, but if there were not sufficient cash and the executors or the administrators were obliged to sell some of the other property in the estate in order to pay the £1,000, that would not be the end of the matter and the legatee in due course could become liable or, alternatively, he estate could become liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the legatee receives only cash there is no question of the legatee having to pay.  The legatee would get £1,000 cash and there would be no question of any addition to that value after receipt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the purpose of this portion of the definition of the word &ldquo;legatee&rdquo; which, with your indulgence, Sir, I will read again, &ldquo;...property taken under a testamentary disposition or on an intestacy or partial intestacy includes any asset appropriated by the personal representatives in or towards the satisfaction of a pecuniary legacy...&rdquo; is to ensure that in such cases no liability for capital gains tax will arise in respect of the property taken for the purpose of satisfying the legatee? Is that the purpose of that portion of the definition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there would be a disposal in a case of that kind by the personal representative.  At the time of the disposal he would calculate whatever the appropriate capital gains tax would be on the capital disposed of.  There would be no continuing risk attaching to the recipient of the cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could there be any risk of the personal representatives becoming liable?  There should not be because there is not a disposal on death.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any such provision I presume it must be in the Continental Shelf Act.  I am wondering if there is a definition in some other statute which provides that in this context &ldquo;the State&rdquo; means our portion of the Continental Shelf.  It is stretching the meaning of the word &ldquo;State&rdquo;, as I am sure the Minister will accept, and it would be for specific purposes only.  If there is such a definition I presume it can only be in what I think is referred to as the Continental Shelf Act, which I think I introduced.  I must confess I do not recall any such provision in it but that does not mean it is not there.  I would ask the Minister between now and the next Stage to put himself in a position in which he will be able to assure us that it covers that, and give us the authority for that statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from what I understand to be the general position &mdash;and I recall the 1973 Finance Act which brought within the ambit of tax liability any profits made on the Continental Shelf&mdash;section 4 (6) specifically charges any gains accruing on the disposal of exploration or exploitation rights in a designated area.  That was taken for the purpose of this Bill <Col N="1824" /> as being the gains accruing on the disposal of assets which are situated in the State.  So, we have very specifically charged it here in this Bill itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>Lines 34 and 35 read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;resident&rdquo; and &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; have the same meanings as in the Income Tax Acts.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate whether that is intended to convey that such words are defined in the Income Tax Acts and if so, where?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not simply a matter of what is spelled out <i>in ex-tenso</i> in the Income Tax Acts but also the interpretations of the courts as to what is the meaning of &ldquo;resident&rdquo; and &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.  These have very clear meanings under the Income Tax Acts and under their interpretation by the courts and that definition covers all these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I adverted to this matter on Second Stage and I think the Minister referred to it in his reply but I am advised by a number of competent people that the word &ldquo;resident&rdquo; is defined clearly in the income tax code based on the various decisions over the years but that the term &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; is not and that there is a good deal of looseness in regard to the definition of &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; at the moment.  If there is any basis for that, the Minister should try to define it in this Bill because it has considerable significance in regard to the persons who will be liable for capital gains tax.  I do not think it is satisfactory if the definition of &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; is left vague and somewhat up in the air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that these questions have arisen for years not only in respect of income tax but also death duties, as to what is the meaning of &ldquo;resident&rdquo;, &ldquo;ordinarily <Col N="1825" /> resident&rdquo; and &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; and so on.  There were references in the Income Tax Act to &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;. For instance, section 199 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, refers to persons having &ldquo;ordinary residence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The difficulty in trying to define these things finally in legislation is that to define them in that way may lead to a presumption that any other condition is outside the definition and, therefore, not liable to tax.  It stimulates the ingenuity of people to find a way out by tax avoidance.  &ldquo;Ordinarily resident&rdquo; is something related to human behaviour and intention, something that has to be looked at on the merits of every particular case and is not something which is capable of precise statutory definition.  The same issues have arisen over the years in relation to &ldquo;domicile&rdquo;.  Here the question of intention is as important as the question of actual physical presence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is true that the question of ordinary residence may have arisen in regard to death duties, nevertheless, as a result of the definition here, that is substantially excluded because the provision is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;resident&rdquo; and &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; have the same meanings as in the Income Tax Acts.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, section 199 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 refers to ordinary residence, but that is all it does.  So does this section refer to ordinary residence but it does not help us in finding out what it means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the word &ldquo;resident&rdquo; is certainly sufficiently clearly defined not to require any further action in this Bill but it also seems to be held that &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;, on the contrary, is very ill-defined and that it is likely to lead to a great deal of confusion and difficulty and, perhaps, litigation if it is not more clearly defined for the purposes of this Bill.  It might help if the Minister could put on the record of the House an indication of what is considered to be the definition of &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; or if he could refer to decisions on this phrase.  This would not bind the Revenue Commissioners but it would be of some guidance, I think, to people <Col N="1826" /> who have to deal with this Bill in due course in relation to this phrase.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is well aware that it has been the practice of the House for Ministers not to offer themselves as legal advisers or to offer legal opinions which, in any event, are not quotable in any court of law but there is ample case law.  There are several judicial decisions which establish the meaning of &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; but, as I said earlier, they are matters that have to be determined in the light of the facts of individual cases and it is very difficult to arrive at what would be a universally applicable statutory definition and, to try to do so would, I believe, create more difficulties and generate anomalies.  In the end, I believe it would generate even further argumentation in the courts as to the meaning of the section and its applicability to a particular situation which might be generated.  I cannot make it any more precise than to say that these are matters that have to be determined in the light of individual cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty is this: people who are, with due respect to the Minister, more competent than he or I in these matters tell me that the phrase &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; is not in any way clearly defined while the word &ldquo;resident&rdquo; is.  This is why I feel that we, in this House, should not accept the phrase with its importance in the application of the Bill without a clearer indication that it has been defined.  The Minister tells us that it has been reasonably well defined on decided cases.  I would ask him in the circumstances to mention, if not the circumstances in each case, at least the titles of the cases involved. Otherwise, we may find ourselves <Col N="1827" /> having to deal with this matter again on an amendment on another Stage with an attempt to define it which, as the Minister says, might turn out to be quite unsatisfactory.</P>

Furthermore, the House is entitled to a little more information on a matter such as this, in the circumstances I have outlined.  I want to make it clear that what the Minister says in relation to the word &ldquo;resident&rdquo; is fully acceptable but, in relation to the words &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; it is not.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Minister to subsection (5), which reads:</P>
      <P>References to profits or gains in the Income Tax Acts shall not include references to chargeable gains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know what is intended by this but I should like to hear the Minister's comments on the fact that, in a Bill dealing with capital gains tax, there is this phrase: &ldquo;references to profits or gains in the Income Tax Acts shall <Col N="1828" /> not include references to chargeable gains.&rdquo;  Why should references in the Income Tax Acts to profits or gains include references to chargeable gains since this is not an Income Tax Act?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, under the Income Tax Acts, some particular profit can be called a gain and become chargeable under the Income Tax Acts.  We want to ensure we do not have duplication here so that something which is involved under the Income Tax Acts would not then be regarded here as something which would become liable to capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assumed that was the position.  But what mystified me is that provision is made here to make it clear that the words &ldquo;profits or gains&rdquo; in the Income Tax Acts will not include chargeable gains.  On the other hand the word &ldquo;resident&rdquo; or the words &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; which occur in the Income Tax Acts have the same meaning as the Income Tax Acts.  In other words, where it suits it is said such a thing referred to in the Income Tax Acts does not have the same meaning as in this Bill, and that is specifically spelt out.  On the other hand, words which appear in the Income Tax Acts and which we want to include as having the same meaning are specifically provided to have the same meaning.  On the face of it, one of those provisions appears to be unnecessary.  If similar words in the Income Tax Acts would have the same meaning in this Bill, unless otherwise specified, that is one position, and you would then have the provision about the word &ldquo;resident&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;. But if they would not have such a meaning, unless so specified, then you do not need that provision about &ldquo;resident&rdquo; and &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; and you do need the one about profits or gains.  But it seems to me one should not need both.  Otherwise, there is a risk that any word that is the same used in the Income Tax Acts and in this Bill which is not dealt with in the definitions section will produce a meaning which was not intended by this House when this <Col N="1829" /> legislation is enacted.  I wonder have I made my point clear to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Then we are providing, at subsection (5) of section 2 that:</P>
      <P>References to profits or gains in the Income Tax Acts shall not include references to chargeable gains.</P>
      <P>We must do that.  Otherwise there is the danger that they would all be brought in because they would be gains made after April, 1974.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to avoid duplication here, that anything that has already been involved and dealt with in the Income Tax Acts as a gain is not caught also as a gain under this Bill.  Residence, on the other hand, has one meaning <Col N="1830" /> only.  It would be a common meaning to the two Acts because residence is something related to the condition, the position and the intention of the individual taxpayer.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 6, line 44, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to add &ldquo;save and except that the tax shall not be assessed and charged for any year prior to such year (which shall not be earlier than the year 1974-75) as the Minister may, by order, appoint in respect of chargeable gains accruing to a person on the disposal of business assets&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to give to the Minister power, by order, to fix the commencement of the operation of the capital gains tax legislation in relation to business assets which I have not attempted to define in this but which would be easy enough by reference to definitions later on in the Bill.  It is the principle with which I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that there probably could not be a worse time from the economic point of view for the introduction of this legislation.  No matter how much the legislation might be amended, it seems very likely that its implementation at this time will have an inhibiting effect on investment generally at a time when investment was never more sorely needed. Not alone are we suffering from a record level of inflation but we are suffering also from, if not a record, almost a record, level of unemployment, with economic activity winding <Col N="1831" /> down.  More than ever investment needs to be spurred and given an incentive. For that reason I am proposing that the Minister be given power to postpone the operation of the capital gains tax in relation to business assets so that a more appropriate economic climate could be awaited before its operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well say: &ldquo;But the Bill provides, in relation to business assets, that provided any gains are invested in the business, then capital gains tax will not arise, and therefore it will not inhibit investment.&rdquo; While that may be plausible I do not think that, for a number of reasons, it is true.</P>
    <P>First, there is the question that was raised on the previous day by Deputy Fitzpatrick, and which will have to be pursued later, as to how limited is that provision, to what extent does the business in which the gain is invested have to be similar to the business from which the gain was made in order to ensure this roll-over relief. The second difficulty is that, in so far as portion of the gain is not invested in that way, it would become liable to capital gains tax at this time; and the third difficulty is that the climate created by capital gains tax legislation, particularly when the manner in which it is to operate is uncertain, is the wrong climate for the situation with which we are faced now.  This is a time when all the efforts of the Government should be directed towards creating the right climate for investment.  For these reasons, I say that to give the Minister the power to postpone the operation of the Bill in relation to business assets in the hope that he would exercise that power with discretion, and having regard to the economic climate and the requirements of the country, would be an improvement in the effectiveness of the Bill and also in the steps needed to be taken to get our economy moving again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard the argument of the orthodox Tory from Deputy Colley, that is, never do anything because now is not the right <Col N="1832" /> time; never do even what is right because now is not the opportune moment; continue postponing until times might be better.  This is the Mr. Micawber philosophy&mdash;something will turn up&mdash;hoping that, for once, it might transpire to be right.</P>
      <P>We are committed in Government to the removal of death duties.  This is a type of tax that is harmful to investment and which imposes a hardship on families and individuals at times of bereavement.  It is a disincentive to investment and to the retaining of investment.  As part of the price of abolishing death duties we must introduce a form of capital taxation which will allow people to pay their capital taxes when it is best for them to do so rather than under the existing system of death duties.  An essential part of such capital taxation reform is a capital gains tax.  We propose to abolish death duties as and from April this year, and we could not justify this move at this time without introducing simultaneously alternative capital taxes.  But these alternative capital taxes, at least in the earlier years, will not bring in as much to the State as will be lost as a result of the abolition of death duties.  One reason why this is so is that the only capital gains being taxed are those that have been made from April, 1974, and there are very few assets in respect of which gains have been made since then.  Apart from the domestic scene, this has been due to world conditions. Therefore, very much as in relation to farm taxation, there is never a better time from the taxpayer's point of view to introduce such taxes as when the market is at a valley point.</P>

      <P>Each of our partners in the EEC has a capital gains tax system.  In some cases such a system <Col N="1833" /> has been in operation for as long as 20 or 30 years.  If there is anything that might disturb investors it would be a continuation of the present system because they would expect that, regardless of which Government were in power, sooner or later a capital gains tax would come into operation. Anybody who has had any dealings with potential investors has discovered their amazement at the absence in Ireland of a capital gains tax.  These taxes operate in the US, which is a heavy investor in Ireland. They operate, too, in Norway, and Sweden and we are very likely to be getting considerable investment from Norway, and possibly, from Sweden, too, in years to come.  These future investors from outside&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In addition&mdash;and Deputy Colley has anticipated another argument I used elsewhere&mdash;the very system of a capital gains tax will, if anything, act as a discouragement to people to get out of their business investments, because by getting out they become liable for this tax whereas if they continue their investment they will not be involved in any liability for this type of tax.  Surely that is an incentive for people to continue their investments.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I do not think it is Deputy Colley's intention that the Bill be postponed in its entirety.  The Deputy had in mind certain types of assets or businesses.  The previous amendment in the name of Deputy Colley, and which was not accepted, would have been one means of inhibiting the transfer of property.  We know that many businesses and companies are run down today and that there are many old companies in respect of which it would be desirable that they be sold and modernised.  At this time of economic depression we should not discourage the transfer or the sale of the types of companies I have in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister one gets the impression that he is trying to tell us that this is a good time to introduce a capital gains tax, If the Minister believes that, he would believe anything.  He must know that the effect on investment of the introduction of a taxation of this type is inhibiting at least until such time as it has been seen in operation.  That is not necessarily to say that it should be inhibiting.  I am saying it is inhibiting.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to acknowledge the reality of the situation. The fact that he and his colleagues in the Coalition made a certain commitment in regard to death duties&mdash; I do not wish to pursue that red herring unnecessarily&mdash;is no reason for the Minister saying that, regardless of what is the situation in the economy, this Bill must be introduced.  In essence that is what he is saying.  In regard to this Bill or to any other measure for which the Minister is responsible, his primary obligation at this time must be to get our economy moving again.</P>
      <P>I am not only speaking of investment from abroad which seemed to be what the Minister thought.  I am concerned with that, of course, and will deal with it in more detail on another section.  I am also very concerned about investment from within the country.  The Minister must know that more than anything else we need investment at this stage if we are to have any hope of conquering unemployment. Unless he can say, and with good reason, that the introduction of capital gains tax on business assets will not inhibit investment in any way or diminish either the state of our economy or the chances of recovery, then in my view he is not justified in taking a step of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has not, in fact, said, although he may have implied it, that he believes this will not in any way affect investment in business either from within or from without the country.  I would be very surprised if he were prepared to make a categorical statement to that effect.  If he did make it, I would not accept it <Col N="1835" /> unless he could advance cogent reasons for that belief.  There are many reasons which could be advanced to show that that view would not be true and, indeed, common sense would indicate this to anybody who thinks about it, particularly at this time.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has quite grasped the significance of the timing.  At a time when the economy is booming, people are prepared to invest almost despite any hardship which stands in their way because they are confident that what will emerge will enable them to overcome whatever difficulties they see.  At a time like the present, it only needs the slightest difficulty visualised to inhibit investment for many people. This is my fear in relation to this Bill.  That is why I put forward this amendment.  I ask the Minister to accept the reasoning behind it.  After all, it is not taking out of the hand of the Minister the date of implementation of capital gains in regard to business assets, it is merely giving him the power to exercise one of the functions which he is obliged to exercise as Minister for Finance in relation to the management of our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that his functions extend far beyond the introduction of measures such as this or decisions on taxes, revenue and so on. The management of the economy is, <Col N="1836" /> perhaps, a more important function now than ever before requiring a good deal of delicate handling and timing. This amendment is giving the Minister power to exercise the function of management of the economy.</P>

    <P>As indicated, amendment No. 5 is out of order on the grounds that the rates of tax proposed in the earlier years would involve an increase in taxation. For that reason I put down an alternative amendment the effect of which would be to provide for a rate of tax of 26 per cent on a gain realised at any time within six years of acquisition of the asset and thereafter declining as indicated in the amendment until, after 15 years, it would be 1 per cent and thereafter nil.</P>
    <P>This is not, of course, our first choice which was indicated in the amendment ruled out of order and indicated <Col N="1837" /> on Second Stage.  This in my view is the second major principle in capital gains tax on which this Bill, as drafted, is wrong.  The first, which we discussed earlier, provided for inflation. This goes even more to the root of a capital gains tax.  We want to see a much higher rate of taxation than that proposed by the Minister on gains made in the earlier years, particularly those made within one year.  On the other hand, we wanted to provide that where the asset has been held for a long time the tax should be less.  There is no accurate way&mdash;and I stated this on Second Stage&mdash;by which one can distinguish between speculators and people who put their time, skills and energy into building up a business.  There is not any way this can be done perfectly. But we can go some of the road on this.  One aspect of that is contained in this amendment.  The other is contained in the following amendment with which we shall deal later.</P>
    <P>What is involved in this amendment is a recognition of the fact that if a person has held an asset for a number of years&mdash;and the asset can be that person's business, including the goodwill which was built up over the years &mdash;and there is a gain, one should distinguish between that person and the speculator.  The speculator may make a profit in maybe a matter of months, certainly within a year, with little or no economic input into the asset.  We are trying to distinguish between these. We do not say that this distinguishes perfectly but it goes some of the way. The approach which the Minister has embodied in the Bill of a flat rate of 26 per cent across the board, irrespective of when or how the profit was made, is to our minds totally wrong. For that reason we are urging in this amendment&mdash;we are not entitled to urge a higher rate of tax for the earlier years&mdash;for a lower rate of tax for the later years tapering off after 15 years to nil.  We discussed this on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister would see the force of the argument, particularly as it was reinforced from his own benches. but on the basis of amendments put forward by him he has not apparently seen the force of the argument. <Col N="1838" /> I hope he will now because what is involved in this is extremely important. This House should not try to treat in exactly the same way, for the purpose of capital gains tax, on the one hand the man who makes the quick buck and puts nothing into it and, on the other, the man who spent years building up a business.  That is what this Bill is doing and that is what this amendment is designed to change.</P>

      <P>I have heard and I understand all the arguments but like most arguments there are two sides so let me put the other side.  The scheme as proposed by Fianna Fáil on the amendment is less than they wanted to do.  They wanted to bring in a capital gains tax of 50 per cent sliding down to 26 per cent in the sixth year.  This, after they have been shouting from one end of this country to the other for the last year and, as they have repeated in the last five minutes, that it was not the time to bring in a capital gains tax, they wanted to start off with the lovely jump of 50 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which would be the highest capital taxation in Europe. It would not be bad for a start.  I invited them, when I was replying to Second Stage, to get some consistency into their arguments because it would help the country to know what their attitude was.</P>
      <P>That is one side of the argument. This beautiful solution put forward by Deputy Colley which is to treat the long-term owner of an asset more generously than the short-term owner overlooks a necessary corollary that the short-term owner of an asset with a loss would enjoy the value of a write-off as Fianna Fáil originally envisaged.  It could be a 50 per cent write off of a notional loss to be carried forward against future gains. You would then have the outrageous position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Last week we emphasised, and some Members of the House accepted, that it is the well-to-do who <Col N="1840" /> would make most out of the particular sliding scale Fianna Fáil have in mind.  There are plenty of people with money surplus to their current needs who can lock that money away in an asset which over a long period can accumulate quite a substantial gain.</P>

      <P>They do it for five, ten, 15, 20, aye 25 years to make gains.  If you exempt such gains totally the longer they keep the asset the more they will be inclined to keep the asset, the more they will plunge into these situations, so you will have these frozen assets, frozen in some particular form of property which might not be at all productive but which could, at the end of a period, have a very substantial gain which would not be subjected to any tax liability at all. That is the other side of the argument advanced by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the fairest thing is what we have offered in this Bill, what we propose to carry through. That is one rate of tax and adjusting the thresholds.  If you were not going to adjust the thresholds, if you were going to leave them stagnant, if you were going to leave them as Fianna Fáil left death duties, with little or no moderation in the threshold, then there might be something to be said for a system such as this.</P>

We are getting rid of the very bad system that has nothing to justify it which is a <Col N="1841" /> disincentive to investment.  Getting rid of death duties is one of the most positive steps to encourage investment which any country could introduce.  It is worthwhile pointing out that all the countries that have capital gains tax have retained death duties, quite severe death duties.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Deputies opposite to have a look at the likelihood under what they offer of manipulations and distortions.  You would have the locking up of assets by people who have means surplus to their current requirements in order at the end of the period, to make a tax free gain.  That is not an equitable system of taxation. The system Fianna Fáil propose would in the long run be contrary to the national interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>A person who comes in here and buys a property should not have to pay more than 26 per cent capital gains tax on it.  Before this Bill was introduced a person could have an off-shore company and if he sold it he ended up with the full amount without paying any tax on it.  I can see the sense in having a lower tax for the person who has run a business for, say, ten years.  I can also see the sense in having a high rate of tax for the person who buys a business and sells it again in a short space of time.  There should be some differential between the 26 per cent imposed on the person who comes in and makes a very large profit in a very short space of time and the person who buys a business and runs it for up to 25 years before he sells it.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Opposition about having different rates of tax, having a very high rate and then having it reduced each year.  I believe there should be some reduction from the 26 per cent to 15 per cent, 13 per cent or even 10 per cent for the person who buys a business, runs it himself for a number of years and then sells it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The one thing we would like to get on the record here is the principle we have in mind behind George Colley's amendment, that is not to have the speculator put in the same category as the man who, through his talent and energy, builds up something into a valuable asset and in the process gives employment. We feel that the man who comes in here and buys 30 acres or 40 acres of land on a particular day, and because planning permission is given and services provided within a month or even a year makes enormous capital gains without any input <Col N="1843" /> on his part, should have to pay tax on his profit.</P>
      <P>I know when one is drafting an amendment, such as the one George Colley has drafted, it is very hard to define in precise form the type of person you want to get after and the type of person you want to relieve of tax.  The man who through his energy and ability, builds up a valuable asset and creates employment should not be put in the same category as the pure speculator.</P>
      <P>The Minister tries to allege some ulterior motive on the part of the people on this side of the House because we want that type of system. The reason we want it is that we realise that the economy needs every incentive it can get from everybody in authority but most of all from the Government and the Minister.  We want to ensure that people have faith in the economy and that no type of ideological politician can come along and, because it is a nice slogan, tax the wealthy, tax the property owner and the business people.  The Minister is doing a very bad service to the country.  He accuses us on the one hand of opposing capital gains and on the other of advocating higher taxation on capital gains.  We accept the inevitability of the Minister's intransigence in the matter.  In order to have a fairer system of operation in relation to capital gains George Colley put forward his amendment. Then we had the red herring of those write-offs and tax losses at the rate of 50 per cent.  The Minister used the words &ldquo;the imprisonment of assets&rdquo;. It was a ludicrous argument to put forward because that would require the connivance of auditors and accountants.</P>

That is the analogy he drew, but it is completely <Col N="1844" /> false and totally irrelevant to the point of view we are putting forward.  I urge the Minister to try to draw some distinction between people like Paddy Belton and Maurice Dockrell, who have through their own ingenuity and energy built up assets, and in some cases from very little, and the pure speculator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I should like to support Deputy Colley and Deputy Crowley on this amendment.  We are not particularly tying the Minister to this table.  We are going on the same principle as Deputy Paddy Belton has already mentioned, that there must be a certain differential between the speculator and the long-term investor. Several businessmen I have spoken to during the past four weeks have told me that they object to this section. Those people have spent their lifetime in business.  They consider it an injustice that they, as long-term businessmen of all descriptions, who have spent their lives working in this country and giving employment, should now be classified in the same category as the speculator who makes a quick short-term gain.  There are businesses which have been built up through the skill, dedication and hard work of families, families which never drew proper remuneration from those businesses for periods of ten, 15 or 20 years.  These will come into the category of capital gains.  This is <Col N="1845" /> an injustice.  That kind of family should not be classified in the same category as the speculator who comes into the country and makes a quick £100,000 or £200,000 in 12 months, with no input, without contributing anything to the economy and without employing anyone.  To classify these in the same category is totally unfair and most unwise.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not correct in saying this could be written off in the first two or three years.  That would be negative.  It would be very limited. There are other anomalies in income tax about which one can do nothing. Destroying all for the sake of the few the Minister mentions is just not good enough.  These business people have contributed to the economy down through the years and they will continue to do so.  They are of vital importance to the community.  They seldom look for anything from the State.  Indeed, they make substantial contributions to the State.  They do not look for social welfare or anything like that.  These should not be penalised.  The Minister can make it any period he likes for the purposes of exemption.  We are not opposing this for political reasons.  If the Minister inquires of the business community, he will find that this is the particular section which really needs amendment. I hope the Minister will do something positive on the lines suggested in our amendment.</P>

Family businesses are built up on family labour, very often built up through a great deal of self-sacrifice, so that at the end of one's days one can retire with an income to sustain one for the remainder of one's days.  The same rate of tax should not apply in this case as that which applies to the fly-by-night who buys an acre or two of land in the centre of the city because he has some information about potential development and sells that bit of <Col N="1846" /> land for treble the price he paid for it after two years.  The same rate of tax should not apply to the ordinary businessman as applies to such a specultor.</P>
      <P>I was talking to a man recently who worked with his father for the past 20 years in building up a good business. All this man took out of the business was pocket money for the odd weekend or Sunday night out.  He could have taken wages out of the business and possibly paid income tax on those wages.  He would be better off if he had done that than to be faced now with this burden of capital gains tax.  If the local authority decide they want the site of this business for development purposes, the site will be compulsorily taken from him.  The price will be set by arbitration and there will be no recognition of what was put into that business or of what he could have taken out of that business by way of wages.  Such a business should be free of capital gains tax.  It should be free in the case of the widow who has to sell because she cannot carry on the business and she needs an income on which to support herself and rear her family.  Surely it should be possible to work out a system of differential rates.  We would be prepared to accept it but we want the Minister to accept the principle that there should be a differential rate of taxation and that it should be reduced to nil after a certain period.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about assets being unproductive.  With inflation at the current rate and with costs so high, if an asset is not productive it will not be possible for the owner to keep it.  If a portion of a farm is unproductive because it is flooded the farmer knows that this will affect the viability of the farm.  All the land must be in production if the farm is to pay its way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would apply even more to a business.  If the owner does not devote himself full-time to it, it will not survive.  This completely disproves the Minister's theory that assets can be locked up and be unproductive in an effort to evade capital gains tax.  He seems to think that after a period of <Col N="1847" /> 15 years the state of the business will be satisfactory but that is not so. Nowadays people want to put all their assets to work.</P>
    <P>When people get a piece of land from the Land Commission sometimes they are tempted to clear the annuity so that it will be rent free.  I always tell people who ask my advice that they should put the money into Government bonds or in some other security and let the interest pay the rent.  In that way they will have command of their money and they can use it when they need it.  The land they obtain from the Land Commission will not be worth more because it is rent free but if they need the money in a few years time they will not be able to get it back.</P>
    <P>People are not interested in locking up their money for 15 years or 20 years.  They want to see their assets working and bringing in a good return. The Minister has said that a person would get a considerable capital gains after 15 or 20 years, but that might not happen.</P>

      <P>Until the present Government came into power our country was building itself up on family-owned businesses.  In this connection I mean farms and family firms.  We have very few of the large corporations the Deputies on the Government side speak about so frequently. We should protect any business that is in a family for practically a generation.  If it has to be disposed of for health reasons or because of retirement the family should not be penalised, they should not have to give 26 per cent to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should take note of the Deputies behind him.  Some of them who are interested in this matter are present in the House.  Deputy Collins spoke earlier and he advocated different rates with a sliding out after a certain period.  I am sure that other Deputies on the Government side have spoken to the Minister on this matter but he is whipping them <Col N="1848" /> through the division lobbies to support him.  He is becoming a real dictator and he is forcing his views on his party.  We do not see any Members of the Labour Party here.  It appears he has gone in with them, at least so far as capital taxation is concerned.  I can assure the Minister that he is not held in high esteem throughout the country because people think he has joined the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>The Minister represents a Dublin constituency and he knows there is plenty of speculation. He knows there are instances where property is sold for the development of office blocks and hotels.  Those <Col N="1849" /> speculators have done a lot of harm in the country because they bought farms at exorbitant prices, outpricing farmers who needed the land.  The speculators hold the land for a few years and then sell it, or if they think it will appreciate in value to a considerable extent they retain the land for a few years.  It is at those people we should be getting and not the family businesses like the Beltons or the Dockrells, firms which have been built up over generations.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about the fact that death duties will no longer apply after 1st April but I should like to point out that they only brought in between £10 million and £13 million to the Exchequer. Now, instead of death duties, we have capital gains tax, capital acquisition tax and wealth tax.  In a few years these taxes will be bringing in as much as income tax is at present, more than £100 million.</P>

This country has been built up by family units and we should protect them and not tax such concerns at the end of a generation. The Minister has told us that he is bringing in a low rate of tax but he has also informed us that the Bill is tied into the 1927 Act and that by a money resolution of this House this rate can be increased.  I accept that at present we are having a budget a month&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We feel there should be a set rate.  We are not saying that our idea is perfect but the Minister, in consultation with his advisers and Deputy Colley, could bring in an amendment that would suit our purpose. The family business should be <Col N="1850" /> treated differently from the speculator who simply goes to make a kill, does not give any employment and then disappears.  It is accepted in most countries that such people should be hammered at a higher rate than the person who invests a small amount of money and gives employment.  The fact that a family business goes public does not mean that they are an easy target for capital gains tax.  Such concerns give employment and that should mean that they are taxed at a lower rate than speculators or the person who deals in house property. Such speculators merely put their money into property development and there is no energy or employment involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on the Capital Gains Bill but I have very good reason to support this amendment.  I have known people in the west who bought land and sold it again and made thousands of pounds.  They are competing against the small farmer and the Land Commission who want to buy land and divide it amongst the small farmers. Those are the type of people I want to see paying tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a comparison between that type of person and a businessman I know who started in a very small way.  He never exceeded the speed limits because he was always in his own yard to meet his customers. He built up a very big business through hard work.  He pays a very good staff.  He pays his taxes and he <Col N="1851" /> pays income tax.  Surely it would not be fair to put him in the same category as the other person who pays no tax and who is a land jobber, a speculator, a property jobber.  We should go all out to collect money from him.</P>
    <P>This type of person has his cheque book and he buys land as a hobby. I would not mind taking 50 per cent in capital gains tax from him.  The businessman I referred to worked for a county council at one stage.  He drew beet.  He built up a big business. Is he to be put in the same class as the speculator?  Surely there is a difference between the man who worked and slaved all his life to build up a business and the land jobber or property jobber.  If the wording of the amendment is not perfect certainly the principle is correct.  I see the result of land jobbery and property jobbery and I appeal to the Minister to accept the principle of the amendment.</P>

Even if he never sells it, or his family do not sell it, or it is not sold for several generations, a 55 per cent slice will be taken off that family fortune on the death of the head of each generation.</P>

I am entitled to make a contrast between the two. When it has been suggested here that we are confiscating family fortunes, and we are not, it is only proper that we should say we are bringing in a system of taxation to tax a gain when the gain is made and in certain circumstances not to tax a family arrangement.

We are in favour of a tax that is fair but the Minister's proposals are not fair.  How will they affect the family man, the businessman?  He buys a property now and he may have to sell it in ten years.  If he has to sell to divide among his family he will be taxed.  I think that is not right.  It may be said that there are exemption clauses but that depends on circumstances.  I see no reason why, if the owner within, say, 15 years has to dispose of the property and makes a gain, the tax should be more than one per cent.  If he sells after 20 years and makes a profit he has earned it by looking after the property and building it up. If the Minister does not agree to amend the Bill as we have suggested people will say to themselves: &ldquo;Is it worth while expanding?  If we do we will be heavily taxed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I know that you can do that but it is not easy to do it, especially now.  We believe the speculator in land who makes a good profit over a short term should be nailed down but we see no reason why anybody who worked land or property or business should be taxed at the rate of 26 per cent.  The Minister is being harsh and the Minister's colleagues know that even they may have to row in with them; perhaps they have no option.  If the Bill goes through in its present form it will be a bad move: it will stop expansion.  The businessman will consider the overall cost and ask himself if it will pay him to expand when if unforeseen circumstances arise he may have to dispose of some or all of the property and <Col N="1856" /> knows he will be caught for tax on it. That will be harmful to the nation as a whole.  It will tend to divert the capital we badly need to expand various concerns, especially agricultural developments.  This will have an adverse effect on agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about death duties but there were not too many paying those.  Artificial values were operated and in the country, especially in my constituency, only about 2 per cent were caught by death duties but now it seems that 90 per cent of transactions will be subject to tax.  In other words, you are robbing Peter to pay Paul, because you are taking away the duty on one hand and putting on tax on the other and you may also be putting it on people in family farms and homes and you will put it on wealth and so on.  I do not want to go into the wealth tax because there will be another day for that.  The Minister has threatened that so often and changed his mind so often that I do not think he knows whether he is coming or going.</P>

      <P>I know that, but some of the Minister's colleagues objected and he had to back down. The Labour Party did not like it, but that was it.  Our amendment, providing for 26 per cent in the case of a sale within six years, 23 per cent within seven years, 18½ per cent within eight years, 14 per cent within nine years, coming down to 1 per cent within 15 years and nil after anything more than 15 years is fair and reasonable.  If the owner of a farm, an industry or a factory has built up his assets through his own good work he should not be hit but I agree that a speculator who cleans up overnight and gets out with a quick profit at the expense of the ordinary people should be nailed down.  We agree with that.  We are in favour of the implementation of a tax provided it is fair and we believe the amendment we have put down would ensure this.  I ask the Minister once more to give the amendment favourable consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is noticeable that in the discussion so far on the Bill and on this amendment that whenever the Minister finds himself in a position that is untenable&mdash;as he has found on a few occasions&mdash;he begins to talk about other issues, particularly death duties.  I do not wish to extend the scope of this debate more than is necessary and I have deliberately refrained from following the Minister up this alley but I could not let it go when I heard him repeat in the House a deliberate mis-statement of the position which he had already made on television some months ago with a little blackboard to illustrate his mistake.  Tonight he again said that people paid through the death duty system 55 per cent on the whole estate.  The Minister knows that statement is not true but he made it in this House and he made it on television. That is why he heard from me in regard to this matter, in case he is under any illusion about it.  If the Minister must refer to death duties and estate duties I hope he will at least attempt to refer to them accurately and not misrepresent the position.</P>
      <P>However I do not want to extend the scope of this debate unnecessarily.  I believe that the reason why the Minister referred to all this again was because he had just listened to a short speech by Deputy Callanan who had in the course of it highlighted the whole point of this amendment.  That point was that we should not in this House for the purposes of capital gains tax endeavour to treat in the same way, speculators and people who build up their businesses over the years through hard work, effort, energy and skill.  That is the real point of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I referred to this matter on Second Stage and spelled out what we had in mind I specifically said that we were not tied either to the suggested rates of tax or to the number of years involved, that obviously people could take a different view on these matters, but that we were concerned in this Bill to produce a system which would distinguish in the way I have indicated. The fact that that view is one <Col N="1858" /> that commands a good deal of support is borne out by the debate on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>It is true that no member of the Labour Party, who have been so vociferous about capital taxation and capital gains tax in particular, has appeared in this House on either Stage of the debate so far and certainly none has contributed.  Nevertheless we do have on record the views of two members of the Fine Gael Party who spoke on the Second Stage.  Deputy Eddie Collins, speaking on the Second Stage of this Bill on 28th January, 1975, and reported in the Official Report for that date, at columns 1131 and 1132, said:</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that the blanket rate of 26 per cent should be changed.  I suggest that the rate be higher on short term capital gains, in respect of which, say, a 50 per cent tax should be applied.  Deputy Colley referred to such gains as speculation.  On medium term gains &mdash;gains on assets held for a period of, perhaps, 15 years&mdash;I would suggest a 25 per cent or 26 per cent tax, but for gains on investments for longer periods I would suggest a 10 per cent tax.</P>
    <P>Deputy Paddy Belton speaking on the same day and reported at column 1204, said:</P>
    <P>After a certain number of years there should be no capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>Therefore it is clear that there is widespread support for the idea involved in this amendment, an idea very clearly spelled out by Deputy Callanan: that we should have a different approach in the application of the capital gains tax to, on the one hand, the person who is making a quick profit and very possibly not making any economic contribution and, on the other hand, the person who over many years has built up his business or firm through hard work and skill, through difficult and good times and particularly if it is, say, a shop or a business, has built up goodwill which is almost exclusively the result of the hard work and the service he has given.  It is self-evident that those two classes of people <Col N="1859" /> should not be treated in the same way. It is clear, as I have said, and from the quotations I have given, that this view is not confined to this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I repeat that we are not in any way tied to the rates of tax we have suggested or to the number of years but we are tied to the principle involved, one which clearly commands a great deal of support.  In the light of this support from both sides of the House, for the principle involved at least, if not for the detail of the amendment, we are asking the Minister to accept that principle and to apply it.  If he does not like the detailed proposals in this amendment, we ask him to produce his own version of it, accepting the principle involved.  If he does that, I believe he will be acknowledging not only a widespread feeling in regard to capital gains tax but he will be ensuring that a capital gains tax is a fairer tax than is proposed in the Bill.  He will be ensuring also that it does what the great majority of people want a capital gains tax to do, that is, to apply at least relatively heavy taxation to those who make a quick profit, particularly those who make a quick profit with little or no economic effort on their part.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know that in general people do not want to see capital gains tax at exactly the same rate as is applied to that kind of speculator applied to the other type of person I have been describing.  I believe he must know that what I am saying is true in relation to the general attitude of people, of supporters of all political parties, an attitude which was reflected in the contributions to the debate in this House from both sides.  In these circumstances I suggest it is reasonable of us to urge the Minister to accept the principle involved and come back in due course with an amendment&mdash;if he does not like this one&mdash;worked out with the best advice available to him as to the most efficient way of applying that principle to the operation of capital gains tax.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central</i>): At this late stage I should like to appeal further to the Minister. We have put forward pragmatic proposals. The amendment put forward by Deputy Colley is to achieve a different rate of taxation between a speculator and a long-term business man.  I could continue until morning spelling out cases of family businesses established 20 years ago, people who have spent their lifetime in the business, whose sons and daughters have worked in it throughout the years with very little financial return. They gave their time and valuable experience to building up an asset, contributing to the economy of the country and giving employment&mdash;a man who has held a property for 20 or 30 years and is forced to sell it, perhaps in circumstances beyond his control.  We are this evening putting that type of person into the same category as a speculator.</P>
      <P>This aspect should be seriously considered again next week.  The Minister would be doing the country a service by re-considering our amendment. Nobody has any time for the speculator who comes in and perhaps makes £100,000 or £200,000 in, say, six to 12 months.  We on this side of the House thoroughly agree that he should be taxed.  We put forward an amendment stating that we would tax the short-term speculator at 50 per cent.  On the other hand, our amendment states that the long-term business man who has developed his business throughout the years certainly should not be put in the same category.  We are urging the Minister to re-consider our proposals.  Indeed the Minister said earlier that assets would be locked up waiting until such time as the 15 years had elapsed.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>Nuair a bhí Rúnaí Parlaiminte an Taoisigh ag freagairt <Col N="1861" /> Ceist a 9 ar an gclár inné dúirt sé go raibh socraithe déanta ag an Roinn faoin aistriú go Gaillimh.  Nuair a d'fhiafraíos de cad iad na socraithe a bhí déanta, ní raibh a fhios aige, agus nuair a d'fhiafraigh mé dhe an raibh teangmháil déanta ag an Roinn le Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe, dúirt sé nach raibh a fhios sin aige ach oiread.</P>
      <P>Níl aon locht agam ar an Teachta Kelly nach raibh an t-eolas seo aige mar níl an Roinn faoin a chúram.  Ní raibh aon dul as agam, dá bhrí sin, ach iarraidh ar an Aire an cheist a phlé ar an athló.  Tá mé buíoch de bheith anseo.  Séard a theastaíonn uaim a fháil amach ná na socraithe atá déanta, cé lena bhfuil siad déanta, cé mhéid pleanála atá déanta faoin cheist seo.  Tá tuairim i nGaillimh nach bhfuil aon rud déanta ar chor ar bith ach amháin go bhfuil ráiteas ón Aire go ndéanfar é. Más mar sin atá an scéal níl aon locht agamsa air ach amháin nach ndeireann an tAire é sin.  Ach tá sé ráite anois ag an Rúnaí Parlaiminte go bhfuil socraithe áithrid déanta ach nach bhfuil a fhios aige cad iad na socraithe sin.</P>
      <P>Táimse i mo bhall de Choiste na Gaeltachta de Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe.  Ar an gcoiste sin bímíd ag plé plean forbartha do na Forbacha i nGaillimh.  Tá brú curtha againn agus ag na baill eile den choiste sin atá ina gcomhairleoirí ar Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe aitheantas sráidbhaile a thúirt do na Forbacha i bplean forbartha an Chontae, agus go mba chóir dóibh dul i gcomhairle le coiste an pharóiste, Gaeltarra Éireann agus Roinn na Gaeltachta sul a gcuirtear plean an tsráidbhaile le chéile.  De réir oifigigh an Chomhairle Chontae ag cruinniú an Choiste Gaeltachta Dé Luain seo caite i Scoil Lurgan in Indreabhán, níl aon eolas fáighte ag Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe fós ó Roinn na Gaeltachta faoin scéim atá foilsithe ag an Aire i dtaobh Roinn na Gaeltachta a aistriú go dtí na Forbacha i nGaillimh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rinne oifigigh an Chomhairle Chontae iarracht cruinniú a chur ar bun chun an cheist seo a phlé le h-oifigigh ó Roinn na Gaeltachta. <Col N="1862" /> Níor tháinig aon duine ón Roinn i mBaile Átha Cliath go dtí an cruinniú sin.  Bhí an tUasal Ó Dorcáin, an cigire áitiúil, i láthair, ach níor tháinig éinne ón Roinn a mbeadh eolas aige faoin aistriú.</P>
    <P>Teastaíonn uaim anocht a fháil amach ón Aire céard díreach atá i gceist aige sa scéal seo ar fad.  An amhlaidh go mbeidh foirgnimh nua á chur suas ins na Forbacha?  An bhfuil suíomh fáighte dos na foirgnimh sin?  An mbeidh cead pleanála le fáil?  An mbeidh deacrachtaí faoi sin?  Nach gceapann an tAire go mba chóir cainteanna a bheith ann faoi seo sul a ndéantar fógra poiblí faoi? Ceist anthábhachtach atá i mbéal chois-mhuintir na háite cén áit ina mbeidh na daoine seo ina gcómhnaí. An mbeidh siad ina gcomhnaí i nGaillimh cosúil leo siúd a tháinig le Gaeltarra Éireann?  Cuireadh tithe ar fáil istigh i gcathair na Gaillimhe dóibh siúd.  An bhfuil aon phleanáil déanta ag an Aire tithe nua a chur ar fáil dóibh siúd a bhéas ag obair i Roinn na Gaeltachta nuair a aistreófar é go dtí an Ghaeltacht ins na Forbacha?  An dtuigeann an tAire go bhfuil imní ar chos-mhuintir na bhForbacha faoin fás atá pleanáilte dos na Forbacha ag údaráis Bhaile Átha Cliath agus gan fiú uisce reatha san áit fós, gan séarachas poiblí d'aon sórt a bheith ann, gan seirbhísí an gnáth sráidbhaile a bheith ann agus gan plean sráidbhaile nó fiú aitheantas mar shráidbhaile ag an áit fós?</P>
    <P>Bí cinnte faoi seo, tá áthas ar mhuintir na háite go bhfuil an Roinn ag teacht ach ba mhaith leo eolas éigin d'fháil.  Ceapaim go mba chóir don Roinn dul i gcomhairle leis an gComhairle Chontae go luath ionnas nach gcuirfear moill ar réiteach na faidhbe atáacu, aitheantas sráidbhaile a bhaint amach dos na Forbacha.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire in ann an scéal seo a réiteach anocht, agus arís ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil iarracht déanta cheana féin cruinniú a chur le chéile idir oifigigh ón Roinn i mBaile Átha Cliath agus oifigigh ó Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe, ach nár tháinig oifigigh ó Bhaile Átha Cliath <Col N="1863" /> go dtí an cruinniú sin, nach raibh aon eolas ag oifigigh Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe faoi, agus nach bhfuil an cheist sásúil go dtí go socrófar é sin ar fad.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa cur leis an méid atá ráite maidir leis an gceist seo.  Nuair a bhí na Meastacháin os comhair na Dála, cháin mé an tAire de bhrí go raibh an oiread sin geallta aige do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus chomh fada agus a bhain sé liomsa, nach raibh toradh le feiscint.</P>
      <P>Tá a fhios againn go léir go raibh scéal ins na páipéirí anuraidh a chuir gliondar agus áthas ormsa, ar dhaoine eile sa tír ach go mór-mhór ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta, B'é an fógra a bhí ann ná &ldquo;Roinn na Gaeltachta to go to the Forbacha&rdquo;.  Is cuma liomsa faoin scríbhneoireacht bheag a bhíonn ag státseirbhísigh mar gheall ar rud mar sin.  Séard atá ag déanamh imní domsa ná gur ghlac muintir na Gaeltachta go raibh Roinn na Gaeltachta le dul go Gaillimh.  Níos déanaí ná sin bhí saghas amhrais ormsa, mar chuir mé ceist anseo ar Rúnaí Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí, agus b'fhachthas dom nach raibh socrú dá réir á dhéanamh aige sin maidir leis na hoifigí a bhí le tógáil ins na Forbacha. De réir mar fheicimse anois é, séard atá i gceist ná go mbeidh saghas oifig áitiúil ag Roinn na Gaeltachta i nGaillimh.  B'fhéidir go mbeidh oifig dá leithéid, agus ba mhaith liom féin dá mbeadh, i gContae Dhún na nGall agus i gCiarraí chomh maith.  Ach más é sin a bhí i gceist, ba cheart don Aire é sin a rá.  Ní ceart a rá go bhfuil Roinn na Gaeltachta le dul go Gaillimh muna bhfuil ann ach go bhfuil duine nó beirt, triúr nó ceathrar le dul ansin chun obair oifige a dhéanamh.  Fuair mé amach freisin seachtain ina dhiaidh an fógra seo a bheith déanta nár cuireadh ceist ar fhoireann na Roinne anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní raibh mé ag caint leo go léir ach de réir mar a thuigim, agus is féidir leis an Aire cur im aghaidh níos déanaí ar an bpointe seo, níor cuireadh ceist ar na státseirbhísigh go léir atá i Roinn na Gaeltachta an raibh siad ag <Col N="1864" /> dul siar go Gaillimh.  Bhí an cheist againn sa Dáil níos luaithe sa tseachtain agus thuig muid ó fhreagraí Rúnaí Parlaiminte an Taoisigh nach raibh a fhios aige an raibh socrú ar bith déanta nó á dhéanamh; nach raibh a fhios aige an raibh Roinn na Gaeltachta ina h-iomlán nó ina phíosa ag dul go dtí na Forbacha.  Idir an dá linn agus is é seo an rud is mó a chuireann isteach orm&mdash;ardaíodh meanma agus dóchas mhuintir na Gaeltachta faoi theacht Roinn na Gaeltachta go dtí na Forbacha.</P>
    <P>Tá sé in am anois an fhírinne faoin rud a insint.  Má tá Roinn na Gaeltachta ina h-iomlán ag dul siar, ba cheart é sin a rá.  Muna bhfuil ach an ceathrú, an tríú nó an deichiú cuid d'oifigigh na Roinne ag dul siar, ba cheart é sin a rá.  In ainm Dé, déanaimis beart de réir ár mbriathar agus an fhírinne a insint.</P>
    <P>Cháin mise Rialtas Fhianna Fáil agus iad i gcumhacht faoi fhógra a d'eisigh siad maidir le h-aistriú na Roinne Oideachais agus na Roinne Tailte go dtí áiteanna eile sa tír. Cháin mé iad go príobháideach agus go hoscailte.  Chreid mé go raibh sé ró-luath fógra dá leithéid a dhéanamh gan an t-ullmhúchán a dhéanamh roimh ré.  Níl mé ag imeacht ón bprionsabal sin anseo anois.  Caithimid an fhírinne a insint faoi chéard díreach atá i gceist againn anseo. Muna rabhamar ach ag iarraidh cur ina luí ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta go rabhamar ag tabhairt aitheantais dóibh agus gan bheith ullamh ina choinne, ba cheart dúinn é sin a rá leo.  Más rud é nach raibh i gceist ach an méid sin, muna bhfuil ann ach go mbeidh oifig beag ag Roinn na Gaeltachta sna Forbacha, beidh fáilte ann roimh an oifig sin, ach caithimid a rá nach bhfuil ann ach an méid sin.</P>

Ins na freagraí sin ní raibh aon chinnteacht faoi aon rud.  Ní abródh sé an mbeadh an Roinn ar fad ag dul siar.

Aistreofar oiread agus is féidir d'obair na Roinne go dtí na Forbacha i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe. Glacfar lánchomhairle le comhaltaí na foirne agus is dá dtoil féin a aistreofar iad.  Chomh maith leis sin is féidir liom a rá ag an bpointe seo, mar a dúras cheana, go bhfuilimid ag dul ar aghaidh leis na socraithe faoi láthair. Is féidir liom a rá ag an bpointe seo go mbeidh an oifig nua suite in aice le ceanncheathrú Ghaeltarra Éireann ins na Forbacha.  Tá láthair ann a oireann don oifig agus tá sé socraithe anois go mbeidh oifig nua tógálta ann agus is ann a bheidh an fhoireann ó mo Roinn-se.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ina dhiaidh sin anseo sa Dáil arís ar 7 Mí na Samhna, chuir an Teachta <Col N="1867" /> Tunney ceist eile orm faoi an dul chun cinn atá déanta maidir leis na socruithe.  D'fhreagair an Rúnaí Parlaiminte, an Teachta Kelly, an lá sin:</P>
    <P>Tá Coimisinéirí na nOibreacha Poiblí ag dul ar aghaidh leis na socruithe don oifig nua.</P>
    <P>Ar 5 Nollag chuir an Teachta céanna ceist ar an Aire Airgeadais agus dúirt an Rúnaí Parlaiminte an lá sin:</P>
    <P>Tá an réamhstaidéar ar riachtanais Roinn na Gaeltachta in oifig nua ins na Forbacha beagnach críochnaithe agus tá súil agam go dtabharfar na pleananna chun críche gan ró-mhoill.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Rúnaí Parlaiminte freisin:</P>
    <P>Tá cainteanna ar siúl idir Roinn na Gaeltachta, Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí, Gaeltarra Éireann agus an comhairle chontae.  Nuair a bheidh siad sin críochnaithe beidh siad ag lorg na tairiscintí.  Ansin nuair a bheidh siad sin réidh tosnófar ar an obair.</P>
    <P>Sin mar a bhí an scéal roimh Nollaig. Chomh maith leis sin is féidir liom a rá go bhfuil siad ag obair ar na pleananna.  Is mar seo atá an scéal: Aistreofar an méid agus is féidir de fhoireann na Roinne&mdash;30 atá measta ag an bpointe seo.  Chomh maith leis sin aistreofar cuid d'obair mo Roinnese go Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Mar sin, beidh foireann eile ag dul siar go Gaillimh.  Níor fógraíodh riamh go raibh an Roinn iomlán le haistriú go dtí na Forbacha.  Níor fógraíodh ach go mbeadh cuid den Roinn i gceist&mdash; an oiread agus is féidir d'obair na Roinne.</P>
    <P>Chun an chóiríocht a chur ar fáil don fhoireann bhreise a bheidh ag obair faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta, tá Gaeltarra Éireann ag ullmhú pleananna faoi láthair chun na foirgnimh atá ann a leathnú.  Tá na pleananna atá ag Gaeltarra Éireann agus ag mo Roinnse ag dul ar aghaidh le chéile, agus tá dul chun cinn an-mhaith ann. Tá ailtirí ag obair ar na pleananna agus tá muidne i Roinn na Gaeltachta ag feitheamh leis an ndréacht-phlean.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na ceisteanna a bhaineann leis na Forbacha agus leis an coiste áitiúil, bhí cruinniú agam coicís ó shin anseo sa Dáil le rúnaí Choiste <Col N="1868" /> Pharóiste na Forbacha, an tUasal Nodlaig Ó Gadhra.  Do phléamar na ceisteanna go hiomlán ar feadh uair a chloig nó mar sin, agus chuir sé in iúl dom go raibh fonn ar an gcoiste paróiste go mbeadh cruinniú a luaithe agus is féidir agus go mbeadh ionadaithe ó mo Roinnse, ó Ghaeltarra Éireann, ó Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí, agus ón gcomhairle chontae i láthair ag an gcruinniú.  Dúras leis go mbeadh an-áthas orm ionadaithe a chur chuig an gcruinniú sin.  Chualas ar Radio na Gaeltachta oíche éigin an tseachtain seo caite go bhfuil na socraithe don chruinniú sin idir lámha.  Dá bhri sin, beidh cruinniú sar i bhfad chun an cheist go léir a phlé le muintir na háite.</P>
    <P>An scéal is déanaí atá agam, fuair mé litir ón choiste paróiste, agus is litir an-shuimiúil í maidir leis na pleananna do cheantar na Forbacha go hiomlán.  Deirtear anseo:</P>
    <P>Táimid ag obair ar an gcomhairle chontae le breis is sé mhí agus cé go bhfuil leisce ar Oifig Phleanála na Comhairle tabhairt faoin obair, tá treoir chinnte tugtha dóibh ag na comhairleoirí.</P>
    <P>Is ceist don chomhairle chontae ar dtúis ceist phleanála na Forbacha ach mar adúras, tá fonn mór ormsa mar Aire na Gaeltachta dul i gcomhairle le Coiste Pharóiste na bhForbacha, ach ní éiríonn an cheist seo ag an bpointe seo.  Is féidir anois go bhfuil sé beartuithe ag an Rialtas an oiread agus is féidir d'obair Roinn na Gaeltachta a aistriú go Gaeltacht na Gaillimhe, go bhfuil na socraithe ag dul chun cinn chomh tapaidh agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Molloy tagairt do chruinniú agus nach raibh aon oifigigh ó mo Roinnse i láthair.  Bhí cruinniú le bainisteoir Chontae na Gaillimhe agus leis an oifigeach pleanála san bhFómhar seo caite.  Bhí stiúrthóir áitiúil Roinn na Gaeltachta i láthair agus treoracha cruinne aige ón ard-oifig i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Bhí cruinniú ann, agus faoi láthair tá na hailtirí i gcomhairle le Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe agus tá gach rud ag dul ar aghaidh go sásúil ar fad.</P>

      <P>Gach rud atá luaite ag an Aire, bhí eolas agam faoi cheana féin.  Sí an cheist a d'fhiafraigh mé dhe ná: iarradh ar oifigeach ó Roinn na Gaeltachta teacht go dtí cruinniú a chuirfeadh Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe ar siúl chun an cheist seo ar fád a phlé.  Dúradh linn ag an gcruinniú ar an Luan seo caite in Oifig an Chomhairle Chontae&mdash;agus bhí Nodlaig Ó Gadhra i láthair ag an gcruinniú sin&mdash;nach raibh an t-eolas ag an Uasal Ó Dorcáin agus nach raibh aon teagmháil ceart déanta faoi na socraithe a bhí ag an Roinn. Cén fáth nár tháinig duine ón Roinn chuig an gcruinniú sin?  Sin í an cheist a bhí agam.  Níor thug an tAire aon fhreagra dom anocht.</P>
