    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the steps he proposes to take to limit import licences in respect of furnishing fabrics and bedspreads to protect employment in the textile industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) (for the Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The problems affecting the home producers of woven furnishing fabrics and bedspreads which are in competition with similar imported goods are <Col N="532" /> under consideration.  In the very near future, a meeting will be held with the interests concerned with a view to reaching an agreed solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it was clear for a considerable time that these industries were in jeopardy; that the Minister for Industry and Commerce showed a lack of concern in this regard and he did not take action until he was pressed by members on this side of the House to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree. There were three mills in question and now only one is operating in this very specialised sector of the textile industry.  Some of the distributive trades approached the Department with a view to being allowed import goods but this was objected to by the mill in question.  It is intended to have discussions in the near future in an effort to resolve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the textile industry generally is in a serious position and that there are many unemployed and on short time in the industry?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce knew of this difficulty for a considerable time but he did nothing.  It is only now when there are many people unemployed and on short time that he is taking action.  As far as I can see, he would not have taken any action if Members on this side of the House had not pressed him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, replying to questions in relation to this matter last week, fully explained his position.  The question today relates to a specific sector of the textile industry and not the textile industry in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised by us some months ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I was talking about a specific type of furnishing fabric which is only manufactured by one concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce why the allocation of the quota for made-up textiles of low-cost origin (Quota No. 51) in 1974 applied to large firms only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The quota for made-up textiles is £100,000.  In 1974, as in all previous years since quota was introduced it was allocated on a &ldquo;first come first served&rdquo; basis.  This system led to a certain amount of dissatisfaction and at the request of the distributive trade the method of allocation for 1975 has been changed. Firms interested in the importation of these goods were invited by press advertisements to apply to the Department for shares in the 1975 quota.  The number of applicants and the quantities applied for were so great in relation to the amount available for distribution that it was necessary to limit licences to the larger firms, otherwise the quota would be so fragmented that individual licences would be uselessly small.  This limitation was effected by reference to the employment afforded by the applicant firms.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of all the Minister's journeys outside the State on official business in the period 1st January, 1974 to 31st December, 1974 amounted to £1,682.27.  The cost of journeys made by officials of the Department in the same period was £86,918.52.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy has in mind clauses inserted by supplier in guarantees disclaiming liability for certain aspects such as labour costs.  The Department occasionally have complaints arising from servicing of goods purchased under guarantee, and the Minister is looking into the question of exclusion clauses generally in the context of the report of the National Consumer Advisory Council, which he hopes to be able to publish within the next few weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The attention of the Minister has been drawn to a question asked in the European Parliament on the possible hazards posed by formamide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Felt tipped pens are not manufactured in this country but formamide is used in their manufacture in some countries.  The Minister is not aware of accidents or injury in this country from the use of these pens.  He does not propose at present to make any regulations in regard to formamide content but if the European Commission which is taking a keen interest in the results of work now in progress in this matter makes any <Col N="535" /> regulations this country will implement them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The EEC consumer protection programme is concerned with objectives falling into three categories.</P>
      <P>The first objective is to provide effective protection against hazards likely to affect health and safety and to protect standards of quality.  The Community has adopted a number of directives in relation to these matters and others are in course of preparation.</P>
      <P>The second main objective is the protection of consumers' economic interests.  The principal activities of the Community's consumer programme in this respect have been the preparation of proposals for draft directives.</P>
      <P>The third principal objective is the provision of adequate facilities for advice, help and redress for consumers. and ensuring proper consumer information, education and, where appropriate, representation on representative bodies. A general programme of action in this sphere is expected to be approved by the council shortly.</P>
      <P>The Government have collaborated fully in the preparation of the general programme and of individual directives and draft directives.  Where directives are already in existence&mdash;for instance, relating to food standards, to the safety of low voltage electrical equipment or to textile labelling&mdash;it has given effect to them by regulations made under the European Communities Acts or under other statutory powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister stated clearly, in reply to the question, what action the Minister for Industry and Commerce has taken with regard to consumer protection here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, yes.  I have listed the three main criteria under which the EEC consumer protection programme can be assessed.  The first of these is health and safety; the second is economic interest and the third is advice.  The Government have collaborated fully in the preparation of the general programme and of individual directives and draft directives. Where directives are already in existence, for instance, relating to food standards, to the safety of low <Col N="537" /> voltage electrical equipment or to textile labelling, they have given effect to them by regulations made under the European Communities Acts or under other statutory powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be correct in suggesting that the Minister does not propose taking any unilateral action, that he will wait for the long-drawn-out effect of these directives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Any action which the Minister would take here would have to be in conformity with the EEC directives.  As he said in his reply, he is contributing directly to the formation of these directives at Community level and those, then, apply here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily. Many countries are proceeding in anticipation and have already their own consumer protection laws.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information here about that but I think the Minister did say, on a previous occasion, that he was very concerned about the whole field of consumer protection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen some newspaper reports alleging that price control measures are to be phased out and the National Prices Commission to be abolished.  There is no foundation for these reports.  Price control measures will be maintained as long as they are necessary to protect the consumer.</P>
      <P>It has always been recognised that price control should not be operated in such a way as to cause unemployment by making it impossible for efficient firms to remain in business, and this policy will be continued.</P>

      <P>I will read out an extract from what the Minister said over the radio which I think would be a very effective reply.  The interviewer asked him: &ldquo;Are you saying that the present system of price control is too rigorous and needs to be loosened?&rdquo; This is the Minister's reply: &ldquo;No, I am not saying that it is too rigorous.  I am saying that it is very effective.  I am saying that if we get evidence that we have so robbed people of the profits they need to stay competitive we may have to loosen it a little in order to guarantee jobs and guarantee growth but I am rebutting the statement that prices are out of control.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Firms are not required to notify me or any other official body about their liquidity <Col N="541" /> problems.  I have received representations from various sectors of industry about their particular problems and I am aware of the position of a number of individual firms but I have no precise information as to the total numbers even in the industrial sector. The services of various State agencies are available to help in assessing the problems of individual firms and where necessary in securing financial assistance.  In this connection, I would refer the Deputy to Paragraph 95 of the White Paper &ldquo;A National Partnership&rdquo; with particular reference to the request which the Central Bank has made to commercial banks to respond positively to the short-term liquidity requirements of their business customers.</P>
      <P>I would also refer the Deputy to the references to this matter in the Minister for Finance's budget statement last week and in particular to tax relief provided in the budget for companies engaged in manufacturing construction or farming or in the sale of plant, machinery or material to those sectors.</P>

      <P>Every member of this Government is concerned with the liquidity problems of industry but I do not think that Ministers would have knowledge of individual cases.  Indeed, it is very desirable that unless certain firms approach the Government the banks would not release what essentially is confidential information in regard to these firms but the banks, through the Central Bank, might give some indication to the Minister for Finance that, in their estimation, the number of firms experiencing liquidity problems amounted to 2 per cent but the banks would not specify the individual firms concerned nor would they indicate the extent of the problems of individual firms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle.  I propose taking Questions Nos. 11, 12 and 13 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to mining policy I would refer the Deputy to my speech on 13th December, 1974, in the House on the 1974 Estimates for the Department of Industry and Commerce in which I outlined the present position.  The overriding objective of the Government's policy is to secure a fair share <Col N="544" /> of the profits from our mineral resources for the nation and to provide an adequate degree of control to ensure that the fruits of exploiting our resources are realised to the maximum extent in this country.  In our present circumstances, I consider that this objective can best be achieved by way of balanced mix of private enterprise and State participation which will enable the State to exercise a greater measure of influence over the production and processing of our mineral resources.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that there is no intention of discouraging private prospectors and that any prospectors discovering commercial deposits can rest assured that they will receive leases on terms which will be fair and reasonable. Our requirements in regard to lease terms will be applied in a reasonable and flexible manner and will differentiate between exceptionally profitable operations and others, so as to ensure that the mining companies receive a fair and adequate return on their investment in mining in this country.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, legislation has already been enacted withdrawing the tax exemption from the base metal sector and replacing it by an alternative taxation system tailored specifically to meet the needs of the Irish mining industry.  Legislation was also enacted last year providing for tax relief for coal enterprises proving hardship.  Agreement in principle has already been reached which will give the State a measure of participation in the operation of the privately owned minerals at Navan.  As the Deputy is aware, the determination of lease terms in respect of the State-owned minerals at Navan is being held up because of legal proceedings which have been instituted against the State by the mining interests concerned.</P>
    <P>As regards the conditions under which exclusive off-shore exploration licences may be granted, I expect to remove the last remaining obstacles to publication of these in the very near future.  A statement of policy in regard to the development of our petroleum resources will be published at the same time.</P>
    <Col N="545" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the public are becoming exasperated at having to listen to this waffle being repeated instead of there being a definite policy on mining and exploration?  My question asks when, having regard to the Minister's statement in this House on December 13th last, he will be in a position to let us have the documents setting out the conditions under which exclusive exploration licences may be issued. The Minister told us then that these documents would be available in the near future but these words are repeated again today.  For how long more will this fiddling continue while Rome burns?</P>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by this <Col N="549" /> company and I can understand the concern of the employees.  Initial problems have now been resolved but due to a downturn in demand the company has had to cut back its production programme with a consequent reduction in its workforce and the introduction of short-time working. Some further reductions are expected before the company's operations can be stabilised.  The Industrial Development Authority are working closely with the company in assisting it through the current difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the action he proposes to take to deal with the situation facing Irish industry as detailed by the Federated Union of Employers in their official bulletin of 2nd January, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the December, 1974, issue of the Federated Union of Employers' Bulletin which refers to the decline in consumer demand, the level of unemployment and the inflationary situation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from the White Paper, <i>A National Partnership</i>, that the Government are clearly committed to the maintenance of employment and living standards.  The recent budget as did that of 1974, provided increased social welfare and tax concessions for individual taxpayers, measures which should stimulate consumer demand.  I have also, as the Deputy is aware, set up a committee to take special action to promote the purchase and sale of Irish goods.  As a measure of the Government's commitment to increasing job creation they have made a substantial increase in the financial allocation this year to the IDA for grants to new industry and for the expansion and re-equipment of existing industry.</P>
      <P>The submissions made by industry have been taken into account by the Government and the budget of last week provided tax concessions which will ease cash flow problems, and announced that other measures were under consideration to aid exports of capital goods.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the difficulties which we are going through are shared internationally and that, being heavily dependent on external trade, the depressed external economic scene places a severe constraint on our economic growth potential.  Until the international economic scene begins to improve, expansionary policies pursued at home will obviously take some time to show results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  The budget of 1974 initially recognised that unemployment would be the major concern of this country over the current winter.  Many other Governments did not recognise the fact at that time&mdash;April, 1974.  They concentrated their attention on inflation.  The budget of 1974 was designed to act as a buffer against this high unemployment figure, which might be much higher but for the effects of that budget.  The 1975 budget is, as the Minister described it, a carefully expansionary budget.  This, we are sure, will have the effect of reducing the number unemployed this year and maintaining an increase in growth in the coming 12 months.</P>

I am aware that the syndicate in question announced its intention to withdraw from the market with effect from 1st September, 1974.  The effect of the syndicate's decision was that policy holders with renewal dates on or after 1st September, 1974, would not have their policies renewed and would have to seek cover elsewhere.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, the 1972, 1973 and 1974 notifications were given in February, January and January respectively.  As he will further know, it has been the practice in the Department to await the review of the current year's examination before issuing details for the alternative examination the following year.  This year, in fact, we are a month in advance of previous practice. I think that answers the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose at present to extend the alternative <Col N="555" /> examination in French to the leaving certificate.  The alternative examination on the intermediate certificate has been in operation since 1972 on an experimental basis only and, pending further experience, I am not in a position to consider extending it to the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in schools where the alternative examination is being carried out at present the teaching of French continued along these lines in the fifth year and it is hardly reasonable to expect the students who are following the course relating to the alternative examination to do the written examination in the leaving certificate in those circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties of introducing it at leaving certificate are obvious on an examination of the question which, by the way, is continuing in the Department all the time.  The question of extending the mode to the leaving certificate has been given consideration in the Department and when the Department are satisfied as to the effectiveness and value of the mode in the intermediate certificate examination steps may be taken to introduce it at leaving certificate level also.  This consideration has not concluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Deputy but there are other questions which need to be investigated. For example, at the leaving certificate the problem of recognition of the mode by university authorities is important because of matriculation links between the leaving certificate and the university.  The question of the reliability of teachers' evaluation at this level in assessing, for example, university scholarships and the range of linguistic skills which school-leavers will be expected to have, all these problems make the question of the alternative at leaving certificate much more complex than at intermediate level.</P>

      <P>As I rarely intervene in these discussions, may I ask the Minister whether he is aware that a person can acquire a first class degree in an Irish university, can acquire a doctorate in an Irish university, can teach for 20 years in an English school and come back to this country and not have incremental recognition of the experience he acquired abroad?  Does the Minister think that hiding behind the Supreme Court is an adequate answer to Deputy Wilson's question?</P>

      <P>I am aware of the point the Deputy makes but I think the House might like to know that at <Col N="558" /> the moment, and this is not by way of justification of my action, the facts are that the secondary schools which traditionally absorbed the vast majority of graduate teachers could find this year places for only 630 of the 1,715 graduates who took out their H.Dip in 1974.  Outlets to Britain and the USA are no longer available to Irish graduate teachers as Britain since January, 1974, does not accept the H.Dip except for science and maths graduates and several States of the USA are now actually laying off teachers.  I do not want to aggravate the situation for those graduates who are coming out of our establishments and who cannot get jobs in our secondary schools. That is not in justification of my position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost a week since the Minister introduced his budget and during that time many of us who travel through our constituencies have heard the comments of various sections of the community.  The general opinion is that the Minister will be back again before the year is out with many more mini-budgets.  He may not announce one beforehand but he will come, by ministerial order or otherwise, to seek much more revenue and more taxation to make up for some deficiency which he has overlooked.</P>
      <P>The Minister did very little to help the most depressed sections of the community such as small farmers, social welfare recipients and those in employment, whose numbers are becoming less as the months go by.  The agricultural situation for the vast majority of farmers was never as depressed as it is at the moment.  The small man who has to live on a small herd of milking cows, on the side of a hill or any place else, has very little money to spend.  If the Minister checked with the ACC and the other organisations who advance money to farmers he would find out the large number of applications they have from small farmers looking for extra time to pay back their various instalments. They cannot meet their commitments on the day payment is due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in the budget spoke about interest free loans and the various schemes available for small farmers but there is not much good in telling that to the man who invested heavily and looked forward to a good future in agriculture but now finds himself up to his neck in money he borrowed. He finds it very difficult to pay back this money.  The pattern was that the small man would sell his store cattle to the bigger farmer and he would get a fair crack of the whip. The Minister mentioned what the State had to pay to intervention under EEC regulations but I would like to point out that that money has mainly gone into the pockets of a few big factors and has not percolated down <Col N="591" /> the line to the small men who had to produce the calves and sell them at 4 and 5 cwt.</P>
    <P>The forecast of everybody in the trade is that there is grave doubt that the small man will benefit this year. It is forecast there will be surplus beef in England and that there will be imports from third countries.  Has the Minister taken recognition of that?  He has done nothing in the budget to give confidence to the small farmer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is in charge of the purse strings and if he is to put so much money into keeping up the price of cattle for sale he should do something about seeing that some of that money goes to the small man.  He should be able to take some money from the big man and give a floor price for small cattle.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the cattle feed vouchers.  He is providing £2 million here but there are many people who applied for those vouchers and did not get them.  They have been contacting Dáil Deputies to do something about the matter.  I hope the money the Minister is providing now will clear up the backlog.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consult with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, about introducing strict price control on fertilisers and animal foodstuffs.  The Minister may say that various farming organisations asked to have the price decontrolled.  I believe this was a mistake. The various committees of agriculture, who know what is happening all over the country, are requesting that there should be strict price control on fertilisers and animal foodstuffs. We are told that the price of maize has dropped all over the world but we do not see any benefit from that in the various animal foodstuffs presented for sale.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a new EEC scheme which is to give money to livestock farmers in hilly and other disadvantaged areas.  It makes no difference whether we talk about the EEC plan or the Mansholt plan.  There are thousands of farmers here who cannot exist on their incomes at the moment.  We should ensure that they <Col N="592" /> are given extra money to help them to eke out a living.  We have not enough industries to absorb all the people who are likely to leave the land.  Many of those people will still be on the land in 1985 and it is our duty to see they have enough money to rear their families.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if the £6 million which the Minister is providing for this scheme is sufficient.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries should place in the library details of the areas his Department are sending to the EEC.  There is grave disquiet in my part of the country about what areas are in and what are out because Cork has been divided.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to bring in a scheme that would include every small farmer regardless of the area he lived in.  The old scheme is a good idea but the amount of money provided will not go very far.  We have been told that the more applicants there are the less they will get and that only so much money will come out of the EEC Fund.  I take it the Minister will be subsidising the scheme pound for pound, but I should like him to explain what his intentions are.  In his budget speech he said no more than that £6 million was being provided.  That is not good enough.  These people are looking forward to this provision.  There are also people involved in suckling and if their scheme is to be changed it is only fair that they should be told.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear the Minister for Defence say the other day that the small store farmer was well looked after.  If he did a tour of the area I live in he would know that small farmers are not well looked after.  It is very disquieting that there were some millions of gallons less delivered to our creameries in 1974 than in 1973.  This is a drop of about 5 per cent, which is very serious.  There is no guarantee that there will be an increase in the gallonage of milk delivered to creameries in 1975.  This will have very serious repercussions on employment in the various processing plants.  It must be remembered that when agricultural products drop in price and volume it has very <Col N="593" /> serious consequences for our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>There has been a big change in the traditional way of handling pigs from the days when the small farmer had so many sows in the yard.  Now production has gone into the hands of the big units and there is great danger that there will not be an increase in the amount of pigs for slaughter this year.  If the Minister does not deal with this situation there will be unemployment in this sector.</P>
    <P>There is no incentive in the budget for the smaller man in the agricultural sector, so that he is really depending on what comes from the EEC.  I would appeal to the Minister to fight for the highest amount he can get and, if necessary, not to hesitate to come to this House with proposals for giving more to agriculture, because the survival of so many families depends on it.</P>
    <P>There is very little provision in the budget for the private housing sector. The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government may say all is going well, but there is a decline in the number of planning applications for the building of private houses.  The Fianna Fáil Party have a motion down on the order paper for some time which asks that the loan would be raised from £4,500 to £6,000, that the qualifying limit would be raised to £3,000, and that grants would be increased by some 50 per cent.  I do not know whether the Minister for Local Government is fighting for this money or not.  If he is I am sure the Minister for Finance is not inclined to give it to him.  However, unless he does something about it the decline in the private house building sector will get worse in 1975.</P>
    <P>There is the difficulty that local authorities cannot advance the loans until the houses are completed.  There are many people who get sanction from the local authority for a loan of £4,000 or £4,500 but some of the bank managers, whether on local initiative or on instructions from headquarters, say they are unable to give a bridging loan.  The Minister should get a categorical <Col N="594" /> statement from the banks that the council's sanction for a loan will be honoured by a bridging loan.  He could get over it another way.  There could be legislation to provide that a man who had got sanction for a loan would get some of it when he would have the foundations laid and so on right up through the various stages of building the house.  It is inappropriate to go into further detail on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has also stated he is increasing two-fold the money provided for local improvements. He is allowing for the fact that we are going from a nine-months to a yearly budget and also making up for inflation and the higher cost of repairing these roads.  Therefore that is not a huge increase.  I thought the Minister would say he was providing £1 million for the repair of bog roads.  We live in an age in which we are told to conserve fuel, oil, energy and so on, that it is costing an enormous amount of money to import oil.  The Minister will say it is up to the local authorities to disburse the money provided.  He should have stated specifically what money he wanted each local authority to devote to the various bog roads so that lorries would be able to travel on them.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of talk about environment, about providing playing fields, parish halls and so on.  For many years so much money was provided by the Department for amenity schemes.  There is no such money this year.  The Minister should think twice about this.  We must encourage local voluntary organisations to provide facilities for youth and for the local people generally.  It was always money well spent, and it does indicate the serious financial position when it was found necessary to withdraw the small amount of money spent on this worthy scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of unemployment, and some people may say there has been a reduction within the past week.  We all know how that <Col N="595" /> came about.  It was merely a temporary drop and now we have 20,000 to 25,000 more people unemployed as compared with this time 12 months ago.  It is a great strain on resources to have to pay out so much each week.  There are, too, pay-related benefits and redundancy money.  If one multiplies the amounts by the 25,000 more unemployed a great deal of money is going out each week. There are fewer people paying income tax and fewer people paying for the social welfare stamp.  All this makes the position very serious indeed.  If what I have suggested were done that would help to rectify this unsatisfactory position.</P>
    <P>It has been said that there are so many out of work that others will be only part-time out of employment.  In a very short time those on the three-day week at present will be redundant. We have had various budgets from time to time.  We have had increases under the health scheme; the contribution has been increased from £7 to £12.  Hardly a day passes that there is not an increase of some kind. We must, of course, ensure that the economy survives and the Government must do their utmost to control the situation.  We have a huge deficit. Deputy Donegan talked about the confidence in the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence.  He referred to the northeast Cork by-election.  It was a vote of &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo; there because taking the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party together the combined vote was down by something like 3,000 votes.  That does not show confidence. He said security is costing the country a good deal at the moment.  We must pay our Defence Forces and our Garda.  They are fighting for better conditions and more money.  Our Defence Forces should be looked after properly. When the Minister was speaking here last week we were all hoping that peace would prevail.  The Government are very quiet.  They should be <Col N="596" /> playing a greater part in the peace moves initiated by the various churchmen. Like the Minister for Defence, I sincerely hope that the day is just around the corner when security can be relaxed.  It is the duty of all to support every effort which will bring that situation about.</P>
      <P>Government supporters boast about the great things they are doing for social welfare recipients.  These will be getting an alleged huge bonanza on 1st April.  If one examines the increases one finds they will not be so huge at all.</P>
      <P>Before the budget it was clearly recognised and accepted that non-contributory pensioners, those in receipt of unemployment assistance and home assistance were in dire need.  In my area it was thought that another £600,000 would have to be earmarked to supply these people with fuel to keep them alive over the winter.  As a result of this budget they will get an increase of £1.55 from 1st April; that will bring them up from £7.30 to £8.85.  I understood some time back that the Minister intended to re-organise the whole structure and I was hoping that in this re-organisation all differentials would be removed as between DPMA, UA and non-contributory pensions. That has not been the evolution.  The single non-contributory pensioner will, as a result of the budget, get 35p more than the person in receipt of DPMA and £1.15 more than the person in receipt of unemployment assistance.  These differentials should be removed.  All recipients should be brought up to the £8.85 per week. That is not a very large sum in today's money values.  The person who buys one pound of tea, one pound of butter and a loaf of bread has very little change left out of £1.  A bag of coal will cost at least £1.50 A non-contributory pensioner with a kitchen and living room will need at least three bags of coal a week.  By the following Thursday night these categories will have very little left out of DPMA, UA or even the non-contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we are not treating these <Col N="597" /> people properly.  We should have a more humanitarian approach to our senior citizens.  I was hoping for a big break through this year, the more so as we no longer have to provide agricultural subsidies.  We are now getting money back from the EEC. We are not doing enough for our senior citizens.  The cost of living has increased and inflation is running at 20 to 25 per cent.  That may be all right if you have a high income and you get a 20 per cent increase, but when you have an income as low as £7.30 per week and it is raised to £8.85 a week that is very sad.</P>
    <P>The figures supplied to us by the Minister are very informative.  The Minister should provide more for the person who has no income.  A person can have an income of £2,600 or £2,700 and still get an old age pension. There is nothing wrong with that, but I am talking about the unfortunate person who has no other income and who has no way of getting any other assistance.  In the rural areas he may get firing from a neighbour but the provision of fuel is a great problem to people in cities and towns.  It is no wonder that organisations throughout the country are becoming more and more aware of these problems. Leaving politics aside, in this generation we will have to admit that we are not treating that category fairly. In this budget the Minister has done a bad job in that regard.  That cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>We had the increase which we are getting used to of 30p a month in children's allowances.  That is 1p a day per child.  The day of the penny lollipop is almost gone.  Many Departments will not improve their services in the coming year.  The service provided by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has deteriorated.  Nothing in this budget will improve the postal and telephone systems.  The telephone system is chaotic throughout the country.  The relevant Minister will have to tackle that job soon.  He does not seem to be handling it.  He seems to be more interested in many other matters which should not concern him at all.  We see statements from time to time about all the inquiries there <Col N="598" /> are about new factories.  Why then are not more of our people employed? Our population is increasing and, when a man becomes unemployed, he cannot jump on an emigrant ship and get a job in another country.  We will have to think more and more seriously about providing employment for our own people here at home. There is nothing positive in this budget to do that.</P>
    <P>The unions have a big role to play in the running of the country.  I have always believed that the unions should not be tied to any political party. They should not subscribe to a political party because once they do they become completely biased in their views and they cannot see what is happening.  At the moment we have the peculiar situation that the unions are not making any case for the workers.  The workers are very dissatisfied. We all hope that a new national wage agreement will be successfully negotiated.</P>
    <P>Every day we hear various Ministers shouting that the workers will have to tighten their belts and that they must not make exorbitant wage demands.  Many workers will have to demand large wage increases to enable them to make ends meet.  Members of this House come under the national wage agreement.  The workers can see that we get fair increases per year. You cannot get a big increase yourself and then ask the next person to tighten his belt.  That simply is not on. The example will have to come from the top.  Everybody will have to be seen to tighten his belt.  The Government are not setting an example and therefore they cannot expect the ordinary man on the factory floor to say: &ldquo;I am willing to accept very little for the general good of the country.&rdquo; When a worker knows that the people on the top rung of the ladder, and Ministers and public representatives, can get a certain amount of extra money per year, you cannot blame him for looking for the same.</P>
    <P>There is a lot in the papers at the moment about dumping from countries outside the EEC.  The unions have failed to take action in this matter.  Dumping has affected the <Col N="599" /> textile trade.  The information to hand is that huge supplies have come in here from those countries at very cheap rates.  The unions should know as we know that the people in those countries work for half nothing.  They live in shocking housing conditions. Their way of life is completely different from ours.  They have a very low standard of living.  Very often the manipulators and the people who built the factories in those countries do not reside there.  They come from the powerful nations and they see where the cheap labour is.  They set up factories and export goods to the richer countries.  The unions should ensure that this is not allowed to go on.</P>
    <P>An example was set in Cork recently when the dockers prevented a shipload of meat from leaving.  I understand they did this for one reason.  They wanted the Government to implement the cheap beef scheme for recipients of social welfare.  They blacked the ship and would not allow it to sail.  That scheme should have been put into operation long ago.  The point I want to make is that if they involved themselves in the question of what is coming into the country at cut-throat prices, and causing unemployment here, they would be doing a good day's work.  There is unemployment in my part of the country, which could be considered a rural area, as a result.  Some people in business will tell you that there are firms with a supply of goods which will last for two years.  There was a sale a short time ago in a particular premises, which I will not mention.  They made such profits that they were able to sell children's socks at 4p a pair.</P>
    <P>We are in the process of having a Buy Irish Campaign.  Surveys have shown that the more exclusive shops do not stock Irish goods.  The producers of the articles are blaming the retailers for not ordering them and the retailers are blaming the producers.  It is the Government's duty to ensure that that mismanagement between shopkeepers and manufacturers is brought to an end.</P>
    <P>Many garments being sold in the <Col N="600" /> shops do not show the country of manufacture.  Some firms tear off the tag showing the country of origin and put on their own brand.  I understood that legislation was passed here to ensure that the country of origin would be shown on all the goods.  I understood that was a general agreed principle between the various exporting and importing nations.  That is not the case.  Naturally enough, if a person sees an Irish brand name on the article he will take it for granted that that article was produced here, whereas it has come from a factory thousands of miles away in which there are shocking labour conditions.  Speculators have invested their money.  They see a way of making soft money and sell their goods to this country.  The unions have a big role to play and the sooner they play it the better.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the income tax code.  We read last year that so many hundreds of thousands of people were taken out of the income tax net.  It is quite obvious that, with the various rounds of wage increases, no sooner are they out than they are in again.  There were no great wage increases this year.  The ordinary working man has not secured great increases this year.  The country really needs an incentive to bring back the money that has gone abroad.  There is no doubt that millions of pounds have left our shores; nobody can deny this.  Any financier or anybody in a bank will tell you that millions of pounds have gone out, not in big amounts because much of it represents the savings of the ordinary boy or girl who set out to save for five or six years and put money in the bank or elsewhere and found out after a very short time that their savings were taxable as well as their earnings.  We must have some incentive to get this money back.  A far greater proportion of interest on savings should be tax free.  The first £5,000 invested should be free of income tax, especially if it represents savings.  This type of taxation often results in people being charged tax which would originally be 26p in the £ but will become 35p in the £ because of their savings.</P>
    <P>This economy requires the money <Col N="601" /> that has gone abroad and it would be much better if it were providing employment at home and being used by Irish people than having us in the position of going out seeking foreign money.  There is no incentive in the budget which would bring back this money and this was remiss of the Minister who should reconsider the position. When and if he introduces legislation which would have this effect we, on this side of the House, will be glad to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>For a long time I sat on the other side of the House and during budget debates made every effort to find the loopholes and comment on them.  I do not blame Deputy Meaney for doing the same thing.  In the early years I found myself making comments pretty soon after the budget had been introduced and I subsequently found that I was not, perhaps, exactly on the mark. As years went by, I became more conscious of the necessity to check facts regarding social welfare improvements and taxes contained in the budgets as well as the grants made available.  So, so far as the older hands were concerned the debate was usually confined to facts.  I was rather surprised this year listening to the budget contributions from the Opposition that while some of the points were well made others were not factual comments on the budget.  Some speakers appeared to have closed their eyes, gone back over the years and changed places with us in Opposition; they were making the comments we could legitimately make in past years such as that many people were in a bad way under social welfare, and that we were not providing enough in social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This makes me recall the days when social welfare got a very low priority from Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance and when it was true to say that many people were in a pretty bad way.  I am not trying to say that social welfare recipients are well off but without fear of contradiction I say that they are now, and will be when this budget is implemented, better <Col N="602" /> off than they ever were under the previous Administration.  A wide range of people who were completely outside the social welfare classes under the previous Government have been included and are now enjoying certain support from Government funds.  This is as it should be.</P>
    <P>One of the great achievements of the Government is the tremendous improvement not only in the amount of social benefits being paid but in the widening of the range of services granted to social welfare beneficiaries. A number of changes were introduced by Fianna Fáil and these have been continued and improved by the National Coalition Government but a wide range of people who would not be considered for benefit under the previous Government have been brought into the scheme and are receiving various types of benefit.  To hear Fianna Fáil speakers saying that social welfare classes were not being looked after makes one wonder whether they are talking about this budget or a previous Fianna Fáil one.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear about the three bags of coal which the social welfare recipient needed to warm a house.  The person who is at present able to buy three bags of coal or requires them will have more than one fire going and he certainly would not be able to use even one bag of coal in some of the ramshackle houses built by Fianna Fáil in the latter years of their administration.  In making his case Deputy Meaney was exaggerating more than slightly.  He also said that now that no grants were being paid to agriculture there would be more money available for social welfare.  In fact, more money is being paid in this budget for agriculture than in the year 1971-72 and there is also very much more being paid in grants to agriculture, as Deputy Meaney who is himself engaged in agriculture must, or should be aware.</P>
    <P>In the main, his case was fairly well worked out but he did go off the line in a number of ways to which I am drawing attention.  I was interested also in his reference to the trade unions, what they should do and the <Col N="603" /> increases they should get.  It always touches me when I hear people like the Deputy talking of the unfortunate trade unionist and what he is entitled to.  As one who was for 26 years a trade union official, I assure him that the trade unions know their friends. Also, I think it wrong that an effort should be made at present by the Opposition, who I assume are as interested in the solvency of this country as we are, to encourage people to look for more than they would seek, perhaps, if they listened to those who are representing them at trade union level.</P>
    <P>I want to see workers getting higher standards of living as the years go by and I am glad to see it happening but I think it is wrong to suggest that they should seek tremendous increases just because Fianna Fáil are not in office.  I heard what Fianna Fáil said when they were in office about these things.  As regards the trade union connection with the Labour Party, I remind Deputy Meaney that the Labour Party was set up by the trade union movement in 1912 and nobody can get away from that.  You cannot reverse history.</P>
    <P>I also heard his reference to buying Irish and while I might not agree entirely with his arguments it is true that a buy Irish campaign is very necessary and I am glad to see that this campaign is succeeding.  It is not sufficient to tell the trade union members in the shops and elsewhere to insist that Irish goods are the only goods sold and used and that foreign goods should not be imported.  The campaign will succeed when the Irish people realise that it is in their own interest to buy Irish goods.  I have, through the years, insisted that Irish goods are as good as, if not better than, and in many cases cheaper than, foreign goods that have been imported by the million pounds worth for many years.  Incidentally, the free trade agreement was introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government who took away all the protection.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it was not a bad move to take away some protection which Irish <Col N="604" /> manufacturers had but, having taken it away, it is useless now for Fianna Fáil spokesmen to ask why do we not prevent foreign goods from coming in. If the Irish housewife or the man buying even a pair of socks insists on getting Irish products, many more Irish-manufactured goods could be sold. From my own experience over the past few weeks since the buy Irish campaign was intensified I am glad to say that a good deal of Irish goods are being sold and we have shops doing something they did not do for years&mdash; putting up signs for Irish goods.  We saw them before putting up signs about British and Italian goods as if there was some special merit in buying goods from those countries.  I am glad to see that at last the buy Irish campaign is coming into its own and is succeeding.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney talked of millions of pounds going out of the country but the net inflow of capital is pretty big and has been over the last year.  There is not a big rush by people with money, in big or small amounts, out of the country.  I am glad this is so and I am sure Deputy Meaney, and the Fianna Fáil Party, are glad also.  It is wrong to give the impression that if people want to get a good interest rate for their money they should dash outside the country to invest it.</P>
    <P>Naturally, one of the main things I wish to talk about concerns my own Department and the way the budget affects the running of that Department. From the point of view of Local Government this year's budget can best be appreciated by the steps which will make possible a fairly impressive expansion in the activities of my Department in the next 12 months.  As against a total provision on current and capital account of less than £85 million for the Department of Local Government in 1972-73 more than £181 million will be made available for 1975, an increase of 113 per cent.  This increased expenditure will be reflected in expanded construction activity by local authorities, expanded construction which has a special social element It will also complement the many other activities in the social sphere which have been achieved in the local government sector. <Col N="605" /> It amuses me to hear people talking about a reduction in the amount of money being spent by local government. An increase of 113 per cent since the change of Government, no matter how one looks at it, is a fairly hefty increase.  I am glad it was possible to do it under my Ministry and under a National Coalition Government.  Apart from the number of houses being built &mdash;a matter which I will deal with later &mdash;I should like to refer to the standard of houses, particularly local authority houses.  The standard of house being built when I took over as Minister for Local Government was deplorable.</P>
    <P>The reason was that the then Minister for Finance was under the impression that the proper thing to do in order to save money was to provide as many of what are known as low-cost houses as possible.  In other words, build a cheap house.  The comment was made that the house that would last 100 years was not what was needed; all that was needed was a house that would last 25 to 30 years. Therefore, the general standard dropped, the design dropped, the standard of construction dropped and the standard of the type of material being used dropped.</P>
    <P>Now we have a situation where it is costing what would build thousands of houses to repair houses built in 1971-72 and part of 1973.  This is a shocking indictment of the then Government.  They created the situation and there is no use blaming the contractors, the men who designed them or the men who worked on them.  Those people did what they were told and what they were paid for.  That was a shocking situation and it should not have been allowed.  I am proud of the fact that the first thing I did was to give instructions that this was to stop and that the standard of house to be built was to be one that anyone would be proud of.  A house that a person would not be proud to live in is not worth building.  I am happy that the people are now getting from the local authorities a house which all of us are glad to see them living in and which will be a monument to this Government in 20 years time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> The whole idea of building houses was considered by various Governments. There was a big backlog and the fact that the average number of houses being built in the five years before I took over was about 15,000 per year was not meeting anything like the demand by people looking for houses or meeting the number of houses which were going out of use meant that there was a net loss in the housing stock annually.  When we were campaigning for election we told the electorate that we would attempt to get the housing scheme up to 25,000 per year and that we would provide the necessary money for that. Frankly, we thought it would take some time to do that but I am delighted to be able to say that we did it in the first year.</P>
    <P>We also decided that we would increase the number of local authority houses to be built from 5,800 to 8,000. This year we will have 7,250, which is not bad after only two years in Government.  The whole question of housing is one which was neglected.  I have been critical of my predecessor, and maybe unfairly, in regard to one aspect of housing, the question of heating of those houses.  It was decided by my predecessor that the proper thing to do was to instal central heating in groups of houses because, it was felt, this would be a cheap and reasonable way of heating the houses. This was a big mistake.  It was not the fault of my predecessor because he is not an engineer or an architect and he did not know that the oil crisis was coming along.  The introduction of central heating in houses which possibly were never intended for such a form of heating created massive condensation.  It caused the tenants incredible headaches because of the bills they had to pay for electricity when they used the central heating.  It may be unfair if I continue to blame my immediate predecessor for that because he was not to know that massive changes were to take place in the price of electricity.</P>
    <P>However, this happened but I changed the whole lot around.  The regulations now are that there must be in all grant houses and local <Col N="607" /> authority houses at least one open fireplace.  I would prefer two open fires in local authority houses and I would prefer if these houses did not have central heating but if the tenants wish to instal central heating it is all right.  I found that, apart from the fact that it was costing a lot of money to instal central heating which many tenants later asked the ESB to cut off, the cost of installing outside equipment to supply central heating to a scheme of houses was colossal. This ran the rent and the ultimate purchase price of the house completely out of the pockets of people who wished to purchase them.  I am glad the situation has been changed, that the people now have good houses and that everything connected with them is first class.  The contractors, architects, engineers and the workers have proved that we can produce the type of house that we can all be proud of.</P>
    <P>The question of housing subsidy also arises.  Health charges and house subsidies have been talked about.  I am aware that before the election the Fianna Fáil Party suggested that if they were returned to power they would take the rates off dwelling-houses. It was a handy scheme which had not been worked out and was introduced when Fianna Fáil were losing ground.  Fianna Fáil have been talking about it ever since but I am sure they never worked such a scheme out.  I am sure Fianna Fáil did not understand it or what it amounted to, but, it was in response to a proposal we made, that we would take health and housing charges off the rates, and this we have done.  This year the rate required to be struck by local authorities for these services is only 25 per cent of the respective 1972-73 rates for the same services; which means that the total contribution facing ratepayers has been cut down to approximately £10.8 million as against £43.2 million in 1972-73.  Indeed, if we take into account the increase in expenditure on health and housing since 1972-73&mdash;the addition which has been included for various reasons&mdash;the saving to the ratepayer <Col N="608" /> amounts to about £60 million.  In the year 1976 the rates in the £ for the same services will be further reduced to 12½ per cent of the 1972-73 rates. From the 1st January, 1977, onwards the Exchequer will meet the full cost, that is if we are still using the rates system as we now know it.</P>
    <P>I should point out also that in general ratepayers this year are paying £4 in the £ less than they would have had there not been a change of Government.  That is something which people do not seem to understand but it is a plain fact.  I want particularly to say that if Fianna Fáil had done what they said they would do and taken rates off houses, farmers would still be paying rates on their lands, and their land is rated at £4 in the £ less than it would have been under a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>These are aspects of our budget which seem to be overlooked by people who should know.  They are plain facts of life.  I do not believe in making statements that are incorrect. I do not believe in high-falutin' language over which one cannot stand.  I believe in plain facts, and those are the plain facts there for everyone to prove or dispute.</P>
    <P>Somebody in the House said to me recently: &ldquo;But the rates are higher this year than they were last year.&rdquo; I would imagine this is so for two reasons.  One is the increase in costs generally and the second is that local authorities, to my knowledge, have found that they are able to do things now which they could not possibly have dreamt of doing before the health and housing charges were taken off the rates.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have said enough about this but I think it only fair that this should go on the record.  In addition to that the Government decided to give further relief to rates, first by recouping local authorities in full for payments made by them on foot of court decrees in respect of damage to property caused by the use of explosives and attributable to disturbances in Northern Ireland.  That was quite a substantial amount in a number of counties.</P>
    <P>Where the cost of malicious injuries <Col N="609" /> compensation to a local authority in 1975 and any subsequent year exceeds the rate of 20p in the £ the excess will be recouped by the Exchequer.  This has meant that North Tipperary County Council, who are facing a colossal increase in rates, Cavan County Council, Monaghan County Council have been able to strike a reasonable rate and this in addition to the health and housing subsidy which the State now pays.  Provision for relieving the rate was increased from £1 million in 1974 to £2 million in 1975.  Of course there was no corresponding provision in 1972-73, the last year in which the Opposition were in office.  These £2 million do not take into account the amount which is covered by the 20p maximum increase in the rates for malicious injuries.</P>
    <P>I said on a number of occasions here that the National Coalition said before the general election that they would be anxious to review the rates system and to try to change it.  I always held that, while the rates system was perhaps a handy way of raising local capital, it was an inequitable system in itself.  It is not related to the ability of people to pay. The Government have agreed with me that a review should be undertaken by my Department with the primary objective of seeking to relate local taxation to ability to pay.  Because of the complexity of the matter I have commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to supplement my Department's efforts by carrying out a study of certain aspects of the matter.  I was pressed here by people who wanted to know when it was proposed to introduce this new system, if such were to be introduced. At the time I said, and I repeat now, that I cannot say. There is no point in asking somebody to do a job and then, halfway through, deciding to jump the gun and say that this is what is going to happen. I want to know what is the best way and, when that has been established, I will bring it before the Government and the House.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of rating which annoys me particularly.  That is its operation with regard to widows <Col N="610" /> who have a very small income.  Local authorities are entitled to allow them, and indeed to allow some other sections of the community, a reduced rate; or they can abolish the rate altogether. But I find that some local authorities have not implemented that system. Some of them have shown a marked reluctance to giving this small relief to people who are really badly off. I mentioned that before in answer to a question put down in the House.  May I say again that I hope there will be a more liberal application of this alleviation?</P>
    <P>I shall cite just one example of what has been happening&mdash;the case of a widow with four or five children who was afforded a rate relief.  When one of her children got a small job which did not bring in very much money, the local authority immediately imposed the full rate the following year.  This happens in most similar cases.  I think that is entirely wrong and is not the way the system was intended to be operated.  The system was introduced by my predecessor; it was introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government and was one of the good things they did. I do not think they ever intended that that was the way it should be operated. But when they found it was operating that way they did not seem to do anything about it.  I have been attempting to rectify the position.  I cannot tell the local authorities but I am suggesting to them that they be more lenient in dealing with the less well off sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The key position which the building industry occupies in the economy is well known to all of us and indeed its very high employment content.  Because of this the Government have given, and continue to give, unprecedented financial support to the industry. Within the nine months period April to December, 1947, a total of £189 million&mdash;that would be the equivalent of approximately £240 million in a full year&mdash;was provided in the public capital programme to generate work for the industry. As a result a high level of activity in the sectors of the industry supported by public funds was maintained throughout 1974 and the value <Col N="611" /> of output in 1974-75 at current prices is likely to be of the order of a record £450 million, due in no small way to massive Government support.</P>
    <P>I know that some of the gentlemen of the Press have been commenting adversely on the fact that I have said and repeated frequently&mdash;one of them, in particular, challenged the validity of it without any evidence to prove that what he said was correct, and he must know that he is wrong&mdash;the position is that last year, up to the 31st March, 1974,25,365 houses were built.  There is no doubt about that.  The evidence is there and was compiled on the same principle as has obtained down through the years.  Up to the 31st December, 1974, which takes in the first three months of the year included in the previous statistics, over 25,000 houses have again been completed.  By the 31st March next, which will be a calendar year since the last figure of 25,365 was furnished, we will have not alone as many as last year but several hundreds more.</P>
    <P>This is something about which we have the right to be proud and I personally have the right to say that this is something we have achieved.  The building industry, and those employed in it, should be proud of the fact that they rose to the occasion.  All right, they have had their difficulties.  But when I listen to people talking about the collapse of the building industry &mdash;I shall not say it amuses me because such comment annoys rather than amuses me&mdash;I think it wrong that people should talk about such a serious matter in a way in which they pretend they know what is happening and, at the same time, completely ignore facts.  I am dealing merely with facts today.  The larger houses, the more expensive ones, have not been selling well since last summer.  It is true that there are large houses which have been built and are not occupied. That is quite true.  This has had an effect, for instance, on those who make bricks, because bricks are generally used for the facing of such houses.  In one instance of which I am aware this has reduced the number of people employed in the brick-making <Col N="612" /> industry.  I have asked builders of local authority and small houses to use more bricks; if they do so, that problem should be sloved.</P>
    <P>Not only have more of the smaller type houses and considerably more local authority houses been built during the year but during the next 12 months output will continue at the same high level.  Deputy Meaney, who is generally a reasonable man, said that there were some small towns and villages as well as rural areas in which houses were not being built. That is not so.  There are more houses than ever being built in such areas and an increasing number of planning applications are being sanctioned.</P>
    <P>Some time ago it was decided by one of my predecessors that in so far as possible people should be forced to live in settlements or villages rather than that isolated houses would be built for them in rural areas.  Being a country man I know that people who are born and reared in the country see life in a different light from those who are reared in cities or towns.  This policy of not building isolated houses was a bad one because country people were not happy to live in built-up areas.  It was their hope to marry and raise their families in country areas but it was only in exceptional circumstances that isolated cottages were built by local authorities.</P>
    <P>However, I changed that situation and now hundreds of these cottages are being built throughout the country. People who perhaps would have found it almost impossible to acquire sites near a town have got sites in country areas.  Where it is convenient, local authorities and county councils have joined together to build housing schemes on sites beside towns and villages, and because it is now possible for a scheme of 60 or so houses to be built without reference being made to the Department, many such schemes are in progress, whereas in the past there would have been a delay of, perhaps, six or seven years in getting the work off the ground.  These changes have revitalised rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I might mention the effect of planning in this regard.  There is a Planning <Col N="613" /> Bill under debate currently in the House so I shall not say much on this aspect except to remind Deputies that when I took office I found that planning permission was given only within very tight limits and that it had been refused in numerous cases where it should have been granted.  My attitude on planning will result in many people building beautiful houses in 1975 in rural Ireland.  Regardless of what those who refused planning permission in the first instance in the cases in which I have since granted it may think, those houses will enhance the appearance of the countryside.  As I said a week ago, a well built house&mdash; not a well built scheme of houses, as somebody in the Press Gallery said&mdash; in a rural area in which a family are being reared is far better than having a bare mountainside where there is no sign of human life.  This may be an old-fashioned concept but it is the sort of situation that I have been trying to bring about and I am happy with the result achieved so far.  I trust that when the planning board come into being they will continue this policy.</P>
    <P>I have been relating our achievements to date but let no one think that we will now rest on our laurels. The work must continue.  A further £300 million is being provided in the 1975 capital programme to stimulate building and construction work in the year ahead.  This refutes the criticism that the Government are neglecting the building industry.  When I took office there were employed slightly more than 80,000 people in the building industry.  That figure has been increased now to slightly more than 82,000.</P>
    <P>We have heard that the private building sector is on the verge of collapse.  Some people come to me and tell me that they are engaged in building private houses, that they are selling these houses at a profit and that, consequently, they are happy with the situation.  However, there were some people who made substantial sums of money as a result of being engaged in the private building sector and much of this money was invested in land banks.  Some of these people have admitted that part of their financial <Col N="614" /> trouble at present is due to their having acquired much more land than they are able to use and they now find themselves short of cash.  It is unfair that they should blame the Government for that situation.  We have poured money consistently into the building industry in order to keep it going.  Because we reached our target of 25,000 houses during our first year in office there were some people who expected us to increase that figure to 30,000 in the next year and to continue increasing it year by year. Apparently there were some who planned on that being the situation but those people did not come out of that very well.  Again, they cannot blame the Government in that regard.</P>
    <P>We have done our share.  We believe that the building industry will continue to do very well and that the number of houses built in 1975 will be 25,000 plus.</P>
    <P>I shall give some figures to substantiate what I am saying.  In the period April to September, 1974, the number of mortgages approved for house purchase loans totalled 10,929 and the value of these loans amounted to £51.9 million.  The corresponding figures for 1973 were 9,456 loans and £41 million respectively.  New house grant allocations and payments continue to be at a very high level.  In the nine-month period to the 31st December, 1974, more than 12,000 new house grants were allocated and ment.  In the 12 months to the end of December, 1974, the total output of will be exceeded as at 31st March, 1975.</P>
    <P>I attended a function recently at which a Fianna Fáil representative spoke after I had spoken and this gentleman suggested that the achievement last year of 25,000 houses was because there were included in that figure dwellings which had been built many years earlier and which were the subject of the new revised and improved tenant purchase arrangements which I introduced in July 1973. This is utter nonsense.  The individual concerned must have embarrassed Fianna Fáil people in this House <Col N="615" /> although he is not a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>The quarterly publication on housing statistics has been published by my Department for many years and the basis on which the statistics are arrived at have not changed.  It will be noted that in the bulletion total house output for 1973-74 comprised 6,539 local authority dwellings for letting, 17,380 dwellings completed with grants from my Department, 446 other stages of dwellings completed and, finally, an estimate of 1,000 dwellings provided through conversion and dwellings provided without any house grants.  The total is 25,365.  It was alleged that the figures from grant-aided dwellings, 17,380, are unduly inflated because they include dwellings built in earlier years and sold to tenants under the 1973 sales scheme.  This is not so and I would like to make it very clear that the person who made this statement did not know what he was talking about.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to make a distinction between a tenant purchasing an existing local authority house and a prospective tenant who now has the option from the outset of purchasing or renting a new house from a local authority when it becomes available. In the case of an existing dwelling, the sales price of the house to the tenant is reduced by amounts equivalent to the maximum State and local authority grants plus an amount equivalent to the capitalised value of rates remission.  In this case, a grant from my Department is neither allocated nor paid.  There is no question of these houses being included in the output figure.  In the case of the prospective tenant-purchaser, grants are payable by my Department for the new houses.  But to avoid duplication these grants are not included in the figures for dwellings completed with grants from my Department. Details of these grants operations are shown separately.</P>
    <P>There also seems to have been confusion in this gentleman's mind on the matter of statistics for water and sewerage grants paid by my Department. <Col N="616" /> In 1973-74 the number of grants fell to 6,780.  A further look at the figures will reveal that almost twice the number of grants, 12,704, were paid by my Department in the year 1973-74.  The fact that the Government in their first year of office achieved their housing target of 25,000 dwellings appears to have discomfited certain people, including this gentleman.  However, there is no justification for suggesting that housing statistics were juggled.  If anybody wants to check on statistics, my officials and I will be only too glad to make available any information needed.  We did not change the system in operation nor do we propose to change it.</P>
    <P>One of the big question marks with regard to building is building societies. They played a very significant part in the housing programmes last year and will, I hope, continue to do so in the coming year.  Despite all the pessimistic forecasts in the last year, by the 31st March next, they will have paid out about £40 million in loans, which is not far short of an all-time record which they created in 1973-74. In common with all other saving institutions during times of high inflation, the societies experience considerable difficulties in attracting and retaining funds.  Because of the action taken by the Government, with effect from 23rd May, 1973, when a subsidy was introduced, societies have been able, as I have proved, to maintain the high level of activity.  The subsidy had the effect of enabling the societies to offer reasonable rates of interest to their investors and, at the same time, cushioning the borrowers from the full impact of higher mortgage interest rates.  In addition, borrowing facilities were arranged by the Government to enable the societies to expand their commitments.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the societies were not satisfied with the conditions under which they borrowed the money from the banks, but they accepted it. Those who say they were not satisfied do not understand that the people who run the societies know their business and accepted the terms before the deal was completed.  Therefore anyone who <Col N="617" /> says that these terms were forced on the societies does not know the facts. I am in close touch with the building societies.  There has been a drop in interest rates across the water.  Perhaps that will have the effect of improving the situation here.</P>
    <P>The most recent information available from the societies shows that there is an improvement in their inflow of funds.  If that trend is maintained the prospect for house purchasers in 1975 will be very good.  As I said, I am keeping in constant touch with the societies.  Recently I had a number of conversations with their officials and we hope to come to a very good arrangement with them.  A Building Society Bill will be introduced in the near future which will not deal with the immediate problem. It is long overdue.  We will be very glad to see it through this House.</P>
    <P>Some people got loans from building societies because there were no SDA loans available, although they qualified. In cities particularly&mdash;around County Dublin&mdash;there are a number of people who are barely able to meet their building society commitments.  I am very anxious to try to improve their situation.  So far I have not been able to do anything for them.  I should like something to be done for them in 1975 which would relieve this very heavy burden on a relatively small number. People borrowed from the corporation and having got the loan now have great difficulty in meeting repayments.</P>
    <P>I introduced the house purchase scheme, the first period of which finished on 31st December, 1974. Indeed, I was gratified by the number of people who availed of it.  Information received to date indicates that a sizeable number of people were anxious to become purchasers of their own houses.  The new scheme, which will be operative until 31st December, 1975, means that the houses because of the fail in money value will be somewhat dearer, but still very good value.  I am sure many people will be applying this year also.</P>
    <P>Local authorities continue to provide valuable assistance to intending house purchasers by means of their housing loan schemes.  Information received to <Col N="618" /> date indicates that loan payments in the period 1st April, 1974, to 31st December, 1974, amounted to £27.3 million, which is equivalent to £36.4 million in a full year.  This is an increase of over £14.6 million on the corresponding figure of £21.8 million in 1973-74.  The provision of loans and supplementary grants in 1975 is £41 million.  This compares with the provision of £12.2 million made by the Opposition when in Government in 1972-73.  Any one who says we are not stepping it up need only check the facts.</P>
    <P>Pressure has been put on me by people inside and outside this House to have two things done: the amount of loan which can be got under the SDA increased from £4,500, as it is now, to £5,000,£5,500 or £6,000 and the maximum of the qualification income, which is at present £2,350, increased to £3,500, £4,000 £4,500 or £5,000.  The facts are that very many people earning up to £46 a week are availing of the scheme as it stands.  I still feel that so far no case has been made which would require that we should increase either one or the other. As I said in the House, this is under constant review.  If things change, then we will have to change.  I would remaind those who appear to be saying that the gap between what they can get by way of loans and what the houses are costing is so wide that it is of no use to the large number of people availing of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Because of the firm stand taken by the Government, the price of houses is coming down.  Many builders are prepared to accept a reasonable price for their houses.  I make no apology for saying this.  In order to get a certificate of reasonable value, one builder was prepared to reduce the cost of each house by £1,500 and still admitted he was making a reasonable profit.  This makes the point that the certificate of reasonable value, which was introduced by my predecessor, is an excellent measure and works very well.</P>
    <P>I am personally satisfied that there are no excessive delays on the initial application for a certificate of reasonable value.  Seventeen days is the maximum delay which occurs on an <Col N="619" /> appeal and if the necessary information is not given it can be a good deal longer.  I believe that it is being very well handled and should be kept.  I have had requests that it be moved but I do not think that would be right.</P>
    <P>We hope to go a step further towards achieving our 8,000 local authority houses per year in 1975. The capital budget for 1975 provides £51 million for local authority housing, more than a 100 per cent increase on the capital provided in 1972-73, which was £25.38 million.  The local authority housing construction programme continued during 1974 at a high level of activity, with the whole programme comprising 77,875 dwellings or sites at the end of October, 1974, and there is a substantial rise&mdash; over 30 per cent&mdash;in the number of men employed on the programme during the year ended 31st October, 1974.  Granted they are people who might possibly have been employed on private building, but they are employed in the house building programme. There was a very high level of dwellings in progress throughout the year, work in progress having increased from 9,478 units at the end of December, 1973, to 12,286 by the 31st October, 1974.</P>
    <P>I believe we will definitely meet our target by 31st March of 7,250 local authority houses for that 12 months.  This is very important.  I always thought the ratio of local authority houses to private houses was far too low and I am satisfied now that the situation is improving. While I am not happy that it is as good as I would like it to be, nevertheless it is improving.  Some people have been saying that local authority houses built beside a posh scheme spoiled the appearance of the scheme. They will not spoil the appearance of the scheme now because the local authority houses being built are as good as any house being built and, therfore, can be integrated far more easily.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy was not here when I referred to the central heating of local authority houses.  I said I would <Col N="620" /> not blame him for the decision taken because at the time the idea of central heating of houses was attractive.  He could not estimate, and in his position I would not have been able to estimate, the savage increase in the cost of oil and electricity.  The decision was taken but because of what has happened I think it is only right that I have reversed it.  The situation now is that there will be a solid burning fireplace or appliance in each local authority house.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney referred to the necessity to give more local improvement scheme grants.  He was disappointed that we had not given some for the bog roads.  I am sure quite a number of the bog roads will be done. Quite a number of former bog roads are now public roads and are paid for by the county council.  But I agree with him that if turf is going to be used in a very big way there will be a very strong case for more money for repairing bog roads.  If we are to go back to the idea of using turf as fuel as against imported oil and so on, the proper thing to do is to try to make it as easy as possible to have it available.</P>
    <P>Energy conservation is urgent.  I moved early on in this, immediately after the oil crisis.  I am now considering an interim report I commissioned from An Foras Forbartha and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and which recommends improved thermal insulation of the fabric of buildings. Before making a decision on the recommendations I am awaiting the final submissions of interested parties on the report, which I have made available to the public.  In the meantime local authorities and the NBA have already adopted improved standards of insulation in the new houses being provided by them.  I was astonished to find that the evidence produced showed that in most new houses, until this step was taken, the heat loss was very great.  Because of the changes which are now taking place there should be a very substantial improvement in the amount of fuel used, even of oil or electricity.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the <Col N="621" /> National Building Agency for the very considerable success they have achieved in the development and execution of the special emergency housing programme launched by me in May, 1973, as a consequence of the Government's commitment to deal with the housing situation as one of emergency.  The agency tackled the programme with vigour and achieved the target of having work started on over 1,600 dwellings by the end of March, 1974.  I understand the agency is working hard to achieve its overall local authority housing output target of 2,500 houses in the 12 months ended 31st March next.  This agency is also performing a very valuable task in its original programme of housing for industry.  This programme, which was carried out largely on behalf of the IDA, is expanding rapidly.  The agency completed 204 houses during 1973-74 and they hope to complete 450 houses for industry in 1975.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to housing, I should like to refer to the financial contribution to housing, current and capital, made available by the Government. This came to approximately £50 million in 1972-73 and to £125 million in 1975, an increase of 150 per cent.  What more practical illustration could there be of the priority and consideration which the Government assign to housing?</P>

      <P>I referred briefly to sanitary services.  The capital provision for sanitary services in 1975 at £16.75 million represents an increase of over 100 per cent on the 1972-73 position. Since the 1st April, 1973, I have approved some £25 million worth of schemes for commencement.  Some of the works included in these programmes have already been constructed while works are in course of construction or soon will start on the others.  The main objective in the public water and sewerage programme is to provide sufficient services in the main built-up areas where development pressures are greatest and to ensure that the lack of serviced land <Col N="622" /> will not continue to inhibit related programmes for housing and for industry.  While much remains to be done I am glad to say that the schemes already in construction will, when completed, make a dramatic change in the position of a number of our main cities and towns.  I was surprised at the number of sizeable towns that had no sewage disposal system except flushing into a nearby river, or else a very inferior system.  In Dublin and Cork, for instance, water supply schemes at present in construction will ensure a supply to meet all foreseeable needs for many years to come. The position in Waterford, Limerick and Galway has also been improved by recently completed schemes and further schemes in these areas, which are at advanced planning stage, will bring them in line with Dublin and Cork.</P>
      <P>A similar picture is emerging in all the other built-up areas where they were suffering from inadequate services. The position has also improved in respect of sewerage and of course special schemes already provided for ease the pressure on land for development and schemes coming to final planning will improve the position further. The sewerage schemes include projects needed to secure final disposal arrangements for domestic effluents that do not give rise to pollution problems or seriously impair the amenity of the area.  The on-going public sewerage programme includes a number of works specifically designed to prevent or abate pollution.  I am glad to see the planning of the new Dublin treatment works has commenced. As a result of their increased capital allocations many county councils are increasing their involvement in group water supply schemes.  This has taken a considerable burden off many local groups in areas where adequate sources would not be available. Group scheme activities are increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as roads are concerned, last year I introduced by way of a block road grant a sum designed to devolve a significant element in the road programme to local decision.  I asked local authorities to ensure that in the <Col N="623" /> drawing up of their road works programme the maximum employment would be maintained.  I want to see to it that the amount of money made available will ensure the full employment of all road workers who are in constant employment.  I have asked local authorities if at all possible to employ extra labour.  I suggested that if a job which can be done in two or three months by using a lot of machinery can be done equally well, or even almost as well, in six months by employing more hand labour, they should employ more hand labour to do it.  For this reason I believe there will be extra work for people who will need it.  We all know there is unemployment even in rural areas at present. I would like to see those people usefully employed on the roads.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Meaney to people who are employed. People who are becoming unemployed at present&mdash;and I hate to see a man or woman who wants to work being left unemployed&mdash;at least know that because of the activities of this Government they are getting a benefit which at least for the first six months will ensure that there will be little difference between what they are getting while they are looking around for a job and what they would receive in employment.  While some people may look down their noses at that and say it is wrong that an unemployed worker should get as much money as he got while in employment, I say that if they were in a house where the breadwinner was unemployed through no fault of his own they might take a different view when they realised that the money required to feed the family had to be provided.  I hope we will see the day when there will be full employment but, until there is, those depending on social welfare will get, as they have been getting from this Government, fair treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate on the budget last year the one comment that remains in my mind was that it was a budget that would be better judged at the end of the year.  That might have appeared contradictory or illogical but I elaborated on the point <Col N="624" /> and said that the Minister's claims last year regarding the expansionary effect the budget was supposed to have on the economy and the magnificient results that would be obtained as a consequence of the changes the Minister claimed were for the benefit of the economy were pure speculation, unsupported by any factual information or by the prognosis of any of the economists who frequently attempt to forecast.</P>
      <P>This budget goes even further in that direction.  Last year's budget did not succeed in getting the necessary investment to expand the economy. The previous speaker spoke a lot of nonsense about all the money the Government were giving to social welfare and to housing.  One would think the Government had a pool of money and that they kept dishing out that money to people whenever they felt like it.  One does not have to be an economist to know there is no prospect of any improvement in the economy unless we get increased production which results from increased investment. There are many factors that are necessary to achieve this.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance approached this budget as though we were living in normal times.  He spoke about the magnificent increases in social welfare and the tax on the old reliables and he gave us to understand everything would be all right in future. This is not a normal year.  It is admitted by everyone except propagandists in the Government, or on the fringe of the Government, that we have reached a serious crisis in our economy, one that calls for emergency action not soft talk about the prosperity that is around the corner. The budget is a disastrous one.  In no way does it face up to the serious problems that confront the country and, while it is a &ldquo;hope and pray&rdquo; type of budget, we could end up by having a more serious situation at the end of the year.  The Minister recently threatened that there would be another budget and, goodness knows, we have had enough budgets in the last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major problem we are facing is that of inflation and all its consequences are becoming far too evident. <Col N="625" /> This year we have a balance of payments deficit, an all-time high unemployment problem, an inflation rate of 20 per cent and prices have been running amok without any effort being made to control them.  We should not pretend that the Government are taking any measures of control in this area.  The budget has done nothing with regard to the problems; it has not even taken them into consideration.</P>
    <P>Are the members of the Government in touch with the people throughout the country?  Recently a Minister said that the position with regard to agriculture was improving.  There are many factors that must be taken into account when one considers the state of agriculture in the country.  At the moment calves are being sold for pence.  There was a heading in a newspaper recently which stated that there could be little prospects of agriculture rallying to the state of prosperity that industry enjoyed in 1972.</P>
    <P>If agriculture were in a satisfactory state there would not be complaints about too many cattle in the country; rather we would be trying to increase the numbers and calves would be at a premium.  That is the real test of progress in agriculture.  At the moment farmers are under severe strain and many of them are facing object poverty.  This year they must decide whether to part with their stock for a small price or pay inflated prices for fodder.  There has been some talk about vouchers but they have turned out to be the greatest fiasco.  Nobody has attempted to explain in this House what has happened with regard to this matter.  I hope that before this debate ends the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will contribute an hour in this House to deal with the problems of agriculture so that he may in some way be able to allay the anxiety of people who have looked forward for the first time to agriculture as a progressive, worthwhile occupation.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out frequently, we got the green £ ten months after it should have been introduced and we have been paying subsidies for intervention. If all the fact cattle are bought <Col N="626" /> up there may be some chance for the stores which the west of Ireland depend on.  However, there is no hope that the farmers will be able to hold out until what has been talked about glibly by the Government as the better times ahead, arrive.  They have had their confidence rocked.  There are trends in everything which are not always controllable by the Government but at least if the Government show signs of doing things which are within their control and show their capability to deal with matters which it is possible for them to deal with then confidence will not be shattered.</P>
    <P>We talked about the budget as if this were normal times.  The chaos which exists in relation to prices at present does not seem to be appreciated by those on the other side of the House.  We are so convinced that prices will continue rising in the year ahead that we have made provision to come back in October for the first time to cushion the impact on the social welfare recipients of the vast increases they inevitably will experience between now and then.  The Minister has deliberately provided for the continuation of price increases that are becoming intolerable to those on fixed incomes and those on no incomes except what they try to earn from the small piece of land they occupy or some other occupation which is in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>We are told we have some valuable mineral wealth, both ashore and offshore. This is the time when a quick decision should be taken to get that mineral wealth operating.  Those minerals have been used as political propaganda with suave statements that the Government will ensure that the nation gets what it is entitled to, that it is its own wealth and will not be frittered away by foreigners.  The Government tell us they will see that there is a proper balance in what goes to the developer and what the nation gets out of it. We get this nonsense day in and day out. We want the mineral wealth developed and channelled into the bloodstream of the economy at a time when the people are becoming tired with regard to the way the economy is.</P>
    <P>We now have 100,000 unemployed. <Col N="627" /> When questions were asked today about unemployment we had sniggering from the other side of the House as if it was a huge joke.  When I was Minister for Labour I remember that the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Corish, used ask what the Government intended to do about the serious situation of 65,000 unemployed. We were taking serious action which every time proved effective. We were told that 8 per cent inflation was something the country could not stand and the only remedy for that was to get Fianna Fáil out of office before the country was ruined.  Fianna Fáil could not be got out quick enough until some able band of men came together to relieve the country from the disgusting situation brought about by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Now we have a 20 per cent inflation and we are told it is due to matters outside our control and nothing can be done about it.  With the oil crisis, inflation and the EEC we have no longer a native Government.  We are now floating on the tide of international economics.  We cannot even adjust the quotas on the importation of materials in the textile world.  We have boys and girls on the dole because of the EEC and we cannot take action against industrial expansion in some cases because it would conflict with some EEC regulation.  We cannot do anything about prices because they are entirely due to influences outside our control. The balance of payments, which has reached an alarming figure which would not be tolerated a number of years ago is due to the oil crisis.</P>
    <P>I remember the use that was made of the Suez Canal crisis during the term of the last Coalition Government. Every time a question was asked we were told the situation was due to a boat which was sunk in the Suez Canal and the long haul around the Cape had upset the economy.  It upset the plans of the Coalition Government at the time.  This time they have the EEC and the oil crisis to blame.  The people are not prepared to accept this now.  The quarterly report of the Central Bank, just issued, states categorically on page 6:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> There are two dangerous illusions which must be put aside.  One is that Irish inflation is so largely determined externally that nothing can, or need, be done about it.  The other is that the balance of payments will come right of its own accord.</P>
    <P>Most people are not talking just for the sake of supporting one Government or another.  They are facing up to facts as they see them facing the country. While we are blaming everything now on external factors outside our control one day we will have to get down to the basics and explain to the people, who will be demanding high increases in their incomes and wages in the near future, that the major factor contributing to inflation is domestic.  The workers and those in receipt of incomes generally are the people who can throw it out of gear. Despite the fact we have been telling them all along that inflation has nothing to do with domestic matters one of these days we will have to talk sense to them, explain to them that if we are to take really effective action to control that part of inflation which is domestic and due to internal factors, if we are to have a national partnership, they must understand that 50 per cent of the cause of inflation is due to matters which we can control.  We will have to get them to understand that they are very important factors and they can help in putting things right.  I do not think we can go on all the time getting away with this unrealistic and untrue talk with regard to what is seriously affecting the problems we are facing at present.  Inflation and price increases which go hand in hand with the subsequent and inevitable unemployment are the factors the country is facing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that moneys should be provided out of public funds towards the acquisition of Fota Island so that its amenities can be preserved for the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> This motion was introduced on the Order Paper several weeks ago, some time before Christmas, and it was before the date when tenders were to be submitted for the purchase of Fota Island, otherwise known as the Smith-Barry estate, and as it is for legal purposes.  The final date for receiving tenders has long since passed, but fortunately it is not yet too late to save this very valuable amenity for the public.  I understand that the trustees of the Smith-Barry estate, who were very well disposed to its being acquired for public purposes, are still open and willing to receive tenders or amended tenders.</P>
    <P>Apart from its high amenity value, Fota Island is of great historical interest as well.  The name Barry was associated with Fota for several centuries, probably even going back to Norman times when the first Barry was de Barry, and he fought many battles with the McCarthys, Princes of Munster.  There is on the island an old Barry Castle from which it might be assumed that many of these battles were started.  Therefore, the estate goes back to Norman times and the subsequent Earl of Barrymore was obviously descended from the original Norman Barry.  The Earl of Barrymore was created an earl in 1627, and the first earl gave Fota to his youngest son.  That was at the beginning of the eighteenth century, and it was the youngest son who, it is presumed, built Fota House and developed the estate, particularly the wonderful arboretum on the estate.</P>
    <P>We can assume that the original house, which has been extended since and now, I believe, is one of the best known regency-type houses in the country, dates back to the early 1700s, and I think the same can be said of the garden in which the arboretum is to be found.  My source for this is mainly the book published by the Georgian Society, edited by Desmond Guinness and William Ryan, entitled <i>Ireland's Houses and Castles,</i> and I want to quote an extract from the account of Fota in that book:</P>
    <P>The other great pride of Fota is the garden where, on account of the mild climate engendered by the <Col N="630" /> surrounding salt water, the most astonishing collection of semitropical trees and rare shrubs is able to flourish.  The specimens have grown to such exceptional height that dendrologists the world over are familiar with the botanical achievements of Fota.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need say any more about the need to preserve such a desirable amenity, such an historical piece of property as Fota, as well as it can be preserved, for the public.  The whole estate, I understand, runs to about 780 acres, of which about 400 acres would be suitable and, I understand, are available for agricultural land.  There is, in fact, a group of farmers in the area who are looking for that land, who need that land for better development of their own farming enterprises and who, I believe, could be accommodated by whoever would ultimately purchase the estate.</P>
    <P>A rather sad coincidence is that the last owner, the Honourable Dorothy Bell died only last week, having been predeceased by her husband by some two years or so.  Mrs. Bell and her husband were most generous and public-spirited in making the grounds of Fota available for many public purposes, including charity fetes, scouting activities and so on.  There are, however, some beneficial owners, some of them who are minors, and therefore the trustees of the Smith-Barry estate are naturally anxious, in fact are bound by their trust, to procure the best possible price for the young beneficial owners, the minors, in this case.  However, I know that the trustees and, indeed, the beneficial owners are more than anxious to continue the policy of Major Bell and his wife, the Honourable Mrs. Bell, in making the land available as much as possible for the public, and are desirous that the land should be acquired under public ownership and as a public amenity.</P>
    <P>The sale was to take place some months ago, and there was a terminal date for the submission of tenders.  The tenders were, in fact, submitted, but before that the Cork County Council and the Cork Corporation jointly made efforts to engage the State in the acquisition of Fota.  They felt at the <Col N="631" /> time they would not have the resources themselves, either separately or jointly, to purchase the estate.  The Minister for Finance received a joint deputation at which it was urged upon him that this property should be purchased by the State and preserved as a public amenity.  Unfortunately, the Minister did not see his way to contribute in any way to the purchase of the estate, and so the two local authorities, the Cork County Council and the Cork Corporation, made a joint bid for the property.  That bid was considered with, I understand, at least two, if not more, private bids from other sources.  I am not in a position to say what the bids were.  I have been given an indication of what the local authorities bid was, but there were at least two other bids which may or may not have exceeded the bid made by the local authorities; in fact it is likely that they did exceed it.</P>
    <P>However, as I said, the trustees of the beneficial owners are anxious that the property, if at all possible, should be acquired for public purposes.  As far as I know, they are still in contact with the local authorities to see whether a suitable arrangement can be arrived at.  I believe the difference between the offer made by the joint local authorities and the sum likely to be accepted by the trustees is not a big difference and I believe only a little more money would ensure that this most desirable property would be preserved for the public.</P>
    <P>The title is freehold and the property has been designated by Cork County Council as a high amenity area.  Quite recently the county council passed a resolution requesting the county manager to draw up an amenity order and a tree preservation order.  It is most unlikely&mdash;indeed, it is reasonably certain&mdash;that no matter who buys the property it will never be developed for industrial or commercial purposes.  That is poor consolation to the residents in the area and to people generally who would like to see this property preserved, not only as an amenity area but as an amenity area to which the public would have access.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> The Minister might now reconsider his attitude.  I am sure he has access to the details of the kind of money required to effect the purchase.  As I have indicated, as far as I know it would not be a great sum, but it would be a tremendous investment by the State.  Even though I have no mandate or brief from the local authority I go so far as to say that the property should be purchased on a three-way basis.  Obviously the corporation and the county council have worked out their joint liability in respect of the bid they have made and I believe it would be possible for them to come to an agreement with the Minister and the Government in their making the extra contribution that would secure the purchase of this valuable property and ensure its subsequent availability to the public.  If there were such a three-way contribution I suggest that, without any great burden on the State, there could be a three-way control, management and maintenance.  The house is an excellent example of Regency architecture and the region itself is known world wide.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I raised this matter I mentioned that there was a precedent for the Government to intervene in an undertaking such as this. I raised this when the Estimates were being passed <i>en bloc</i> on the last day of the sitting of the Dáil before the Christmas recess.  It was relevant to the Estimate of the Minister for Lands, who was in the House at the time, because he had put a stop order on the sale of the property pending investigation by the Land Commission as to whether it could be acquired for the relief of congestion.  The Minister for Lands did not give me a very clear indication then as to what his attitude was.  I did not get from him any disposition towards meeting the case put to him by the local authorities and by Deputies.</P>
    <P>I said there were precedents and I readily acknowledge now that they are not directly in point.  The most recent is the purchase by the State of St. Enda's Admittedly it had more immediate and direct historical associations with the evolution of the Irish State, as we now know it, but nevertheless <Col N="633" /> there was a danger at one time that that property might pass into private hands.  Deputy Haughey is in the House; he was Minister for Finance at the time and he received the approval of the Government to advancing the moneys necessary to purchase St. Enda's.  It is now being developed by the Office of Public Works, solely by the Office of Public Works and solely by the Exchequer, without any contribution from either Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council. That monetary obligation would not exist in this case.  Another precedent was the contribution made to the purchase initially of the site of the old burnt-out Cork Opera House.  It, too, was in danger of passing into private hands.  There was need to preserve it as an amenity and the State made a grant to meet the loan available, which matched to some extent voluntary contributions made.  When I say &ldquo;voluntary contributions&rdquo;, there were ordinary and debenture shares taken up by people anxious to see the Opera House preserved.  I cannot remember exactly whether it was a grant or a loan Cork Corporation made available.</P>
    <P>There are other precedents.  I do not want to introduce any acrimony into this debate and I say, somewhat diffidently, that if this property were available in its present form in the vicinity of Dublin the State would not neglect the opportunity of acquiring it for the public purposes.</P>

      <P>Because it is an estate far removed from Dublin it is believed by people in the area that the Government have less interest in it. That is the belief that is held.  It is one in which I find it difficult not to share.  I shall not put the case any further.  The trustees are still in contact with the local authorities.  Even though the final date for the receipt of tenders has passed they are continuing negotiations in the hope that a reasonable offer, which they can accept in their capacity as trustees, for the benefit of their principals will be made.  This will not go on forever <Col N="634" /> and there may be only a couple of weeks left in which the offer will be available.  I would therefore urge the Parliamentary Secretary to take action quickly, even on the basis I have suggested&mdash;a three-way divide of the purchase price with Cork County Council and Cork Corporation and, if necessary, a three-way divide of the cost of maintenance and care of this most valuable amenity to ensure it will be preserved in the spirit in which it was occupied by the Smith Barry family up to the time it was finally vacated, which was only last week, when the Honourable Mrs. Bell died.  She was a direct descendant of the Barrymores to whom I have referred.</P>

      <P>I have listened very attentively to Deputy Lynch putting his case for Fota Island.  Over the past few months the Minister for Finance and his officials and I and some of my officials have met various deputations from Cork.  The desire to have this area made an amenity area is a very laudable one.  Apart from Deputies, I believe that every association and organisation has also come and asked us to purchase Fota Island.  I have never been there myself but I have studied the brochure.  As Deputy Lynch said, there are 780 acres involved and the region is known all over the world.</P>
      <P>What Cork Deputies do not seem to realise is that help can be given only to certain designated areas.  There seems to be some misapprehension, some doubt, about the type of parks that can be helped by the Exchequer. We have only one park in Ireland which reaches the international standard for national parks, that is, the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park. Negotiations are almost finalised for the taking over of Glenveagh Park in County Donegal.  Then we will have two.  This is the crunch for the Cork representatives: Fota would not be a national park.  It could not be a national park.  It can be a local amenity.  The deputation stated that they wanted to preserve Fota for the people of the city and county of Cork. That is a very laudable desire but it is a bit selfish, in my opinion.</P>

      <P>Two now.  A national park is a relatively large area where one or several ecosystems are not materially altered by human exploitation and occupation, where plant and animal species, geomorphological sites and habitants are of special scientific, educative and recreative interest, or which contains a natural landscape of great beauty; secondly where the highest competent authority of the country has taken steps to prevent or eliminate as soon as possible exploitation or occupation in the whole area, and to enforce effectively the respect <Col N="636" /> of ecological, geomorphological or aesthetic features which have led to its establishment; thirdly where visitors are allowed to enter, under special conditions, for inspirational, educative, cultural and recreative purposes. Fota Island fulfils only one of those factors.</P>

      <P>This is where the difference lies between the taking over by the State of Fota Island and the giving to the State of the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park.  The arboretum of Fota Island has worldwide renown.  It is, of course, artificial. Remember this, and this is one more objection.  Plans to locate heavy industries in Cork Harbour put the future of the arboretum at risk.  These industries will probably give rise to a high level of pollution which may destroy the arboretum if international experience is any guideline.  This island, a beautiful place, is situated on the River Lee but there is an expectation that some heavy industry will be established on the opposite side at Marina Point.  If that happens, Fota is gone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>St. Enda's is different because it has an historical background, and so has Derrynane.  As <Col N="638" /> against that, when Merrion Square Park was taken over, it was taken over by Dublin Corporation.  When the beaches at Brittas were taken over, they were taken over jointly by the local authorities and they paid for this amenity themselves.  Phoenix Park has been there for a very long time.  St. Enda's is a unique historical park and that is why the Government stepped in to take it over.  I do not think a comparable case can be made by citing the Abbey, the Cork Opera House and places like that.  I know that it was with reluctance and regret that the Department of Finance had to reject the application of the joint committee for some financial help. We can give all the necessary help and advice both from the Department of Lands, from the Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance.  The only thing lacking is finance.</P>

If the joint authorities purchase the island they will probably have to leave it as an entity.  If you take away 400 from 980 acres it leaves very little as an amenity park for Cork city which is developing every week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The objections of the Office of Public Works are contained in a letter which I have here which says:</P>
      <P>When a deputation representing local interests met the Minister for Finance and his Parliamentary Secretary on 5th June, 1974, great emphasis was laid on the pressing need for increased recreation facilities for the people of Cork City and County and it was argued that Fota Island offered an outstanding opportunity of providing a wide range of such facilities.  The Committee's report does not indicate what range of activities the local authorities should provide or what areas should be allocated for this purpose.  The committee recommends that those portions of the island suitable for agricultural use comprising of 300/ 400 acres should be disposed of to local farmers.  This would materially alter the landscape and attraction of the area and would appear to leave little land available for general park uses such as playing fields, golf course, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee also recommends that Fota House and Gardens, including the Arboretum, should be presented to the State for public benefit and enjoyment and cities the cases of Muckross and Kilkenny in support of a State role in their management.  We would not regard Fota as being in any way comparable with Muckross which is a national <Col N="640" /> park of outstanding quality or with Kilkenny Castle which was taken into State care because of its special historic significance....  The Arboretum attached to Fota in its present state is recognised as being of exceptional merit with a very fine collection of exotic trees but before taking such a property into its custody the State would have to be reasonably confident that it was in a position to guarantee its preservation. In this connection it must be stated that the Island without its Arboretum and other tree plantations would have little topographical interests.  The Cork County Council, as the planning authority for the area, would be in a better position than a state organisation to help preserve the valuable tree collection in question.  In view, however, of the trend towards the development of the River Lee estuary as a major industrial area, including industries which posed serious threats to the natural environment, we do not think that the preservation of the Fota Arboretum up to its present standard will prove to be a feasible proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is a clinical appraisal by a civil servant&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is but these are the facts.  If the State bought Fota and after a few years the arboretum was destroyed what would be the outcome? Anybody who buys Fota is taking a chance because in the next 20 or 30 years, with the development of Cork, you are bound to have some heavy industries that will pollute the atmosphere and it would only take one day or a human error to wipe out the arboretum.</P>

      <P>Surely the Deputies can see how accidents happen and should learn from experience.  Nobody ever gave a greater guarantee that there would not be any oil spillages here and there but they are still occurring. We only know about some of them.  The rest could be minor spillages but they occur.  No matter what guarantee is given human error, or something like that, could result in the wiping out of one of the best and most beautiful areas on the River Lee.  It is with regret, and reluctance, that I must reiterate what the Minister for Finance said, that he does not want to be involved in the purchase of the island.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary has been put in the position he now finds himself. I was on the deputations he has referred to and I felt that if the Parliamentary Secretary was Minister for Finance we would not be in this predicament and we would not have this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that I am treating him more fairly than he deserves but that is the way I felt after going on the deputations.  I feel that the Parliamentary Secretary's heart is not in this case because he is a better exponent of a good cause than he has shown himself to be tonight. To my mind it proves the point that where there is a will there is a way.  Some members of the deputation spoke from a local point of view, but once it was stated by the Minister, or his advisers, that it was purely a local amenity and not a national one it was stressed by several members of the deputation, myself included, that it was a national amenity.  It may not fulfil the requirements of a national park but it is a national amenity.</P>
      <P>The history of the Government, and the Department of Finance, in this matter is not a creditable one.  If a decision had been made at the beginning to the effect that they would not give us any assistance, financial or otherwise, at least we could have then launched a campaign to save Fota. When the first deputation was received they were told that the Department would not help unless there was an agreed plan.  We were told that if we came up with an agreed plan the Department would then see what assistance could be given.  At that stage, and for two years, An Taisce and similar bodies publicised the value of this holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never anticipated that the Government would not help in a big way whoever would be engaged in the purchase of Fota.  When we went on the second deputation we put forward the suggestion that Cork Corporation and the county council would put up two-thirds if the State put up one-third of the cost but this was turned down. We then suggested that the corporation and the county council should buy Fota and that the State should maintain the arboretum and the house but this was turned down without question.  When we suggested that the corporation and the county council buy Fota with money loaned by the Government this was also turned down.  We were told that Fota <Col N="645" /> could be bought if it was money raised but that it was not to be taken from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>Nobody knew better than the Minister for Finance how hard it is to raise money within the country and I wonder, for that reason, where he thought the two bodies referred to would go to obtain any to purchase Fota.  The bodies concerned, however, bid for Fota in the hope that the State would help in the maintenance of the island thereafter.  The Parliamentary Secretary posed the hypothetical question, what would happen to the arboretum, and the property, in years to come in the event of pollution. If that defeatist attitude is taken about everything why are we trying to preserve worthwhile places?  Why are we doing this if the first thing we say is that something might happen? We could have a nuclear war tomorrow and we would all be wiped out.</P>
    <P>I accept that pollution is a danger but we have the Anti-Pollution Bill to guard against such eventualities. We have what are described as the best minds in the State agitating about how to avoid pollution but yet the Parliamentary Secretary tells us that the arboretum might be wiped out within two years because of pollution from heavy industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not denying that there is a case in what the Parliamentary Secretary has said but there is a case for any supposition anybody wants to make.  The case I should like to make is completely different.  For many years people in high places have been deploring vandalism, the delinquency of youth and all the evils of the age, glib talk with tongue in cheek, but when it comes to rectifying matters nobody is willing to take a little liberty with the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fota contains more than 700 acres and has an arboretum which is educational and which will come under all kinds of scrutiny by educationalists. There is nothing better in Europe, we are told on the best authority, and <Col N="646" /> that is worth considering.  Fota consists of acres of woodland and landscape gardens.  There are acres of ground suitable for outdoor recreation or walks; 300 acres or more suitable for division among local farmers, who have been agitating for it for years and who are quite willing to pay for what they might receive.  Even taking all of that into account, the State does not seem to be able to see its way to say: &ldquo;Look, we will loan you the money and you can pay it back at whatever rate is decided by the Minister for Finance.&rdquo; It is obvious that there is no will so to do.</P>
    <P>I respect what the Parliamentary Secretary said and what was written in the various documents from which he read.  But those are merely guidelines. Rules should never be allowed to hinder, particularly when it is for the benefit of the people.  I would remind Deputies that Cork, as the second city of the State and the largest county, is entitled to its amenities.  Nobody living in Cork would believe that it would be enjoyed only by the locals, because in Cork we have attractions that bring people from all over Europe annually.  This would be just such another attraction, an attraction which would be well maintained.</P>
    <P>Were the Parliamentary Secretary or the Government worried about atmospheric pollution of the arboretum or anything else, they would step in and take complete control, appointing the county council, the corporation, or both to act with them as guardians of the property so as to ensure that it is preserved for the benefit of everybody. They should not be trying to find a excuse for not paying a paltry £250,000.  I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary is not Minister for Finance because, if he were, I have not the slightest doubt but that he would meet this case.  There must be Cork and Munster people in the Government benches who can testify to the fact that what I say is true.  I do not want to make any political capital out of this.  If the case were being made about somewhere in Galway, Donegal or Mayo, I hope I would be just as anxious as I am about this one, because I feel such cases should not be treated <Col N="647" /> by rules taken from a guidebook but rather on their merits.</P>
    <P>I cannot overemphasise the fact that if this opportunity is not availed of we will never have such a chance again.  If this opportunity is missed this Government and the Minister for Finance will be blamed by the people, not alone of Cork city and county, not alone of Munster, but by the people of Ireland and indeed of Europe for having allowed this chance go by of acquiring this island as State property.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that moneys should be provided out of public funds towards the acquisition of Fota Island so that its amenities can be preserved for the public.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear and needs no definition. The motion does not state the amount of money to be involved in the acquisition of Fota Island so that its amenities can be preserved for the nation, not merely for the people of the locality, the townland, the parish, the city or the county.  This Smith Barry estate of 780 acres coming on the market affords the State a unique opportunity for its acquisition.  It is in a beautiful setting; it is very good agricultural land; we all know of the arboretum, the exotic and rare plants and shrubs to be found there.  There is also a large deposit of gravel and sand on the island.</P>
      <P>This motion simply asks the State to give some funds towards the acquisition of Fota island.  We did not even ask, as we should have, that the State purchase it <i>in toto</i>, to safeguard and run it, after disposing of some of it to local farmers.  The joint committee of the Corporation and county council did not at any time in their deliberations, of which I am aware, mention that it should be confined to the people of Cork city and county.  I was not a member of the deputation and I am not discussing what was said then.</P>

    <P>This motion has been put down here to ask the State to intervene. We on the joint committee of Cork Corporation and county council feel it completely wrong that any of this money should be levied on the rates of the county.  Why should those ratepayers have to provide the finance with which to purchase that property when we hope and expect that the gates would be open to mankind?  As the previous speaker said, we talk about youth, juvenile delinqency; we <Col N="650" /> talk about people living together in built-up areas.  Cork city is spreading very fast.  Within a very short time it will be merely a few minutes by bus, train or car&mdash;there is a rail stop there&mdash;to that island, where people can walk around, enjoy the scenery, the shrubs, and view the large house, which could be converted into anything&mdash;a museum or anything else.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is accepted that if the estate is acquired by the State some of the land will be allotted to local farmers.  In this regard there is a long history that I shall not go into here except to say that these farmers have special rights to some of that land.  They have made their case in a reasonable way.  They are living on what can be termed as uneconomic holdings.  What they have asked for should be accepted as being very reasonable.  They are prepared to pay for the land but the Land Commission should act on their behalf. If this estate were in the west of Ireland or any place other than where it is I am convinced that the Parliamentary Secretary would be the first man to approach the Land Commission in regard to having it acquired.  We are asking the State to acquire this estate of between 400 and 450 acres but if I have ever heard a silly argument it is the one put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary regarding pollution from the hypothetical heavy industry across the harbour. Cork County Council, the planning authority responsible, have not given permission for any such industry. The Parliamentary Secretary was talking of something that might happen in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Any planning application for industry in the area would have to come before Cork County Council and surely they and the corporation who have fought so hard so that the State might acquire this estate will not allow the establishment of a heavy industry so near to the island that with a change of wind all vegetation on the island would be killed.  This excuse is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are thousands of people living within a few miles radius of this estate.  For these as for the rest of us the day is gone when for a few pounds they could fill the tanks of their cars and drive out into the country.  This estate can be reached easily by train so that for, perhaps, 10p the people living nearby could avail of the rail service to and from the island.  Are we not supposed to be trying to preserve <Col N="652" /> our natural amenities?  Fota Island has been designated by Cork County Council as a special area for preservation.  Indeed, we are making moves to preserve it further as an amenity area.  We understand from the county manager that our tender is only third in line but that the trustees who are disposed favourably to the State acquiring the island have kept the sale open but what happens when they read the papers tomorrow morning? They will see that the last effort has failed, that the State is not interested. It may happen that some speculator whose name is not on the list will acquire the island and do with it as he wishes. For instance, how could he be prevented from pulling down the rare trees on the estate or from ploughing up the walks which, incidentally, are in good condition?  The responsibility for what may happen to this estate must rest with the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's statement regarding the possibility of pollution as a result of any future industrial development is bad in so far as the area is concerned in that people will be frightened at the thought of any such situation occurring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to that of the previous speakers and to support this motion.  The Parliamentary Secretary usually puts forward his arguments very strongly and has his brief well prepared but, unfortunately, this evening has been an exception.  The reason for this is that he is not convinced of the argument contained in his brief.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that the case being put forward from this side of the House is unanswerable and that the argument that Fota would be an amenity area for Cork alone is unsustainable. Otherwise, the same thing might be said of Garnish which is visited each year by about 70,000 people of which, I would venture to say 75 per cent are not Cork people. The proof can be ascertained from <Col N="654" /> other amenities in the area. Of course, the real argument and the real reason the Government are not allocating money to an amenity in Cork is because 11 Members are Dublin based and Dublin living.  They do not give a damn about the rest of the country. The rest of the country does not exist outside Dublin in their minds and eyes.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary put forward arguments about the danger of killing the amenities about which we are talking.  There may be some validity in those arguments.  If all the industrialisation he predicts takes place in a haphazard and unplanned way then fall-out will destroy vegetation. If he believes this will happen, he should bring in much stronger legislation to protect the country from this severe pollution.  By making that statement he is admitting that the existing legislation is not strong enough to cover that eventuality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is saying that, although they are the planning authority, they will not be doing their job.  Of course, they will; they will ensure that such an event does not occur.  The arguments put forward in relation to the local amenities and the danger of pollution cannot be sustained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming the Government have no money for Fota, I suggest that they might agree if the local authorities could borrow or get the money by some other means to repay the money borrowed to the local authorities when they have it.  The people and the local <Col N="655" /> authority of Cork feel so strongly about Fota that they are prepared to explore any avenue to preserve this amenity.</P>
    <P>A lot of pious platitudes are preached by Government Ministers about the lounge bar society, the number of alcoholics here, the number of juvenile delinquents and so on. If we are serious in our concern, we should try to provide counter attractions. We should try to re-educate these people to the true value of life. The provision of an amenity such as Fota is, in my opinion, a true value.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed at the attitude of the Government because I know that Members of the Government party feel exactly as we do. Unfortunately, because they are in Government, they are not in a position to forcibly put forward their arguments. All the people, not alone in Cork but everyone concerned about the future, is behind the purchase of Fota.  As Deputy Meaney said, people will judge us harshly in years to come if we do not avail of this opportunity which may never come again.  Shakespeare said there was a tide in the affairs of men and this is the tide as far as we are concerned.  If we do not take it at the flood we could find ourselves in very muddy waters.</P>
    <P>I will counter the argument that this is just an amenity for the people of Cork.  CIE are operating cheap rail fares throughout the country. For a very small sum there could be rail excursions from any area to view Fota Island.</P>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to very seriously reconsider his decision and put forward more cogent arguments.  The arguments he has already put forward&mdash;and I know they are not his own because he read them from his brief&mdash;have no validity.  Will he ask his Minister to reconsider the case and try to work out some formula by which Fota does not pass away from the people?</P>

      <P>I was amazed at the Parliamentary Secretary's definition of a national park.  Over 100 years ago the idea of a national park was first formulated by people exploring <Col N="656" /> the wilds of the American West. It took the American Congress years to establish their first national park at Yellowstone.</P>
      <P>We have many parks which would not qualify for the United Nations listings.  Some of our national parks are the responsibility of the Office of Public Works, some forest parks are the responsibility of the Department of Lands and local public parks are the responsibility of local authorities.</P>

      <P>Botanists and others intersted in nature often plan their holidays and visit various national parks.  People from abroad wishing to visit national parks in America or, even, East Africa, could include our national park on their itinerary. I understand many people spend their holidays visiting different parks to see and study the flora and fauna and get some idea of the heritage and culture of the country they are visiting.  It worries me that the Parliamentary Secretary would suggest that our <Col N="657" /> other parks, just because they are not listed by the United Nations, are not national parks at all.  Of course, they are national parks.</P>

I know people from the centre of the Continent who will come here within the next month or two to see the birth of the new deer up there.  The planting and laying out of the People's Gardens is of interest and people come from overseas to inspect this park and to walk around, even where the grounds are laid out for sport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point. It is there as an amenity for the people of the world.  They will not and they cannot be charged for getting into it under our own rules in relation to national parks.  There could be a great circuit there for car racing and so on but the people who organise those things cannot charge for admission under our rules.  To think of the Phoenix Park as an amenity for the people of Dublin only is absolutely crazy.  I know it will not qualify for inclusion in the United Nations index but it is a fine park and a park of which we can be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, there is the small national park like St. Enda's. When the question of St. Enda's came up there was not the slighest opposition from any Member of this House to the purchase.  That was bought as a result of the political will of the then Minister for Finance and the support of all Members of this House.  Part of it is being developed as a sporting amenity area and the flora is being protected, preserved and restored as far as possible.  The then Minister for Finance listened to a <Col N="658" /> proposition put to him and decided to act on it.  The same applies to Derrynane. The political will was there, the decision was made and the house was bought as a museum and the gardens and surrounding area developed as a park.  That park, indeed, includes a caravan park.  The same can be said of Kilkenny Castle.  The State did not just buy Kilkenny Castle. It bought a park as well.  It is small park but quite a fine one.  I think already a nature trail is being provided there. That cannot be said to be just for the people of Kilkenny.  One might as well say the Beer Festival is just a local fair.  It is an international function with singers and dancers from all over the world. The Kilkenny national park is a great amenity.</P>
    <P>I believe that when such an obvious amenity as Fota Island becomes available if it is outside the power of the local authority to pay the State has an obligation to assist if not to take it over completely.  If reports of the State's attitude in this case get abroad the nation will be held up to ridicule.  Some time ago we had a similar case, that of the Doneraile estate.  The Department of Lands were interested in it for planting and for land division.  The Government of the day had to adjudicate on the question of which Department was most suitable to take charge of the estate.  The then Minister for Lands and myself, as Parliamentary Secretary, went down with our chief advisers and inspected the estate.  The idea was put forward that, perhaps, part of it might be a national park and the other part handed over to the Department of Lands but the advice from both Departments was that we should not divide the estate.  An agreement was eventually reached, and I hope it is being honoured, that the Department of Lands would take it over, that the walks and gardens, the flora and unusual plants, would be preserved by them as an amenity and that part of the estate would be used for planting and another part for division.  The important thing to me was that the unusual trees and plants and the layout of the main lawn should be preserved. Once I got agreement on that I had no objection to the Department <Col N="659" /> of Lands taking responsibility because I have seen some of the very fine work they have done on their forest parks and I know they will do a good job on this one.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that if the Office of Public Works, for financial or other reasons, are precluded from taking over Fota the example of the Doneraile estate should be followed and they should work out between themselves and the Minister for Lands some reasonable solution so that at least the house, gardens and arboretum will be preserved. That is a very reasonable suggestion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney said that if it takes an Act of the Oireachtas, and I am not sure it does, all that is needed is the political will of the Minister.  Right down the history of this State when a matter of this kind came before the House no Minister has ever been opposed by any section in this House from taking over and preserving amenities of this kind.  When the initiative came from the Government it was never opposed.  This time we are asking the Government to take the initiative and it must be quite clear to them that it will not be opposed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton referred to the Phoenix Park and the distance of Fota from Cork.  The Phoenix Park was once on the outskirts of Dublin but now it is almost in the centre of the greater Dublin area.  There was great pollution in the UK and they brought in a Clean Air Act which has met with great success.  Japan has now realised that their fauna is being destroyed by pollution with their vast industrial expansion and they are rapidly removing this severe pollution.</P>
    <P>There is technological information available to us now that will eliminate practically all danger so far as pollution is concerned.  What the Parliamentary Secretary apparently did not consider is that, when one looks at the central Rhineland area, the central industrial belt in Europe, one can see the pollution there and have cause for concern even though there are nice parks, trees and flora in that area. <Col N="660" /> At the end of the war, when Europe was devastated, any local authorities or planning authorities that existed were not concerned with that aspect. They were concerned only with getting the countries back to life again, getting people to work, bringing in money and food and helping them to survive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress I was endeavouring to emphasise the factors that show this is not a normal year where we could expect a normal budget.  I referred to the unprecedented increase in unemployment, to the dangerous and rapidly rising deficit in the balance of payments and to the 20 per cent increase in prices during the year.  All these matters should be considered by any Minister who wished to tackle them in a serious way by any monetary or fiscal adjustment that might be necessary in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may deviate for a moment, I would mention a reference made here by the Minister recently to a speech of mine and this will show how catty and naïve the Minister has been.  Prior to the budget when the House was discussing the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce. I pointed out that the Minister had the duty to bring in corrective measures to ease the pressure on prices by monetary or fiscal measures in order that jobs might be saved.  The Minister said that I had proposed new taxation measures but he knew perfectly well that fiscal or monetary measures can be downwards as well as upwards and, in this case, that they would have to be so.  I was referring, of course, to the possibility of reducing VAT in many cases to ease the pressure on prices and to adjust significantly the <Col N="661" /> tax-free allowance to workers that would put money in their pockets without calling on their employers to do so out of non-existent profits.  The Minister pretended not to see what I meant and said I was advocating further taxation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the balance of payments deficit, the unemployment figure, the unprecedented increase in prices and the serious inflationary problems&mdash;in themselves these factors are alarming and they call for emergency measures&mdash;there is a problem in agriculture and it has been approached in a shabby manner.  There has been a lack of policy in dealing with education.  It is being treated in a haphazard and clumsy way.  No action has been taken with regard to mining.  It has been used as a political sop, with the Minister saying that he will ensure the State gets its due share but, at the same time, he is not taking positive action to get mining going.</P>
    <P>In addition, the position with regard to prices is chaotic.  The National Prices Commission are capable of doing more and they should be asked to examine why prices are increasing and, where action can be taken, to prevent price increases.  Perhaps equipment could be provided to help certain firms to attain cheaper, better and increased production as well as lower unit costs.  They may not have the capital to invest in the necessary equipment and this is where the Minister could come to the rescue of those employed in industry and in the services sector of industry in which there is a considerable amount of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Industrialists cannot be expected to invest money in expansion or in maintaining the existing level of output when they have not the money.  They are faced with rising costs with which they will probably be unable to grapple and these will erode their competitiveness and they will be unable to maintain their level of output.  While this is happening they will be faced with demands in the immediate future that they will be unable to meet.  The Minister made a few million pounds available with regard to deferring income tax but it will be a mere drop <Col N="662" /> in the ocean.  Now the employer and the employee&mdash;but to a greater extent this applies to the employer&mdash; will be mulcted with paying completely for the weekly social welfare contribution. The Minister refused to disclose the figure but it could amount to more than £5 per week.  The State is withdrawing from the contribution it made in the past to the national insurance fund.  Formerly the employer paid one-third, the employee paid one-third and the State made up the difference but now the State is withdrawing from any contribution to the fund.  This means industry will be mulcted with the extra payment in respect of each employee at a time when the employer can least afford to pay it.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out recently by a leading industrialist that if an industrialist invests £100 at the moment and if he makes a 40 per cent profit, the State will take 20 per cent in tax and inflation will take another 20 per cent.  Therefore, he is left with nothing.  That position has obtained in the last year and it will be intensified in the coming year.  The profits of the industrialist to generate expansion are non-existent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government spoke a short while ago and, while he dealt mainly with housing, he referred to the great amount of money made available for industrial development. Of course, he was referring to moneys placed at the disposal of the IDA, as well as other moneys.  Money is given to the IDA for the promotion of new industries and for the payment of grants where suitable industries are prepared to set up.  This does not assist existing industries who are in serious trouble at the moment and, in many cases, are going into liquidation. When we consider the Book of Estimates and the amount of money placed at the disposal of the IDA to provide for industrial expansion, we must remember that is only to pay for the incentives provided to industrialists coming into the country or for major extensions to existing industries where they can show they will have new products or meet the requirements of a new market.  This will not happen in relation to existing industries. <Col N="663" /> I think I am correct in saying that the IDA seldom spend the amount made available to them.  A good deal of this could be diverted to existing industries, to help meet their problems, particularly in relation to liquidity if the commercial banks cannot be induced to relax the purse strings and be a little more generous in extending credit facilities to industry at present.</P>
    <P>The banks are calling in old loans and drastically curtailing credit, which was formerly available to industries. The banks are not performing a useful function for the community if they do not stand up to the requirements of industry in the present difficult times. If the Government cannot ensure that is done they should divert to Fóir Teoranta some of the vast amount of money which has always been available to the IDA to enable them perform a fire brigade exercise in saving firms which may be going into liquidation as a result of the serious problems they are facing.</P>
    <P>These are some of the things which should be done by the Government but which have not even been forecast in the budget.  The NPC should be given further duties in relation to things which could be done for the consumer and not merely harass people for charging increased prices. The reason for such price increases could in many cases be due to Government action or inaction.  The NPC have a rather unenviable task at the moment.  When the price increase that was sought is taken into account and the amount granted is subtracted from it we are often told this is what the public were saved.  We should all realise that when industry ask for increased prices for their products they ask for twice as much as they expect to get and they very often finish up getting more than they expected.  I do not agree with the suggestions flown as kites from the front bench that we should completely relax price control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government dealt almost entirely with housing.  The thing which amazed me about his speech was that he stuck tenaciously to the old attitude that everything in relation to housing is all right.  Does he expect anybody in Ireland to believe it is?  I do not need to go to the Central Statistics Office to ask them what is happening with regard to housing.  I have only to go to some of the well-known builders' providers, to the people who produce cement, to the people who sell everything that goes into a house and ask them how their wholesale and retail sales are.  They are laying off people and they do not know what to do with the stocks they have on hands. The Minister told us today that house prices were coming down.  I can see people having to sell houses below their value or face bankruptcy because they are simply not selling them.  The output of cement has been drastically reduced. In Donegal, because of its proximity to the Border we can buy concrete blocks cheaper in Northern Ireland than we can have them produced here.  Many of those are made from cement which is imported from this part of the country.  Sin ceist eile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister can say that building is doing well when almost every builder has laid off men. <Col N="665" /> when there is redundancy, when the builders' providers have been asked by their banks to pay off loan repayments, which they are unable to meet.  Housing in an expanding economy should move rapidly towards private building with the necessary incentive from the Government.  The white collar workers mainly do not qualify for local authority houses and are not in a position to build their own houses without some assistance.  They are the people who generate activity in the building industry but their incomes do not permit them to buy houses at present.  As the year goes on more and more of them will be unable to buy houses.  Nothing whatever is being done for them.</P>
    <P>In an expanding economy if people find themselves in a remunerative position they will be able to build their own houses with the help of State assistance.  That is real housing progress.  At the moment we have more and more people in the dole queue qualifying for local authority houses.  The local authorities are being forced to build more and more houses at the expense of the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>These are some of the problems which show us that this is not a normal year and not one in which normal procedures should be adopted to deal with budgetary matters. It is being discussed from the other side of the House as if this were a normal year. We are left with the huge problem of inflation, unemployment and rising prices without the Government doing anything to improve the situation.  We are getting tired of the allegation that inflation is entirely due to external matters.  Earlier on I quoted from the recent Central Bank report in which they quite definitely point out that somebody has to face this problem fairly and squarely, that the biggest factor in the present inflationary spiral is in relation to domestic matters which are within our control and should be tackled.  The sooner we face up to that the better.</P>
    <P>A great deal of cynical comment was directed towards us about the various programmes for economic expansion.  They were very useful, but we have no such programmes now nor, from what we have heard, are <Col N="666" /> we likely to have one.  It might not always have been possible to hit the targets that were set in these programmes or to attain the rate of expansion that was projected, but whether it was or not they were always very good guidelines for the various sections of Government and for the State-sponsored bodies as well as the private sector.  I would ask the Government, for the sake of the safety of the economy, to forget about the 14 points which they are ashamed to hear about now because they know they were used only as election gimmicks. They have codded the people and eroded confidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask them to start anew and express a <i>mea culpa</i> and to say that they will now try to produce something that is attainable. Let them draw up a programme and let us see the direction in which they hope to move.  I know it is a waste of time talking in this respect because the two diametrically opposed ideologies in the Government of socialism and conservatism could not possibly conspire to bring out such a programme.</P>
      <P>This is something the country needs more than anything else at this time when we are being buffeted on the sea of international turmoil and being told by the Government that nothing can be done about it.  It is tantamount to a situation in which we have no Government and no autonomy.  We are left at the mercy of the EEC and the Arabs with their oil and of inflationary trends in other countries, and all we can do here, as the Minister said recently, is merely batten down the hatches, lie low until the blizzard passes and pray that it will not sweep us away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the type of programme we are working on at present.  I would like to see some sort of programme whereby the Government would state the direction in which they would like to go, the way in which investment should be channelled so that a particular policy could be pursued in relation to every Department and every <Col N="667" /> sector of the economy.  We would then see what would be the policy in regard to public transport and in regard to the taxation system, we would see the policy on State-sponsored bodies, and whether they were to be allowed to let their prices inflate in order to try to recoup their losses or whether the losses would be met by subsidy.  We would know the policy in relation to the Army and the police force and, particularly, in relation to agriculture. We would know where we were going in education and social welfare.  We would know when it was intended to have people brought into the national insurance scheme so that there would be contributory benefits without a means test instead of, as at present, assistance on one side and national insurance on the other.</P>
    <P>These are only a few of the many things that would be outlined in a Government programme for economic expansion and development.  The Government have a duty to utilise the expertise available to them in the persons of excellent civil servants who have the ability and also the facts at their fingertips to formulate the Government's desires.  Let them put them on paper and let the community see the Government's thinking on these matters.</P>
    <P>Never was it more necessary than at present to inculcate into the minds of the people a feeling of security and confidence that things will not turn out the way they have on a number of occasions in the past.  This relates particularly to mining and exploration policy.  The Government must see that these things are not merely done but done with an urgency that would indicate that in the emergency in which the country finds itself there are men who are prepared to tackle the problems and to focus all the resources of the State in rescuing the economy at a time when we could very easily go under.</P>
    <P>The lack of such a programme is one of the causes of so much frustration in the country.  We expected that the Minister would bring in measures to create employment, but there were the old reliables that we have called <Col N="668" /> on in the past.  While we have an urban-minded Government, they should have some idea of rural requirements, and know that we have such things as bog roads, which may not be very artistic for the academic to pay attention to but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>These bogs roads are as important to the people of the west and other parts of rural Ireland as are the pipelines of Arabia and the Persian Gulf to the transport of oil.  Only one out of 20 bog roads &mdash;and this information can be elicited from the Minister&mdash;is approved for the LIS grant for which the Minister gave £500,000 in the budget.  The LIS, for the benefit of the Parliamentary Secretary and others who would not be expected to know anything about rural life, is the local improvements scheme, a scheme to which interested parties contribute a percentage of money.  There are hundreds of people who are so anxious to have these roads put in order that they are prepared to contribute to their repair. People who cannot afford to continue with oil or coal are going to the bogs to produce turf for their fuel, if a bog is within reach, but it is almost impossible to take the turf out of the bog because of the conditions of the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government seemed to be aware, when he was speaking a while ago, that they had slipped up, because he said this would be looked after.  He would know this is a major problem, though it may not seem so, and one that affects every western county.  A few million pounds spent on the making of these roads would create employment and take a number of people out of the dole queue while, at the same time, providing the necessary access to the fuel <Col N="669" /> supplies that exist and the harvesting of those fuel supplies would have the effect of reducing the nation's bill for imported fuel.  But nothing has been done about this.  The same is true of other things and the answer as to why nothing is done is not easy to find.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that this budget is a hope and pray budget.  We have a huge deficit.  We are going to borrow. We may get the money or we may not.  If we get it we will get it at the lender's rate of interest and we will be paying for it for many years to come.  When I was in Government we were advised by those competent to advise to ease off on foreign borrowing. One does not have far to search to find the wisdom and the logic in that advice.  But we have continued borrowing at higher and higher rates of interest.  We intend to borrow more and long after the present inflationary trend has been brought under control the country will still be paying a huge amount in servicing a debt it really cannot afford and servicing that debt will keep us under for many years before we are once more back on our feet, if we do not succumb in the meantime to the present ineptitude demonstrated by this Government in their handling of the whole sorry mess.  We are hoping to borrow and we are hoping to get.  We are praying we will get.  As I said, a hope and pray budget.  We may not get the money.  We are looking for petro-dollars.  We will get them at the lender's price.  It is a sad state of affairs.</P>
    <P>This is a dangerous budget and it is most dangerous of all for those who cannot cushion themselves against the impact of rising prices.  Social welfare recipients are told they will get more in October next because prices will go up in the meantime.  What about those who will get nothing, who cannot expect to get anything?  We are rapidly reaching the stage at which all the good done in the past will be siphoned away.  We often have to listen to accusations that Fianna Fail did little in their 16 years in Government.  Thank God, the most important economic <Col N="670" /> indicators, socially and nationally, were there to show that we were in Government during those happy days in which we saw a rising population, an increase in the number of marriages and a dramatic decline in emigration.  These are three major factors.  They are particularly important in our community which suffered from 1847 from a deterioration in all three.  We lived to see that deterioration converted into progress on all three fronts.  We are now facing the danger&mdash;I say this in all sincerity and no one so far on the other side has said anything which would lead me to believe otherwise&mdash; of putting the country in jeopardy in the interests of political expediency and we could easily see a reversion of the happy trends the country saw when Fianna Fail were in office.  I refer to the increase in the population, the increase in the marriage rate and the decline in emigration.  Emigration was reduced to a mere trickle. They were happy times and it is very sad to see these three important socio-economic factors put at risk for the sake of trying to hold together people of divergent views.  It is just not good enough. It is the country which will have to pay.</P>
    <P>There are those who are boasting that we are keeping social welfare recipients abreast of deteriorating standards and the rising cost of living. Let us remember only a certain number of people produce wealth.  They have been doing a very good job in the past.  Certain people saw fit to talk about the affluent generation rising up just because the country was getting its head above water.  What have this Government done for those who generate wealth?  They have imposed a wealth tax, a capital gains tax, a tax on farmers plus increased taxation generally and increased VAT.  We are rapidly reaching the stage of diminishing returns so far as taxation is concerned.  The number of those producing wealth to be distributed for the benefit of those who are not in a position to make it or earn it is shrinking and the number on the receiving end is increasing.  Let us watch the gap between the two.  We cannot go on forever grinding down those who <Col N="671" /> generate the wealth that we need to redistribute.  We must have some regard for these.  There is little, if anything, for them in this budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with three particular aspects of the budget.  I shall have some comments to make on employment and industry, some comments on social welfare and some comments on agriculture.</P>
      <P>On the employment side, I do not think we fully appreciate as yet the multitude of economic difficulties affecting the country.  This is something that has yet to be brought home to the electorate and, indeed, to politicians, particularly those on the Opposition benches.  I refer to the serious and extensive nature of the difficulties. I do not think the chilling effect of global inflation on the country has yet fully dawned on the electorate.  There is growing unemployment in the EEC and in the United States of America.  There is a decline in world trade.  There is confusion in international money markets.  There are high interest rates for money borrowed.  There is the collapse of stock markets.  There is a scarcity of commodities.  There are costly and unpredictable oil supplies. These undesirable developments are not yet, I believe, fully understood. Admittedly, there are a number of indicators.  In the past 12 months the number of unemployment benefit applications has risen by 10,000. Short-time workers have increased by 8,500.  In the United Kingdom three-quarters of a million workers are unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress in particular the number of workers in receipt of unemployment benefit and the number of workers on short-time as these provide the true dimension of our economic recession and our economic difficulties in particular industries.  They put the problems in their proper prospective.  We must bear in mind that the current total of 95,000 persons on the live register includes 8,500 on short time and many thousands in receipt of the rural unemployment assistance or dole who would be on that register <Col N="672" /> anyway irrespective of economic recession or economic growth.  Such is the nature of the dole.</P>
    <P>It is quite irresponsible for the Opposition to attempt to draw any analogy with the situation in 1957 when our economic infrastructure was in an embryonic state and when 50,000 persons emigrated each year.  Some of the Fianna Fáil efforts to undermine the confidence of our people in Ireland's future go beyond the pale of constructive political opposition.  If the Fianna Fáil Party were to adopt the neo-Powellite policies of Deputy Haughey, for example, and expanded on just now by Deputy Brennan, they would have a great deal to answer for to future generations.  It is best that the Fianna Fáil Party should remain in what we commonly call a state of &ldquo;Deputy Colley confusion&rdquo; rather than adopt the extreme right wing conservative policies of Deputy Haughey and Deputy Brennan, as epitomised by Fianna Fáil opposition to the wealth tax, the capital gains tax, the elimination of the mining tax, and the taxation of 9,000 large landowning farmers.  That is the state of play of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Opposition to Fianna Fáil is not enough.  We in Government have to ask ourselves what have we done.  As we undertook in the White Paper &ldquo;A National Partnership&rdquo;, in this budget we have given priority to promoting employment.  To help industry to meet the cost of maintaining employment, the increased prices of raw materials and future investment requirements, we have removed £12 million from taxation direct from industry.  In Government we are continuing various investment concessions for industry and we are increasing from 20 per cent to 50 per cent the first year capital allowance for industrial building.  This will help in some measure the manufacturing and the construction industries.  The IDA and the other State-sponsored bodies which provide finance for the maintenance and creation of employment are getting a massive increase of £20.2 million in 1975.  However, I believe that to secure the further development of Irish industry and the expansion of <Col N="673" /> Irish exports we have to press forward, and there is an urgent need for a more comprehensive package from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that consideration should be given to some selective import controls.  As one who supported Ireland's entry into the EEC&mdash;a rather lonely figure I was at the time in the Labour Party, and I still support entry on balance&mdash;I believe we should have the introduction of selective import controls for textiles, clothing and the footwear industry, with EEC approval.  I hope the Ministers will be successful.  We need more extensive credit facilities for the manufacturing industry.  We need a much greater emphasis on measures for export promotion, marketing and product development.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay particular tribute to Córas Tráchtála and the IDA for their sustained efforts towards greater industrial development and export promotion. I have knowledge of the rescue service of the IDA and the tremendous work of Fóir Teoranta in the past 12 months.  They have mitigated the worst effects of redundancy in industry and the public servants in these bodies deserve great credit for their dedicated work.  They have not lost their nerve and the harping and destructive criticisms of Fianna Fáil in relation to our economic difficulties were no contribution towards the success of their endeavours.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Of all the tasks which could engage my attention, the least realistic would be the publication of a medium or long-term economic plan based upon irrelevancies in the past, hunches as to the present and clairvoyance as to the future.</P>
    <P>I regard the Minister as probably the most progressive and intelligent of all the holders of this portfolio in the history of this State.  I genuinely hold that view.  He has grown in stature and in competence during his period in office.  The Opposition possess no front bencher to rival him.  But I do <Col N="674" /> not agree with his policy as enunciated on medium and long term economic policies.  I submit that the very situation we find ourselves in demands such indicative planning both in the long and short term.</P>
    <P>Two basic problems face our Government at present.  They reside at the very core of any modern mixed economy such as ours.  The first is how to maintain and achieve full employment without drifting into rapid inflation. The second is how to manage the economy in an open and egalitarian manner without excessive price rises, wage or taxation controls.  We cannot possibly deal with these complex issues and their interaction at many levels unless we have economic planning of a social and economic content.  Our future employment prospects depend on economic planning being effectively implemented by the Government.</P>
    <P>We need another surge forward similar to that generated in the 1960s by Mr. Lemass and Mr. Whitaker. Future industrial development and productive capital formation demand economic planning now even in a highly inflationary situation.  Our country has grown in economic managements in entrepreneurial skills and, if we are not to dissipate these resources, as politicians we must favour economic and social planning.  Otherwise there is little purpose in being in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to ensure that our important oil, gas and mineral resources are developed in the interest of the Irish people as a whole and not for the speculative enrichment of a few private or multi-natiional companies.  Our agreements with these companies must be planned for the future and our relationship with them must reflect the principle of economic and social planning in this area.  The oil and gas explorations off the Irish continental shelf and the future on-shore developments must be placed under the aegis of a State-sponsored development corporation. This will require economic planning of the highest order.</P>
    <P>The almost complete absence of an effective domestic regional policy in Ireland and our failure to develop trans-Border industrial projects pinpoint <Col N="675" /> the need for more effective economic and social planning.  We must plan for joint ventures between the State-sponsored bodies and the progressive elements in public and private enterprise to ensure Irish involvement in the new technologically-based industries.  This calls for economic planning.  We have yet to develop a coherent strategy for industrial growth based on growth centres.  We tend to have an excessive dispersal of industry in many areas.  This, too, calls for a re-evaluation of economic policy. I suggest to the Minister, a most progressive Minister, a man for whom my regard has grown in the past 22 months, that he should rethink his comment on that aspect in his budget speech.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in the budget for increases in social welfare payments and the pledge to review and raise those payments again in October fulfils the undertaking given in the 14-point programme, at the Labour Party conference and Fine Gael ard-fheiseanna and clearly stated in the White Paper, &ldquo;A National Partnership.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The budget raised the weekly rates of social welfare payments by between 21 and 23½ per cent, several percentage points above the rise in the cost of living since the last increases were paid in July, 1974.  To take one example, in July, 1974 the contributory old age pension for a person aged 69 was £7.20.  In April, 1975, ten months later, a person aged 67 will receive a pension of £10.50.  That is an increase of almost 46 per cent in ten months. One could hardly do better than that.</P>
    <P>Last week's welfare increases do not, therefore, just keep pace with inflation as is being suggested.  They represent a real increase and are in line with our policy of improving the position of all social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>These rates will be increased in October.  The Government have made a public commitment to maintain the new level of the value of all weekly social welfare payments by means of a review and further increase in October taking into consideration the movement in the cost of living and <Col N="676" /> other relevant factors.  I congratulate the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <P>Since we came to power social welfare payment rates have been raised by increases ranging from 66 per cent in the case of some personal rates of benefit to 80-90 per cent in single parent families and to 96-140 per cent for child dependant allowances.  Children's allowances which have been raised again for the third successive year in this budget have gone up since 1973 by 360 per cent for the first child, by 140 per cent for the second child and by 93 per cent for the third and subsequent children.  In the same period the cost of living rose by between 35 and 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Government spending on social welfare has been increased by £46 million in full year terms.  This means that since this Government came to power the proportion of GNP devoted to social welfare has risen from 4.1 per cent to 5.6 per cent, the greatest record in the history of the State.  The Exchequer cost of social welfare has increased in two years by 140 per cent because not only have rates been raised but the scope of coverage and protection has been greatly extended by the introduction of new schemes, the reduction of the pension age to 67 years and by easing the means test.</P>
    <P>All this is in line with the policy laid down at the last annual Labour Party conference and at the Fine Gael ard-fheiseanna.  At our conference we made a statement on &ldquo;Protecting The Future&rdquo; and we declared:</P>
    <P>The advances in social policy made to date by the National Coalition Government must be maintained.</P>
    <P>Referring to the impact of the economic crisis on the less well-off, the statement said:</P>
    <P>The defence of the living standards of the poor is a stated priority of the Labour Party in its policy to beat the crisis.  In short, this means in a time of financial stringency that the real level of expenditure on health and social welfare must not be allowed to fall.  Rather must the Government's commitment to <Col N="677" /> social protection and reform be maintained whatever the cost to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>This particular reform is continuing. Increasing the levels of social welfare payments is not as far as we are concerned the be-all and end-all of activity in this area of Government policy.  Work is proceeding on a number of major developments.</P>

      <P>Work is proceeding on a number of major developments and many new moves are being planned in social welfare.  The Department of Social Welfare is busy on the preparation of the Green Paper on an income-related pension scheme which will also deal with certain aspects of the social insurance of the self-employed sector of the work force, a much-needed and necessary development.  The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cluskey, recently indicated his desire to get to grips with the major job of consolidating the complex legislative framework within which the social welfare system operates. The Tánaiste has stated that a complete review of the basis of financing the social welfare and health services will be carried out.  It may be said here that the total Exchequer cost this year of these services will exceed £400 million.</P>
      <P>This provides a basis for planned advances in the future and for the fulfilment of the Government's solemn pledge to remember and cater for the needs of the disadvantaged to the maximum possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elimination of poverty from our country remains a demanding and fundamental challenge to the Government. I am not satisfied with raising the level of social welfare payments, low as these are in many cases.  I want <Col N="678" /> to remind the House of the words of the Labour Party's policy statement on poverty in which it was stated:</P>
    <P>The long-term strategic approach to poverty must be directed to the fundamental question of inequality &mdash;inequality in the distribution and control of wealth, inequality through political power which does exist (there are no poor in Leinster House as Deputies); inequality of educational opportunity; inequality in the living environment (there is not a homeless Deputy in the House); inequality of employment opportunity (there is not an unemployed Deputy in this House); inequality of living standards (the vast majority of Deputies are well above the national average in living standards).  All these are symptoms which form the backbone of poverty measurement.  The major elements of such policy must include economic and real social planning; redistribution of wealth and incomes; use of natural resources; economic democracy and enfranchisement of the poor.</P>
    <P>I think this will come.  It is very difficult for a poor person to be elected to Dáil Éireann and the budget has not changed that.  This is a clear indication of the size of the task before us, one which calls for the best efforts of everyone in the Labour movement and in the Government, particularly in this period of economic difficulty.</P>
    <P>As Labour Party Whip with a deep interest in the alleviation of poverty, I am encouraged by the progress made to date by the advisory committee on pilot schemes to combat poverty and particularly by the announcement of the first four projects which have now been brought to the planning stage.  I hope this important project will soon be fully operational so that a start will have been made on the long but essential programme of action research capable of providing a proper basis for the evolution of policies capable of getting to the root causes of poverty and dealing with them.  I wish Sr. Stanislaus and the committee every success in their endeavours.</P>
    <P>I am confident that in the next few <Col N="679" /> months we shall see full ratification of the overall EEC programme of pilot schemes and the implementation of schemes in all member States.  I also congratulate Deputy Cluskey. The initiative of the Irish Government has opened up the prospect of a new direction in the social policy of the Community with an emphasis on the pressing needs of those citizens who are not part of the active labour force here.  In that regard also I should like to congratulate Commissioner Hillery on the work he has done in that area.</P>
    <P>Since my election to this House in 1969 I have repeatedly referred to the plight of single parent families, particularly the plight of widows with children, of unmarried mothers, of deserted wives, of prisoners' wives and, that other forgotten category, widowers with young children.  The provisions in this budget have been of benefit to these categories.  A serious effort has now been made by the Government to give social support to the young, and the not so young, women who have remained at home caring for their parents and who have not had the benefit of social insurance. I should like to give one figure to illustrate the changes that have occurred.  In March, 1973, the insurance rate paid to a widow and two children was £8.60.  The rate from 1st April next will be £15.80, an increase of £7.20 or of 84 per cent.  We should bear that phenomenal change in mind.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the deserted wife and her two children will receive an increase of 88 per cent over that same period, from March, 1973, to April, 1975. These increases far outstrip the increase in the cost of living.  I urge the Minister for Finance to review the provisions for widowers with young children because the income tax allowances for widowers, and the home help provisions, are quite inadequate. I suggest that the Minister undertake a special review in that area.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the contentious issue of some types of claims for unemployment and disability <Col N="680" /> benefit.  It has been suggested by some extreme right-wing conservatives, particularly in Britain&mdash;they are developing in this country also since social welfare benefits have been improved&mdash;that many social welfare recipients are spongers and that many claims for pay-related disability and unemployment benefits are unjustified. I do not share that view.  Unfortunately, it is true that a tiny minority in a society will always abuse claims, particularly for social benefits and social services.  It is also true that the introduction of the much welcomed and long overdue pay-related system provided some incentive to those who might wish to defraud.  For example, a married couple with two children with reckonable weekly earnings of £50 will be able to qualify for weekly payments of £31.20, £20.80 flat rate and another £10.40 pay-related benefit.  This is a payment of 75 per cent of earnings for disability or unemployment.  The applicant is also saved the cost of the social insurance stamp which is credited to him.  Inevitably, all one needs in this situation is a lazy or unscrupulous doctor prepared to sign a disability certificate for a dodgy applicant.  I emphasise that I have chosen my words carefully on this issue because they in no way reflect on the overwhelming majority of entirely legitimate claims.  It is an area the Department of Social Welfare should keep a close eye on, particularly in relation to disability claims.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to increased social insurance.  Improvements in social welfare payments announced in the budget will cost £49.40 million gross in the financial year 1975 of which the Exchequer cost will amount to £25.86 million.  The full year cost of these improvements will be £77.7 million gross and £46.05 million to the Exchequer.  I should like to remind those who nostalgically hope for a return to power of Fianna Fáil that the total Exchequer cost of the social welfare services has risen from £92 million in 1972-73 when Fianna Fáil were in power to £223 million in the current year.  I am proud to be part of a Government with such a record.  I am proud of the Government who have made such an <Col N="681" /> allocation of State resources which massively outstrips the substantial increase in the cost of living in this period.</P>

      <P>It is perfectly obvious that on the basis of the information made available by the Minister for Finance in this debate the weekly rates of employment contributions for social welfare will be increased when the Social Welfare Bill is published.  I am not, I should like to stress, privy in any way to the Bill but I can make a deduction from data available to me as readily as most people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>How much will the stamp cost then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The present ordinary rate for a main is £1.84 from the employer and £1.42 from the employee making a total of £3.26 per week.  The rate for a woman is £1.79 from the employer and £1.35 from the employee making a total of £3.14.  I submit that even if these rates are to be increased in excess of £4.00 per week the cost of social insurance here is very low and provides tremendous value for money paid to the State in the form of, as social welfare contributions are, deferred savings.  I have no doubt that Fianna Fáil will exploit, in their usual cynical and short-sighted manner, the necessary increases in the weekly rates to be paid by the employee and employer. Is there any country in the world, any country in the EEC or any insurance company in the world providing for an employee contribution of less than £2 per week the following benefits, occupational injuries, redundancy payments, unemployment, disability, pay-related benefits, maternity, death grant, retirement pension, deserted wives benefit, contributory <Col N="682" /> widows' pension, contributory orphans' allowance, contributory old-age pension, treatment benefit and so on?  In fact, we have social insurance on the cheap.</P>
      <P>The fact that one-third of our labour force is self-employed and the fact that large segments of our rural population do not contribute to social insurance has made the problem very much more difficult.  I submit that there is an urgent need in 1975 for the Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare to get together with their experts to work out a comprehensive system of national social insurance bringing the self-employed and a substantial proportion of the farming community under the ambit of a national scheme.  I also feel that a pay-related contributory system should be revised with particular reference to the current ceiling of £2,500 earnings.  At present £25 per year is the maximum pay-related contribution payable by an employee and £50 per year is the maximum corresponding employers contribution.  I submit to the Minister for Finance that in the light of inflation and increased earnings there is a need to revise these ceilings.</P>
      <P>I should also like to point out that the current flat rate insurance contribution penalises the low paid worker and hits hardest at the female worker who is earning 55 per cent of the male adult earning and is paying a substantial social insurance contribution.  This is an obvious area of imbalance in social welfare contributions and it should be put right in 1975.  I know that the expert staff of the dedicated Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare have the capacity, the competence and political will to bring forward radical proposals in these areas.  I submit that the Minister for Finance should give them a leeway of going ahead and doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two other matters of social welfare to which I want to refer &mdash;two very controversial matters, children's allowances and the dole.  It has been stated in regard to children's allowances that the current cost is about £50 million per annum.  As is widely appreciated, generally these allowances are paid with no reference to actual <Col N="683" /> family income and with only the most marginal emphasis on size of family. In this House we have the spectacle of Ministers of State earning £10,000 per annum, public servants&mdash;in the higher echelons&mdash;earning £6,000 per annum, middle management executives in Irish industry, private employment, earning similar salaries, wealthy businessmen and farmers earning similar amounts, all drawing, say, for three children £123 per annum allowance with no clawback to the Exchequer.  I submit this is a preposterous state of affairs.  I suggest it is a scandalous waste of some £4 million to £8 million, or 10 per cent of the total, which should not be provided to families who manifestly do not need it.  As a socialist, who believes in the concept of need, I submit to this House and, indeed, to my constituents in what is probably one of the wealthiest constituencies in Ireland, that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare should divert that money to those sectors of the community in far greater need.</P>
    <P>Regarding the dole, I consider it an area of public scandal.  I make no apology for saying so.  I submit that a cursory examination of the unemployment assistance benefits paid out in the local employment offices will show clearly that there are farmers and small business people drawing the dole where their actual, real personal and family incomes do not merit such payment. Unfortunately, such is the political party attitude to the dole in this country that any effort to eradicate the abuses of the system is likely to be strenuously resisted.  However, I would point out that there are, for example, in some of the Munster counties farmers with substantial weekly creamery cheques, with income from cattle and other farm revenue who, because of the valuation method of the dole assessment, qualify for such benefits. Any rural Deputy, particularly from the Munster area, will not be too hard put to give chapter and verse to that comment.  That is a demoralising state of affairs and, I would suggest, has induced a cynical decay in the fibre of many a family generation.  All the <Col N="684" /> political parties have not only a major political but moral responsibility to face this issue squarely with some honour.</P>
    <P>In making these critical comments &mdash;again, claiming to be a socialist&mdash;in this House I, as one who cares deeply about the poverty and low income existing in many parts of rural Ireland &mdash;in no way denigrate those who must, because of need, apply for the dole and who have never had an opportunity of earning a decent farm income or of having full-time employment in a rural town.  As you well know, all of my family come from rural Ireland.  I cannot be accused of having any particular anti-rural bias.  My late father was reared with ten other children on the side of a mountain in north Cork, on a small holding of ten acres.  Certainly, I am acutely aware of the need for such income maintenance needed by many families still in rural Ireland. But I do strongly submit that there is grave need for the Government and the Opposition to examine constructively the present position and to eliminate the areas of abuse with particular reference to the method of assessment of means.</P>
    <P>Regarding agriculture, I would submit that this budget has, in some measure&mdash;and admittedy, with the limitations of finance available to any Minister&mdash;helped farmers with cattle over the difficulties of this winter.  The Government have, as is known, provided another £2.2 million for cattle feed vouchers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have provided also new incentive reliefs under the income tax code to encourage further investment in farming. These steps, together with the £50 million or more negotiated by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in Brussels last October, will provide&mdash; and I am confident are providing&mdash;substantial and significant improvements for farmers during 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to congratulate Deputy Mark Clinton on his outstanding work on behalf of the farmers of this country <Col N="685" />&mdash;and for the country as a whole&mdash;since his appointment as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  Deputy Clinton has never over-reacted to the most obdurate and unco-operative criticism and whining from some spokesmen of farming organisations and particularly in recent months from the President of the NFA, Mr. T. J. Maher.  Some most outrageous propaganda has been levelled at the Minister and, God knows, Deputy Clinton is a quiet man. I would not blame him were he to erupt but I admire him for the fact that he has kept his cool when others &mdash;on the farmers' spokesmen side&mdash; were semi-hysterical.  Some most outraegous claims have been levelled at the Minister.  I quote a classic example from last Saturday's <i>Irish Independent</i> by that well-known political commentator &ldquo;The Drover&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>It is very easy to understand the reason for this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is, why the farming community is in revolt&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;the farming community have watched as various trade union groups held the country to ransom for pay increases, as National Wage Agreements shoved up wages and salaries and budgets kept social welfare benefits up to the stage where an urban dweller still gets a ready income even if he cannot get a job or will not work.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the farmer has fallen steadily behind in income level and, after an extremely bad time in 1974, sees a final straw in the fact that he is expected in many cases to pay tax on the double income tax on his so-called profits (what farmer made a profit in 1974?) and rates on the land that produces his income.</P>
    <P>Farmers are willing to pay rates on their houses, they are willing to pay their fair share of general taxation. But, at a time when things are very bad for them in a general sense, farmers are incensed at the idea of having to pay what they genuinely see as a double taxation.</P>
    <P>That is sheer propaganda and has to be refuted in this House.  My reply to <Col N="686" />&ldquo;The Drover&rdquo; and to the drovers in some other organisations is that there are in this country 200,000 farmers and that last year's Finance Act subjected only 8,800 full-time farmers, with farms of over £100 rateable valuation, to income taxation.  About 7,000 other persons who also draw a livelihood from professions or businesses other than farming and whose farms are over £50 rateable valuation are affected also.  Thus the tax liability affects, at the very maximum, 15,800 farmers only out of 200,000.  That is 8 per cent of the farming community and that is not double taxation of the farming community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I would point out that even after this budget has relieved many thousands of people from PAYE, the percentage of employed persons in this country paying income tax is still 85. Therefore, we have a situation in which 8 per cent of the farming community and 85 per cent of the other employed persons in the community are called upon to pay income tax.  It is not double taxation.  Therefore, let us not advocate that kind of nonsense.</P>
    <P>Mr. Maher advocates that this small minority&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair would prefer if names of persons outside the House were not mentioned. It is a convention to which we should like to adhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall refer to it in another context.  Some farming spokesman said that this small minority of larger farmers liable to income tax should not have to pay rates.  They fail to appreciate that if the rates claim were to be admitted the revenue loss would have to be made good by other taxpayers, namely, collecting income tax from wage and salary earners or from other sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those agitating for rates exemption for bigger farmers should realise that if the no-rates claim were to be admitted, the necessary corollary would be the extension of income tax to all farmers.  These people cannot have it both ways.  The relief provided already by the Exchequer for rates <Col N="687" /> on land by way of the agricultural grant must be taken into account.  As much as two-thirds of the total bill for rates on lands&mdash;about £27 million out of a total of £40 million&mdash;is met by the Exchequer and this is at the expense of other taxpayers.  Farmers with valuations of less than £100 as well as those whose valuations are greater than that amount benefit from the generous relief afforded by this grant.  For example, farmers whose valuations are £100, £150 and £200 get relief, when rates are set off against income tax liability, at 56, 55 and 52 per cent respectively.  Therefore, it is nonsense to suggest that farmers are suffering the penalty of double taxation.  A further major benefit to farmers is that the employment allowance of £17 for full-time male workers is given for rates relief. Taking these factors into consideration it is obvious that there is a considerable contribution by the State towards the easing of the relatively low burden of rates on the farming community.  The president of the IFA has conceded, though reluctantly, that 53 per cent of all farmers having more than 20 acres pay no rates on agricultural land.  The more authentic figure is that given by the Minister for Finance who has shown conclusively that 70 per cent of all farmers pay no rates on agricultural land.</P>
    <P>An interesting point made by &ldquo;The Drover&rdquo;&mdash;I am not being offensive in any way since I am not aware of his identity&mdash;is that all farmers pay rates on their private dwellings.  This commentator, together with the other spokesmen, should remember that the rateable valuation of a residence in rural Ireland is about one-third of the valuation of an equivalent dwelling in an urban area.  With respect to the propagandists involved it could be said that town dwellers have rate burdens three times greater than have those who live in farm houses.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the dwindling band of supporters for the kind of agitation being exercised now that this is a very dangerous form of agitation and the protagonists of it would be well advised not to stress too often the question of the relative burden of <Col N="688" /> rates on the farming community compared with other sections because such a spotlight would, if anything, merely expose the fact that the actual burden of the farmers as a whole is not any greater than that of any other section, that if anything it is somewhat less.</P>
    <P>As a trade unionist I have no objection to the IFA or to any other farming organisation seeking the maximum improvements possible in the standards of living of their members but as I have said in the past in relation to the trade unions I deplore any attempt by any group to gain advantage for themselves on the backs of other sections.  I deplore the attempt of some spokesmen in the IFA&mdash;I think they are a minority who are very badly advised&mdash;to use the back of the beet growers and the Irish Sugar Company in order to take issue with the Government.  I would have more regard for some of these spokesmen if they were to resign from their positions on semi-State bodies, that is if they wish to continue that kind of sectional campaign.</P>
    <P>The issues of intervention, of store cattle prices, of compensation claims for tillage and so on cannot be developed. These matters cannot be resolved within a democracy simply by destroying a most valuable cash crop for farmers and by destroying the employment of thousands of people in rural Ireland.  Some members of the IFA may say that these are the words of another urban Deputy who is having &ldquo;a go&rdquo; at the farmers.  I speak as a Member of this House and as one who has a national concern in these matters.  Knowing the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries I am confident that if the IFA sit down with him and argue their issues calmly and reasonably without having recourse to hysterical television contributions or to intimidatory noises, the Government will understand, appreciate and give every assistance possible to the IFA.  I know that the farmers have experienced a bad time but they would be very wrong to act on ill-considered advice and in a precipitate manner on an issue in respect of which some people have put themselves on the hook but from which <Col N="689" /> they should release themselves as quickly as possible.  Otherwise, the farmers and the farm workers will be the first to suffer.</P>
    <P>The public may rest assured that this Cabinet will continue to introduce all taxation reforms that are necessary in the national interest.  The reactions of Deputies Lynch, Colley, Brennan and of Haughey, both in the past and in the present, and also of Senator Lenihan, if I may refer to a former Minister, to the Government's taxation proposals, whether in relation to mining, to a wealth tax, to a capital gains tax or to the taxation of larger farmers, have shown that these men are very conservative politicians.  They are what I would classify as the defenders of the old-fashioned Fianna Fáil capitalist of the narrowest kind. These men are unique in that they are the retired leaders of a so-called republican party, a party whose attitudes in relation to such issues as natural resources and taxation, would not be adopted by any other European country.  No other political party in Europe have put themselves into that kind of mould.  By contrast, we in the Coalition have a policy of developing a dynamic mixed economy with no pandering to those who would, in partnership with the State, develop our natural resources.  This is a welcome breath of fresh air.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have been, tragically, a great party and in this debate have been a party of despair and retrospective wisdom.  I would remind them in these difficult economic times that despair cannot be exported.</P>
    <P>During this debate it has become increasingly obvious from Fianna Fáil contributions that they have nothing new to offer by way of policy, particularly in the economic field.  Cheap sneers at Deputy Mark Clinton, Deputy Garret FitzGerald or Deputy Richie Ryan, who now carry onerous ministerial responsibility, are no substitute for constructive criticism in the national interest.  It seems to me that the strategy of the Fianna Fáil Party has been to exploit, for narrow political advantage coming up to an Ard-Fheis, the dangers and difficulties <Col N="690" /> inherent in a critical economic situation. They have made no constructive proposals on current domestic and international difficulties in this debate.</P>
    <P>I finished my education in 1957 at the age of 21 and was unemployed. Eventually I got a job in a trade union. This was at a period of serious economic recession.  I am confident that this Government will not allow a situation of relevant comparison to develop. There is no comparison between today and 1957.  That year 55,000 people emigrated. The whole of my class from UCC, except three, emigrated. Of the three still in Ireland, one is a publican, one is rearing greyhounds and I am a politician.</P>
    <P>This country has many things going for it which other countries would envy.  Today our economy is basically healthy.  Our export opportunities are greater.  Now opportunities to export our agricultural and industrial goods are open to us in the Common Market.  We have shown that our exports can compete successfully.  We have a growing expertise in new technologies being developed here.  We have a young and growing population who can make that contribution.  The Coalition Government are committed to economic and social reform and, therefore, we will succeed in our endeavours.  I regret the Opposition have contributed little else but abuse and negative reaction to this debate.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his carefully expansionary budget.  Perhaps, he was wise to budget for a deficit of £125 million.  Personally, I may have gone only for £5 million or a little over, in order to provide aid for the construction industry.  I have no doubt that in the months ahead the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, and the Minister for Finance will resolve the problem, knowing how tenacious Deputy Tully is in all matters, particularly those relating to the Department of Local Government and Finance.  On that basis I have no doubt that aid will be forthcoming for the construction industry.</P>
    <P>I commend the Department and the Minister for not having lost their <Col N="691" /> nerve in an extremely difficult year. The Coalition have not lost their nerve and so will not lose the people's confidence in any further budgetary redevelopments during the next 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to condemn the whole budget.  I intend to be harsh where the budget is wrong and to give credit where it is good.  In my opinion this is a &ldquo;chancey&rdquo; budget. If one borrows in a business, one borrows for productive purposes.  The danger of this budget is that we are borrowing money to keep the people alive.  We are spending large sums of borrowed money on social welfare. Much has been said about social welfare. I agree with every increase and congratulate the Minister.  However, the country is in a very bad state when so many people are living on welfare.</P>
      <P>There would be a bloody revolution in rural Ireland if it were not for Deputy Frank Cluskey's social welfare. In my area three people were drawing the dole two years ago.  There are 50 people signing now because they have lost 70 per cent of their income. I am referring to the small farmers whose income has gone so low that they must depend on social welfare. I agree with Deputy Desmond when he says that this can demoralise the people.  I remember the time when some of those people would not accept social welfare.  But hard facts have made them accept.  We are now budgeting and borrowing merely to keep our people alive.  This is not good business.</P>
      <P>I agree we should budget for a deficit but, in my opinion, a budget deficit of £125 million is too high.  When I was growing up we were taught that in business we should balance our budget.  We were also advised that if we had a productive plan, we should borrow and invest in it.  This budget does not do that.  It is giving a few pounds here and there solely to keep people alive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed that the construction industry did not get a much needed injection.  Nobody can deny that the housing industry is in a very <Col N="692" /> serious situation.  The Minister for Local Government is a man with whom I agree on many things but I could not agree with him when he said today that he saw nothing wrong with the private housing sector nor when he said that he could not see there was any problem when a young couple wanted to buy a house costing £9,000 but could only get a loan of £4,500 plus grants.  Where will they get the rest of the money?  This is a major problem facing young couples today.  The houses are there but there is no money to buy them.  I have been pressing here for quite some time for grants for the building of private houses.</P>
    <P>There should be no difference between the farmers' grants and other grants.  They should all be the same. The farmer has the site while the non-farmer has to buy the site.  The total of the farmer's grant at the moment is, at best, £920.  That was granted at a time when houses cost only £2,000 or £3,000.  Now houses cost £8,000 or £9,000.  Therefore, at present the grant is useless.  The £920 grant is not from the Department of Local Government.  Half comes from the Department and half from the local county councils.  I thought an injection should have been given to this sector.  The building industry gives a great deal of employment.  Everybody expected taxation to be mentioned in the budget, but I expected a big injection to be given to the building industry.  That it did not get.</P>
    <P>I also expected an injection to subsidise the wiring by the ESB of private houses.  This is one of the greatest hardships at the moment in rural Ireland.  Some of the old people did not accept electricity when the ESB were wiring in their area.  Now a son, who has made money abroad, comes home and wants to build a house.  He builds his house.  He budgets for the building of his house but he does not budget for an extra £500 or £600 for ESB connection.  We have been pressing here for some sort of subsidy to the ESB to help such people because this is a great hardship.  I have cases where £500, £600 or the whole grant from the Department of Local <Col N="693" /> Government has gone for ESB connection. The ESB will tell you, quite rightly, that they are a non profit making concern and that they have to pay their way.  An injection of money in this area would help ordinary people to build their own houses. This is one of the things that prevents people from building houses in their own environment and drives them into the towns.</P>
    <P>The increase of 15p per gallon on petrol was a shock to me.  This is expected to bring in £27 million.  We thought this would give the type of social welfare increases which we knew were needed to keep up with inflation.  I cannot accept that this was done to cut down the consumption of petrol.  I do not believe it will do this in the case of people who have plenty of money but what about the worker?  I come from County Galway and I know people who are driving 30 or 40 miles to Galway city to work. They cannot be expected to travel on bicycles, they must have cars.  This will add a couple of pounds a week to their expenses.  Where will they get it?  To cut down on the consumption of petrol I would go for rationing and I would give petrol to the people who need it at the right price.  If the Minister had said he was putting 15p a gallon on petrol because the Government needed the money I would not be half so critical.  I do not believe it was put on for the purpose of cutting down the consumption of petrol.</P>
    <P>I spoke before about the mistake that was made in imposing a 50 miles per hour speed limit.  That is a cod because nobody is keeping to it.  I do not mind saying that I do not keep it myself.  I have been fined a couple of times.  If I am travelling at 50 miles per hour I am overtaken as if I were on a bicycle.  To make an order to which nobody pays attention is humbug.  Anyway, it does not save petrol.</P>
    <P>On the first night after the order was made there was an attempt made to keep it.  On the road on which I travel when one passes Kilcock the traffic begins to open up.  The fast car gets away, then there is the medium one, the slow one and so on.  On this <Col N="694" /> particular night everybody seemed to be travelling at 50 miles per hour.  The result was when we got to Kinnegad we had a funeral of cars.  I used more petrol that night than I have used since then because I did not keep to the 50 miles per hour.  I suppose I will be caught again.  That is not very relevant, however.  I do not agree with the increase of 15p per gallon and I do not believe it was put on for the purpose of cutting down consumption because the people who have money will continue to buy petrol and those who need it for their work are the people who will be affected.</P>
    <P>I believe we will have another budget.  If we have I hope the ESB will get something to subsidise the provision of electricity for those who are trying to build their homes.  They come to me or to somebody else and ask whether we can do anything about the large amounts they are asked to pay.  We cannot.  We cannot even get the ESB to take it in instalments.</P>
    <P>I was shocked that there was nothing in this budget by way of direct payment to the smaller farmer who must now live on the dole because of the low price of small cattle.  I do not think I have got it across to city Deputies that the majority of people who have small cattle this year had 70 per cent of their income taken away.  I know this.  I had them myself and I know other people who had them.  The average price of a weaned calf two years ago was £80.  Last year it was £63 and this year it was £23 and it had to be a reasonably good one before it could be sold.  Prices have improved slightly but the price of young cattle has not improved very much although beef has.  I said before that the beef man has had it good over the whole year because with whatever he was getting for beef he could buy small cattle at a very low price.  I have been appealing for some type of direct payment in respect of small cattle.  I now understand that the carcase weight for intervention is not in EEC regulations but is decided by our own Government.  I said before that I could not see why a 5 cwt. quality beast could not be put into intervention.  This is something over <Col N="695" /> which the Government had control. I thought there would be some direct payment to people who have lost large amounts of money.  The big danger is that in springtime if there is an improvement those people will not be able to buy in because they got such bad prices for what they sold and some of them sold cows instead of calves.  I asked for a direct payment on the first 20 cattle to such people.</P>
    <P>The fodder voucher has been mentioned.  That is only a loan to keep things going.  When the voucher first came out the people who applied immediately got four vouchers, which was £30.  People then began to get three.  Eventually they got two and then none at all.  Will the scheme be continued or is it the position that only people who had their applications in on the last date will get the four vouchers?  It is my understanding that the Government will loan the money to keep the scheme going.  Many people have asked me if it is in order for them to continue to apply for the vouchers and I have told them that I thought the scheme will be continued.  I should like the Minister to make a statement on the matter in the near future.  It is ridiculous to say that a few million pounds were handed out to the farmers. It is merely a loan.  I have been arguing for a long time that repayment of the £500 loan should be put back until October and it is good that the Minister has agreed to it.  It was not possible to repay the loan in March because the cattle would not be saleable then.  When feed is scarce all the farmer can do is to try to keep the cattle alive but it is not possible to have them in a saleable condition before March.</P>
    <P>The beef farmers have been advised to go back to milk.  This kind of advice amuses me because different kinds of animals are involved in both lines.  As any farmer knows, he would have to sell five suckling calves to buy a good dairy cow.  It is not possible to switch suddenly from beef to dairying.  However, if there is a switch to dairying&mdash; anyone who can afford to do so will make the switch&mdash;a large percentage of the calves that would be kept if the farmer stayed with beef production will <Col N="696" /> be put on the market.  They will be worth very little.</P>
    <P>If the farmer stays in beef, at least he will be able to keep the calves for six or eight months by which time we hope the situation will have changed. However, if he switches to milk, the price of suckling calves will be very low.  I am always annoyed when I hear people telling farmers to switch from one area of production to another when they do not realise what is involved. The people who give this advice are not farmers and do not understand the situation.</P>
    <P>When I spoke in this House on another occasion I said it was dreadful that we were so short of tillage.  I had expected in the budget that there would be some direct payment for at least a few acres of tillage.  When I spoke in an interview before the budget I pointed out that this is not contrary to EEC requirements.  When we thought the Treaty of Rome was very tight on these regulations we were told ten or 12 years ago that in the EEC it was not possible to subsidise by way of prices but that it was possible to pay a headage or acreage payment.  We are doing this in the beef incentive scheme and I am glad the Minister has announced it will be continued this year.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that in the budget we would not allow what had happened this year to recur, that farmers would be in the situation that they had no tillage.  I was disappointed that nothing was given to this type of farmer. I cannot emphasise strongly enough that the type of farmer I am referring to has suffered the loss of a 70 per cent decrease in his income this year. If this happened to people in other walks of life what would they do?  I am sure they would be loud in their protests.  I have been trying to emphasise throughout the year what has happened to the incomes of the farmers I have referred to; I do not think any other section would accept that situation.</P>
    <P>I am not referring to the type of farmers Deputy Desmond mentioned. I am as good a socialist as anyone else and I repeat that a certain section <Col N="697" /> is being neglected.  They have to depend on social welfare for existence. The budget has given increases in social welfare but it is said that we are budgeting for social welfare, that we have to do that.  Instead of providing a living for the small farmer we have to give his social welfare.  He would prefer not to be in this position but he must accept the benefit in order to survive. I compliment the Minister for his action with regard to this matter but it is sad that we have to budget in this way and that we are obliged to concentrate so completely on social welfare.  I wish to make it clear that I am in favour of the payment of social welfare but it is sad that we have to borrow for this kind of measure and that we have no definite plan, for instance, with regard to housing.  The 100,000 people who are unemployed will not get work as a result of this budget.  Irrespective of on what side of the House Deputies may sit none of them wants to see the situation deteriorating.  I hope the tide will turn and that the position will improve but I do not think the budget has done much.  It has not spelled out how the 100,000 people might obtain employment.</P>
    <P>With regard to small cattle, in addition to the question of reducing the carcase weight with regard to intervention, a board should be set up. This should be a different board from the beef board that is doing a good and specialised job.  The new board should go abroad and try to get markets for young cattle.  It annoys me when I hear people talk about the price farmers obtain for small cattle. I have said in this House that we went into the EEC in order to obtain free trade.  The farmers with small cattle did not get this free trade because an £8 tariff was slapped on them. The Government should send abroad people who are interested in selling small cattle.  The system that operates in this country is unique because we produce small cattle in one part of the country and we fatten them in another area.  One of the parties concerned would not like the small cattle to be too expensive.  The man who owns the small cattle should look <Col N="698" /> after their sale abroad.  The man with the beef cattle should have his own man looking after them.  If I was a man finishing cattle I would not like to see young cattle too dear.  That is why there was all the pressure for the £8 the time the tariff went on because they were afraid they would get too dear.  The producer of small cattle has not all the advantages in the EEC.  This is the first time he got a chance of getting anything but he was cheated out of it because the man finishing wanted to get young cattle as cheap as he could.</P>
    <P>Some export body should be set up to look for a market for small cattle abroad.  I cannot see when we are in the Community, if the cattle are to be fattened in one country and intervention is the same in every country, why the small producer in this country cannot get the same price as those in other member countries. I hope the Minister can tell us that the fodder vouchers will be continued and that the £30 will be paid from now on.</P>
    <P>I expected some money to be given to the Land Commission to add to the £6 million which they have in relation to Directive 160.  I understood the idea behind that was to get people who are not working their land off it. I find now it is not that type of farmer who are not working their land off it. I find now it is not that type of farmer who will retire.  The State will have to contribute a vast amount of money for farmers who retire because the EEC contribution to that scheme is 75 per cent for farmers who retire between 50 and 65 years. If a farmer is over 65 years when he retires the State has to bear the full cost.  A sum of £6 million is not sufficient to implement this scheme in full.  If the Land Commission retire a man over 65 the State will have to pay the full cost, because the EEC pay nothing in his case.</P>
    <P>We would all like to see people suffering from disabilities retiring from working their farms.  Those people do not come within this scheme because it says that retiring farmers must have spent at least 50 per cent of their working hours over a certain number of years working on their farms.  The scheme operates if a person is 50 years <Col N="699" /> of age.  If there is a widow aged 49 years, whose family has gone away and who would like to retire, she does not come within this scheme.  There is no money in the kitty to carry out this scheme if the majority of people retiring are between 60 and 70 years.</P>
    <P>Somebody stated that this was the first time that farmers got an opportunity to retire and that other sections were asked to retire at 65 years.  No section is asked to retire at 50 years. A good working farmer will not retire at that age.  If the Minister for Lands were here I am sure he would be able to tell me if I am right in saying that a large percentage of the people who want to retire are between 60 and 70 years of age and that the vast majority of them are over 65 years.  Therefore the EEC will not pay any money for them.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who is in charge of the Board of Works.  If some money were given in the budget to his Department it would give greater employment and bring a lot of land in the west of Ireland into production.  If extra money were given to housing, the Land Commission, the Board of Works and some incentive given to people to till I would not mind borrowing the money.  But if we have to borrow money to keep people fed by paying them social welfare it is not good business.  Many Deputies have stood up here and praised the Minister for giving extra money to social welfare recipients, but if he did not do this the people in receipt of those benefits would be in a very bad way.</P>
    <P>I often have people coming to me who want to obtain land from the Land Commission.  Social welfare is given out to farmers at the moment on the the basis of £20 for every £1 valuation. A small farmer with under £20 valuation who has a few children will get £8 or £9 a week.  If you give him ten acres of land and put up his valuation £8 or £9 you put him in the rating bracket and the social welfare is taken from him.  That is a disincentive to that man to take land or to become a developing farmer.  The present system <Col N="700" /> of assessing the income for social welfare is wrong.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Desmond when he said there are people who have other sidelines.  Just because they are assessed on a valuation basis they can draw social welfare although they are not entitled to it, while there are others who are just above the guideline and are very poor but cannot get social welfare.  Valuations vary a great deal.  There are reasonably good lands that are valued at 15p an acre while there are very poor lands valued as high as 75p an acre.  There is an historical background to that.  In the old days of the grand jury you had to have a certain valuation in order to qualify to be on the grand jury.  In those days, when the rates were only a penny in the pound you were not one of the aristocracy if you were not on the grand jury, and many people applied and got the valuation on their estate increased in order to qualify. That valuation remains to this day. That land is known in places in my constituency as landlord's land.  There are very high valuations on it, and all the tenants on that land, having a few in family, might be poor, but they cannot get social welfare.  If their genuine income was assessed against the income of a man with a lower valuation, I believe they would be more entitled to social welfare than he is.  There is a farmer in County Galway, in this area where the low valuation is, who has nearly 100 acres of fairly good land and who has 90 Friesian cows, and if that man wanted to&mdash;he is not doing it&mdash;he could apply for social welfare on the valuation basis.  That is why I say it is wrong to assess income on that basis.</P>
    <P>I know nothing about high finance and I do not intend to go into it, but one wonders when one is on the safe side in regard to borrowing.  It seems to be the general policy among economists that borrowing is no harm at all. I agree that it is no harm provided you are borrowing for productive purposes, but when you have to borrow to keep people fed, I worry a little about it.  I may be a little old-fashioned, but I was brought up with the idea that if at the end of the year <Col N="701" /> you were paying out a lot more than you were bringing in, you were going the wrong way.  Apparently now you are going the right way.</P>
    <P>What we want to do at the moment is to take the unemployed off the list, and I know we have to borrow, but I am just worried about the amount being borrowed and where it is being channelled, putting a few pounds here and a few pounds there and trying to give something to everybody, except of course the small farmer. The small farmer got nothing. The Minister may talk about the fodder voucher, but that is only a loan of money until it is recouped from the penny off the beef.</P>
    <P>I should like an answer to the question that was asked on the first evening of the budget and on which we have no information yet: what will be the cost of the stamp to the worker?  All the increases in social welfare, in old age pensions and so on, the good size of the budget on which we all agree, were spelled out, but the other side is not mentioned. We had the 15p on petrol.  We know about that, but the stamp is a further imposition on the worker.</P>
    <P>Again as regards the small farmer, if you go into any town in the west or in the midlands and ask the people who is the best customer and the best spender in that town they will say: &ldquo;The small farmer's wife when she has it, but when she has not got it, we feel the pinch.&rdquo; If the small farmer is short of money everybody feels it. That is why we are sadly disappointed that nothing has been done for this section of the community.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister whether the fodder voucher will be continued.  Can you apply all the time?  Will you get your four vouchers with the money the Minister is lending provided he collects it on the beef? If people switch from beef to milk what will happen with the newlydropped calf which will not be kept, if you are going into milk, for eight months in the hope of a better trade? Will an export market be set up for small cattle?  This would be different altogether from the beef end of it. What will happen if the small farmer's <Col N="702" /> position does not improve&mdash;and I do not think it will?  I am worried about the effect of paying out social welfare. When you start paying out money it is surprising how fond people get of it, and they lose the incentive to do things for themselves.  I would prefer to see something given to the small farmer to improve his farm and to build him up so that he would not need social welfare.  The provisions of the budget remind me of somebody running a business that is going down: we borrow money; we decide to put a few bob here and a few bob there and hope for the best.  I hope, in the interest of the country, no matter what side of the House we are on, things will turn out all right and that the economy will improve considerably within the next 12 months.  I believe this is a very dangerous budget, but as a man who does not understand high finance I am not in a position to go into it in detail.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Government even at this late hour to do something for the kind of person I represent.  I represent the workers in the towns as well as the others.  There are a great many people unemployed and more will be unemployed in my constituency because of the increased price of petrol. Government Deputies and Ministers will be down there for the by-elections. I would appeal to them to take a look around and see the position for themselves. They should ask the people what it costs to drive from one constituency into the other.  I need not tell them the answer the people will give.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be too critical but I am annoyed because I expected the Minister to do something better for those who most need help.  They are the people who are very hard hit.  I thought there would be an indication in the budget which would show that the workers would be removed from the unemployment list.  I thought something would be done for the small farmers. That has not happened.  That is why this is a disappointing budget.  I think it is a gambler's budget.  I may be wrong in that.  It may turn out very well.  All the same, I would not like to be the Minister for Finance because I think it is a chancy budget.</P>

      <P>I join with Deputy Callanan in hoping that before the year is out the economy will take a turn for the better and things will not be as difficult as they are now.  I compliment Deputy Callanan on his honesty and sincerity.  If we had more of this kind of contribution it would serve a better purpose.  The pattern is set, not just in relation to this year's budget, or last year's budget, but in relation to every budget: people on this side praise everything in the budget while those on the Opposition benches criticise everything in the budget.  This does not make for constructive debate.</P>
      <P>First of all, I want to deal with the circumstances in which this budget is introduced.  A previous speaker said it is a budget which is not introduced in normal circumstances because of the serious economic situation at home and abroad.  There is rampant world inflation and I have no doubt the Taoiseach and the Minister took a great deal of care and exercised a great deal of consideration and research before this budget was ultimately presented to the House.  It is somewhat difficult to discuss the budget on its own.  I believe we must also take into consideration last year's budget and the budget the year before that.</P>

      <P>We must do that to get an indication of the pattern adopted by the Government.  One thing is quite clear&mdash;it emerges above everything else&mdash;and that is that the Government are determined to look after the needy sections of our community. This is something for which many Deputies on the opposite benches have not given the Government credit. That is one thing that emerges above all; they are determined to look after those whe were neglected for far too long, social welfare recipients, the aged and the infirm.  It gives me great pleasure to support a Government determined to do this.  This budget clearly shows that this is the policy of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of things I should like to see done.  I will take up <Col N="704" /> now a point made by Deputy Callanan in connection with agriculture.  I am sure he was sincere when he said he was very concerned about the plight of the small farmers in the west and that they had had a lean year.  I do not accept altogether the percentage reduction he gave in their incomes. I concede there was a reduction but I would not agree it was 70 per cent. When Deputy Callanan talks about the small farmer changing from beef production to milk production I would like to remind him that this is a very costly process.  I contend that the small farmer should never have been induced to go into beef production. There is no living in beef production on a farm under 50 acres of top-class land.  There is no one more convinced of that than the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and he has said time and time again that every inducement should be given to those misled by the beef incentive bonus scheme to go into beef production to get out of beef production now and go back into milk production.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Callanan has left the House because there was one point I wanted to put to him.  The year 1973, the first full year of the National Coalition Government, was the best year the agricultural industry and the farming community have ever had.  Towards the end of the year there was a turn for the worse, but the dairy farmer did not do too badly.  I believe every incentive that can be provided should be provided to induce the small farmer to go into milk production. This would be a worthwhile exercise.  There is a future for milk. Unfortunately the cost of reversing the process is enormous.  There are modern parlours, modern milking machines, bulk tanks and so on; all these are very expensive.  This is the dilemma in which some small farmers induced into beef production now find themselves.</P>
    <P>This year there was an increase of 4p per gallon for milk.  We are going through a transitional period in the European Economic Community.  In 1977 we will become full members. The gap between prices in Europe and here will be bridged by 20 per cent <Col N="705" /> until such time as we reach par with European producers.  Once we are in that position I believe we will be in a very sound economic position provided our farmers are totally geared to milk production.  Our dairy farmers are second to none.  Our climate is right for milk production.  The winter period for in-feeding is far shorter than it is in Europe.  As high as costs are at present they are far lower than they are in the other eight countries in the European Community.  We produce milk far cheaper because of our valuable grass crop and because we have an excellent type of dairy farmer.</P>
    <P>A mistake was made in former years with the beef incentive bonus scheme to induce those people to go into beef rather than to continue in milk production.  There are difficulties in milk production as well.  It involves a seven-day week, but times are changing and farmers are becoming more modern.  In some areas they are helping each other and they have weekends off.  It is vitally important to the agricultural industry that we should induce and encourage as many as possible of the type of farmers mentioned by Deputy Callanan to go back into milk production.  The Minister has said time and again that this is the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>I agree that the price for small cattle is bad at present.  I agree that the producers of store cattle have gone through a difficult year.  I hope that the new scheme which the Minister will be introducing in the not too distant future, the scheme for the underprivileged areas, will benefit some of those people and that it will apply in the most deserving areas.  At present, many schemes apply to certain areas in the 12 western countries. I contend that there are areas outside the 12 western counties which are in a far worse position than the privileged areas.  Deputy Desmond and Deputy Callanan said that in the Gaeltacht areas&mdash;and most of them are in the 12 western counties&mdash; and in areas where unemployment assistance or dole is available for small farmers, many farmers who are doing reasonably well, some of them <Col N="706" /> earning £20 or £22 or £24 a week, are receiving unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear Deputy Callanan from the Fianna Fáil Party saying that the dole is demoralising for the small farmers, and that it is soul destroying.  It takes a bit of courage to say that, particularly for a Fianna Fáil Deputy.  It takes courage on the part of a member of the party who introduced it for the sole purpose of gaining votes, and so they did.  All the more credit is now due to Deputy Callanan for saying that.  This prompts me to say that, while we are talking of changes in our social welfare and our agricultural schemes, we should also talk about a change in the working of this Parliament.  Deputy Desmond made a constructive contribution to this debate and he criticised where he thought criticism was necessary. We should make more use of committees.  I understand that there are all-party committees dealing with matters like the Northern situation and the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Taoiseach and the Government that this suggestion is worthy of consideration.  Knowing the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, I know that he would welcome an all-party committee of this House sitting with him and discussing problems such as the problem mentioned by Deputy Callanan of unemployment assistance. That scheme is wrong because it is based on valuation.  West of the line determining the 12 western counties, which brings into that area part of my constituency, unemployment assistance or dole is based on valuation.  It does not matter what income you have.  You could have the milk of 50 cows going to the creamery.  The scheme is abused wholesale.  I would love to see twice as much money being devoted to some form of inducement or incentive towards increased production. This is what we want for the most hard-working section of our people, the small farming community. I should like to see a change in that direction.  An all-party committee of the House could examine this question with the Minister for Social Welfare.  I am reliably informed that if you are living in a dole-drawing <Col N="707" /> area, if you are a farmer with a wife and children, your dole is based on your valuation and the number of your dependants.</P>
    <P>Some people in receipt of unemployment assistance in those areas have bought a second farm and put it in the name of another member of the family in the United States or in Britain, and they can still draw the dole.  This scheme is necessary at this time to provide a livelihood for some people, but it is being abused.  It is terrible to find that somebody who is sending the milk of 20 or 30 cows to the creamery and drawing unemployment assistance qualifies for a butter subsidy, while next door a widow with young children in receipt of a contributory pension does not qualify for a butter subsidy.  That is why I say it is time we had changes.  There are many anomalies in social welfare benefits today.  I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister. You cannot transform the whole nation in two years.  That takes some time.  I am pleased that old people and the infirm are being looked after.  It is high time they were.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for Finance.  I have the greatest admiration for him.  When you consider the amount of money being provided this year for social welfare benefits and when you compare it with what was provided a few years ago, you realise what has to be provided from the Exchequer.  People should realise that the Exchequer is only a pool of resources taken from the people and redistributed to people like the social welfare recipients.  It was stated that each year more and more people are going on social welfare benefits.  This is quite true.</P>
    <P>For 50 years the qualifying age for the old age non-contributory pension was 70 years.  Prior to the change of Government the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party said they would reduce the qualifying age for a non-contributory old age pension year by year until it was in line with the qualifying age for a contributory old age pension or retirement pension.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> This was right, but one must realise the magnitude of this task.  From 1st April next the qualifying age will be 67 years.  Therefore, the social welfare net for the non-contributory old age pension is being cast very wide.  I want to pay tribute to the officials of the Department of Social Welfare who are dealing each year with two years' applications.  We have had less delay in dealing with some of those applications than we used to have.</P>
    <P>Many crocodile tears are shed about the way rural Ireland was denuded of its population over the past number of years.  Even in my own constituency huge areas are sparsely populated, and that is not the worst hit. There are empty houses.  The doors are locked.  The people have emigrated. Does anybody ever stop to realise what was the main contributory factor to this draining of our young people from rural Ireland?  If what was done over the past year and ten months had been done 20 or 30 years ago, it would have stopped much of the draining of our young people out of the remote parts of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>If you had a self-employed man and wife, whether shopkeepers or business people in a small way, or farmers, and they reach the age of 70 and they made an application for the old age pension, if they had a right of residence and maintenance under the deed of transfer of their property to a son or daughter or other member of the family, this was reflected in the non-contributory pension they received. If they had an income of £25 per year there was a reduction of five shillings in old money.  This was a very raw deal for people who had given a lifetime of service.  What happened was that the old people because of insecurity, fearful of being thrown out or put into an institution, retained their farm or property and would not sign it over.  Consequently, the sons and daughters could not wait until they reached the age of 50 or 60 before the farm or business was transferred. Now we have a situation, I am glad to say under this Government, where a man and wife, under a deed of transfer, can reserve for themselves <Col N="709" /> in a farm or business or other occupation, while transferring their property to their family, an income from that property of £12 per week and still qualify for the maximum old age non-contributory pension.  This is very welcome and if it had been done years ago would have obviated the movement out of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say that you can try to bring people back.  While this is a good aim it is very difficult to achieve, because once people leave it is very difficult to get them back.  In my opinion, the situation I have described was the cause of a considerable number of young people, particularly small farmers' sons and daughters, leaving rural Ireland.  I am glad even at this late hour that this matter is rectified.  Now, when even one partner reaches pensionable age, the couple are satisfied to transfer because they know they can retire with the dignity they deserve.  As a public representative, it is my experience that far more people are now inclined to sign over their property to their families much earlier than in previous times.  This is something for which great credit is due to the Government.  They reduced the pension age and eased the means test applying in such cases.  Previously people reaching 70 found that when they got the pension it was not very much good, but they can now draw a pension at 67 while still young enough to enjoy retirement.  Whatever one's occupation retirement at 65 is very commendable, so that people can enjoy a few years at the end of their days after having contributed so much to the State.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with that aspect of the budget and the previous two budgets but I am slightly concerned about another aspect of this budget in connection with social welfare.  A person becoming unemployed under a pay-related social welfare scheme will get a worthwhile benefit and this is as it should be, because the vast majority of workers would prefer to be employed rather than draw unemployment benefit or assistance.  The Irish people particularly have a sense of pride and prefer to work rather <Col N="710" /> than join the dole queue.  But when you have a situation in which a man and wife with three children qualify for unemployment assistance at the rate of £23.85 per week you are very near the danger line where some who may not have that pride I referred to and may be inclined not to work will elect to live on the £23.85.  This is a danger of which the Government should take note.  We should be trying to provide employment for as many people as possible.  While there are unemployed, there are also unemployables and that is something we should not encourage.  I do not want to be misunderstood.  We have an excellent work force in this country and if a man is unemployed through no fault of his own the benefit he can get is richly deserved but, on the other side, there is the danger to which I referred and it is something to which the Minister for Finance and the Government should give consideration in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to housing.  I heard the Minister for Local Government dealing with that subject today and he gave a detailed account of the activities of his Department over the last two years.  These details can be checked by any member of the Opposition.  I believe all the criticism of his Department is totally unjustified. When he became political head of his Department the Minister gave an undertaking that we would reach an output of 25,000 houses per year.  Some doubted if this could be achieved but I am glad to say that the figure was reached last year with 300 more in addition.  This is a worthwhile achievement because housing and employment are two most important things.  If you have people in good houses and secure jobs it is conducive to prosperity.  We in public life realise only too well that some of our people, particularly some with young families, are still living in hovels.</P>
    <P>I am a member of Cork County Council and the one committee in which I have most interest&mdash;I have been chairman of it for at least a year &mdash;is the housing committee.  One thing that is clear from the reports presented <Col N="711" /> to our county council's housing committee is the fact that the schemes submitted for sanction to the Department of Local Government have not been held up.  We have not experienced the delay in obtaining sanction for the erection of houses like we did in past years.  In former years people had to exercise pressure to obtain a house.  I do not believe that many Deputies realise how difficult it is for a family to live in a bad house, a house without sanitary facilities or running water.</P>
    <P>In this field I should like to pay tribute to the Government, and the Minister for Local Government in particular, for their housing programme. The Minister has tackled this problem in a serious way and, I believe, that within a few years we will have reached the stage where we will be able to provide a decent house for those in need.  In former years we had to tell applicants for rural cottages that they would have to wait four or five years before a proposal to erect a cottage for them was sanctioned.  It takes three years less for a person to qualify for a house now than it did under Fianna Fáil.  Under Fianna Fáil some people were as long as seven years on a housing list.  I am glad the Government are stepping up the housing programme and I hope they reach their target of 25,000 this year.</P>
    <P>Local authorities also receive grants from the Department of Local Government for road improvements.  We must continue to improve our main road network and because of increased costs more money is needed.  I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for Local Government for the work he has done in this regard.  My experience, as a member of Cork County Council, has been that he has made great strides in this sphere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan made the point that there was not much money in the budget for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance who is in charge of the Office of Public Works to carry out drainage work.  I agree with the Deputy in that regard.  I should like to see more money devoted to that activity, something which has been sadly lacking over the years.  It is <Col N="712" /> difficult to understand that while we talk of solving the problem of the small farmer and uneconomic holdings thousands of acres of land are flooded. Some of the rivers in my constituency which are choked are between No. 14 and No. 17 on the priority list.  Unless progress is stepped up these will not be reached in the next 30 or 40 years. If such rivers were cleaned the holdings adjoining them could be made economic.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about providing money for the Land Commission so that land can be acquired for division amongst small holders but the drainage of land must be tackled. It is a futile exercise acquiring land at enormous expense to solve the problem of small farmers while at the same time thousands of acres of arable land is flooded for more than nine months of the year.  A river in my area has flooded more than 20 small holdings but money cannot be found to clean that river.  The first question I asked in the Dáil following my election was if money would be provided for this work and I was informed then that the particular river was No. 13 on the priority list.  For some peculiar reason this river has been moved to No. 17.  This is crazy.  Extra money must be found for this type of work if we are sincere about solving this serious problem.</P>
    <P>People would not have an objection to paying rates on a holding that is capable of providing them with a decent living for their family.  The farmers I have spoken of have given up hope that the river which floods their land will be reached in their lifetime. This problem must be tackled with the same initiative as the housing problem and others have been tackled by this Government.  Very little progress has been made in this regard down the years.</P>
    <P>Some very welcome changes have taken place in agriculture in the past 12 months.  We had the serious problem of professional people, millers and so on, buying up land and as soon as they purchased it making application to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for every conceivable grant available.  Some people drew <Col N="713" /> grants in excess of £50,000 while the small farmer was not in a position to buy the land because he was outbid by these people.  Even if the small farmer proved successful in his efforts to buy the land he could not avail of the grants.  Under the farm modernisation scheme which is cumbersome and is causing great hardship to the farmers and the advisory service to operate these wealthy people will not qualify for grants.  It is only right that they should not be in a position to draw, at the expense of the taxpayer, enormous grants to improve newly acquired holdings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> While progress in some areas may have been slow many welcome changes have taken place over the past two years.  The Minister, Deputy Clinton&mdash;I accept that there is some criticism of him by some of the farming organisations&mdash;has proved himself to be a hard working and dedicated Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the best to have ever graced that office.  I feel sure that everybody agrees with that statement.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why the necessary information regarding a person (name supplied) in County Meath has not been sent to the British Ministry of Health and Social Security in accordance with the letter of the 27th November, 1974 which was issued by his Department; and the reason for the delay in dealing with this case.</P>

      <P>It is not clear what information the Deputy is referring to in his question.  The position in this case is that all information available at the time regarding the Irish insurance record of the person concerned was supplied by my Department to the British authorities on 28th November, 1974, with the request that his pension entitlement be determined on the basis of his available insurance record.  As I indicated to the Deputy, however, on that date, in reply to his previous question, investigations were continuing to establish an earlier Irish insurance record in respect of employment the person concerned claimed to have had prior to 1953.  As a result of additional information obtained from him, a pre-1953 record in respect of him under another insurance number was traced on 2nd January, 1975.  Details of this record were transmitted to the British authorities on the following day.  They were requested at the same time to re-examine his pension entitlement in the light of this additional insurance.  It has been confirmed that the information has been received by the British authorities and that they are re-examining his pension position.</P>

    <P>* Actual threshold increase as from 1st January, 1975.</P>
    <P>The 2nd phase increase for Cork County Council road workers applied as from 1st July, 1974 because of a local agreement made in 1970.</P>
    <P>The variation in the increases shown for Kildare County Council is due to the termination of a &ldquo;house agreement&rdquo; with the unions (on the recommendation of the Employer-Labour Conference).  As a result roadworkers' wages in Kildare now attract National Agreement increases simultaneously with, and on the same basis as, those in County Councils generally. Under the local agreement the increase of £2.55 was payable from 1/7/74 while that of £0.75 was payable from 1/12/74.</P>

      <P>Representations have been made to the British in the strongest possible terms regarding the situation in the Kiltyclogher area, and the matter has been raised and pursued vigorously at meetings in Dublin, London and Belfast.  The British authorities have not accepted our view that there are compelling social reasons for ensuring adequate access between Kiltyclogher and County Fermanagh and have up to now agreed only to provide a foot bridge. This has been in place since 20th December.  I will continue to press for a satisfactory solution to the problem.</P>
