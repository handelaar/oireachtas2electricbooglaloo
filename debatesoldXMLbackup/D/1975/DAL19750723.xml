      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Finance is engaged in the Seanad I am moving the Bill on his behalf.  The purpose of the Bill is to give statutory effect to the taxation proposals in regard to value-added tax reliefs and the income tax surcharge which were the subject of financial resolutions passed on 26th June, 1975.  These were part of the Government's package of measures aimed at reducing the CPI and stimulating employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 relates to the 10 per cent surcharge.  It provides that for 1975-76 the rates of income taxation of 35 per cent and upwards shall each be increased by 10 per cent in the case of tax payable by individuals.  To ensure that the surcharge will not put employment in jeopardy, companies will not be affected by it.  Section 1 also <Col N="170" /> provides for certain consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>The 26 per cent rate which applies to the first £1,550 of taxable income&mdash; that is, gross income less personal allowances and reliefs&mdash;is not being altered.  Only the 35 per cent rate and higher rates will be increased by the 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>This term &ldquo;taxable income&rdquo; is a technical term which is readily understood by the Revenue Commissioners, tax inspectors, tax consultants and accountants.  It is somewhat confusing for the ordinary man in the street. I want to emphasise therefore that the £1,550 to which the 26 per cent rate applies is reckoned after the taxpayer has already been allowed whatever personal allowance and other reliefs he is entitled to.  It is, I think, worth mentioning here that the new tax liability for 1975-76 will be less than that for 1974-75 for most taxpayers both married and single.  The surcharge will operate in such a way as will ensure that account will be taken of personal and family circumstances of each taxpayer.  It might be of assistance were I now to give some examples.</P>
    <P>Where income is £2,500 the surcharge will levy in a year £13.12 on a single person, £1.05 on a married person with no child, and nothing on a married person with dependent children. The surcharge on income of £3,000 will add annually £30.62 to the tax bill of a single person, £18.55 to a married person without children and nothing to a married person with three dependent children.  An income of £5,000 will as a consequence of the surcharge impose £101.37 on a single person, £88.55 on a married person with no child and £64.40 on a married person with three children.</P>
    <P>The additional £8 million in 1975 that the temporary 10 per cent surcharge on upper level incomes will produce will be expended by the Government in part payment of the cost of subsidies on butter, bread, milk, transport and fuel and in part compensation for the revenue foregone by the abolition of VAT on <Col N="171" /> clothing, footwear and fuels.  To that extent the net impact of the cost on individuals will be significantly lessened.</P>
    <P>Section 2 together with the Schedule to the Bill provides for the application with effect from 1st July last of the zero-rate of value-added tax to personal clothing, footwear, certain clothing materials and footwear materials and to electricity and fuels generally, other than oil used in road vehicles.  The effect of the changes is to relieve completely these commodities from value-added tax.</P>
    <P>Section 3 and 4 of the Bill are of a routine nature.  Section 3 is the usual care and management provision, and Section 4 provides for the short title, construction and commencement of the Act.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to return again to the simple truth that taxation is necessary to meet Government expenditures.  There may be argument about whether it is better to tax income, expenditure or capital or the rates to be applied in these categories. But it is hard to attack taxes on nonessentials. The &ldquo;old reliables&rdquo; for taxation purposes, drink and tobacco or cigarettes, may not be exactly described as luxuries but no reasonable person would argue that they are essential.  If taxes have to be imposed, and they must be to cover the cost of necessary expenditures including all public service incomes and social welfare payments, it is obviously preferable that taxes should be imposed on non-essentials rather than on basic necessities such as food.</P>
    <P>Most people would say too, that they would prefer increased taxation of nonessentials to increased in income taxation. In fact that is precisely what was told to the Minister for Finance by the various interests and delegations who made representations to him before the budget of last January.  In response to their wishes and to public opinion the bulk of the necessary new taxation was borne by alcohol, cigarettes and tobacco and public comment after the January budget, endorsed that policy. As non-essential goods including necessary <Col N="172" /> tax on them are taken into reckoning for consumer price index purposes, taxation added an extra 2 percentage points to the CPI.  In last autumn's White Paper <i>A National Partnership</i> the Government urged that such taxes if used to claim income increases would fuel further inflation and negative social redistribution of incomes. Because of continuing insistence on luxury items as a wage index the public service wage bill has been shoved up by £9 million.  With nearly all Government expenditures including social welfare, education, health, Army, Garda and a host of other essential services costing more, couple with a fall in revenue as a result of recession, a further increase in taxation was inevitable. In the absence of agreement to de-tax the CPI for income assessment purposes the Government are obliged, albeit reluctantly, to increase income tax rates to provide the revenue for essential expenditures.  Demanding total compensation for taxation creates a vicious circle which we cannot allow to continue if we are to bring our alarming rate of inflation under control.</P>
    <P>Experience shows that Government expenditures cannot be financed without difficulty, but financed they must be if the State is to prosper.  Individually and collectively we need to have a more honest acceptance of the obligation to pay taxes without always seeking compensation.</P>
    <P>The important feature of the supplementary budget exercise is that it is a critical step in the campaign to wind down inflation which, having started now will have to be deliberately continued until our inflation rates are at least comparable with those operating in countries where we have to sell our goods.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House for a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an emergency Bill.  Any doubts there might be to the contrary would be dispelled by reference to section 1.  A Bill which proposes to impose an additional surcharge of 10 per cent on all income tax payers with the exception of those in one band is clearly an emergency <Col N="173" /> measure.  That there is an emergency is indisputable.  The recent speeches of the Taoiseach in particular and of the Minister for Finance on occasions have been designed to bring home to our people that there is an emergency. The fact that we on this side of the House have been drawing attention in the first instance to the steps which were contributing to the creation of that emergency and subsequently to the existence of it, without response from the Government side, is well known and does not need to be gone into in any great detail.</P>
      <P>A brief recital of the main economic indicators brings home to us very forcibly that there is an emergency. For instance, there is the appallingly high rate of inflation, the virtually unprecedented unemployment for this time of year, the fall in the volume of retail sales, the apparent fall now in the volume of industrial exports&mdash;a most serious matter&mdash;the overall contraction in our economy as distinct from even holding our own, the balance of payments deficit which is at a dangerous level and is held in check only because of the downturn of the economy and, of course, there is the frightening level of borrowing that we have now reached.  According to the Minister for Finance in his recent budget statement, there was a budget deficit of £116 million in January but six months later this had more than doubled at £241 million.  All of these factors add up to a most serious emergency situation.  That being so, one can understand the necessity for the introduction of an emergency Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will not cure that emergency. In fairness to the Government they do not claim it will have any such effect, but we must concern ourselves with the steps that are necessary in order to make even some inroads on that emergency situation. One of the basic problems with which we are faced in regard to this Bill is the fact that the whole thing is based on a gamble.  Since budget day the Minister for Finance has referred on a number of occasions to the fact <Col N="174" /> that the Government might be compelled reluctantly to withdraw one part of the package if the other part is not accepted.  Should that situation arise we would be in a worse position than if the package had never been produced.  This Bill contains portion of the Government's side of the package.</P>
    <P>The Government side of the package is two edged.  Section 2 is a retrieving section in so far as it provides a zero rate of VAT for a number of commodities whereas section 1 is a charging section imposing a surcharge of 10 per cent on income tax payers.  But all of it is contingent presumably on the success or failure of the Government's gamble.  Not only are we entitled to but we have an obligation in discussing this Bill to consider the background which has produced the circumstances necessitating the introduction of this emergency measure.</P>
    <P>The major problem with which we are faced is that of inflation.  This is now acceptable on both sides of the House as incontrovertible.  That may seem a simple straightforward statement but it is only recently that this has been accepted on both sides of the House.  Up to recently the stance of the Government has been that there was nothing they could do about inflation and that our major problem was to maintain employment.  We have had pseudo-solemn declarations from the Government, from the Taoiseach and from the Minister for Finance to the effect that the Government were committed to the maintenance of employment and of the standard of living of our people.  All the time these declarations were being made unemployment was rising and the standard of living of our people falling.  While there are other factors that enter into it, there can be no doubt that, unless we conquer inflation, unemployment will worsen and the standard of living of our people will drop further.</P>
    <P>I must blame the Government for the attitude they have adopted consistently in regard to inflation since coming into office until very recently. We have heard <i>ad nauseam</i> from members of the Government about the effect of world trade difficulties on this <Col N="175" /> country, the effect of imported inflation. The whole thrust of their argument was that because of imported inflation and world trading difficulties it was impossible for this, or any other Irish Government, to do anything about it.  That argument was simply untrue.  It is now acknowledged by the Government as being untrue because they are now trying to do something about inflation, however belatedly and ineffectually.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that we, on this side of the House, pointed out to the Government that what they were doing in their budgetary stance in the past was directly fuelling inflation, firstly because of excessive budget deficits.  I say &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; in the sense of deficits which were beyond the capacity of our economy to absorb. In so far as a budget deficit is poured into our economy and does not contribute to growth, it is directly causing inflation.  We have had a succession of budget deficits from this Government which were doing precisely that.  I am not saying that the total of budget deficits of this Government were not non-productive but I am saying that great bulk of them were and, to the extent that they were not contributing to growth, they were directly fuelling inflation.  We pointed that out to them at the time and subsequently.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, the other major area in which the Government have themselves caused this problem of inflation&mdash;which is now our number one enemy&mdash;has been the attitude they have tried to put across to the public, that they could not do anything about inflation, an attitude which apparently they believed themselves for some time because their actions were consistent with that belief&mdash;the ease with which price increases were allowed in respect of services directly under their control, such as postal charges, CIE fares, television licences and so on; the manner in which the Government allowed some State bodies to by-pass the National Prices Commission, and in other cases, having <Col N="176" /> received recommendations from the National Prices Commission, rejected them and allowed increases considerably higher than those recommended by the Commission.  All of this was direct action by the Government fuelling inflation.</P>
    <P>We have urged on the Government at some length and over a considerable period that the battle against inflation requires consistent effort, resisting every inch of the way.  Of course, one has to give way in a situation of world inflation; one will be gradually retreating but, unless the Government of the day fights every inch along that way, there is no hope for us, and this Government have not been doing so.  In trying to read any coherence into their actions, as far as I can see, they believed either that they could not do anything about inflation or that it was not necessary for them to do anything about it.  It is true that, in the short term, political advantage can accrue to a government which adopts that attitude.</P>
    <P>It is true that a government can appear to be very generous and concerned about various sections of our community if they are prepared to shovel out money for this and that purpose, not caring that they cannot find the money; not caring that, in order to meet the bills thus created, they have to borrow very substantially, and very often abroad, at high interest rates, with risks, because of currency devaluation, of a substantial increase in the repayments required.  A government prepared to do that can reap short-term political advantage, and this Government have sought to do so.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of right or wrong or what is good for our economy or not, but thinking purely in party political terms, I have always believed and am now quite convinced that politics, unlike what a famous dictum says, is not a short-term business. Perhaps a lot can happen in politics in a week, but politics is a long-term business.  A government which embarks on the kind of short-term courting of popularity such as this Government have engaged in, <Col N="177" /> without regard to the longer term consequences, ultimately will pay the price for that irresponsibility and playing around with the taxpayers' money. As I have indicated, a great deal of the expenditure undertaken by this Government, and an increasing proportion of it, has been financed by borrowing, much of it foreign borrowing. Indications are that, not alone has our indebtedness as a nation increased enormously under this Government but that the nature of that indebtedness has changed also.  We have now a very high proportion of short-term borrowing which will come home to roost in a matter of two or three years on whatever government is then in power.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that kind of approach is what has brought about the emergency situation we now face. When I say that, I do not want anybody to suggest that I ignore totally or sweep aside the very real and serious difficulties in the world around us and the effects such difficulties have on us, effects which no Irish government could control.  I am not doing any such thing.  But what I am saying is this : other countries, faced with the same difficulties, with the same increase in oil prices, with the same imported world inflation, have tackled this problem and reduced their inflation rates to levels which range between a half and a quarter of ours. That is the significant thing.</P>
    <P>It is significant not only as a measure of the failure of our Government to do their duty but is also very significant for the future because if we continue with anything like our present rate of inflation, our wage rates, even if lagging behind inflation, will be way out of line with our competitors.  If that continues for any length of time there is no way in which our producers can sell their goods either on the home or the export market.  That creates the vicious cycle of firms closing down, of workers being laid off and the economy grinding down.  As it grinds down there is less and less base for the Government to raise taxation and to stimulate the economy.  So it goes <Col N="178" /> on.  I hope all of this is well known to the Government now.  It would appear from their actions it was not well known to them up to fairly recently.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the next matter I want to put to the Government, and to the Taoiseach in particular who is sitting in for the Minister for Finance. Previously I put this matter to the Minister for Finance and got what I considered to be a very unsatisfactory reply.  Perhaps the Taoiseach can give a more satisfactory one.</P>
    <P>The measures which the Government have taken, some of which are provided for in this Bill, are mainly measures which we advocated quite a long time ago and which we spelled out in great detail last September.  In January the Government introduced a budget and we urged them to take measures of this kind because at that time we were faced with an emergency situation which required emergency measures.  However, the Government did not do that; they have only done so now.  The question arises, why did the Government not take those steps at least last January? That raises very serious issues.  Did the Government know what was right and not take action?  Did they not know and, if so, why did they not know?  After all, we knew and we said so and we were prepared to go on record on the matter.</P>
    <P>I get an impression from various statements of the Minister for Finance that there has been a tendency by him and a number of his colleagues to snatch at straws, that if there is any report, particularly by an international body which suggests even remotely that there may be an upturn in the world economy on a certain date, that he snatches at that. I hope the Government have now learned to ignore this kind of straw-snatching and that they will concentrate on what they can do in our economy to control our situation, irrespective of what is happening in the world around us.  The only effect that should have is to spur us to greater efforts in regard to what we can control ourselves.</P>
    <P>There is an even greater significance <Col N="179" /> and a more serious question to answer in regard to the Government's failure in their budget last January to take the steps they have taken now, that is in relation to the national wage agreement.  The Government knew, as everybody else knew, that there was a national wage agreement to be negotiated shortly after the January budget.  We also knew that at the rate inflation was running that agreement would itself be inflationary if it merely provided for keeping pace with inflation.  We strongly urged the Government at that time to take the kind of steps they are taking now in an effort to reduce the consumer price index.  We pointed out that if the Government did that the consequence would be that the national wage agreement could be negotiated at a considerably lower level because the cost of living increase would be lower and thus a massive burden which would otherwise be imposed on business, whether manufacturing, distribution or agriculture, would be removed. In addition the burden on the Exchequer would be less because of the enormous size now of the public sector pay in the overall costs that have to be met by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Government did not take our advice.  They allowed the national wage agreement to be negotiated.  It is fair to point out that the Government produced a White Paper called <i>A National Partnership.</i> What happened in the national wage agreement was exactly what the Government had asked for in the White Paper; both the employers and trade unions paid attention to the White Paper and did what they were asked.  Having agreed to the national wage agreement with considerable difficulty, and some workers having got the first phase under that agreement, the Government now come along and ask that it be renegotiated on the basis that they are taking steps to bring about a reduction, hopefully of 4 per cent, in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>The Government must answer the following crucial question.  If this approach is right&mdash;we think it is because we advocated it a long time ago <Col N="180" />&mdash;why was it not done in January before the national wage agreement was negotiated?  Is it not clear that to call for renegotiation obviously creates many difficulties that would not have arisen if the Government had done their job in January?  Is it not obvious that this whole operation is shaking the faith of many people in national wage agreements and endangering the continuation of such agreements in the future?  I do not think we have had any satisfactory explanation from any member of the Government for their failure to take action before the national wage agreement was negotiated, which would have led to a reduction in the burden on industry, agriculture and on the Exchequer itself.  I hope that in the course of this debate the Taoiseach will indicate the reasons for the Government's failure to take action last January.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect that suggests either a great naiveté or a gross, almost unbelievable, incompetence on the part of the Government and that is putting it in very blunt terms.  If the Government had embarked on the course they took in January, they could have said to the Employer/Labour Conference : &ldquo;We will do this if you will do that&rdquo;, and worked out an agreement on that basis.  The Government are now saying: &ldquo;We have done this, will you do that&rdquo;, and threatening that if the other side do not do it, the Government will retract what they have done.</P>
    <P>There is no weaker position for a Government to be in than the one in which they are at the moment.  The whole operation smacks of either enormous naiveté or gross incompetence. All this suggests that the Government have been taking the wrong approach to the management of our economy up to recently, that they are now belatedly trying to reverse the course and are even handling that reversal in such an incompetent manner as to inspire less than confidence that they will manage even to achieve the limited objectives provided for in this Bill and as part of the package announced by the Government.</P>
    <P>The origin of much of what is in this Bill and the Government's package can be traced back to the introduction of <Col N="181" /> the green £ in the Common Market for our agricultural produce.  It will be remembered that we on this side of the House urged the Government to go for the green £ and that there was a very lengthy delay of at least six months, but nothing happened.  There were, of course, many leaks from informed sources the burden of which was that the Government were not happy at the prospect of applying for the green £ because of its effect on the consumer price index.  That was a very reasonable and natural concern.  However, we suggested that since the bulk of the products which would be affected were exported, or paid for on an export basis, the effect on the consumer price index at home was relatively limited and that it could, and should, be counteracted by certain forms of subsidy.</P>
    <P>The effect of that would have been that the consumer price index would not have been affected on the one hand and, on the other, farmers who were going through an extremely difficult time would have had their income boosted by approximately £40 million.  The Government did not take either step.  They vacillated for so long that the farmers lost this additional income and, when they finally moved, the consumer price index was allowed to rise as a direct consequence and no action was taken by way of subsidy to keep it down.  A consequence of that was rolled in directly into wage increases with a cost which far outweighed what it would have cost the Exchequer to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>Another consequence was, as I said, the failure of the Government to obtain for the farming community at that time an addition to the income of approximately £40 million.  This was reflected in our over all economic position because the farming community was going through a particularly difficult time.  The net effect was that the consumption of goods overall produced in the non-agricultural sectors of our community went down, with a consequent loss of employment and increased prices to meet increased overheads because of reduced sales and production.  The overall effect of the Government's failure <Col N="182" /> in that regard was felt not only in the agricultural sector but right across the economy.  It contributed to a considerable reduction in growth in our economy, increases in the consumer price index and consequently increases in the wage bill across the economy, not only in the private but in the public sector.</P>
    <P>The lack of approach of the Government to that problem and, when they screwed up the courage to go for the green £ their failure to deal with the consequences arising, is reflected in what has happened since.  The reason I am mentioning this matter is that it would appear that we are now about to have another change in the value of the green £.  This raises serious questions.  The Government ought today to indicate to this House and the country their attitude to this.  To the extent that the change in the value of the green £ will improve the income of the agricultural community, I do not think the Government should hesitate for a moment but go for it.</P>
    <P>Then the question arises, as it did last year, what about the consequences of that change on the consumer price index?  Will it in whole or in part wipe out the benefits of the subsidies announced by the Minister for Finance last month?  If there is a danger of that&mdash;and it would appear that there is&mdash;the Government have to make up their minds what they are going to do.  Will they allow that to happen with the consequences that flow from it, or will they provide for even further subsidies to maintain the position as it was envisaged when the Minister for Finance made his announcement?  If so, where will the money come from?</P>
    <P>The Government have the responsibility for making those decisions and taking the action necessary to implement them.  It is not enough, in my view, if the Government continue to vacillate as they did before about the green £ and slowly come around to the position they should have taken first.  I am calling on the Government to indicate today if possible&mdash;and if not today, then within a matter of days&mdash;what action they propose to take arising out of the proposed <Col N="183" /> further change in the value of the green £.</P>
    <P>The question of the package the Government announced, of which this Bill forms part, and the threat to withdraw the Government side of the package if the other part of the package is not accepted I referred to earlier, but when we consider this Bill, implementing part of the Government's side of the package, we ought to be told just what the Government's attitude is.  We ought to be told, for instance, if the subsidies announced on CIE fares and food, and so on, and the reductions in value-added tax provided for in section 2 will be withdrawn, then what will happen to section 1, the surcharge on income tax?  As far as I am concerned, I want an absolute assurance.  I want to make quite certain that we will not end up with a surcharge on income tax without the benefits announced by the Government for which the surcharge on income tax is to be a method of paying part of the cost.  If it is a package then it is a package for everybody and, if it is withdrawn, or partially withdrawn, then we should go back to square one and the income tax payer should not be left subject to a surcharge while the benefits he was supposed to get are withdrawn.  As far as we on this side of the House are concerned that is a basic position we maintain, and we will seek to ensure in the passage of this Bill that that position is safeguarded.</P>
    <P>The whole atmosphere the Government are trying to create arising out of the emergency situation we are facing is one designed to reduce expectations and demands.  I think the Government are right to do that.  The problem is that the Government themselves created excess, expectations and demands, but I am not going to go back over all that.  I am saying that I believe the atmosphere the Government are now trying to create is the correct one given the emergency situation with which we are faced. The leader of this party has indicated on behalf of this party that we believe, given the present circumstances, that <Col N="184" /> the national interest does require restraint and renegotiation of the national wage agreement.  We believe the issue involved here far transcends party politics.</P>
    <P>We believe the whole interest of the nation is tied up in the success or failure of efforts to overcome this dire emergency.  Having said that, what I said earlier in regard to how this situation has come about becomes even more serious.  Furthermore, the activities of the Government in more than doubling expenditure, both capital and current, in a period of two years have contributed to the situation we are facing and unfortunately robs the Government of a considerable amount of the moral authority they would otherwise have.  We do not want there to be any illusion about where the failure has lain but, granted that, the important thing to recall is that, whatever the causes, we are now faced with a most serious emergency, an emergency which cannot be overcome unless right across the board there is exercised a degree of restraint and discipline, which has not been evident up to now and, in particular, has not been evident from the Government.</P>
    <P>We are asking the Government now to turn over a new leaf, however belatedly, and do their part in trying to ensure that the national interest is put first, as it has not been for almost the last 2½ years.  Now that the chickens are coming home to roost we on this side of the House, who pointed out consistently what was happening, are still prepared, as we were in the past 2½ years&mdash;we did our part&mdash;to go on doing our part.  We are supporting the Government's efforts, however belated those efforts are, to tackle the problem. Consequently we hope that the passage of this Bill will contribute in some degree to the successful renegotiation of the national wage agreement, successful in the sense of its eventuating in new terms which will take account of the emergency situation we are facing and account of the best interests of the people in whatever sector of the economy they earn their living, whether as employees or employers.  We have no doubt at all that the best interests of all our people lie in a successful renegotiation of the <Col N="185" /> national wage agreement and in the package the Government have announced being implemented as far as possible.  To the extent that we as an Opposition can give our support to that aim we are giving it, conscious of the causes of the emergency we are facing and conscious also of the fact that, when the country is faced with an emergency of this kind, the major problem is how to overcome it, not who caused it.</P>

      <P>In this Bill we have an opportunity of discussing important matters affecting the economy.  For that reason one will be pardoned if one covers some of the ground covered in different ways in the past in relation to other matters.  Any worthwhile contribution to a debate like this must be calculated to help.  That is not an easy matter for the Opposition.  We may be criticised for not coming up with constructive proposals to alleviate the serious position that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the background of this whole exercise and considers what the Government are attempting to do in a small way one discovers that what they are doing is actually undoing some of the things they did in the past, things which have had a serious adverse effect on the economy. I suppose it does not do much good to keep on reminding them of this.  To those who would say we are not constructive, the record will show that on every possible occasion we did advise that the Government were taking the wrong steps.  Would it not have been nice, when the ESB crippled the people with extra VAT charge, if the Government had moved to prevent it?  Would it not have prevented a lot of damage being done and restored some confidence? The people at the time got the impression that no action was being taken to deal with the increasing charges they had to meet from day to day.  Would it not have been nice if at the time that the Government, after a five-million introductory speech, extracted several million pounds from the people in increased fuel charges, the Minister had come in and said: &ldquo;We would be supposed, at this time, to increase the price of petrol but in order to keep our charges below those <Col N="186" /> of other countries and to help industry, particularly the tourist industry, we will not increase the price of petrol&rdquo;? Would that not have saved the Government subsidising fares now?  Would it not have been nice if, in the last budget, the Government had said: &ldquo;Eventually the contributions to the national insurance fund should come entirely from the employers but now is not the time to do it.  Those people have too much of a burden to bear.  We will continue to subsidise the fund&rdquo;? In that way they would have relieved the employers of a considerable impost which at the time they were unable to meet and would have enabled them to have retained in employment many of the people they have paid off.  This would have saved the Government having to introduce a £12 employment premium at this time.  Would it not have been nice if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had said: &ldquo;I want a few million pounds to do something with the scandalous telephone service but I will take only as little as possible from the people at this time because the economy cannot afford it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which the Government have contributed to the situation, to the pall of gloom and despair that hangs over the country at this time.  If we are to be blamed for not being constructive at this stage we must point out that very little heed was taken of any suggestions we made in the past.</P>
    <P>I remember the difficulties we had in negotiating the first national wage agreement.  We were proposing legislation to insist that the demands made by the people seeking to compensate themselves for the increase in the consumer price index would not be too great.  With the assurances and the co-operation we got from the Congress of Trade Unions and others we withdrew the legislation and consequently had the first national wage agreement, which had in it a certain element of inflation but was much better than the free-for-all type of situation which preceded it.  It was the first genuine effort towards getting a grip on the relationship between what are now known as the social partners.  It was <Col N="187" /> the first serious attempt to bring about sanity in industrial relations and get the co-operation of the trade unions without which no real progress can be made in this or any other country at any time.</P>
    <P>Most of this is water under the bridge, but there is much to be learned from it now.  The Taoiseach knows these things as well as we do but he is not in a position to take the action that he knows should and must be taken at some stage because the elements of the Government of which he is the head do not accept the things which are necessary in order to dispel the gloom and overcome the recession in which the country has been plunged so deeply, particularly in the last two years.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have a programme, it is necessary to chart the way ahead.  The programmes for economic expansion were a tremendous guide for the economy generally. Sometimes the targets were surpassed, sometimes they were not reached and sometimes we were well off course, but at all times they were a guide both for the public and private sectors and for the government in particular.  There were factors beyond our control which sometimes put us off course but, by and large we have moved towards our targets reasonably satisfactorily having at all times to face the unforeseen difficulties of trade disputes and international changes in marketing and pricing.  We ensured that the effects were minimised however.  In the Department of Labour I experienced the senseless bank strike which crippled the country for a long time, the cement strike, a couple of ESB strikes.  These were crippling, senseless and ultimately proved pretty fruitless, but we learned something from them.</P>
    <P>Out of all those adversities came the first national wage agreement. Many people realised the foolishness of their efforts and found that a better course could be adopted.  We commissioned a man to report on the bank strike.  He went into the details of what it was necessary to do to restructure the machinery which supported <Col N="188" /> industrial relations in the banks.  These were trivial in comparison with the action taken at the time. The overall effect of his report was that the mountain laboured and produced a mouse.  The economy suffered seriously as a result of it, despite every possible effort we could make.</P>
    <P>I say this to emphasise the important part which organised labour has to play in bringing about a real and effective improvement in the economy of this country at present, or any country at any time.  Workers must realise that the most patriotic thing they can do is to co-operate as partners and indispensable links in the effort to improve the economy. Until everybody co-operates, we cannot say real progress is being made.  I found a situation in industrial relations where the bosses in the trade unions wanted to appear as the people who succeeded in extracting more money from the employers.  No effort was made by them to point out what the overall effect and the ultimate outcome would be.</P>
    <P>We are very quick to copy what other countries do, particularly in western Europe.  I often thought it would do us a lot of good if we studied some of the other aspects of those economies.  We should take a leaf out of the book of the Federal Republic of Germany and study the way they built up their country after the war with the absolute co-operation of every individual who was responsible for holding down a job or who worked in the services, in productive employment, driving a bus, or working at the bench in a workship, or on the assembly line in a factory, or at a desk in an office.  They took the patriotic view that they were partners in a great drive to recapture the greatness of their own country and bring it back to the prosperity they knew it was possible to achieve.</P>
    <P>That could not be done without the absolute co-operation of all the people, and particularly the workers. That co-operation was forthcoming and they did a job which is an example to the rest of the world.  We copy them and take examples from them in matters such as taxation, but <Col N="189" /> it would be no harm if we took example from them in that field.  If there is one thing more necessary than any other here today, it is the harmony and co-operation of social partners working together and realising that this is their patriotic duty and it will achieve greatness for the country.  There is no short cut.</P>
    <P>One would expect that with the unions represented in Government by people who claim to be their political leaders that spirit would have been found in greater measure in the past couple of years, but it has not.  It is the old game of seeking to demonstrate: &ldquo;We are your great protectors and but for us you would be back to where you were in 1912.  We will ensure that the affluent society will pay up.  We will extract every penny we can from it to ensure that you get all you want to compensate you for any losses you have suffered as a result of inflation or anything else.&rdquo; That is a wrong attitude and it will never get us anywhere.  Whether we are to have worker participation or a workers' democracy, until people realise we are all in this together and everybody has a part to play, the Government cannot claim that we are making any progress.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Department of Labour I thought I was getting a progressive rapport with the workers' side of the economy.  I thought it was possible to reach the stage where people would realise that the trade union movement has more to do than to continue extracting more out of the economy.  They should help the people to realise that we are all in it together and unless we all co-operate the ultimate outcome will be that there will be less for fewer instead of more for many.  I sometimes wondered whether those in comfortable employment really had much regard for those who were on the unemployment list.</P>
    <P>This is the spirit which has to be engendered.  If those who hold themselves out as being the political leaders of organised workers cannot do better than they have done in this crisis, I do not think there is much hope. Inevitably there will have to be a <Col N="190" /> change of Government.  I will not labour that because I would be accused of making no contribution to a serious situation.  This is a serious situation and it is difficult to see what the approach to it will be.  One of the things which has to be done, and it will not be done by pretence or political propaganda, is to restore confidence and give the people the true picture of what is happening and of what the position really is.</P>
    <P>There is not much good in somebody saying that next year will be a great year.  That has been said without any reason.  Last spring the Minister for Finance said there would be a great upturn in autumn and that we were over the worst of our difficulty. He had no reason in the world for saying that.  Now we are told it is next year, and next year we will probably be told it will be the year after. Whether there is to be an improvement next year or the year after, the way matters are being handled now will leave a permanent scar on the economy.</P>
    <P>We know the number of concerns which got into difficulties and contributed to the unemployment figures. We are aware of the number of firms which had to close down and pay off workers as a result of the policy pursued by the Government.  We do not know the number of people who might have been investing in the economy if things had been better handled.  That is an imponderable.  That must be happening at present.</P>
    <P>I thought this whole exercise sounded ridiculous.  We heard boasts about a new set of taxes being brought in but it is being done at a time when confidence is badly needed in productive industries.  It must have been ironical for those who were struggling with liquidity problems and trying to carry on under adverse circumstances to find that this House was engaged daily in producing new taxes directed at those who were accused of being responsible for the affluent society.  If we can continue to have an affluent society all other things can fall into place.  It is when we have not got it that we are in trouble.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> Nobody knows where we are going from here.  In this legislation we are engaged in an exercise, to use a new phrase, to de-tax the CPI.  It is a terrible admission, and I do not want to rub it in, but we were frequently told that inflation was due to factors beyond our control, that nothing could be done about it but now we are back-pedalling and taking action to undo what was done.  The Taoiseach said the important feature of a supplementary budget exercise was that it was a critical step in the campaign to wind down inflation which having started now will have to be deliberately continued until our inflation rates are at least comparable with those operating in countries where we have to sell our goods.  It is a bit late in the day for that statement. I wish the Minister for Industry and Commerce made that statement in the House two years ago. Had he done so we would be in a different position today; we would not have the same gloom, despair and uncertainty that is threatening to cripple the economy and is preventing people from planning for the future.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to revamp the story of gloom heard at every street corner, but there is no use putting our heads in the sand.  We must accept what the position is, face up to it and try to do the best we can about it.  The economy is suffering a permanent scar which will be difficult to eradicate.  When we were advocating support for membership of the EEC we had the full co-operation of Fine Gael.  We were seeking to confound the arguments against membership, that it was a loss of sovereignty and that our Government would be irrelevant in the EEC.  We were arguing against the view put forward by the Labour Party, and the other minorities who supported them, that we would be governed entirely by factors outside our control.</P>
    <P>I believed our membership would not seriously affect our sovereignty, but the events of the last two years appear to give credence to what was <Col N="192" /> advocated by those opposed to our membership of the EEC.  They said that our Government could do nothing, that we would be completely in the hands of Brussels and we would be buffetted around like a cork on the European wave.  That is nonsense.  We are our own Government, and a Government which takes money from the people for the running of the country must have a strong whip hand to direct the course of events of our economy. They cannot opt out of a responsibility which must be theirs. Since they have so much fiscal and monetary control and are taking such a huge percentage of the people's wealth they cannot get away from these problems by saying that there is nothing they can do about it, it is beyond their control and the rest of the world is suffering for the same thing.</P>
    <P>If we were in power since the last election prices would have gone up and there would have been some unemployment but it would not have been half as bad as it is.  We would still be blamed for not taking the proper action but the uncertainty would not have been there and confidence would still be strong.  These are important points.  The day-to-day effort of political cosmetics is not a substitute for a long term study of policy.  I am involved in the coordination of the efforts to up-date Fianna Fáil policy and at intervals we issue discussion documents to inform people obout the policies.  I shall try to insist that the policies will be realistic, that they will be capable of attainment within the resources available to support them and that they will be long term ones that will ensure that this country will not merely resume the movement towards expansion but that we will, in the shortest possible time, reach the desired goal of full employment.</P>
    <P>In doing that we will not be relegating in any way to a secondary position the important part of the cultural and social side of the programme.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that if we are to make a reasonable contribution to this important debate it is necessary, if we are to give the people some hope for the future, that we should give an assurance to the people that might help to dispel some of the gloom.  It is important that we should assure the people that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
      <P>The affluent society was the target of attack when we were in Government by the then Opposition.  There was a feeling that if there were signs of a few pounds extra as a result of a growing economy machinery should be devised quickly in order to rake it off.  That is the exercise that is taking place now instead of the cooperative spirit needed to get everybody working together in order to create all the wealth possible and to ensure that everybody gets an equitable share of the wealth.  That is a simple policy.  To do that it is necessary to ensure that any international happenings likely to affect expansion here would be offset or counteracted by some measures by the Government. It is necessary to ensure that measures taken by the Government do not endanger the progress of those involved in giving employment and creating the expansion we enjoyed for so long because of an increase in exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to go over the field again, but it is axiomatic that this country cannot expand its economy without expanding its exports.  To use the overworked term, the Government have done very little to monitor the economy in relation to unit costs in production and to ensure that exports would continue increasing at the pace at which they have been increasing.  It is not sufficient to say <Col N="194" /> that the markets failed because of conditions in other countries.  What happened was that we became less competitive, that we have now reached the stage where we are unable to compete because of unit costs in production rising faster here than in any other country.  This has happened at a time when we are moving towards free trade.</P>
    <P>The NPC have been doing a reasonably good job.  They have been found to be the best vehicle by which the Government can monitor prices, but the time has come when the Commission's function should be less circumscribed, when they should be allowed speak out without fearing that in any way they might be offending the higher dictates of the present political propaganda effort which is fostered and maintained daily.  I do not think anybody is foolish enough to pay any attention to the preamble to each issue of the NPC report which indicates the amount of money saved to the economy by reason of the increases allowed being less than those sought.  Everybody knows that since the whole mechanism of price increases has got out of hand the usual procedure for any concern in approaching the NPC is to ask for, say, a 15 per cent increase in the hope of being granted an increase of 7½ per cent.</P>
    <P>It is easy to make a case for increased prices, and it must be difficult for the NPC to take any effective action at a time when the Government are the greatest offenders in regard to increasing prices.  One must ask where we go from here.  Will the action being taken have any effect? Will the Government be successful in the gamble they have taken?  This package is dependent on the action of people outside this House.  It is a belated effort but, to a large extent, it is putting the cart before the horse. The time at which the Government should have acted was when the Employer-Labour Conference were working on the national wage agreement. Instead of applying this remedial action months later, the Government should have been working at the time of that conference.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> The action they are taking now is dependent on the co-operation of other people who have become an indispensable cog in our whole economic set up.</P>
    <P>If we in Fianna Fáil were to be guilty of that serious omission there are some who might say of us that we had not the proper contacts with the organised labour force, but the omission has occurred at a time when the supposed political leaders of the trade union movement are operating in Government.  These are people who must be conscious of the necessity of taking effective measures to deal with the situation.  They should move now, that is if it is not too late to do so.  However, if they can take action, difficult though it may be at this stage, they will be making some worthwhile contribution to the future but I doubt seriously that they have the will to move.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's speech in relation to this very important matter was short.  It was a <i>mea culpa</i> sort of speech which said: &ldquo;We told you in the past that these things could not be done but now we are trying to do them and we hope to get the co-operation that is necessary although we do not know whether such co-operation will be forthcoming.&rdquo;  We are asked to be constructive.  We have been constructive in the past as the record will show.  For instance, at the time of the introduction of the green £ we suggested that to offset the effect on the CPI subsidies be introduced. If we are to have progress it can only be brought about by the proper approach of the social partners&mdash; everyone realising that he has not merely a duty but a real patriotic duty to help lift up this country from the situation in which it now is.  We must have co-operation right along the line with everybody working to help the country rather than to be endeavouring to get from it what is not there. We must not continue to create debt, the repayment of which is more than the country will soon be earning, if we cannot do something that will change seriously the present trend in the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the supplementary budget measures and the other recent measures may help our economy, they have the support of this side of the House.  However, I do not believe the measures the Government are taking are the kind of measures that will meet the present situation, speaking on the measures before us and the desirable things said in this speech in relation to the necessity to wind down inflation particularly</P>
      <P>until our inflation rates are at least comparable with those operating in countries where we have to sell our goods.</P>
      <P>There are many such phrases with which I am entirely in accord.  In speaking on the measures involved anybody in Opposition must be expected to be as critical&mdash;not party-political criticism&mdash;as one believes the present situation warrants.</P>
      <P>In the initial part of the speech it is said:</P>
      <P>It is, I think, worth mentioning here that the new tax liability for 1975-76 will be less than that for 1974-75 for most taxpayers both married and single.  The surcharge will operate in such a way as will ensure that account will be taken of personal and family circumstances of each taxpayer.</P>
      <P>That is to say that the measure, in relation to taxation, is framed in such a way as to apply to the least number of people.  It is as if the Government were saying: we would like to tax people in a way which would appear to be politically equitable and try to exclude as many as possible so that what we are doing will affect the smallest number only and, in that way, we will not be unpopular.  Of course that is quite true if the object of the Government is merely to engage in a popularity contest but has nothing to do with the fulfilment of their real responsibility to the economy and the welfare of our people in general.</P>
      <P>Further on in the speech it is said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If taxes have to be imposed, and they must be, to cover the cost of necessary expenditure including all <Col N="197" /> public service incomes and social welfare payments,...</P>
    <P>That is quite true but is not what is happening at present.  A substantial amount of current State expenditure is being met out of borrowings.  In that sense what is said is the right expression but what is being done is not in accordance with the ideal expression of how State expenditure should be met.</P>
    <P>The first section of the Bill makes changes in the tax rates.  It is worth setting out what will be the new rates and how they will compare with other, relatively more successful and prosperous countries.  The new rate of income tax here, over and above the income allowance to an individual whether he or she be married or single, will commence with a tax which is not changed from the previous rate of 26 per cent on the first £1,550.  The next £2,800 of income will be taxed at 38.5 per cent and the next £2,000 at 49.5 per cent. The following £2,000 will be taxed at 60.5 per cent and the final £2,000 at 71.5 per cent.  Over and above that rate of income the tax level will be 77 per cent, which is reached in or around a figure of £12,000 earnings per annum, depending on the personal allowances of the individual concerned.  In effect it is a 10 per cent increase, from the previous 70 per cent to 77 per cent.</P>
    <P>This increase in taxation is in addition to the Minister's gift package of wealth tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax.  It is worth making some comparison between our taxable situation and that of some countries to which the Minister for Finance referred in debates over the past few weeks.  As I have said, the highest taxable rate here is now 77 per cent above an income of approximately £12,000 per annum. In West Germany the maximum taxable rate in 59 per cent, as I understand at present, but that is not imposed until the income has exceeded £38,900.  In Holland the rate is somewhat higher, almost level with ours, at 71 per cent but that is not reached until the income exceeds £22,600 per annum.  In Belgium <Col N="198" /> the rate is 70 per cent at the top but that is not reached until an individual earns in excess of £44,000 per annum.  In Luxembourg, a much smaller unit, the taxable level is 57 per cent and is somewhat nearer ours, being imposed on earnings of £14,200 per annum.  Therefore, not alone are we from 7 per cent to 18 per cent above those countries in ordinary income tax but those earning high salaries in Europe are allowed from £2,200 to £32,700 per annum more than their counterparts here before they reach the maximum levels of taxation.</P>
    <P>From the enterprise point of view that means that a person can earn from twice to almost four times as much in countries such as Germany, Holland and Belgium before reaching the maximum taxable level.  In all cases the percentage level is well below that of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The circumstances of our economy are different from most of these countries.  The point that needs to be made in relation to taxation is to see what effect the taxing system has on enterprise in an economy like ours which has not reached the stage of development of most of the European countries mentioned.  If these tax rates are taken with the additional package of taxation recently introduced, as well as major over-expenditure here and borrowing from abroad, it is obvious that these developments have helped to reduce our economy to its present level.  It is the state of the economy that has led to the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>We do not object to a fair capital gains tax, particularly one that captures the exploiter, the get-rich-quick merchant.  There is not likely to be much objection to a reasonable gift or inheritance tax.  When one considers the high levels of ordinary income tax one wonders what the Government are thinking about in economic terms.  If the rates of taxes and the legislation introduced in the last few years are driving capital out of the country&mdash;I am assured this has happened&mdash;it is little wonder that for the first time in the last few years the larger part of State borrowing for <Col N="199" /> capital purposes, and recently for a good deal of current expenditure, has had to be obtained from abroad.  It is not possible to have a successful economy or to have expansion in employment if government policy is directed towards discouraging enterprise. That is the impression that has been created, it is the feeling people have, quite apart from the serious situation arising from very rapid inflation which creates other problems for people engaged in enterprise.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the removal of VAT from fuel, food, shoes, clothing and some textile items.  The VAT rates now being removed were increased by the government two years ago but the tax on the items mentioned should never have been increased. When it was done the Opposition warned against the increases and we spoke of the inflationary results.  The warnings were not given purely from a political point of view but from people who had some experience of the effects of different measures of taxation on the cost of goods.  For example, it is not possible to impose a higher rate of VAT, which up to a few days ago was 6.75 per cent, on energy and fuel without it having a significant effect on the cost of the production of goods.  Those who have had to deal with fairly substantial ESB bills will know what I am talking about.  It is not possible to have additional costs in these areas without transferring them in one way or another to the cost of production of goods.  If a government tinkers with that area of the economy they are asking for trouble.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the inflationary cycle into which we have moved in the last two years was, to a considerable extent, primed by Government policy in relation to taxation, spending and borrowing.  One could talk about the effects of our current borrowing problem almost indefinitely.  Deputy Colley was quite right in what he said earlier.  The Government are engaged in a major gamble in their fiscal policy in relation to borrowing.  The rate of borrowing at home from the banks <Col N="200" /> has increased almost astronomically, from about 28 per cent to 44 per cent, and the rate for overseas borowing has increased almost to the same extent. We are reaching a stage where short-term borrowing has become the norm and the cost of that borrowing has increased by as much as 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>No economy of our size can afford to borrow at the present rate and survive, nor do we have much hope of holding our present markets with our current level of inflation.  Even though I do not really believe the measures the Government have taken are adequite, I am glad to find the reference at the end of this speech to the effect inflation has on our ability to sell goods.</P>
    <P>If the Government were to undertake the necessary measures which would call for significant sacrifices from the public, I would applaud them.  It sounds like lecturing to go into the fundamentals of what we are dealing with at present in relation to our economy, but the foundation of economic success lies in the efficient production of goods at the right price.  We cannot hope to sell goods in the markets referred to in the speech unless we can produce them at a price which will ensure that they will be bought.  In the western world, there is no alternative to efficient competition in prices.  In this country our primary means of production are in agriculture and industry.  They are our only real wealth and we depend on them.  The price of goods produced in these areas depends on the cost of production, including service charges&mdash;heating, energy, wages and so on.</P>
    <P>Our economy is in dire straits because the Government have failed to provide an economic policy which would ensure the production of goods at competitive prices.  As I said, farming and industry are our only real wealth and all other forms of activity &mdash;State or social services, hospitals, transport, banks, insurance companies, office blocks, retail and wholesale outlets&mdash;are merely secondary units depending on the ability of the primary producers to provide goods at efficient prices.  At present the cost of wages has risen beyond the capacity of industry <Col N="201" /> to be successful.  It has not been driven up by the farm or factory workers, but by the secondary services, including State services, Salaries and wages have been allowed to increase far beyond the capacity of the economy to maintain competitiveness.</P>
    <P>In an ordinary enterprise if costs begin to escalate, a point is reached where the company has to say: &ldquo;Stop, we are not making enough to pay the increased demands sought.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance should ask themselves who says on behalf of the taxpayer, that the time has come to stop, that we cannot borrow from banks, particularly overseas financial institutions, to balance a situation which, in itself is not sound.  As the largest single employer and spender, the Government are responsible for the present situation. Over the past year, despite warnings from the Central Bank, other institutions and the Opposition, the Government have persisted with the policy of spending, borrowing, taxing and as a result, we now find ourselves in the most serious economic danger since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>This Bill is merely the last item, following on this year's first budget and previous budgets, of borrowing a few million pounds more to subsidise foods, impose tax and reduce value-added tax in some areas in order to bring about what appears to be an artificial reduction in the official index and is merely a political performance calculated to delay the day of reckoning.</P>
    <P>We have a serious balance of payments deficit this year which has been modified somewhat in the first six months.  When studying the returns, I found there was a drop of approximately £100 million in the first five months of this year.  I believe this drop is the result of lack of demand on the Irish market.  This would, of course, occur because of the increases in many areas.  Nevertheless a balance of payments situation over the past two years has been allowed to deteriorate too far. Our borrowing policy&mdash;something which did not exist so far as overseas borrowing was concerned, up to three years ago&mdash;is reaching a point where we may consider ourselves fortunate <Col N="202" /> if, next year, we can meet our capital budget.  At present our current expenditure deficit, according to recent estimates, is in the region of £240 million to £250 million.  It looks as if we will probably have overspent approximately £280 million or more by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for State expenditure does not lie with the Departments of State, the civil service or the many substantial semi-State bodies.  They must obey the Government who are in charge because the responsibility in the very large area of expenditure where State and semi-State groups are concerned lies on the shoulders of the Government, the politicians in power.</P>
    <P>During earlier times&mdash;I am harping back now to something I said earlier &mdash;when there were difficulties people were prepared, when called upon, to make sacrifices.  Today we are facing a serious economic situation, forced upon us by the world situation and also forced upon us by ourselves because we have a Government which so far has not had the courage to introduce a greater efficiency into the expenditure area or to call for a reduction in what can be described as selfish spending, a habit that has developed in our community right from the top. People generally cannot be expected to do something when they have not before them an example from the top. The question is what can industry do to compete with wage and salary increases ranging from 22 per cent to 25 per cent already committed to in the public sector.  How can industry survive and how can the jobs of workers be maintained when our prices are escalating in those very markets upon which employment depends, those markets in which inflation rates are well below ours and, in some countries, are being reduced?  The key to economic survival in a small country like ours is based on competent political leadership which puts the economic interests of the people before political popularity.  The aim of responsible political leadership should be a reduction in the rate of inflation below that of competing economics.  It is for the Government to give that lead.  If they do not do so then this Coalition will leave behind it the same bad memory <Col N="203" /> that previous Coalitions left behind them.  The people will have to decide the issue we are debating here today as soon as they get the opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition are completely overlooking the reasons for this Bill.  There has been a good deal of discussion of the 10 per cent surcharge on income tax and the reasons for it. Right throughout the last 12 months the Members opposite have had several motions, all demanding more money for this, that and the other&mdash;more money for housing, more money for education, more money for social welfare, more money for the Army, for security and so on.  It has always been a question of more money.  In order to pay for all these things the necessary finances have to be raised.  They can be raised either by borrowing or through taxation.  No matter where or how one gets the money somebody has to pay and the Opposition are being less than honest when they criticise this Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The last speaker talked about our taxing the upper income groups and leaving the lower income groups free for, he said, political reasons and political expendiency.  Those in the lower income group are those who are hardest hit by rising prices.  The intention is to renegotiate the national wage agreement.  The removal of value-added tax from foodstuffs, clothing and certain types of fuel in order to bring down the consumer price index is very important.  It is a clear indication that the Government are not using and do not intend to use the heavy hand but rather to use negotiation and provide incentives.  Incentives are normally responded to and, in the interests of industrial peace, this is the way we should operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Government, we have always been concerned about negotiation, always prepared to talk and always prepared to come to the conference table.  That is how a good Government should operate.  The Opposition are missing the point in regard to this Finance Bill.  The argument has been advanced that employment is contracting.  The premium employment <Col N="204" /> benefit will ensure the maintenance of jobs and the creation of new jobs when the upturn comes.  When it does come industry will be properly geared for the upturn.  More money is being made available for industrial training, showing the confidence we have in industry by ensuring we will have the trained personnel for industry in the future.  It is essential that we should have a pool of trained industrial labour.  That is what we are doing here.</P>
    <P>More money is being put into housing.  The Government are making £10 million available and the banks are putting up £40 million over the next two years.  More money is being invested in the building societies contrary to what some Members on the opposite side say about money flowing out of the country.  This is mischievous and dangerous talk, and anyone with any sense of loyality would not engage in that kind of activity.</P>
    <P>The capital gains tax was mentioned. Members opposite dragged their feet on this when it was being discussed.  One got the impression that they were actually against it.</P>
    <P>Their opposition to the wealth tax is known.  We had all the scaremongering. I would describe these measures as mild social reforms.  They highlight the difference between the Government and the Opposition in regard to concern for a proper redistribution of wealth.  The Opposition have not faced up to the fact that we have major economic problems and while some stem from internal inflation many of them are due to external factors.  Problems still exist in the highly industrialised countries of Europe&mdash;Germany, France, Italy and England.  Those countries have always been far better off than we have in terms of productivity and of wealth and they are feeling the pinch.  Because of that they are not importing in the same quantities as they might be and this is affecting our exports.  However, the signs are that this is changing and later in the year and coming into next year there should be a significant upturn.  The steps the Government have taken in this budget will <Col N="205" /> ensure that they will be ready to meet the challenge of increasing our exports.</P>
    <P>At the rate inflation is running something had to be done.  In a situation of high inflation the people hardest hit are those in the lower income groups.  This Government have cushioned that effect in every way.  We must now ensure that inflation is curbed.  The removal of VAT will make a significant impact in that regard.  This must be coupled with restraint from all sides of the economy to ensure that we as a nation get back into a competitive situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> our competitors in Europe.  We are in the Common Market and they do not owe us a living.  We must go out and earn it and that is how it should be. We must gear ourselves and we must invest.  The Government have taken this into account in this budget and are getting the ship straight and on course again.</P>
    <P>We must look at ways and means of increasing our productivity.  There is nothing wrong with high-rate economies if they are geared to high productivity but the idea of watching the CPI and then making claims without any thought of raising our rate of production gets us into trouble.  We have a low productivity rate as compared with our partners in Europe.  The Government, in time, will have to look at the whole trade union movement and the employer side because we cannot stand the strain of competition.  What we are doing now is a step towards reducing inflation but it is not a cure. The cure is within ourselves.  Are we prepared to work harder, to put more into it, to get more out of it?  If we are prepared to come to terms with the hard reality of life we can weather any storm because we are an emerging industrial nation with a bright future. We can only reap the highest benefits from it if the Government, the employers, the trade union movement and the farming organisations come to terms with the problems, discuss them and take whatever remedial action is necessary in the short term and in the long term ensure that we adapt ourselves in agriculture and industry to meet the challenge.  We can meet it. <Col N="206" /> We have the backbone, the ability and the will.  I believe we are now getting down to it and with offshore oil and gas, our new-found mineral wealth, and the way the Government have handled the negotiations in regard to these, the prospects are bright.</P>
    <P>As a nation we must examine our conscience and work with the Government. I would appeal to the trade union groups to think, because inflation does not make for more jobs, it makes for fewer jobs.  Anything that can be done to curb inflation will ensure a growth in exports, a growth in employment and a general upsurge in prosperity. We all have a lot to do because a Government can only do so much.  A Government can give a lead.  The lead is in this document.  Now the people must think whether they want to grasp all they can and let the less well-off go to the wall and some of those who are grabbing will ultimately go to the wall because we will not be able to afford the type of settlements that some people are demanding.  We must look at ourselves and ensure that we take the right course at this time.  The Irish people have always had the good sense to take the right course of action.  If we do that we are heading for a prosperous future under the leadership of our Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important occasion.  Indeed, one might call it a critical occasion.  It is not our desire on this side of the House to try to score points on the Government although it would be quite easy to do that.  Because of the crisis facing the country we have a solemn duty to expose the Government's faulty handling of the situation this year in particular.  In January, when the Minister for Finance introduced what we used to think was an annual budget, he said it was a holding operation.  Since we had the second budget, we know the holding operation was not very successful.  It did not hold very much.  It does not hold any hope now.  It did not hold back an increase in unemployment, or the rate of inflation, or the rise in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy to say outside influences are the main cause of these problems, but it is not good enough that we <Col N="207" /> should be evasive about what is facing us in the hope that things will get better in two or three years' time. This morning the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>This term &ldquo;taxable income&rdquo; is a technical term which is readily understood by the Revenue Commissioners, tax inspectors, tax consultants and accountants.  It is somewhat confusing for the ordinary man in the street.</P>
    <P>That sums up the Government's policy. It is somewhat confusing for the ordinary man in the street.  When the national pay agreement was being discussed, the trade union leaders and the employers had a tough time in getting the principle accepted.  The Government sat back and refused to take any part in that debate.  Eventually agreement was reached and, as matters deteriorated, the Government brought in a second budget holding out certain carrots and laying down certain conditions. The carrots will be available only if the trade unions decide to cut back on the agreement reached.  This was a breach of faith with both sides of industry who negotiated the agreement.</P>
    <P>I realise how much worse the economic situation has become since the agreement was drawn up.  I blame the Government for that.  I blame them for their attitude towards the agreement and for the confusion which now exists.  Have the subsidies promised in the budget been implemented?  They were conditional on the trade unions doing certain things.  Where do we stand with regard to the last budget? If the trade unions do not fully agree with the Government, when will the subsidies be withdrawn if they have been implemented?  Whoever is replying on behalf of the Government should clear the air and tell us where we stand.</P>
    <P>Will the Government guarantee that if the trade unions and the employers revise the wage agreement there will not be a further call for further cutbacks later this year?  Can we get the Government to decide on some definite policy with definite <Col N="208" /> targets and some hope or promise that they can be achieved?  Are we to go on drifting into further economic chaos which must result unless proper and adequate measures are taken to improve the lot of the people?</P>
    <P>While it is true that many of the influences which are affecting us badly are imported, the Taoiseach said they do not account totally for the position. We can do many things to achieve well-ordered progress on a well-compassed course towards prosperity, or even to maintain our standard of living. We are becoming more uncompetitive as the economic blitz persists.  I can give two examples.  A large firm in Dublin lost 20 per cent of their staff through redundancies.  They manufacture an article which is also widely manufactured in the United Kingdom. Things are not going all that well over there either, but that industry is now flooding our home market with their products because they can sell them cheaper than the home manufacturer can.</P>
    <P>Manufacturers on the far side of the Irish Sea will be seeking to take more and more of our home market. Are we gearing our industry to withstand the new challenge from the United Kingdom, which is not exactly a model of progress?  Industrialists there are able to make themselves a little more competitive than we are, and they are trying very hard to take more of our market from our home manufacturers.  I have spoken to manufacturers in this city and I am convinced that both the management and the workers in this case are doing their very best to meet the new challenge but, because of a crazy system of taxation, they are finding it very difficult to overcome it.</P>
    <P>The other example is that of a large concern with branches in Dublin and Cork.  Recently they were faced with the problem of a great number of redundancies.  They had discussions with the workers.  They were able to prove that an American concern were able to produce the finished product at a little above the cost of the raw material for the Irish firm.  How can any concern compete in those conditions? This is what I have in mind <Col N="209" /> when I say the Government are not coming clean on their policy towards industry.  We are becoming more and more uncompetitive.  Now there is a great onslaught on the home market because some of the ailing industrial concerns in Great Britain in sheer desperation are cutting back their costs and seeking to take more and more of our home market.  Our home market is not all that big.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have been telling the Government that their approach to many of our major problems is wrong especially in regard to taxation and the relationship between the Government and industry.  Unless at this eleventh hour the Government are more imaginative in their thinking and produce a progressive policy such as other EEC countries have done and have proved so successful in their battle against inflation, we face a serious situation.  None of the other EEC countries have the rate of unemployment or inflation we have.  I suggest that we send officials to those countries to study the measures adopted there.  It is possible that we could then see where the weakness is in our industrial and economic makeup to such an extent that we cannot hold on to the home market.</P>
    <P>I agree that our exports this year increased but in recent months a change for the worse has taken place. Unless the Government produce an imaginative policy to put Irish industry in a position to meet the challenge of outside competition the deteriorating situation will continue.  We have achieved great success in industrial development and with proper Government guidance and help we could continue to develop the industrial arm of our economy&mdash;I include agriculture in that.  However, the Government in their taxation policies this year have done nothing to help the industrial sector to make any progress.  The time of this House has been taken up on financial measures which in the long run will prove a waste of time.</P>
    <P>The Government should consider giving those engaged in industry hope for the future by devising a scheme such as one for long-term credits.  The Government should point out to the <Col N="210" /> people that in this hour of trouble and trial we must be more competitive in selling our goods abroad and on the home market.  They must tell the people that while they realise that sacrifices are called for now they do not think the lower paid section of the community must continue to make these sacrifices.  The unions have been criticised for their attitude in the present negotiations, but we must realise that they represent people who have little margin between themselves and want.  Those working in manufacturing industry, salary and wage earners, should be given a guarantee that if they agree to the Government's proposals when the upturn in the economy comes and the much promised bonanza arrives they will share in the new wealth we hope will accrue from the discovery and development of commodities like oil and natural gas.</P>
    <P>It is not too much to ask for this new social pattern.  It is not too much to ask that the pattern will not be the same as this year whereby the national wage agreement which was freely concluded between employer and employee will be suddenly cast into doubt by inept handling of the economy by the Government.  When the Government are talking to the trade unions and employers they should tell them if they have a new blue print which will ensure that all people will share in the new wealth promised as a result of the development of the resources off our shores. People will no longer accept a stop-go type of economy.  At one time people are being told that things are going well but at the same time we have more than 100,000 unemployed, a rising cost of living and galloping inflation.</P>
    <P>It is within the wit of any democratic Government to ensure that we have a better order of economy for the future under a free enterprise system as exists in the other EEC countries.  The Government must be sincere with the people and not have a carrot-display budget and saying that if the workers do certain things the Government will do other things. It is wrong that the Government should bring in subsidies and say that <Col N="211" /> they are conditional.  The Government should tell us if it is the intention to bring in more subsidies.  Unless the Government announce that they have firm plans to take us over the problems facing us they cannot expect co-operation or loyalty from employers or employees.  It is ironic that the Government should have issued a short report on how to combat poverty when there is a great poverty of thought in the Government towards the improvement of our economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien said that if we all got together we could do great things. I know the Deputy was sincere, but that is not enough.  I am sure the people will come together if they believe that the Government are sincere and have a practical policy to put before them.  That policy should safeguard the people from the effects of the present economic blizzard, or are the Government becoming so complacent as merely to blame outside influences for our problems? Will it be their attitude to sit back and say that they cannot do much about the situation because the problem is a worldwide one?  Let us consider our position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other eight members of the EEC.  Somebody has said of the UK that she is suffering so badly from post-Empire pains that, as a society, she is becoming more sick.  However, let us consider other European countries that are battling against the present economic difficulties, countries that are being successful in their efforts in this regard.  Unless the Government here can generate a climate of belief in ourselves, our problems will become much worse.  It has been suggested that within a short time there may be 200,000 people unemployed.  I have not heard that suggestion being described as a defeatist attitude.  While such a prospect may be unpalatable, the question of whether that stage will be reached depends to a great deal on the Government.</P>
    <P>When this Government came to power they were handed over a very sound economy, an economy that was capable of great development.  I realise that there are influences at <Col N="212" /> work which are imported and which we cannot prevent but which are contributing to some of our problems. However, I do not accept the Government's complacency in this regard. I do not accept that we cannot take the sort of action that is being taken by, for instance, West Germany, Denmark and Holland.  West Germany has a very strong economy despite the disaster of World War II which brought her to her knees and despite the fact that she is a partitioned country.  By the application of their native genius, the Germans have been able to build their economy so that today her people enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world.  Germany has both an inflation and an unemployment problem but these problems are contained within manageable limits while our difficulties continue to become greater.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may say that we have taken certain action, that we have eased the burden on people by the provisions of the budget, that certain conditions have been given in an attempt to effect a 4 per cent cut in the cost of living, but unless the Government are prepared to examine our problems and take decisions as to how best they can be solved, the outlook for the country is bleak.</P>
    <P>If the workers are to agree to a modification of the national wage agreement they must be given a guarantee that there would be no further modification.  They must be given a guarantee also that those whose salaries and wages are in the lower brackets will be given some credit by way of State bonus for the sacrifices they are making now when there is material evidence of oil and gas from our territorial seas.  If the Government continue to endeavour to solve the problems piecemeal they are not likely to get the full co-operation of those who are working to create wealth for the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanToal" hpid="Mr. Toal Mr. Toal">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say merely a few words on this measure.  The Bill is designed to wind down inflation and to stimulate employment.  With that objective in mind I would expect it to be welcomed by every Deputy in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> I am glad that VAT is being removed from footwear, from essential clothing, from non-vehicular fuel and electricity, but I am very disappointed there is no such concession in respect of furniture.  By &ldquo;furniture&rdquo; I mean such essential items as beds, chairs and tables which bear a VAT rate of 19.5 per cent.  Obviously this is a penal rate especially when one considers that the rate in Northern Ireland is only 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>We all know that along the Border, on the Northern side, there are many Jonesboro'-type markets.  People from this side of the Border can go to those markets and bring back to the Republic goods to the value of £52 on each occasion.  There has been a tremendous upsurge in the purchase of furniture in Northern Ireland by citizens of the Republic.  When we take into account also the importation by traders of foreign furniture, even from non-EEC countries, and also the secondhand furniture sales, one realises the mammoth task facing the home manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The groupings for the various rates of VAT have been re-examined.  At a time when the 6.75 per cent rate on footwear, for instance, has been removed completely, it is difficult to understand why there should not be at least a substantial reduction in the 19.5 per cent that applies to furniture. Such reduction would encourage sales of Irish-made furniture, thereby ensuring more employment for our people.</P>
    <P>In my county furniture manufacturing is a thriving industry.  In my home town one furniture concern has closed down and the others face great difficulties because of the importation &mdash;whether it be from Northern Ireland, EEC countries or non-EEC countries&mdash;of cheap furniture with which local manufacturers are unable to compete.  In this respect the only thing for the Government to do is to give immediate assistance to such people by reducing substantially, or abolishing, value-added tax on essential items of furniture.  By that I mean items such as chairs, beds and tables. By so doing they would be not alone helping the furniture manufacturers <Col N="214" /> but stimulating employment and rescuing the industry before it is too late.</P>
    <P>I heard the Taoiseach say that we should all face more honestly our obligation to pay tax.  That message could not be spelled out too often. To my knowledge the average Englishman fills out his tax forms diligently, correctly and more honestly that does his Irish counterpart. Perhaps he pays the tax unwillingly but at least he shoulders the burden and meets his commitments.  I do not know what is the reason for the Irishman's reluctance to pay tax in a prompt and accurate fashion.  Perhaps this stems from former times and our ancestors' distrust of authority.  I should like to see business people especially being more honest and accurate in filing their income tax returns.  Unless we all do this we ourselves will suffer ultimately because, if the Government cannot get in the moneys they require by way of taxation, they will have to impose taxation on items which could be devoid of it were everybody more honest.</P>
    <P>I should like to see also a more decentralised system for the collection of tax here.  In the Cavan/ Monaghan, Louth/Meath region there is one inspector of taxes located in Dundalk.  The average businessman or farmer cannot take time off to drive 50 miles to Dundalk to have his income tax affairs settled.  I should like to see a tax office established in every town.  I know this would take time but I should like the Taoiseach to address himself to this question in his reply.  In the interim, with the complexity of tax measures confronting people at present, I should like to see the inspectors of taxes in the various regions attending at least once a month in the major towns in each county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, this Bill is designed primarily to wind-down inflation. We have heard a lot of talk <Col N="215" /> from the Opposition about inflation. They know the facts of it as well as we do.  First of all, there was the fourfold increase in the price of oil; there was also the worldwide increase in commodity prices and the fall in the value of sterling.  In addition, there have been the exorbitant wage demands being imposed by workers on various firms here.  We have wages chasing prices and prices chasing wages.  Unless we are prepared to cut down our demands the spiral of inflation will continue.  This Bill is designed to halt the spiral of inflation and reduce it.</P>
      <P>Needless to say whatever measures the Government adopt, they need the co-operation of all our people.  People talk about patriotism.  We have sufficient of the political kind but very little of the economic kind.  I do not mean that merely in a confined sphere of &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo;; I mean it over a broad spectrum, even in the sense of acceptance of the tax proposals of this package; accepting them in a civil spirit and shouldering the burden so that our economy can weather these difficult economic times.  I commend the measure to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike some speakers, I take a different view of the tragic problem this country now faces. This problem must rest on somebody's shoulders.  We must examine the situation and ascertain the full extent of the problem before we can attempt to solve it in its entirety.  For the past two years the Government have been bluffing their way through.  Contributing factors to the very serious situation in which we now find ourselves were vote-purchasing activities, internal pressures, which bring about somersaults in relation to policy and statements emanating from various Ministers from time to time, and the yielding to outside pressures.  We have experienced a disastrous situation during the past 12 months with the vicious upward spiral in unemployment figures and the ever-increasing dole queues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is this measure sufficient to remedy that tragic situation we now face? <Col N="216" /> Positive action must be taken to save this nation and we have not had that. The Government have introduced a measure and qualified it with the implication: do not do as we do; do as we tell you or we will make you. That is no way to treat this positive problem we face now which requires deliberate action on the part of the Government.  We must know exactly where we stand before we can discuss the complex situation in its entirety.</P>
    <P>Will the Government continue the subsidies or will they be removed? We must ascertain the position.  We have had the irresponsible projection by Ministers that certain actions will be taken.  The Government should take a positive line in relation to the rectification of this problem.  It constitutes a very serious situation, a loss of confidence in the Government, by industrialists and other sections of the community.  Confidence is the key note.  There must be confidence&mdash; confidence in the future, confidence in the Government and in their policies.  But no policy has been presented. Two-and-a-half years ago when this Government assumed office we were a creditworthy nation with an amount of finance available from a variety of sources.  We are now on the verge of bankruptcy and the past 12 months have highlighted the complete incompetence of the Government. We should not try to cover up the misdeeds of the Government but we should try to extract some information from them.  They have concealed what has happened with the result that concerned people are not able to evaluate the true situation.</P>
    <P>The matter of State finances has been referred to by the few speakers on the Government side.  We have seen the lonely vigil of the Taoiseach for a number of hours, and now the Minister for Finance is the only Minister on the Government benches. Not a single member of the Labour Party has thought it worth while to come in and support the Government. If Members such as Deputy Barry Desmond and others who have been vocal in the past have not come into the House to support the Minister, we must take it they are not in <Col N="217" /> favour of the present measures.  So far there has not been a single member of the Labour Party in this House during the debate and, with the exception of the Minister for Finance, there is not a single Fine Gael member present.  That is the situation in what we were told was an all-important debate that would rectify the present tragic situation.</P>
    <P>Budgets are meaningless now.  What happens is that the Minister for Finance presents a list to the House; the purpose of part of the list is to buy popularity.  There is no question of making ends meet.  We have been told that when the upturn comes things will be all right; we will have plenty of minerals, oil and natural gas.  The Government decide on expenditure and they borrow to meet the long list with which the House was presented.</P>
    <P>In the last few years there have been many reversals of policy.  VAT has been removed from a number of items although the tax was increased on those items in the not too distant past by the Minister.  CIE and ESB charges have been imposed by the power of this House but a few weeks afterwards the Minister reversed the situation.  There was the national wage agreement which the Minister for Finance and other members of the Government applauded but yet a few weeks later we were told it must be modified.  One does not know the state of the economy from budget to budget, from week to week, from day to day, or from one Government meeting to another.</P>
    <P>Have the Government changed their minds since they presented this Bill?  Has there been any change in Government policy?  It is very difficult to discuss any situation in this House because we know that within 24 hours, or with a change of Minister on the front bench due to an interval break, there may be a change of attitude.  The Government do not know where they are going from day to day.  There are many internal problems and pressures within the Government, where some Ministers are told by their colleagues to hold their political nerve, to damp down the fires.  This is their only solution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> Who is the real Minister for Finance?  It is not Deputy Ryan.  Who is the real Taoiseach?  There have been so many changes and so many conflicting statements with regard to the economy that we cannot accept the word of any Minister for more than the hour in which he makes a statement.  We know that Deputy Ryan is only a cloak for the real Minister.  No doubt the real Minister will emerge in a short time.  Perhaps we might be told now who he is so that we may assess the situation and try to rectify it.  We must know who is in control.  There have been distortions and reversals of policy as a result of a variety of pressures on the people who are supposed to be in power.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about the survival of this nation.  We want positive action to ensure that we have a viable economy.  People will have to make sacrifices.  What is required is courage &mdash;not in-fighting, not political pressures of one type or another.  If the people of the country are asked to accept the situation and to make sacrifices to ensure that we have a viable economy they will do it.</P>
    <P>We know the bluffing that went on with regard to the national wage agreement.  The Government applauded and approved that agreement in this House but, at the same time, the Minister for Finance knew that it was not going to be accepted in its present form by his Department.  Before he introduced his budget, why did the Minister not take the trade unionists into his confidence and tell them the situation?  Instead of that, at a later stage he waved a big stick and told them if they did not do what the Government wanted they and the people would suffer the consequences.</P>
    <P>What is required is confidence and common sense.  Irish workers have always been reasonable and responsible. During the years they have met their responsibilities in full; when called on to make sacrifices they did so when they knew the facts.  On this occasion political blackmail has been applied.  Threats are no solution to any problem.  What is needed is a disclosure of the facts so that everyone can judge the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> What will happen in the future if the so-called package is a failure? The trade unions will be blamed.  The Minister and the Government have left themselves a way out.  The trade union movement is a responsible body which will measure up to the high standards they have always maintained when dealing with the national problems which have confronted them from time to time.  On this occasion, too, I am sure the Irish workers, reasonable and responsible men who are concerned about the future of the nation, will measure up fully to the tragic situation in which we find ourselves because of the incompetence of the Government. Threats such as those to withdraw subsidies and impose further taxation are no solution to the problem.  To handle a problem successfully one must let the people know where they stand and what the consequences will be if remedial action is not taken.  If the people are given the facts, they will respond without the Minister using blackmail.  It is an insult to the trade unions when the Minister uses a big stick to threaten them.  As I said, these are reasonable men who will consider in a reasonable way the problems facing the nation.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that a positive policy would have emerged from this Government which would have inspired confidence.  People have no confidence because we are still waiting for the full package.  We still do not know if the subsidies are on or off.  Will there be a reversal of other benefits in the package?  Will the employment subsidy and other concessions be withdrawn? What exactly are we discussing? Nothing positive, but a package which might exist in some form or other.  For the past two years this Government have been approaching the economic situation in a not very positive way.</P>
    <P>How will the trade union movement view the situation when they sit down to negotiate further wage agreements? Many questions will have to be answered if this Government are in power, and the unions are entitled to these answers.  Perhaps the Minister <Col N="220" /> will give some indication of what will happen if the package does not work. What remedial measures will be taken?</P>
    <P>Ministers welcomed the national wage agreement but only a few weeks later this so-called package was brought in.  Why was it brought in so soon?  Why did the Minister conceal it? Did he not know about it or had the Department of Finance already come to the decision that the economy could not stand it but did not tell the Minister? Or did the Minister know but keep it from the trade unions?  That is an unhealthy situation and will not be tolerated in the future.</P>
    <P>We need courage, not bluff to meet this situation.  We must make a national effort to overcome this disaster, much of which is of our own making.  There has been much talk about industry, workers, unemployment, corrective measures and inflation.  From June, 1974, to June, 1975, there was an alarming increase of 46 per cent in unemployment. As well as the 100,000 on the live register we have the school leavers who are unable to get employment. Some people are predicting that the unemployment figures will rise to 200,000 in the near future.  When it reaches that figure the Government will probably do what they did on a previous occasion&mdash;desert in the middle of the night.  History has repeated itself on many occasions since this Government took office.</P>
    <P>Some people have no hope for the future, particularly school leavers and those on the dole and this Bill gives them no hope.  The remedial measures outlined in this document are not adequate to make us a viable nation again.  It provides for the removal of VAT from certain personal clothing, footwear, clothing materials, footwear materials, electricity and fuels generally. We are told later on that luxuries are taxed and no reasonable person would argue that they are essential.  Of course luxuries should be taxed.  Everyone agreed that they should be taxed. Taxes should be imposed on nonessentials. I have been pointing out here, however, that many items essential where the ordinary household <Col N="221" /> is concerned are taxed because they carry value-added tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if the Government have considered the possibility of employing school leavers in community care projects while they are awaiting the opportunity of pursuing their chosen careers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The employment of school leavers in conjunction with the community care services coming within the ambit of my Department would be a matter for the health boards or for the voluntary agencies engaged in such activities.</P>
      <P>Persons employed by health boards in the provision of community care services are generally professionally qualified and there would not appear to be much scope for school leavers in this sphere, particularly in the circumstances envisaged by the Deputy where their employment would be on a short-term temporary basis.</P>
      <P>While voluntary agencies providing community care employ some professionally qualified staff most of them depend to a large extent on voluntary workers, and the activities of such agencies would probably offer greater scope for young persons.  I would recommend that any such persons wishing to work in community care might contact one of the voluntary groups operating in the area in which he or she resides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there are no funds available in health boards even to cope with current expenditure does the Minister not consider that his Department should offer an encouragement to young school leavers by allowing them mainly voluntary participation but perhaps with some form of remuneration to occupy them in the crucial <Col N="222" /> period they are going through with no employment opportunities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are two sides of community care.  One side is run by teams from the health boards.  These are all professionally qualified, and school leavers would not fit into that category.  As far as the voluntary care is concerned, it is voluntary in every sense of the word and no payment would be made, but I would advise the people to whom the Deputy refers to contact voluntary agencies to see whether they could be of help in voluntary community care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider discussing this with the voluntary organisations or getting the health boards to do so and perhaps making some money available from his Department to help in this situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is for the agencies that are established under the Health Act.  As I have explained they would not fit in the first category, that is community care teams under the Department of Health. The only way they could come in would be under the voluntary scheme, and for that they would not get paid.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to <Col N="227" /> circulate with the Official Report a statement setting out the revised rates of maintenance charges which hospital authorities were requested to introduce with effect as from 1st July, 1975.</P>
      <P>Maintenance charges were last settled in the case of health board hospitals in April, 1971, and for public voluntary hospitals in April, 1972. Since then the cost of hospital services generally has about doubled. Costs vary according to the type of hospital involved, for example, whether it is a teaching or a non-teaching voluntary hospital or whether it is a regional hospital or county hospital or district hospital of a health board.  The charges also vary according to whether the patient is a person outside the existing limits or is a person with statutory entitlement to services who is exercising a choice to go to a private or semi-private ward.</P>
      <P>In the case of the voluntary hospitals, most of the 1972 charges have been increased on average by 33 per cent to 40 per cent; in the case of the health board hospitals most of the increases on the 1971 rates were in the range of 50 per cent to 70 per cent. In other instances the revised charges range from £2 to £3 per day and represent only a relatively small part of the actual cost of the service provided.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the recent increases were exorbitant.  In most cases they are far less than would have been justified by the increases in the costs that have taken place and do not go anywhere near meeting the full cost involved.  In fact, the maintenance charges for private and semi-private wards represent only about half the cost of these services.  The remainder is met from public funds. The proposals for increases were examined in great detail by the Prices Commission and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, acting on the advice of the commission, approved of the increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the time which had to be expended in a careful examination of the proposals I was not able to give as much notice of the increases as it might be contended as desirable.  If <Col N="228" /> this has caused real inconvenience to any person I regret it.  I note, however, that in a recent news release the Voluntary Health Insurance Board indicated that they are prepared to allow subscribers who may be underinsured to revise their insurance cover with effect from 1st July, 1975, and in advance of the ordinary renewal dates.</P>
    <P>The following is the statement on charges for hospital services which hospital authorities were requested to introduce with effect from 1st July, 1975.</P>

      <P>It is at least something that the Minister admits the notice given in regard to the phenomenal increases was inadequate and has the good grace to apologise for that fact.  Does he not recognise that these increases represent a further crushing burden for a very hard-pressed section of the community?  In these circumstances did he not consider meeting these increased costs on <Col N="229" /> the voluntary hospitals and the other hospitals from the Exchequer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I said that.  I do not know whether the Deputy has figures but I should like to give him and the House some figures with regard to the cost and the maintenance charges.  I said that increases had not been made in the case of health board hospitals from 1971 and in the case of the voluntary hospitals from 1972.  In 1972, in voluntary teaching hospitals the average daily cost was £11.  The present average cost is £20, an increase of 82 per cent.</P>
      <P>In 1972, the average daily maintenance charge was £7.  At present it is £10 which represents an increase of 42 per cent.  While the increase in the average daily cost of maintaining a patient in a private room was 82 per cent the actual increase was only 43 per cent.  I have similar figures in respect of regional and county hospital wards.  In all the circumstances and in view of the increase in the average daily cost I think the new charges were justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister adverted to the fact that these increases were sanctioned by the Prices Commission. Does he attach any significance to the fact that the reference to these increases was tucked away in a very obscure part of the appropriate Prices Commission's report and no reference whatever was made to them in the body of the report?  Does he attach any significance to that attempted subterfuge by the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  Furthermore, does he regard the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme as of the utmost importance and as a very successful scheme?  In the circumstances, does he not think that in matters of this sort he should do everything within his power to enable the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to conduct their affairs as efficiently as possible? <Col N="230" /> Does he not think that the way in which these increases were handled seriously disrupted the operations of the board and their planning, and caused considerable hardship and upset to those people who rely on the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to meet their hospital expenses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that these increases were tucked away so that they would not be noticed in the report of the National Prices Commission. There were consultations with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board ranging over months.  The Deputy has probably read in the papers a news release to the effect that the 36 maintenance units which are now in operation were suggested by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board early in the year.  After the increases were announced the board said a cover of 36 units was sufficient even to cover the new charges. Therefore, in those circumstances I do not think it can be said that I did not have due regard to the role which the Voluntary Health Insurance Board played in the hospitalisation of people in the private or semi-private wards.</P>
      <P>The news release to which I referred from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board was dated 7th July, and this stated that current hospital charges meant that in future a patient occupying a private room in a voluntary hospital would require about 36 maintenance units to provide adequate cover.  That was recommended about March or April.  In public advertisements the Voluntary Health Insurance Board recommended that the number of units for maintenance would be 40.  They did this in order to ensure that anybody going into a private ward would be adequately covered.  Apart from that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board decided that those who did not have sufficient cover on 1st July could take out additional cover and that this would be retrospective as far as charges were concerned to 1st July.</P>

      <P>It represented a considerable upset to the board and to the people.  Would the Minister for Health tell us, in view of these staggering <Col N="231" /> increases and the financial position which he has now revealed to us of these hospitals, if he still intends to present the charade of making hospital services free to the entire community, even to the wealthier sections?  Does the Minister still intend to pursue, even on paper, the proposal to make the hospital services free to all the people?</P>

I dealt with that at length during the debate on the Estimate for my Department.  My object is the same as the Deputy's, to keep people out of hospital.  I am examining the possibility of ensuring that allowances are paid where a person is cared for at home and not sent into hospital.</P>

      <P>I can see a case for the consideration of the whole scheme because it seems a little lopsided in that health board hospitals have not a library service available to them.  It is true that the Hospital Library Council is going out of existence.  I asked An Comhairle Leabharlainne, the statutory body for advising on public libraries, to carry out an evaluation.  They submitted a report on 22nd May containing a recommendation that as soon as possible a decision in principle be taken by the Department of Health, in association with the health boards, that the public library authorities be requested to provide a service to patients in all hospitals, the financing of these services to be worked out between the <Col N="233" /> three parties.  That will be done and I hope, as a result, all hospitals will be covered by this service with the co-operation of the Department of Health, the health boards and An Comhairle Leabharlainne.</P>

      <P>The number of medical graduates required to meet current needs is estimated to be in the region of 120 a year.

      <P>Irish medical degrees are recognised for full registration in the United Kingdom, and, under reciprocal arrangements, in South Africa, in New Zealand, in the Provinces of Saskatchewan, Canada, and in the Australian States of Southern Australia, Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales.  Other countries may admit Irish graduates to their registers subject to compliance with registration and other requirements.</P>
      <P>For example, doctors wishing to practise in the United States must pass a competency examination held by the authorities of the particular State concerned.  Admittance to the register does not, however, of itself confer the right of establishment and, in all cases, statutory requirements, such as the need for work permits, in relation to employment of non-nationals must be fulfilled.</P>
      <P>The EEC directives on mutual recognition of medical qualifications and right of establishment and freedom to provide services, recently adopted will, when put into effect, require member States to give recognition to qualifications acquired in the other member States of the Community by nationals of the member States, and to allow doctors so qualified to practise in any of the member States.  Under these directives, Irish graduates will be entitled to practise in all other EEC member States, subject to the same conditions as apply to nationals of those States.</P>

      <P>At present, foreign graduates from ex-British colonies and from commonwealth countries are required to obtain employment certificates from the Department of Justice.  Other foreign graduates are required to obtain work permits from the Department of Labour.</P>
      <P>Before issuing the certificates or permits, as the case may be, the Department concerned requires the prospective employer to produce evidence that he has endeavoured, without success, to recruit a suitable Irish national for the job.</P>
      <P>As from the 1st August next under the Aliens (Amendment) Order, 1975, all aliens&mdash;which for the purpose of these Orders do not include persons born in Great Britain or Northern Ireland&mdash;may not enter the service of an employer here save in accordance with a permit issued to the employer by the Minister for Labour.  Such persons at present lawfully engaged in employment here and who do not have a work permit will be allowed to retain their present employment without their employer having to seek a work permit.  However, if such persons in future enter the service of another employer or change jobs with the same employer a work permit will be necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the cost of putting a fully equipped cardiac ambulance into service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to answer Questions Nos. 13, 14, 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>Health boards do not operate special cardiac ambulances but provide an accident and emergency ambulance service which caters for emergency cardiac cases as well as other emergency cases.  The ambulance personnel are specially trained in the resuscitation of cardiac emergency cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> In the Dublin area there is a private cardiac ambulance service which is run independently of the Eastern Health Board's ambulance service. The health board pay £8.95 per call on this cardiac ambulance service in Dublin city and county, and somewhat more for calls to Counties Kildare and Wicklow, in the case of persons eligible for hospital services under the Health Act, 1970, if the cardiac ambulance is requested by a doctor or by the Dublin Fire Brigade, who operate the accident and emergency ambulance service in the Dublin area on behalf of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>I have received a number of complaints from people who have been charged for using the cardiac ambulance service but my Department are not aware of any widespread concern about the availability of cardiac ambulances.  This matter is, however, being further considered in the Department.</P>
    <P>Health boards are not legally obliged to provide ambulances but, in fact, they all do so.  They have discretion whether to make a charge for ambulance services or to provide them free of charge.  The actual position is that an accident and emergency ambulance service is provided free of charge to everybody except in one area where persons not eligible for hospital services under the Health Acts may be charged.  The routine non-accident ambulance service for conveying patients to or from hospitals and clinics is provided free for persons with medical cards.  Persons with limited eligibility may be charged for this routine ambulance service in most areas, and ineligible persons are charged for it in all areas.</P>
    <P>The cost of putting a fully-equipped cardiac ambulance into service is estimated at £23,000, made up of the cost of the ambulance and equipment, approximately £7,000, and the annual cost of ambulance personnel to provide cover for 24 hours every day. The staffing costs would probably be less if the cardiac ambulance service were integrated with the existing accident and emergency ambulance service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> With regard to the suggestion that medical insurance schemes be extended to include ambulance charges.  I understand that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board's ordinary scheme covers conveyance by ambulances between hospitals.  The board's supplementary scheme provides cover for the major portion of the cost of ambulance charges in excess of £25.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the health authorities do not provide cardiac ambulances and that the only such ambulances available in Dublin are those operated by a private firm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that while he has received a number of complaints from people who have been charged for using the cardiac ambulance service, the Department are not aware of any widespread concern about the availability of this service.  Surely it is the duty of the health authorities to provide a service of this nature.  I am aware of many public representatives, including myself, to whom representations have been made in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that I raised this matter with him some time ago.  Is he aware that frequently in Dublin city there are cases in which the unfortunate relatives of persons who suffer heart attacks are asked for money before the ambulance will move to take the patient to hospital although the patient has already been transferred to the ambulance?  These are cases in which all that is standing between the patient and death is the cardiac ambulance.  Can the Minister do anything about that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern.  This matter was raised recently by Deputy Walsh as well.  It <Col N="240" /> is deplorable that anybody should demand payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister recognise that the ordinary man in the street is not concerned whether it is the Eastern Health Board or the Voluntary Health Insurance Board?  He is concerned only with getting the patient as quickly as possible to safety, and the cardiac ambulance means the difference between life and death.  Would the Minister agree that it is an appalling situation that we do not have this service in Dublin city, free of charge, or at least provided on a basis of subsequent recoupment of the cost?</P>

There has been pressure exerted to provide a free cardiac ambulance service.  It is intended that the officials of my Department will discuss the whole subject with cardiologists and with the Eastern Health Board to ascertain whether there is a real need for cardiac ambulances.  Therefore, so far as Dublin city and county are concerned, this matter is under consideration, and I trust something satisfactory will come out of that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 21st May to Deputy Lemass regarding the question of waiting lists for joint replacement operations generally.  Much of the heavy waiting lists is due, as I then indicated, to dramatic recent improvements in technique which in turn led to a build-up of cases.  Once this backlog is dealt with a reduction in waiting list numbers could reasonably be expected.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are being made by my Department for the carrying out of a special national survey regarding the workload in regard to joint replacements, and any necessary remedial steps can be considered in the light of its findings.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Southern Health Board area is concerned I have no proposals before me for extra facilities at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher, where the joint replacement work is carried out for the area. However, a new plaster theatre was provided for this hospital in 1973.  A five-bed recovery room was provided in 1974.  A link corridor between the theatre and another block was also recently provided.  In regard to extra staff for St. Mary's Hospital, a third surgeon was appointed in 1972 and also extra nursing staff.  A proposal to appoint an additional house officer has recently been received and is being considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Dáil adjourned I was dealing with the remedial measures being taken by the Government to deal with inflation, the promotion of job opportunities, reduction in the dole queues and so on. The brief statement read by the Taoiseach in no way serves as a measure which would save the nation from the disaster it now faces.  I noticed a change from the situation with which we are familiar, that is, the financing of services.  The Taoiseach said &ldquo;the simple truth is that taxation is necessary to meet Government expenditure&rdquo;, as if we did not know it.  This is the first time we have seen such a statement.  Previously it was said that there were other ways of meeting Government expenditure. Experience has shown that Government expenditure cannot be financed without difficulty and it is about time the government found that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every measure before the House should be aimed at protecting the economy and this measure is not.  We are unsure of this package.  One day we are told it is on, and the next day it is not.  Something more positive is required.  At the moment more than 100,000 are unemployed.  There is nothing in this measure to ensure that there will be a contraction of the dole queues.  There is nothing in it that will bring relief to the large number of school leavers looking for employment. They have no hope for the future.  If we add the 50,000 leaving school to the 100,000 unemployed, the professional <Col N="253" /> people unemployed and those who are being retrained we will see that the unemployment figure is very substantial.</P>
    <P>Between June, 1974, and June, 1975, there was an increase of 46 per cent in unemployment.  There are also 5,458 people on short-time.  What have these people to look forward to? There is nothing in this measure which will bring relief.  This situation must be tackled efficiently and effectively and in a way which will bring relief to the needy sections of the community.  Twelve months ago the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare told us that there were 25,000 people living below the poverty line.  What figure has that group reached?  Is it now 35,000, 45,000 or 55,000?  Where do the people on the dole and the school leavers go from here?  Does this package give any hope for the future? We must again examine statements by Ministers on the problems as they existed before June last, when these remedial measures were introduced.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Labour for being in the House now. During this important debate this morning we did not have one member of the Labour Party in the House.  I hope my words before the adjournment were responsible for the Minister being here now.  Perhaps a member of the Labour Party will now add his voice to that of the Taoiseach, who this morning sat in the deserted seats of the Government benches.  I notice that the Minister for Labour is sitting alone now.  Is this an indication of the lack of support by Government backbenchers for Government policy and the remedial measures being introduced?</P>
    <P>I hope that before this debate concludes I will hear from many Government backbenchers, especially members of the Labour Party, because a very exacting burden has been placed on the shoulders of the trade union movement.  This Government package depends on certain action being taken elsewhere.  The Government are not stating positively that this is the way we should go.  I am positive that responsible trade unionists will respond effectively to every crisis as they have <Col N="254" /> done in the past, conscious of their responsibility to the nation and to those on the labour exchange.  There is nothing in this measure to suggest that there will be any relief for the thousands who are helpless at the moment.</P>
    <P>Some people argue the dole queue may reach the frightening figure of 200,000 in the near future.  We hope this situation will not develop.  We hope the measures taken, admittedly too late, will prevent that desperate development.  Day after day the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, when questioned about the building industry, insisted that there was nothing wrong.  This is one of the most important industries we have, providing employment in the industry proper and in ancilliary industries, such as carpet making, fabric manufacture, cabinet making, furniture and a variety of others.  We were led to believe that there was no need for stimulating the industry, that houses were being built by the thousand, houses of which there was no trace except in the Minister's mind.  We knew the builders' providers could not get rid of their stockpiles.  Yet the Minister insisted houses were being built by the thousand, apparently without bricks and mortar, without timber and all the other items essential to the building of a house.  Nobody knew where the houses the Minister for Local Government was building were to be found.  The construction industry told the Minister on many occasions he was misleading the House and the country.  Last June the Government, exercising collective responsibility, considered it necessary to inject capital into the building industry.  Apparently every Minister, except the Minister for Local Government, knew there was a housing crisis prior to June and realised it was necessary to stimulate the industry. Either the Minister for Local Government was out of touch with the Government or the Government were out of touch with the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>When measures were suggested by this side of the House to relieve the situation in the boot and shoe industry, the textile industry and other industries, <Col N="255" /> we were told there were no problems.  All we met with were the sneers of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, of the Minister for Local Government and of Deputy O'Brien.  The economic problems were highlighted time and time again by Members on this side of the House and we got the same answer every time, a sneer.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has told the Parliamentary Labour Party to damp down the fires, to hold their political nerve because this situation will blow over; we have no more money but do not let the boys on the other side of the House know that.</P>
    <P>The Government must come clean and indicate what the factual situation is.  Only then will we know what the remedial measures should be.  There have been so many changes of mind it is difficult to know what the true position is.  We had an increase in value-added tax.  Now that has been removed.  We had an increase in CIE fares.  Now they have been reduced. An increase in ESB charges was allowed and a few weeks later certain relief was given in another budget. These are but some of the items.  I could give a long list of measures introduced one day and repealed the next.  All this shows the utter confusion within the Government in relation to the problem as a whole.</P>
    <P>We hope there will be an improvement in the coming months.  It will not be engendered by Government action. The Government are depending on oil finds, gas finds and mineral finds.  We are told that in four or five years when gas begins to blow and oil begins to flow everything will be all right.  In the meantime there will be a great deal of human misery.  There is not much hope if we have to wait for oil and gas.  The remedial measures taken will not be sufficient to cure the situation.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare has told us on many occasions that many people are living below subsistence level.</P>
    <P>The first prerequisite is to create confidence.  Industrialists will not come in here to establish industries if they have no confidence in the Government. <Col N="256" /> That is the situation at the moment.  I asked this morning if the Minister for Finance is a member of the administrative council of the Labour Party. He is certainly not the man who holds the job in this House.  We have had plenty of statements from Ministers, plenty of taxes imposed, plenty of promises, plenty of bluff and far too much unemployment.  The incompetence of the Government has allowed the situation to deteriorate to the point at which it is now a national disaster. There is the upward spiral in prices. Some of the items from which value-added tax is allegedly removed are much dearer now.  Blankets were mentioned here.  They carry 19.5 per cent, almost one-fifth in tax.</P>
    <P>We are told that VAT has been removed from essentials.  VAT has not been removed from blankets which people need to cover children but VAT has been removed from mink coats. Of course the average housewife cannot buy a mink coat.  Perhaps Ministers can and perhaps it is more important to have VAT removed from mink coats than it is from bed clothes. The Government would need to get their priorities right.</P>
    <P>A very serious situation has developed. Irish workers are most reasonable people and they will respond to a call to ensure that this nation survives just as they have in the past but they will not respond to political blackmail or the waving of big sticks.  Intimidation will not be a deciding factor but common sense will prevail as on every occasion in the past.  If the Government are trying to beat people into submission they have made a mistake.  They have created a feeling of distrust.  They did not rely on the goodwill and the common sense of the workers and the workers are far more anxious to see the nation survive than apparently the Government are.  I hope the budget will in some way stimulate confidence but I am sure it will not bring about the desired results.  I had hoped that the Government would introduce something more positive, even if more difficult to consume.  I am sure every person would be willing to respond to a nation in difficulty.</P>
    <P>What is required is confidence.  A great burden rests on the shoulders <Col N="257" /> of the people in authority and the Taoiseach in particular.  I believe he is being pushed and shoved around by other sections of the Government.  The policies that have been presented and the way in which they have been presented is a clear indication of the pushing and shoving that has gone on.  I hope that at some stage a more positive approach will be made.  The Government change their minds by the hour.  Every meeting of the Government brings a new decision and every meeting of the political parties in the Government brings another decision. We have seen this in the case of the CIE fares, the ESB charges and a variety of other matters.  I hope this budget will make some small contribution. I am sure the people will respond willingly in order to ensure the survival of the nation.  The Government are responsible for allowing the situation to deteriorate over a considerable period before they took any measures and the measures they have taken are too late and too little.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister for Labour has left the House but I am very glad that the Taoiseach is here to listen to what I have to say.  A couple of weeks ago I raised the problem of the 50,000 young people coming on the labour market at present.  I am speaking of graduates from our universities, from our colleges of technology, our vocational and secondary schools.  The Taoiseach is an ex-Army man who was in the military college at the same time as I was.  He will remember that we were told there that when we went back to our units we would have a platoon of 42 men for whom we would be responsible.  When you went back you discovered that there was a number sick, a number on fatigues, a number on guard duty, a number resting off. You ended up with possibly 15 men for training and you got the idea that what you were told in the college was all cod.  Our young people today do not have the employment opportunities they were told they would have by social workers, by their parents, by presidents of colleges and headmasters.  It is a pity the young Minister for Labour has left the <Col N="258" /> House and I must thank him for his reply to my question of two or three weeks ago.  I asked him if he could bring in a temporary, voluntary retirement scheme.  In the public service and in private industry there are a number of men who are ill but perhaps not ill enough to be certified for national health.  They may not be capable of performing their duties but they must hang on.  Perhaps the Minister could introduce legislation whereby such people could retire. This would make room for some young people at the lower end of the ladder.</P>
      <P>I was glad the Minister said that if proposals of that kind were made to him by the unions and employers he would give them favourable consideration. I said that surely it was the Minister's duty to put that proposal to the employers and the trade unions.  I cannot understand that type of attitude on the part of the Minister for Labour and the type of reply we are getting to questions in this House.  In other words, Government must come from the bottom instead of the Government taking action.  I am satisfied that a number of people in employment in every sector would be prepared to retire if they had three years added to their normal service.  This would make jobs available for our youth.</P>
      <P>Before the last election the Fine Gael Party had posters all over the country saying: &ldquo;Do not blame the Government.  Change it.&rdquo;  The people changed the Government, not because Fianna Fáil lost votes&mdash;we increased our first preference votes&mdash; but because of PR and because people voted Fine Gael and Labour. If the Taoiseach has any of those posters left in Fine Gael Headquarters in Hume Street he should send them over to me or to 13 Upper Mount Street and we will use them in the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach&mdash;and I admire him for it&mdash;said at an Árd-Fheis that the major part of the problems were of our own making.  We cannot keep on saying that inflation is caused by the Arabs, or the Indians, or the Americans, or other outside sources. <Col N="259" /> As Deputy Dowling said, the Labour Party has not been represented here today during this debate.</P>
    <P>If you are in business in O'Connell Street and you have a competitor in business in Grafton Street, and another one in Middle Abbey Street, and the cost of running those businesses increases by 8 per cent in each of those places, and somebody else is in business in Dame Street and the cost of running his business increases by 28 per cent, the man in Dame Street will go out of business. That is what is happening to the country.  The cost of running our business as a nation has increased by 28 per cent.  In Italy, Germany France, Britain, Belgium, Holland, Denmark and all of the Nine they are keeping their inflation rate at a reasonable level.</P>
    <P>I would like somebody to define what inflation means.  To me it means the cost of producing articles in this country has increased by 28 per cent as compared with 8 per cent in other countries.  Therefore, as a nation we are heading for bankruptcy.  There is no doubt in my mind about that. The heading of the editorial in today's <i>Irish Times</i> is &ldquo;Jobs&rdquo;.  It states:</P>
    <P>The EEC Commission's report on the Irish economy, published yesterday, shows up starkly the magnitude of the economic problems facing this country even when the present recession ends.  It calculates that, to achieve full employment by 1986, 30,000 extra jobs need to be created each year over and above the number required to replace jobs lost through redundancies.</P>
    <P>At the end of the editorial it is stated:</P>
    <P>Hence, unless the EEC is prepared to make substantial grants available to this country, full employment simply will not be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Press</i> has an article on the report, and the editorial in <i>The Irish Independent</i> demands that the EEC should give us substantial grants and financial help.  When 83 per cent of <Col N="260" /> the people voted to enter the EEC I got the feeling that the people felt that that was the end of the story, we were in the EEC, and everything was lovely.  The Labour Party who opposed our entry&mdash;and I congratulate them on that&mdash;now realise that outside the EEC we would be gone under the water long ago.  They realise that we should be in the EEC.</P>
    <P>Many people do not realise that the EEC will not help Ireland like a father.  I am speaking now as a member of the European Parliament.  We have got more money from the Community than any other member country. The Minister for Foreign Affairs put the figure somewhere in the region of £200 million.  That includes subsidies we would have to pay towards agriculture, and so on.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation got a loan from the European Investment Bank.  The ESB got a loan there. Many private firms in manufacturing industry got money from the EEC. Surely we do not expect that we can all go on the dole and Europe will look after us.  If that is the attitude of the Government, God help Ireland. The Government are called the National Coalition.  I call them a national disaster.  If we do not look after ourselves Europe will not look after us.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to the press men who made a synopsis of the EEC Commission's Report.  I brought the report to bed with me last night and I read it.  It is fairly lengthy but I picked certain things out of it.  For example, it says that between 1961 and 1972 the number of net jobs&mdash; and &ldquo;net&rdquo; is the important word&mdash; created in this country was 3,000. That would mean that in those years about 33,000 extra jobs were created here.  They referred to the fact that in 1973-74 the net loss of jobs was 4,000.  Everybody knows what the figure is for unemployment at present and we know the problems we have to face in this regard.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in the last election gained in the region of 20,000 extra first preference votes, and we were defeated because of the fact that under PR Labour second preference <Col N="261" /> votes were transferred to Fine Gael and Fine Gael second preference votes were transferred to Labour. After all the celebrations the new Government got on the <i>Titanic</i> and had wining and dining.  They had the band playing, &ldquo;Nearer my God to Thee&rdquo;, or something like that and they went cruising until 1973 giving hand-outs all over the place.  The National Coalition were unsinkable, and they floated along rudderless and captainless, but at the end of 1974 they discovered that they could not do all these things.  The result was that we had the biggest budget of all times and this brought in £37½ million. The tax on petrol was 15p per gallon. In the following year there was an increase of 80p in the contribution by the employer to the insurance stamp and an increase of 40p on the amount paid by the employee and this brought in about £50 million.  In the budget there was additional taxation imposed on cigarettes and beer and since then we have been having a budget a day.</P>
    <P>The most serious thing facing this country is the £241 million deficit we will have towards the end of this financial year.  I would support the Minister for Finance if he wished to borrow £241 million for the provision of houses because he would get the money back in that case, but by the end of this year we will have borrowed £241 million to pay wages, salaries and debt charges.  Where will that money come from?  I believe we will have another budget in October because money will have to be found to pay for the social welfare increases to be given then, but where will we get the money to pay the deficit?  Are we going to strike oil?  Even if we strike oil it will cost twice as much to get the oil out of the sea as it costs to get it out of the sand.  The Government should not give the impression that if we strike oil our industries and our motorists will get it cheaper.</P>
    <P>When the Government talk about the GNP and external assets the ordinary people do not understand. However, a lot of people are beginning to realise what is happening in regard to the spending of money in the current account and the capital account. <Col N="262" /> I am sure Fine Gael Members at branch meetings are being asked where the Government hope to get this £241 million.  When I am asked I always give the example of the small businessman whose profits must be sufficient to pay his employees, pay the cost of transport and of his travellers.  In the case of that businessman it is not necessary for him to pay in any one year for a new van he may have to purchase or for an extension to his store.  Such a businessman can borrow that money from a bank and pay it back out of the profits over a number of years.  However, a Government cannot do that.  It can be done for the capital programme but it cannot be done with the current account programme.</P>
    <P>In the next budget the Minister for Finance, as well as providing for an increase in benefits, must also make allowances for the paying back of the money Richie got from the Arabs in his little bag.  It reminds me of a businessman who has a few credits in the various shops and when things get tight he sends a member of the staff off to see if he would get a few pounds from those people.  Richie has been the same; he has gone to the oil-producing countries looking for money.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil introduced the pay-related benefit scheme for the purpose of cushioning people who would become unemployed and who may have a car on hire purchase or an SDA loan.  The scheme was to help them during the period they were unemployed. It has come to my notice during the last few months that because of the recession towards the end of 1974 the pay-related benefit is based on the income they returned to the <Col N="263" /> Revenue Commissioners.  If a person was six months unemployed and six months at work the six months he was at work is taken into consideration in calculating the amount of unemployment benefit.  The amount they get on the unemployment benefit is not added to their total salary to make up the average weekly earnings.  As a result many of those unemployed do not receive pay-related benefit.  This matter should be considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>Regarding the availability of money for SDA loans I noticed a statement in the <i>Kilkenny People</i> a short time ago to the effect that there was lots of money available for this purpose. Every public representative has occasion from time to time to inquire as to what is the position regarding a loan facility for a constituent.  I was approached by a man who, with his family, is living in a flat and who is anxious to acquire a loan in order to buy a second-hand house.  Thinking there would be no problem because of the big allocation from the Minister for this purpose I telephoned the housing section of Kilkenny County Council only to be told that because of the shortage of capital they had decided that no loans would be made available for the purchase of houses that have been occupied previously and that, furthermore, there was such a shortage of money for SDA loans that they were considering making loans available only to applicants who had families and who wished to purchase new houses.</P>
    <P>I know that there are some honourable people on the Government benches.  Nevertheless, I would say to the Government that while they may fool some of the people some of the time it would not be advisable for them to try to fool all of the people all of the time.</P>
    <P>We are in a serious situation.  It is obvious that the farmers have no faith in the future of our economy.  Proof of this is the reduction of 40 per cent in the purchase of fertilisers.  This indicates that farmers are not prepared to buy the necessary fertilisers for the production of crops and of grass for <Col N="264" /> beef and milk production.  What we need is to instill confidence in the people and not to tell them that we would be better off if we were not in Europe, because if it is the opinion of the Government that we would be better off outside the Community they should withdraw from it.  The EEC, I am sure, would be delighted by any such move on our part because our withdrawal would mean a saving to the other member States of something in the region of £2 million to £3 million per year.  Where, then, would the Minister for Health seek money? I have always been a committed European.  If we had not been members of the Community during the past two-and-a-half years all of us here, in addition to the 120,000 unemployed and the estimated 180,000 who will be unemployed in a few months would be on the dole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief because most of the points I wish to make have been made already.  As Deputy Colley said, this Bill is an emergency measure and to that extent it is welcomed by all of us.  Since I came to this House after the last election Deputies from the Opposition have been issuing warnings as to the danger of our inflation rate running so high and as to the seriousness of the budget deficits, but we were told that everything was all right, that inflation would create employment.  As one who was merely trying to balance his own budget, I began to wonder whether we were wrong, but we have been proven right.  The Government should know now that the budget of a country must be balanced in the same way as one would balance the budget of a business.  During the past few days the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have spelled out the seriousness of the situation. However, if such speeches had been made from these benches six or eight months ago we would have been accused of creating panic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country is in very bad shape. With a budget deficit of £241 million we are heading for bankruptcy.  Any Government which a few years ago would have dared reveal a deficit of that order would not have had any <Col N="265" /> chance of survival.  I do not blame the Taoiseach personally for the situation because I consider him to have his wits about him but I blame the Government as a whole.  While some of their spending was justifiable they overspent in some areas.  One would not need to know a lot about economics to realise that it is not possible to spend any more that what one's purse allows.  Down through the years Fianna Fáil had been developing the social and health services in accordance with what the country could afford, but this Government have been spending more than the economy has been earning.  The result is the present situation.  I hope that the package being offered will be accepted and that the situation will improve.  It is no consolation to anybody on any side of the House to know that the country is in bad shape.</P>
    <P>Everybody will freely admit that the country is in a state of emergency. I think the whole question of inflation began in Europe.  Were we not in Europe at present we would be in a very bad state, but I maintain that the policies in Europe caused inflation. Our inflation commenced in anticipation of a honeymoon that did not come off.  Because of a general recession, Europe did not prove to be our fairy godmother in the way it had been presented.  I remember, on the farming scene at the time we were entering Europe, people saying to me: you do not know at what price per hundredweight cattle will sell in Europe.  I knew in my own way that, in anticipation of our entry, our prices had gone almost beyond European ones.</P>
    <P>There is no attempt being made in Europe to curtail inflation.  I believe the Community is not being run efficiently.  It seems to be merely a question of keeping prices up.  If consumer subsidies are granted both at home and in Europe, giving subsidies directly to people not receiving sufficient for their produce, it might constitute some easement of the problem, rather than driving prices upwards with consequent inflation and so on.  The important problem to be tackled at present is how we control <Col N="266" /> inflation.  We are 12 months too late endeavouring to control it here. We practically led ourselves into the belief that there was nothing about which to worry.  I began to think I was of another generation and it was silly of me to speak about balancing budgets or housekeeping; that it was a case that everything was going fine because we were led to believe, in Government circles, there was no worry at all with regard to borrowing; continue to borrow and one will be all right.  I know from experience over the years that if one continues to borrow for non-productive purposes, one does not know where one will finish.  That is as true today as it was years ago.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure as an attempt, even at this late hour, to stop the roaring inflation bringing this country very near to bankruptcy. At present were it not for the man now sitting in the front benches over there, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, there would not be so many people living on social welfare, thanks to the good job he is doing.  They have no other means available to them except social welfare benefits.  Fair play to the Parliamentary Secretary, while he is able to get the money he is certainly doing a good job.  That is the reason that there is no terrible anxiety being felt as yet because everybody is managing all right.  But people are beginning to ask: will this continue?  That is the kernel: one can continue to pay while one continues to receive the money but eventually there comes a close down.  That is when hardship is imposed on people, when they realise that they cannot continue and, unless some attempt is made at controlling inflation such people will be placed in a bad position.</P>
    <P>For instance, taking the present unemployment situation, were it not for the amount of pay-related benefit and redundancy payments being made, such unemployed people would be in a dire situation.  But if any of such benefits ceased we would be confronted with a very annoyed community. At present everything is being done to soften the blow for <Col N="267" /> those people unemployed.  The point I make is that it is doubtful whether we will be able to continue such benefits unless there is bestowed on us another fairy godmother.</P>
    <P>If we continue borrowing abroad, at very high interest rates, where will we end up?  It must eventually lead to bankruptcy unless it is curtailed.  Those are simple, ordinary housekeeping facts.  I believe the Government have not made a good job of the housekeeping of the nation.  There is lack of confidence in industry, in the farming community and particularly amongst the smaller farmers.  There are the people who are not now utilising artificial manure, which shows a drop of 40 per cent, and which must interfere with production.</P>
    <P>Then there is the plight of the person who is engaged in calf production and who had to almost give them away this year, leading to a drop in the cattle population.  I hope that, in a couple of years' time, we may have a scarcity of cattle here.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that it should be the policy of any Government to balance the economy.  We have been inclined over the years to say: you cannot produce too much of such and such a commodity.  For instance, there is at present a danger of a pile-up of milk powder and products.  Only a few years ago we were told we could not produce sufficient milk.  Immediately there was an abundance of it and we were told then to change over to beef; then back to milk; you will be quite safe in doing so.</P>
    <P>No matter how one manages an economy the old saying obtains today just as it did years ago&mdash;do not put all your eggs in one basket; rather the balancing of the economy should be the policy of any Government.  For instance, if it pays very well for a short time to produce a certain type of commodity, be it sheep&mdash;I should not even mention sheep at present they are so bad&mdash;but whatever may be the commodity, do not rush madly into its production at the expense of other lines.  I am a believer in direct subsidies being given always.  I am against <Col N="268" /> driving up prices, leading to artificial prices for commodities.  Rather I believe prices should be allowed to find their own level and, when they go below a level that is economic to the producer he should receive a direct subsidy.  That would not affect the cost of living, so eliminating the possibility of inflation.</P>
    <P>I believe that policy will have to be introduced in Europe.  Instead of expending a lot of the money to maintain artificially high prices, funds should be created in Europe for the subsidisation of a particular commodity when it falls below a reasonable price to its producer.  Everything appears to have been done in Europe in an effort to ascertain the millions that would have to be fed and the amount of money needed if those people were to continue eating the same type of food.  But no attempt was made to study consumption. Therefore, when one permits prices to go beyond the means of the ordinary consumer, consumption of that commodity drops.  I am surprised that the European Economic Community, with its Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, did not ensure more control of that market. One would imagine they would have been able to predict fairly accurately production and consumption within that market but seemingly they have been unable to do so in any accurate way.  The speeches delivered by the Taoiseach and by Dr. FitzGerald after the recent Summit Meeting were not hopeful.  Had any study been undertaken of production and consumption within the market, surely it would have been possible for somebody to come up with a solution to the present crisis.  As far as I can see &mdash;and again it is an old saying&mdash;there do not appear to be any readymade experts in this country, in Europe, or in the world for that matter.  If there were, some people could get wealthy very quickly.  If a person continues to spend in excess of his earnings he is bound to go to the wall.  If he borrows for productive purposes, for capital expenditure to expand a business that is all right, but where a person borrows for other purposes he is <Col N="269" /> on the wrong road.  Eventually he will have to pay back the money in addition to the interest.</P>
    <P>We all hope that the package now being offered will be accepted and that the action being taken will curb inflation.  When we were discussing the budget I said that no one, irrespective of his political views, wants to see our country going the wrong way.  It does not help any one if the country is not in a prosperous state. There is more at stake at the moment than scoring political points.  We are in an emergency situation and we must get this across to the people. People were under the impression that Fianna Fáil were creating the atmosphere of emergency for political purposes but now the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have admitted that Fianna Fáil were right and that there is an emergency.  They have told us that if certain actions are not taken the country will not survive. On a radio programme last Sunday the Minister for Foreign Affairs issued a very strict warning and did not hold out much hope for a change in the near future.  It is no use our telling the people that everything in the garden is rosy because that is not the situation.  At the moment we are spending money and hoping for the best.  We are not getting an adjournment debate and, therefore, we must take this opportunity of stressing the seriousness of the situation.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said he was fed up listening to me talking about farming and silage but if he knows a little more about these matters some good may have come out of it.  I have heard very little discussion about the smaller farmers in the west.  I can assure Deputies I will keep them informed of what is happening to the people I represent.  When I first came into this House I found that most Deputies knew nothing about the way of life of the people in the west.</P>
    <P>People in my area are getting a rough time at the moment.  The year 1974 was one of the worst years for the smaller farmers.  I am most interested in these people and in the <Col N="270" /> workers.  At the moment the workers are hard hit, so far as employment is concerned, but at least they can get some help from the Department of Social Welfare.  However, there is a major worry whether the money will continue to be available.  If it does not I shiver to think what will happen. Irrespective of their political viewpoint, it is not in the interest of anyone that things should get more serious.  Even at this late hour I am glad the Government have told the people that there is an emergency and that certain action must be taken. It should have been taken 12 months ago.  We are now trying to steer the ship away from the rocks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is quite correct.  Last January one did not need to be overflowing with intelligence to realise that this package was needed before the national wage agreement was negotiated.  I will not dwell on that aspect because I do not wish to say anything that might prejudice acceptance of the package. It should have been obvious then that action was necessary but none are as blind as those who do not want to see.  It is regrettable that it is only now the Government have explained the situation.  They have made statements I would be slow to make; I would hesitate to paint as gloomy a picture as was done by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. After hearing the latter on the radio programme last week people asked me if the situation was really so bad. I explained that while I might not go so far as the Minister the situation was serious.  The pity is that people were led to believe by Government propaganda that everything in the garden was rosy but anyone with common sense must have known that was not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farming community have no confidence in the Government.  Daily we read of workers being made redundant. I am lucky that in my town two factories are doing very well and one is expanding its business.  An <Col N="271" /> attempt is now being made to help the shoe industry; it will be a very difficult job and it is another area where action should have been taken long before this.</P>
    <P>We have a habit of locking the stable door after the horse has bolted. This is very bad policy.  There is a serious situation now regarding the French and the lamb trade but the action proposed should have been taken much earlier.  It has been a disastrous year for the sheep farmers and it is dreadful that the French who are signatories to the Treaty of Rome should violate the principles of that treaty.  As I said before, we support fully any action being taken.  The only trouble is that all the Government actions are taken too late.  They are prepared to let matters go too far and hope for the best.  Decision-making is of vital importance but the Government have not accepted their responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I hope we have not gone too far, that this Bill will be passed by the Dáil without opposition and the package accepted.  For the sake of the country, I hope things take a turn for the better.</P>

      <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to speak very briefly on this Bill.  I was rather surprised to hear my colleague and friend, Deputy Callanan, speak of agriculture and repeat many times that the farmers have no confidence in their future.  I cannot understand how any progressive farmer who thinks for himself can feel insecure or lack the confidence necessary for a viable business.  One has only to look at the facts.  Over the last three years the price paid by the creameries has almost trebled, from 11p to almost 31p this year, and the farming industry enjoy guarantees they never had before.  The guarantees to the whole Community under the guidance section of FEOGA Fund this year amounted to approximately 52,000 million units of account.  Our farmers, in common with the farmers in other parts of the Community, have access to this fund and have benefited from it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>To practically every farmer in the country.  The figures are there to prove that the money was paid.  More cattle were sold over the past couple of years than ever before and the prices paid were greater too.</P>
      <P>I hope the new increase for the price of milk announced by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries this week, which will come into effect later this year and was the result of the 5 per cent devaluation of the representative rate of the Green £ will be passed on by the processors to the farmers.</P>
      <P>The last time I inquired I was told that we were not placing any powered milk or milk products into the intervention system.  Many of our competitors in the Community are putting considerable quantities of skim milk powder into the intervention.  If the figures show that the price paid to the Irish farmers is 2p or 3p per gallon less than anywhere else in the Community, and if our partners can pay a higher price for milk and still put the finished product into intervention, there is no reason why our processing industry should not do the same.  It is reasonable to accept that the cost of production will be lower here than in any other EEC country.  Therefore the farmers can expect to get the full increase which was won for them by the Minister this week directly into their pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last few months in every debate in this House, no matter what new measure was announced or how high the expenditure, there has been a sustained cry from the Opposition benches that this was an effort to keep <Col N="273" /> abreast of inflation and was no use to the ordinary Irish citizen.  This is where the lack of confidence lies.  People are being told day by day that there is a lack of confidence and a dim future ahead.  We must look at the positive side and face the problems squarely. Even though there is a recession all over the world, and if we compare the progress made in the Community with the rest of the world, and compare the level at which our Government have managed to keep the economy with even powerful economies in the Community, we will see that this Administration has succeeded to an extraordinary degree.  It is not really fair to compare our economy with the economies of member states, because that is not comparing like with like.</P>
    <P>When we joined the Community we guaranteed ourselves a good bargain because for the £5 million or £7 million we contribute per year, we get back many times that amount.  In addition to the £100 million we got by way of intervention last year, through other channels we must have got another £100 million.  This has been of tremendous benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Local Government announced a sizeable increase for SDA loans.  In my county he has provided £660,000 for loans this year compared with £150,000 last year. The only salute it got so far was that it did not keep abreast with inflation. The Government are making a tremendous effort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have provided finance for houses in a very determined and successful way, despite the rising prices of imported raw materials.  They have provided this opportunity of keeping the industries moving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take each line of agricultural husbandry and go through them one by one we will find that many farmers last year may not have been able to show a very significant profit.  Nevertheless prices have been increasing. Farmers during the transitional period are endeavouring to produce the lines <Col N="274" /> and products on which there are guarantees.  This is one problem where the smaller farmer is at a disadvantage. While the medium-sized and big farmer can switch, the smaller man is unable to do that.  He must sell his yearlings.  This is a pity and every effort should be made to encourage the small farmer to keep on his cattle until they are the right size and weight to qualify for intervention. Last year realistic prices were not paid.  Would it be possible for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to pay intervention premiums in respect of the actual carcases on which the factories paid intervention prices?</P>

This situation is nothing new.  It has existed for many years.  However, significant progress has been made.

      <P>This Bill should be well received by both sides of the House.  I have not heard any dissident voices raised against it except by those Members who have spoken on the Opposition benches.  I believe people appreciate this determined effort by the Government to bring prices down.  New hope has been given to the people because they have been shown that it is possible to do this.  Again, this Government have given very many reliefs to the lower income groups and to those dependent on pensions and social welfare. Very moderate increases are asked for under this Bill and I believe that taxpayers as a whole are prepared to meet these increases.  By and large, the bulk of the people are prepared to support the Government and cooperate with them in ensuring that the country will emerge from the <Col N="276" /> international depression in due process of time.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill and I compliment the Minister for Finance on introducing new thinking into legislation.  I trust the legislation will get the cooperation for which the Government have asked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

      <P>One wonders, listening to the last speaker, why the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs found it necessary to make the statements they did over the past few days pointing out the desperate plight in which the economy finds itself.  The Taoiseach at one stage said we were living on borrowed time and on the goodwill of our creditors.  That is the position and it is native for anyone to come in here and pretend no problems exist.  We face a very grave economic crisis, a very grave unemployment crisis and a very grave inflation crisis.</P>
      <P>The Government have taken some action but as usual they have taken this action too late.  All the time of the Dáil in this session has been taken up with wealth tax, capital gains tax and in the Seanad, the Criminal Jurisdiction Bill.  There have been very few positive Bills introduced here to try to attack the problems facing the country.  I wonder are the Deputies on the Government side aware of the fact that the farmer, the small farmer especially, has had the worst two years in his history almost in the last two years, that we are fast becoming a dole-ridden society, that we have more people drawing social welfare benefits now than we ever had in the history of the State, and that we have the highest rate of inflation of any country in the Community.  That is because of mismanagement in Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the social welfare increases is that there were so many people unemployed. Their silence is being bought, but there is a limit to how long that silence can be bought.  The people will eventually demand from this Government positive action for the <Col N="277" /> creation of new jobs, for the attacking of the inflation spiral that is continuous. The people are asking the Government to show that they are the Government of the country and that no outside body is running the country.  We are asking our Government to govern.  This Government got into power on many promises but the basic promise was an economic one, a pegging of prices.  They promised that they would ensure that not alone were prices pegged but in some cases reduced.  We all know what has happened to that promise.</P>
      <P>The middle income group are again being asked to bear the burden of the Government's mismanagement.  The easy way out is to shove more taxation on to the middle income group. They are carrying the burden anyway and they are fast becoming the poorest members of our society because they get nothing for nothing. They must pay for medical care, they must pay interest on their mortgages and they must pay full prices for everything.  They get no hand-outs from the Government. They are the people we are crucifying and we are not even taking the smallest step towards alleviating their plight.</P>

      <P>I am trying to show that because of the fact that we have various socialist Ministers going around pushing for the type of legislation that, in my view, is unnecessary in this House the major obstacles facing the advancement of our economy are being neglected.  &ldquo;Tax the Wealthy&rdquo; is a great slogan.  Everybody agrees with it. But who are the wealthy?  Where are they?  I do not think they are in this country in the numbers that some Ministers seem to think.  We are not going to make the poor richer by taking from the people who, through their enterprise and their initiative, would be creating more employment. Because we have introduced capital taxation at the rate we have done we are deterring people from risking their money in order to create more employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the vast majority of the Members of the Government feel as I do on this and I hope the day of hand-outs and of socialist cliches is gone. We must get down now to the nitty-gritty of creating employment.  How do we do that?  We certainly do not do it by extra taxation.  The best way we can go about encouraging people to come in here and set up industry is by making this country a less tax-burdened country.  In other words, rather than introducing new taxation Bills we should be reducing the taxation burden the people bear.  If we did that people, especially very clever and astute businessmen, would appreciate the fact that this was a place to invest their money.  That is what we want.  We want investment in our country not just by way of people depositing <Col N="279" /> money in our banks but by way of people investing their skills and technological know-how for the benefit of our people.</P>
    <P>It does not give any of us any pleasure to say that the country is in a bad state, because it reflects on all of us, but the Government should pay heed to the fact that we want Government from them.  We want them to govern, to get down to the business not of increasing unemployment benefits but of creating jobs for people.  I believe that nobody enjoys being paid unemployment benefit.  Most people have the dignity to want to work and earn their money.  However, we seem to have a pathological urge at present to encourage people not to work, to pay more to people for not working than is being paid to people who are working.  Surely no country can afford to carry on with that type of ridiculous philosophy.  Eventually the buck has to stop and somebody must pay the piper.  We in this House must get down to the very serious business of creating more jobs for our people and of ensuring that we are benefiting to the maximum from our membership of the EEC.  Deputy McDonald tried to show that membership of the EEC was advantageous to every farmer and that they were all paid grants as a result.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said every farmer benefited from schemes paid for by the EEC.  I am totally committed to membership of the EEC and I would like it if that were true, and we were benefiting from our membership, but unfortunately that is not the case.  The reason is that people who are now members of the Government led the campaign against the EEC and they are sabotaging any of the benefits we could get from the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked him on several occasions in this House.  It would be very interesting to get a reply from him.  That is what is wrong with the country at the moment.  We are not gaining the advantages from membership that we should gain because there are people in our Government who oppose membership of the EEC.</P>
      <P>It is very interesting for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to go around the country talking about BBC 1 or an RTE second channel. When you are discussing something like that, you are discussing something which is relatively unimportant, and you are diverting people's attention away from the fact that there are no jobs available for their children, that the economic future is bleak, that even the gate of emigration has now been closed because our neighbours across the water find themselves in an equally disastrous position because of Government mismanagement.</P>
      <P>When all the tours around the country are finished and all the talk about the various TV channels and the technicalities involved in receiving the various television stations, we will still have to provide employment for our people, and feed our people. In any country where the priorities are right, every Minister of the Government of that country should be devoting all his energies to trying to solve these problems.  With a few exceptions nobody in our Government is facing up to the realities of the situation.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have faced up to them, and they spelled out clearly the type of action we must take.  I agree with the Taoiseach when he says the way the consumer price index is calculated is not in the best interests of everybody.  We will have to have another look at that.  We must have the courage and the guts to fight about it if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want the Government to govern. It is all right to govern when everybody <Col N="281" /> is in agreement with you, but the real test of Government comes when there are people who disagree with you and who could put very serious political obstacles in front of you.  The true test of good Government will be whether they can overcome and surmount these obstacles. As sure as night follows day, those obstacles are there and they will have to be overcome if the country is to survive.</P>
    <P>I referred to the plight of the middle-income group.  With the rate of taxation they are paying at the moment and the rate of inflation&mdash;and in most cases they are the least well organised in trade unions&mdash;they must cry &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; sometime, that they have had enough, that they cannot go on any longer, that the burden is too great.  They are probably the least complaining and the most self-sufficient of any section in the community. It is unfair of the Government to burden those people with further taxation because they are not complaining, or because they have not got the channels for effective complaint.</P>
    <P>We must refer to the plight of the small farmer.  I come from a constituency in south-west Cork which has many small farmers, many of them on uneconomic units.  These people are crying out for employment allied to agriculture.  At one time Dunmanway was a thriving market town.  Now the population is diminishing. The establishment of even a small industry there would be a great boon rather than having people queueing up at the unemployment office, signing on, and collecting unemployment benefit.  The people of Dunmanway, and the people of west Cork in general, would much prefer to have employment available to them rather than hand-outs.  If we had that type of development we would have a far healthier society which could not be described as a sponger's society.</P>
    <P>We are becoming a dole society.  We are also becoming a sponger's society. We sponge left, right and centre for everything we think we can get away with.  This is encouraged by the Government. People are told about the fantastic benefits they can get for not <Col N="282" /> working.  This is most unfair to the people who are working, the people who are endeavouring to keep up appearances, and pay their way, and give their children many of the benefits they did not have.  We must get our priorities right.  We have to get down to business.  Deputy Governey may laugh.  He may think the Government have their priorities right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>If he thinks that cavorting around the country as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is doing at the moment talking about BBC 1 or RTE 2 is a proper priority he must rethink that one again.  That is an act of complete irresponsibility by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Criticisms are levelled at this side of the House because we do not say that everything in the garden is rosy or that the Government are doing a good job.  We are told that we are sowing dissention.  The Taoiseach, an honest man, came out with an unambiguous statement when he said that we have to straighten things out, we have to pull up our socks and face reality.  One cannot have anything but admiration for a man who is prepared to state the harsh realities of the situation unambiguously. For a Member on the Government side to say that we do not have any problems, that we do not have an economic crisis, indicates that he is either stupid, naive or downright untruthful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must endeavour to ensure that inflation is stemmed and that the subsidies will have the desired effect the Minister envisaged when he introduced them.  I am afraid this will not happen and we must keep at the Government to ensure that they do the job in a proper way.  We have to keep at them to make sure that the £1 is not reduced in value by 50p within a few weeks.  If this Bill makes the people aware of the problems and instils in the Government a desire to improve the economic situation it is worthy of support but we have had so many rosy promises from the Government that it is hard to believe that that is the case. In their 14-point plan which they presented to the electorate the National <Col N="283" /> Coalition promised to get rid of death duties, but they have replaced that system of taxation with three forms of tax.  For this reason one cannot be blamed for viewing any Bill introduced by the Government with the deepest suspicion.  We want this Government to act as a Government, whether they are socialists or Fine Gael, and we want them to use that platform to lead and direct the country in the proper direction so that our people can be guaranteed employment and a better standard of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. The last speaker was doubtful if the Government were facing the realities of the situation and if they had their priorities right.  That speaker referred to me during the course of his contribution, but surely I am entitled to listen to any Member here.  I should like to mention a number of interesting facts about the debate on this Bill.  The Taoiseach drew the attention of the House to the fact that with effect from 1st July the zero rating of VAT will apply to personal clothing, footwear, certain clothing materials, electricity and fuels generally other than oil used in road vehicles.  On two occasions in the last 12 months the Opposition introduced Private Members' motions expressing their concern about the position in the footwear industry but, in spite of the fact that the Minister for Finance has removed VAT from footwear now, the Opposition have not expressed any welcome for this move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a Member since 1961 and I make no apology for the priorities of the Government.  We told the people that our first priority would be to ensure that the less well off in our society would be looked after.  The Minister for Finance in the budgets he has introduced has given a great lift to the less privileged in our society, the biggest lift ever given to those people in the history of the State.  No Government ever faced up to realities as this Government have done.  They have shouldered their responsibilities in the last two years.  Unpopular decisions were taken but they were taken for the benefit of the less well off.  The <Col N="284" /> Government did not shirk their responsibility in regard to extra taxation, mainly because that extra taxation was to be channelled in the right direction.</P>
    <P>During the past two-and-a-half years this Government have ensured that any taxation collected under the various headings was channelled in the proper direction and was used primarily to benefit those whom we undertook, as our first priority, to look after.  After that priority, any taxation was channelled, under the direction of the Minister for Finance, in the most appropriate direction.</P>
    <P>Having spent about 11 years on the benches opposite I know how easy it is to speak critically from the Opposition side in relation to the Government of the day.  However, having regard to the legislation that has been introduced by this Government I doubt if anybody could honestly be critical of us.  The previous speaker referred to the question of death duties.  In the 14-point programme, Fine Gael, at the last general election&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are Fine Gael the National Coalition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are a National Coalition Government.  At the last election we put before the people a 14-point programme which was agreed by both parties in this Coalition. Lest the Deputy opposite may be endeavouring to put me off my track I would remind him that we promised in that programme to abolish death duties.  We have honoured this promise and, consequently, death duties have been abolished from 1st April last.  Deputy Crowley referred to the replacement of this form of tax by three other forms of taxation.  The Deputy has been in public life long enough to realise that death duties could not be abolished without their being replaced by some other form of taxation. Before the election we left nobody under any illusion regarding the abolition of death duties.  While we said that they would be removed we emphasised that they would be replaced by another form of taxation. Perhaps the people opposite thought <Col N="285" /> we could not honour our promise. About two days before the election they announced a grandiose plan of removing rates from house property and, I think, all other property also. They were promising a bonanza for all.  However, the electorate were wise enough to put their confidence in us and it cannot be said that we have failed them since coming to office.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I trust that the House will agree to accept this Bill and will realise that any action taken by the Minister is in the best interests of the country.  There have been problems. We still have the problem of inflation but as the Taoiseach said this morning inflation must be reduced to a reasonable level.  This is the objective of this Bill and, therefore, I trust that in the interests of all sections of the community both sides of the House will agree on this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the previous speaker leaves the House I should like to advert to a couple of points he made.  He mentioned that this party had introduced a Private Members' motion dealing with the state of the footwear industry.  As a constructive Opposition it was our duty to introduce that motion.  Deputy Governey seeks credit for this Government for their action in removing VAT from footwear and he contends that this will result in saving the industry.  However, I wonder if the Deputy realises that VAT is being removed also from imported footwear so that, to that extent, there is no benefit for the Irish footwear industry in this measure.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred, too, to the 14-point programme of the Coalition.  I thought that programme had gone to dust but I admire the Deputy's courage in endeavouring to raise it at this stage.  Obviously, he was not sure as to who were its authors.  I should have thought that it was the duty of a Government to look after all sections of a community.  Perhaps the poorer sections needed greater attention but one would have expected a Government programme to include all sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Governey said it was easy to <Col N="286" /> be critical when in Opposition.  Will he not agree that there is not one economic correspondent, not one politician who would contradict that this Opposition were correct in their economic forecasting?  While Deputy Colley's forecasting was right, the Government's was hopelessly wrong.  At this stage we are in need of an uplift to pull our people together to take on the mammoth task.  A government giving a lead would have to provide the correct atmosphere for our people in which to tackle that task.  Has that atmosphere been created?  Our people look to this House for a lead.  What have they discovered?  Merely burdens and more burdens.  We merely have to look at this Government's history&mdash; three budgets which were a flop and nothing more.</P>
    <P>I remember the Minister for Finance saying here that he had inherited a deficit of £5 million when he assumed office and mentioning that he could not find the £30 million we had received from the EEC.  A few short months afterwards I recall the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries coming in and acknowledging the fact of those £30 million.  Even at that stage we could foresee the type of government we would have&mdash;a government without direction pulling themselves like a whirlwind.  Certainly that whirlwind has built up from a first budget, with a deficit of from £60 million to £70 million which included the famous claw-back on the children's allowances, to the second one, when we saw that claw-back removed and when the deficit rose to £125 million.  Of course, in between we had increased postal and telephone charges together with a further imposition on the social welfare stamp, all constituting a terrible burden on our people wishing to pull the country out of the fire.  They are continuously being oppressed by measures taken here.  For example, what about the 15 pence on the price of petrol?  Then we progressed to the third budget which was short-lived. We have now reached a stage of having a deficit of £241 million.  Along with that there have been the financial measures such as wealth tax and <Col N="287" /> capital gains tax.  Where is the climate or incentive for our people to work? When will the Government realise our people expect a lead?  We have known for many a long day that there is no Messiah in their midst.  We wonder what they will do next as a government; where they will go?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has adopted a spoiled boy attitude&mdash;if the package does not work we shall have the big stick taken to us.  In my opinion he was the first flop of the Government on television.  Even the famous Government Information Bureau and all its backup men could not bolster him up to face that Sunday afternoon interview when, in a few short minutes, he changed his mind two or three times.  The crack had come very much into the open.</P>
    <P>Who leads the country?  Let us examine what this financial measure endeavours to do.  It is to reduce the cost of living by 4 per cent.  What did the last budget do?  It raised the cost of living by 4 per cent.  The damage had been done then and this will undo it.  We are merely reverting to the &ldquo;stop, go&rdquo; method of operation. There was one famous week in which we had Ministers shuffling around the country announcing good news.  Suddenly the big change came about.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs came out shouting that something was wrong.  The Minister for Finance then came out with the statement that all in the garden was not rosy. When was all in the garden last rosy? I would suggest it was early 1973.</P>
    <P>There have been many problems created by the Government.  The question can rightly be asked at present: who leads the country?  Is it the Taoiseach or is it the unions?  Our people no longer rely on this House; they are waiting on the unions to come to a decision whether they will accept this package.  I wonder are we wasting time discussing this Finance (No. 2) Bill when the Minister has said that if the package is not accepted it will be withdrawn.  Let us remember all the time the Government have wasted in this House peddling along.  This measure is supposed <Col N="288" /> to be a step forward.  I very much doubt that.  Rather I regard it as merely a baby step.  We have had the spending spree.  Under the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power we had to make more money available to CIE.  The blunt reality was contained in the Minister for Transport and Power's brief when he spoke about the lack of return on carriage of bulk cement.  Yet we have statistics on houses and buildings. Where?  One Minister says we have them.  Another Minister says the carriage was down.</P>
    <P>The farming community are worried.  On Monday last I met a deputation from the East Wicklow milk producers who were very worried about the wealth tax.  I am glad the Taoiseach is hear to hear me.  They are very worried and have no confidence in the Government.  I could say many more things with regard to farmers but I want to allow a colleague an opportunity to speak.</P>

Who blames people becoming cynical about politics when one sees this ruthless exercise of power by the Government? Those are some of the realities Deputy Governey forgot to articulate when he made his short contribution.</P>
      <P>When speaking on the Bill itself we must recognise that as a responsible Opposition, we have a responsibility in the present economic mess in which the country finds itself and that anything that we might say in the course of this debate should not harm the prospects of any agreement that may be reached on wage agreements.  It is as well to insert that preamble before one contributes to this debate.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to appreciate that the budget we are now considering, and which gave rise to this Bill, was introduced on the 26th June, 1975, which is almost a month ago.  It was the intention of that budget to reduce the cost of living by 4 per cent.  Would a parliamentary question elicit how much the cost of living has increased between 26th June, 1975 and 26th July, 1975?</P>

    <Title>Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill, 1975: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase the limits imposed by the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Acts, 1963 and 1970, on the issue and taking up of the share capital of NET and on the amount that the company may borrow under ministerial guarantee.  These increases are considered essential to enable the company's proposed ammonia/urea complex at Marino Point, Cork Harbour to be financed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> The Bill proposes to increase the authorised share capital of NET from the present statutory limit of £7.5 million to £27.5 million.  It further provides that the Minister for Finance may take up or purchase shares of the company up to a limit of £22.5 million and that the taking up by the Minister for Finance of any additional shares in excess of £22.5 million, up to the new limit of £27.5 million, would be subject to prior Government approval.  It was considered desirable to include this latter provision as it was felt that in the future and in certain circumstances the Minister for Finance might wish to subscribe for additional share capital of the company.  Section 3 of the Bill proposes to enable him to do this up to a limit of £5 million without the necessity of enacting further legislation. In addition, the Bill proposes to increase the limit on the guaranteeing by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of borrowings by the company from the present limit of £2 million to a new limit of £30 million.</P>
    <P>In order that Deputies should fully appreciate the need for the increases proposed, I will outline the main features of the Marino Point project. Briefly, the company are building a 1,350 tonnes per day ammonia plant and a 1,000 tonnes per day urea plant using natural gas from the Kinsale Head find as feedstock.  The annual production of the plants will be 435,000 tonnes and 310,000 tonnes respectively. Work on the project, which has already commenced, will take about three years to complete.  The ammonia produced will be utilised mainly in the making of nitrogenous fertiliser, calcium ammonium nitrate and urea, which are straight nitrogenous fertilisers used mainly on grassland.  It is estimated that the output from the new complex will secure essential supplies of nitrogen to the farmer for the next decade and make this country independent of outside sources of supply of this commodity which is vitally necessary for the future development and expansion of the country's agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The capital cost of the project is estimated at £42 million and allowing for other costs such as working capital requirements, price escalation, preproduction <Col N="291" /> expenses and preproduction interest repayments, the total cost could be as high as £63.5 million.  This is by any standard a massive investment but one which, I feel, is justified when one considers the long-term benefits and security which will accrue to the country's biggest industry.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the required finance will be provided in the following manner:</P>
    <P>Share capital to be provided by the Minister for Finance, £15 million; IDA grant to be paid during the period 1975-1979, £5 million; Remainder from the company's own resources including borrowings, £43.5 million (estimated).</P>
    <P>From these figures the need for the proposed new minsterial guarantee limit on the company's borrowings can be readily appreciated.  However, despite the anticipated heavy scale of borrowings the company are confident because of the expected profit-making capacity of the project that all borrowings can be repaid by the end of 1982. At this stage, in commenting on the viability of the project, I consider it relevant to point out that because of the committed high level of State investment it is proposed to amend the company's articles of association to provide for the payment of dividends. In other words, the State can expect from 1982 onwards to obtain a return from its heavy investment in NET.</P>
    <P>Apart from securing supplies of vital fertilisers to the farmer, this project will benefit the country in another very significant area.  I refer to the improved balance of payments situation which will result from the project. It has been estimated that at current world price levels the new plants when in full operation will benefit the country's balance of payments to the extent of £60 million per annum.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend the Bill for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to state we have no objection to the Bill.  We are glad to see Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta involved in the development of natural gas in Cork. <Col N="292" /> We are happy to welcome any legislative provisions that are necessary to develop that proposed involvement. However, there are several matters that are relevant to the position of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta and to the fertiliser industry generally on which I should like to comment.  I am disappointed the Minister failed to refer to them, particularly at this time.</P>
      <P>His speech was quite short.  The general purpose of the Bill is to do something that is of far-reaching importance. In the words of the chairman of NET, it is the outstanding development in the history of that company and it is the first practical usage of the off-shore resources we have been fortunate enough to find in the last few years.</P>
      <P>While the Bill is only amending capital and borrowing figures it is of great significance.  It is very unfortunate that a Bill of this kind, that gives us the first opportunity to discuss the usage of natural gas that was discovered in this country three years ago, should be guillotined and that the Second Stage debate will be confined to one hour.  As the Minister made a very short speech I have no doubt I will be able to confine my remarks to less than an hour but numerous other Deputies are interested in this matter also.  Unfortunately they will not get the opportunity to discuss it and to ask questions.</P>
      <P>I suggest at this stage, before we start this debate, that the Government consider lifting the guillotine imposed on this Bill which is very important and non-controversial.  This would enable it to be discussed properly and would allow four or five Deputies, who to my knowledge have expressed an interest, to contribute to this debate by asking a number of questions.  It is only in this debate that we will get any information on these matters.  Unfortunately, we find it very difficult to get information in relation to many of these things outside a debate such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons why we welcome this Bill is that it gives a prospect to the Irish farmer of obtaining important basic fertilisers in a few <Col N="293" /> years' time at a reasonable price.  In the past two years the price of Irish manufactured fertilisers has increased by approximately 250 per cent on average.  One of the results is that in the latter part of 1974 and the early part of 1975, the usage of Irish fertilisers dropped by about 40 per cent. This is a very serious situation not just for NET as a company, Gouldings and Albatros, but it is a serious national problem because our agricultural output is bound to fall as a result of the under-usage of fertiliser. The under-usage of fertilisers by Irish farmers over the past year or so is attributable, they say, exclusively to the fact that the price of what NET Gouldings and Albatros are producing has gone sky high and it is impossible for the farmers to afford the necessary investment to put adequate quantities of fertiliser on their lands.</P>
    <P>The long-term problems that will cause are serious and are adverted to in the annual report of NET.  We were very fortunate last year that in spite of the drop of hay and silage, the 1974-75 winter was extremely mild and a large number of cattle who would otherwise not have been able to do so got through that winter.</P>
    <P>The growing season in 1975 has been unfavourable so far.  There has been an abnormally long period of extremely dry weather.  The silage and hay crops which have been saved this year are well down on the average yield farmers have come to expect over recent years.  Many farms which were providing two silage crops in the summer have been lucky to get one fairly light crop this year.  In many cases, hay fields in traditional meadows were down by as much as 50 per cent on last year and earlier years.</P>
    <P>One of the results of this is that if we get even a normal winter this year our farmers will face serious difficulties. Anything that could overcome that situation of extraordinarily dear Irish fertiliser is to be welcomed.  If, as a result of the proposed development at Marino Point we get cheaper fertiliser, the sooner that factory is built and in production the better.</P>
    <P>One of the things we have not been told, even though an announcement <Col N="294" /> was made in the last week of the signing of an agreement between Marathon and the Irish Gas Board for the purchase of gas, is what the price being paid to Marathon is.  It is impossible for anyone to make an estimate of what the likely cost of production by NET at Marino Point will be.  The Gas Board may not want to state the price they will pay Marathon for the gas and there may be good reasons for that.  They may have to deal with other people later on.  Whatever price has been agreed between the Gas Board and NET should be disclosed to enable people to do the necessary calculations to try to work out the likely cost of the production of ammonia and urea.</P>
    <P>NET and other Irish fertiliser manufacturers are complaining of a reduction of 40 per cent in the usage of Irish fertiliser.  So far as one can judge there may not have been an overall reduction of 40 per cent in actual usage.  At the moment there are fairly considerable imports of fertiliser of a type manufactured by NET, Gouldings and Albatros, coming from Portugal.  This has benefited the farmers considerably.  Of course, it causes problems for our manufacturers of fertilisers.  The Minister and the Government, and all who talk about it, are in the classic dilemma that we either leave it alone and try to help the farmers, or do not leave it alone and try to help the workers and manufacturers of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>I understand the Dumping Commission are urgently examining the question of these imports at the moment and that a report is expected shortly.  I do not know what their findings will be.  I had hoped that the Minister would have dealt more generally with the whole situation of the fertiliser industry here.  He must be aware of the serious situation in which Gouldings, one of the largest, if not the largest, manufacturers of compounds and other fertilisers, find themselves in at present.  There is a widespread belief&mdash;although I do not think it is officially confirmed as yet &mdash;that a large number of men will be laid off in the future by Gouldings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> One hopes that that might not be true, but I understand it is true, and it is only a question of what proportion of their work force will be laid off.  Happily NET have not reached that situation yet, but I understand they have very heavy stocks and cannot guarantee that none of their employees will be declared redundant in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>These are matters I would have wished the Minister to deal with because they are very relevant and pertinent to this Bill.  It would have been important for the Minister to deal with these as there are considerable rumours circulating in Dublin in relation to at least one large manufacturer of fertilisers, other than NET. These rumours, if left uncontradicted, can only do harm.  That is why even though he has not dealt with them in his opening speech, I hope that in his reply or in the course of this debate the Minister will deal with the situation which now exists in Gouldings.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that Gouldings are a public company, without State participation, they are supposed to be in direct competition with NET, are very much involved in the same kind of market and are meeting the same kind of problems as NET.  If Gouldings have problems and difficulties&mdash; and it is widely stated that they have &mdash;can the Minister give an assurance that NET is in a stronger position?</P>
    <P>The annual report of NET was issued a week or two ago.  Unfortunately, it does not make very happy reading.  The loss sustained by NET for the 18 months to the 31st December, 1974, was fairly considerable&mdash; £691,000, as against a reasonable profit in the 12 month period ended June, 1973.  So far as one knows the position has, if anything, deteriorated since the 31st December, 1974.  The bank overdraft increased between June, 1973, and December, 1974, from £3 million to £8.5 million.  The company seems to be very heavily borrowed and, at the same time, is carrying extremely heavy stocks at presumably considerable cost to itself in terms of interest.</P>
    <P>Because of the serious situation for <Col N="296" /> agriculture at the moment in relation to the usage of fertiliser, it is very important that the Minister make it clear at the earliest possible time&mdash;I suggest this debate is the ideal opportunity&mdash; what proposals the Government have for reducing the price of Irish fertilisers in order to encourage their use by farmers because, if farmers fail to use fertilisers again this year, as they did last year, the long-term effect will inevitably be very severe.  On the other hand, I am sure many farmers at present using imported fertilisers want to know whether it will be possible to continue using them, whether there is a likelihood of dumping or a likelihood of duties being imposed on Portuguese imports at any rate.</P>
    <P>The managing director of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta has been appointed a director of the gas board by the Minister, the board temporarily set up as an ordinary company pending the establishment by legislation of the board as a statutory board.  For that reason the involvement and interest in Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta in the natural gas development off Cork are very well established.  I would like to know what provisions are being made by the gas board in regard to the design and construction of the pipeline necessary to bring the natural gas from the point on the coast where it is landed to the NET factory at Marino Point. This is a matter of considerable national importance because it is the belief of the ESB among others, that the necessary knowledge and technology and ability to design and build virtually all that pipeline are available here.  In particular, they seem to be available among the engineering staff of the ESB who feel keenly the obvious desirability of using men like that, who may well be declared redundant because of the absence of growth in the demand for electricity, in a sphere which will be of tremendous benefit to the economy in years to come.</P>
    <P>The proposed factory at Marino Point that Nítrigin Éireann have started to build is the only proposed usage, we know of, of Irish natural gas by industry as such.  The alternative usage of the balance that will come from the field off Kinsale Head <Col N="297" /> is being sold by the gas board to the ESB for conversion into electricity at a new station further north in Cork Harbour and also in the Marino Station in Cork city which is to be converted into burning natural gas rather than oil.  The Nítrigin Éireann development at Marino Point is particularly welcome because it is recognised by those who are experts of natural gas throughout the world that the production of ammonia and urea from methane natural gas off Kinsale is a highly economic usage.  It is almost equally unanimously agreed that the usage of natural gas as proposed by the ESB in converting it into electricity is a highly uneconomic usage.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister that the should have in his capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce very serious consultation with the Minister for Transport and Power about the advisability of having other industries of a chemical type, such as NET which is under discussion here now, established in and around Cork Harbour for the better utilisation of the natural gas off our south coast rather than allow its conversion into electricity at a conversion ratio which everybody agrees is ridiculously expensive particularly if there is any other alternative usage at all.  The conversion ratio is somewhere in the region of 35 per cent which means that about 65 per cent of the value of the gas is lost.  It goes up the chimney, or disappears.  The conversion ratio of the gas into ammonia and urea is very, very much higher.  I do not know what the percentage is, but the wastage factor is very low, perhaps as low as 10 per cent.  Rather than let so much of the gas be wasted by conversion into electricity would the Minister consider endeavouring to secure at all costs the establishment in the vicinity of other smaller industries, not making the same products but making products that can be made from the natural gas so that, from a national point of view, we will get the maximum benefit from the gas we have been fortunate enough to find off our south cost?</P>
    <P>Another factor that strikes me is <Col N="298" /> that we are not told what the ultimate total capacity of this factory will be. We have at the moment off Kinsale Head a find of gas of 125,000,000 cubic feet a day approximately.  By Irish standards this is substantial.  By European or world standards it is a small or moderately sized find.  Many of the gas fields in the North Sea and off the Dutch coast are four, five or six times bigger.  I believe the find off Kinsale Head is too small to set up a liquefaction plant for the storage and transport of natural gas but, hopefully, this find by Marathon will not be the only economically commercial find of natural gas around our coast. Hopefully, more will be found in the general region in which it has been discovered already.</P>
    <P>If this happens has the Minister or have NET any plans for the usage of what could possibly be three or four times as much gas becoming available within the next year or two or within a year or two of this particular find being brought ashore?</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion that the Cork town gas or the municipal gas system would be converted to natural gas.  I understand that the usage is not huge in Cork.  Cork city is not likely to use a large proportion of the gas which would be found.  There will be costs such as conversion and so on which may give rise to some problems.  I had hoped that the Minister would have given some indication of forward planning for the use of the remainder of the gas in this particular field and for any future finds which we might be lucky enough, as a nation, to make in that general area or indeed on the west coast.  Presumably the production of 435,000 tonnes per year of ammonia and 310,000 tonnes of urea will probably be enough to supply the Irish market for the 20 years or so that this well will be in existence.  I wonder have NET or the Minister looked into the possibility of building a much larger factory with these commodities available for export.  I am not altogether clear whether the entire manufacturing process will be carried out at Greenore Point or whether either the ammonia or urea or both will be <Col N="299" /> transported to Arklow possibly for some further processing there.  That is another matter which should be cleared up.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear the view of the Minister that all the heavy borrowing should hopefully be repaid by 1982. The bulk of it, as he described in his speech, is from the company's own resources including borrowings.  From what I can read in the balance sheet I do not think the company have any resources other than what they got from Finance and what they have borrowed from banks already and short-term loans of one kind or another.  I wonder whether this borrowing is to be made abroad or whether the money is to be raised domestically.  If it is to be raised abroad at least this is a productive asset for which to borrow and it is not the type of borrowing that this Government have been going on with over the past six or 12 months to pay their current debts and to pay benefits of one kind or another.  At least there is a likelihood of a return here.</P>
    <P>I note that it is proposed that the IDA give a grant of £5 million towards this project.  The NET projection of the likely number of jobs is 500, which makes the grant cost per job £10,000, which is expensive even by modern standards.  The NET report for 1974 makes reference to the fact that NET, together with Ergas, are participating with the ELF group from France, the French National Petroleum Company, in a consortium to explore four blocks of our southern and western coasts. This is a matter which could be of tremendous significance to NET and it is a pity the Minister did not advert to that because many people would like to know precisely where NET stand in relation to it, what their percentage is going to be.  The only information we got, in relation to the participation of NET, in the Minister's statement of 13th June in relation to the issue of licences to these various consortia is that the participation by NET would be on a carry basis, that is that no funds would have to be provided by the company until a commercial discovery is made.  That statement <Col N="300" /> goes on to say that the NET participation is subject to the approval of the Government.  I presume the Government have approved of it.  It would seem incredible that they would not, particularly when the participation is on a carry basis without any financial commitment until discovery.  What is important is that the public are entitled to know, because NET, are in effect, a public semi-State company, what percentage NET are getting on a carry basis and what percentage Ergas are getting and what percentage the foreign interests would have and confirmation that the Government have approved NET's participation in the consortium.</P>
    <P>If NET have to contribute towards the commerical development or exploitation of any finds which this consortium might be lucky enough to make the capital cost will be very considerable.  I would like an indication from the Minister of where it is proposed to obtain that capital, whether the Minister for Finance will be putting it up or whether it is envisaged that NET, by that stage, will be able to put it up out of their own resources without any assistance from the Exchequer or from the Minister for Finance.  It is important that the country should know that.</P>
    <P>At the moment it is clear that NET are not in a position to contribute to anything no matter how modest because their financial affairs are far from good due to the happenings of the last year or so.  Perhaps it is proposed that NET should be able to make a sufficient profit out of the new project at Marino Point to be able to pump large amounts of capital into the consortium in which they will be taking part for offshore development.  I am limited in what I can say about this because unfortunately we got no information from the Minister tonight on that very important aspect of NET's proposed activities in the future.  They are matters which I think should be dealt with fully.  I know there are other Deputies who are at least as interested as I am in them and in having answered the sort of questions which I have been asking.  This measure is <Col N="301" /> totally non-commercial.  We will not vote against it.  We do not even seek to make any amendments to it.  We would be perfectly happy to let it go through in a reasonable period.  In these circumstances I would ask the Minister to act equally reasonably and to allow a reasonably full discussion on the many important points that arise in connection with the future of NET, of natural gas development and the utilisation of oil in respect of which they have been fortunate enough to get a share in a mainly foreign consortium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. I welcome very warmly the confidence which the Minister is showing in the fertiliser industry at this time and the fact that he is prepared to recommend to this House that NET be given a much greater involvement in the production of fertiliser than heretofore with the erection of a further factory using what will be the first Irish oil and gas to be brought in from the sea off Cork.</P>
      <P>He is doing it at a time when the industry is passing through a very difficult phase as a result of a reduction in the use of fertiliser by as much as 40 per cent in the past year.  The fact that the Minister sees the need to go ahead with this very large scheme at this time shows the confidence he has in the continued expansion of the fertiliser industry particularly through one of the semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Wicklow Deputy, naturally I am particularly interested in this Bill, in the ideas behind it and the need for it.  When the original NET Bill was going through the House over 12 years ago, four main reasons were given for its introduction.  The first and most important one was that an Irish product would be made available at favourable prices, and would have the effect of improving the balance of payments because the basic commodities used in it and the labour and so on would be Irish, with the use also of pyrites from the Avoca mines.  Secondly, it would give employment to substantial numbers. Thirdly, a guarantee was given that no tariffs would be placed on the <Col N="302" /> farming community.  Fourthly, no quota protection device would be used to sustain the factory.  Those guarantees were given by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lynch, now the Leader of the Opposition. He assured the House on several occasions when he introduced that Bill that the industry would stand on its own feet.  As reported at column 226 of the Official Report of 23rd January, 1963, he said:</P>
    <P>I can assure this House that the Arklow project as planned will be fully economic in free trade conditions. I have no doubt whatever that the company will be in a position to honour the undertaking already given that nitrogenous fertilisers will be made available to Irish farmers without subsidisation or protection at prices in line with prevailing import prices.  This undertaking assures the supply of nitrogenous fertilisers to Irish farmers at the prevailing favourable prices.</P>
    <P>That was before we entered the EEC, at a time when the fertiliser industry had to import most of its needs from Chile and other places.  As a result of the setting up of this industry at that time, it can be said that it progressed very favourably under the various headings set out for it.  The tonnage in 1971 being produced in Arklow amounted to ¼ million tons. That figure was almost doubled last year.  The number of people employed in Arklow in 1971 was 798.  Today it is 1,169.  That number has been maintained both last year and this year in spite of the difficult situation.</P>
    <P>It is only natural that the people working in Arklow would like to know from the Minister that the setting up of this factory in Cork will in no way reduce the number of people employed or reduce the operation in Arklow.  It is the wish of everybody that this will be complementary to the Arklow operation and that it will expand its numbers.  Already a spin-off factory of NET products is being established with the setting up of a wallboard factory which will continue to expand the numbers employed at Arklow.  This is <Col N="303" /> very welcome.  Nevertheless, there is this fear amongst people working in the industry.</P>
    <P>The undertakings given by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce at the setting up of the factory that in free trade conditions the factory would be viable have, I think, been proved true.  In recent times we have found that quantities of fertiliser are being imported from outside the EEC countries, from an area where the rules for dumping and so on under the EEC cannot and do not apply. With the unsettled situation there, who is to know whether fertiliser or any other product in that area is being made available to finance the unfortunate situation that exists there.  I know the Minister, at the request of Deputies from Wicklow, has taken up this problem energetically. He has set to work the Dumping Commission to investigate possibility of dumping from that area. The commission are sitting at the moment on this problem and we look forward to their report as soon as possible, so that the figures can show that there is dumping from that source.</P>
    <P>I want to give a very warm welcome to this Bill.  I want to compliment the Minister on bringing in a measure such as this, at this time, which will give encouragement to the people in the industry in that the Minister sees a great future for the fertiliser industry and its expansion with Irish commodities and Irish raw materials.  I hope the fears I have expressed can be allayed by the Minister in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. The welcome I give it is somewhat guarded.  I hope when the Minister replies to some of the questions raised by our spokesman, Deputy O'Malley, and my Wicklow colleague, that he will be able to assure me that NET in Arklow will continue its massive growth over the years.  I want the Minister to spell out where the plant in Arklow will fit in with the plant in Cork.  I have heard it said that the plant in Arklow will be even more secure when the one in Cork is fully operative.  Nevertheless I want an assurance on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> I wish the Minister had used this opportunity to speak at greater length on the state of the fertiliser industry in general.  It involves many sections of our comunity.  The farming section are directly involved and there is also the employment content in NET and a few other privately owned enterprises, one of which is, unfortunately, in dire trouble.  I also wish the Minister had thrown further light on this alleged dumping from Portugal.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to state the position in regard to the common external tariff of the EEC, especially in relation to the present difficulty being experienced in fertilisers which are being sneaked into this country.  We have read reports of ships being diverted from one harbour to Derry so that they could come in the back door. I think the Minister will agree that it smells suspiciously.</P>
    <P>I hope a recommendation will come from the Dumping Commission this week and the Minister will be able to act on it immediately.  I hope the Minister will spell out what is meant by this common external tariff of the EEC.  What is involved in it?  Surely it is there for protection, apart from alleged dumping.  Is it not there for the protection of industries of the Nine from outsiders?  Even if dumping is not proved or found in the report of the inquiry, in view of the serious state of the industry could this tariff not be enforced in some way?</P>
    <P>Has the Minister taken cognisance of this?  There was no mention of it in his brief which was confined to the plant there.  In two years there has been a 250 per cent price rise in fertiliser.  Last year there was a 40 per cent drop in the usage of it.  I do think these were normal years.  The quotation Deputy Kavanagh had about no subvention being given in the line of tariff or quota protection possibly holds true in normal trading conditions and normal circumstances but the present circumstances cannot be regarded as normal.  They are far from normal.  When what he quoted was said, on 23rd January, 1963, circumstances were different.  In those days we had a lot of dumping.  Have the Government changed their minds <Col N="305" /> about setting up a fertiliser plant? They say that circumstances have changed.  If Deputy Kavanagh had continued with the quotation he would have found at column 226 of the Official Report of 23rd January, 1963, Deputy Lynch said:</P>
    <P>Dumping will presumably be prohibited in free trading conditions.</P>
    <P>That is interesting.  I can see the problem of the farmer who has suffered a lot and has had a bad year. Naturally, he must try to obtain the fertiliser at the cheapest possible price.</P>
    <P>I have a commitment to the farming community and to the employees of the company.  In view of the extenuating circumstances, a 250 per cent price rise, some form of subsidy should have been introduced.  It would have added more security to jobs and been an investment in agriculture.  During the debate on the supplementary estimate for the Department of Transport and Power last Friday the Minister mentioned the reasons why a subsidy of £9.5 million had to be given to CIE. One of the factors involved was that revenue from the carriage of fertiliser had been lost to CIE.  If a subsidy had been introduced we would have had carriage of fertiliser, hence we might not have needed the same amount of money for CIE.  We would have had the availability of fertiliser at a reasonable price to the farmer.  We would not have had this 40 per cent drop in usage and we would have had greater security of jobs.  In many cases we would not have had the job loss.  We have had job loss in this country in general.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that the company has grown from 300 employees to the present figure of more than 1,100 employees.  It is a wonderful company; a true Irish company, provided by Irish people.  Over the years it has saved substantial amounts on imports and even achieved exports.  It is Irish controlled, has Irish management and staff.  It is good to see a company like this develop and I hope it will continue to expand.  I would like the Minister to spell out where the plant in Arklow fits in.  I give a qualified welcome to the Bill.  I hope that the reason for its being qualified will be removed.  I <Col N="306" /> wish we had more time to discuss this Bill because if the Minister had given us more information, more points would be forthcoming and more issues raised.</P>

      <P>I am not quarrelling. I want to put a few questions to the Minister.  I notice that the products of this plant in Cork will be ammonia and urea.  It is suggested that the liquid ammonia will be transferred to fertiliser factories in New Ross, where a great many of my constituents are employed, and to Arklow.  I should like the Minister to say if there is a nitric acid plant contemplated for the Marino Point establishment.  If there is, I can see the completion of the production cycle of ammonium nitrate and as it is the available nitrate market will be met considerably by the production of urea in Cork.  Of course, the urea is probably unsuitable for use in compound fertilisers.  I should like the Minister, in connection with the production of fertilisers, to say whether there is any possibility of the phosphate deposits in County Clare being brought into production.  I know it has no direct bearing on this Bill but we are talking about the development of the only more or less semi-State fertiliser organisation we have and this must surely come within their ambit.  Do I understand that the Minister has two minutes to reply now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a number of observations in relation to this Government who present themselves as whiter than white.  Certainly, they set up tribunals of one type or another to prove the integrity of a Minister.  This is, in addition to dealing with matters in relation to family law reform and law reform in general.  For instance, there was an example of this last evening when the Government introduced the Bill dealing with family law reform which, though important in itself, only touched the surface of what was really required.</P>
      <P>The propagandists of this Government go to work and present them in a whiter than white light.  The Chair prevented me from giving the catalogue of how corrupt this Government have become in the last two-and-a-half years in regard to their policy of &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo; and the way the Government placed their political pals in positions.  They have engaged in this practice to an extent unheard of in the history of the nation.  So when we speak about the Government and this particular Bill, we recognise the type of Government with which we are dealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course the real Minister for Finance sits in the Opposition.  That fact was acknowledged when the present Minister&mdash;the man charged with keeping the finances of the nation&mdash;introduced his second budget on 26th June, 1975.  Deputy Colley received due praise for predicting the introduction of a budget some six months before the Minister introduced the package which Deputy Colley had called for.  Of course, the package was introduced six months <Col N="312" /> too late.  Deputy Colley is now widely recognised as being the real Minister for Finance.  He sits in Opposition temporarily but he will return, like Fianna Fáil, as Minister for Finance.  As in the past, Fianna Fáil will have to pick up the pieces. I am sorry I must engage in political cliché but in order to describe the present situation one must speak in simple language.  If the language is that of cliché, my apologies to those people on whose ears that type of language grates.  It is the best and most descriptive language to use in the present context.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley indicated the action which should be taken in relation to the economy.  His predictions and prognostications have been treated with the usual uninformed sneering for which the present Minister has a reputation.  If the Minister&mdash;who has described himself as the person in charge of the nation's finances&mdash;had listened to the real Minister for Finance, the country would not be in the sorry state in which it is.</P>
    <P>There is a cure for our economic ills.  It is simply this: let the Government, with their convoluted philosophy get out.  The Labour Party are looking over their shoulders at the Fine Gael Party and the Fine Gael Party are looking over their shoulders at the Labour Party, to the great damage and detriment of the nation.</P>
    <P>Let the Government get out, let them call a general election.  Let them test the electoral will of the country and if they get back, which is doubtful, good for them.  History has a well-documented habit of repeating itself; that is, that a Coalition Government will not be elected for a second term running.  Fianna Fáil will then take on the real responsibility of running the country properly.  The country needs to be run properly very quickly but the Government of gimmicks do not appear to have the political will to do this.</P>
    <P>My solution, as a non-economist, would be to get the Government out and let Fianna Fáil run the affairs of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Col N="313" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would consider it positive political thinking.  I would suggest that the Government, who were charged with running the affairs of the country, cannot do so.  Therefore, when their mandate has become exhausted they have an obligation to test the electoral will of the people. We believe that the electoral will, so tested, would favour the return of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>That is one immediate solution to the economic problems.  As an Opposition we have a responsibility, when the country is going through a period of economic crises not to rock the national boat.  If the Government, from time to time, take unpopular measures which Fianna Fáil consider necessary, in the interest of the nation we will support them.  That is responsible Opposition.  That would be our obligation in assisting the Government to guide the country through the present economic morass. We would be prepared to do that, as stated by our leader on a number of occasions.  Deputy Lynch has set out clearly what he considers to be the responsibility of a party in Opposition, the responsibility of the largest single political party in the country.  This party, in Opposition, have been responsible. We have been guided well by the leader of the party.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the public&mdash;the people on the electoral register&mdash;must be concerned about the fact that the second official budget introduced on 26th June, 1975, was to reduce the cost of living by some 4 per cent. Who in this country can put their hands on their hearts and say, a month later, that the cost of living is still at the same level as it was a month ago?  As I said when I reported progress, if one was to put down a Parliamentary Question about the rise in the cost of living between 26th June, 1975, and 26th July, 1975, the percentage figures would be most revealing.  They must show an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of this debate we have a responsibility not to endanger the possible favourable outcome of the national wage agreement.  I appreciate that, but are we to suppress <Col N="314" /> our knowledge of the continuous and fatiguing price rises?  It is well known that the housewife in suburbia, in any of the conurbations, or in rural Ireland, cannot keep up with the continually harassing and fatiguing price rises.  I once described this Government as the Government which made meat a luxury.  I now have to revise my description and call them the Government that made food a luxury because of their unwillingness to tackle inflation.  The Taoiseach has taken a number of stands on inflation: he tells us one day that outside influences are responsible, the next day he says we can control it ourselves, and on the third day he tells us again that it is due to outside influences.  He came rushing back from Brussels with the latter state of the nation message.  One wonders does the Taoiseach really know.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has proved that he does not know how to control inflation.  Deputy Colley, the real Minister for Finance, indicated time and again how the Opposition, when they become Government, will deal with this eroding problem&mdash;inflation, job losses and so on.  We all know how Deputy Colley would deal with this problem so I will not burden the House by repeating it.  The present Government are not capable or willing to deal with it.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that inflation can be controlled nationally and that there are certain measures that can be taken.  But the Coalition Government &mdash;Fine Gael and Labour Parties&mdash; have to accommodate one another. That is where the country suffers.  The weakness called compromise in Government&mdash;one party compromising with the other&mdash;is the weakness of Coalition.  The strength of Fianna Fáil or any single-party Government is that they do not have to engage in political compromise.  Compromise in a political sense is an unwillingness to take action, particularly in relation to the economic situation.</P>
    <P>When housewives daily go to their local shopkeeper or supermarket, the owners have to announce price increases. We read the headlines in the newspapers.  No later than last night a headline in <i>The Evening Herald,</i><Col N="315" /> Tuesday, 22nd July, 1975, read: &ldquo;EEC deal to put up prices.&rdquo;  It would appear that every time the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries goes to Europe he comes back with the devaluation of the green £ or with news for the farmer, who is the backbone of the country.</P>
    <P>I come from a Dublin constituency and would not engage in the political exercise of setting off the farming section of the community against the non-farming section.  This is a dangerous and bad national exercise.  It makes for a form of political competition.  It is not my intention to engage in that form of political exercise.  We know that the farmer is reasonably badly off and is entitled to what he gets.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it appears that the middle income group, particularly the white-collar worker, seems to have had enough under the present régime.  Some time ago certain sections of the community were brought into the PAYE system.  Not only will they have to pay last year's PAYE but this year's, too, on this year's earnings.  This seems grossly unfair. As a Member of the Oireachtas, I am in no way engaging in special pleading because we are included in this system.  Maybe it is as well that I do not discuss it because I might be accused of special pleading.  This is an example of the type of convolutions the Government are engaging in and the hardships the white-collar, middle-income group have to put up with.  I represent a constituency which can be described as a middle-income constituency.  I can only reflect in the Dáil the type of response I get from my constituents.  To my knowledge, a large group of people who might have voted for the Coalition parties on the last occasion, will take the first opportunity to correct that error with a certain amount of happiness.  That is understandable.</P>
    <P>They are being taxed, either directly or indirectly, by a Government who consider borrowing to be the panacea, who seem to borrow themselves from one difficulty to the next, and the figures are there to prove it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> So much for the middle-income group.  This can be described as the second official budget.  We have had so many unofficial budgets it is very difficult to list them all.  We had the January and June budgets.  Either the leader of our party or our spokesman on Finance said there can be little doubt but that there will be a third budget before the end of the year.  That appears to be the situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the food subsidies, we are now informed by clever, subtle Government leaks that there will probably be an increase in these subsidies in the not-too-distant future.  If there are to be increases in food subsidies in the not-too-distant future does that mean that there will be a budget to provide for these increases? That appears to be so.  As I say, budgeting has become meaningless in the hands of the present political Government group.  It has been a meaningless exercise.  We have had two budgets already and we can expect a third.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the purpose of a budget is to balance income and expenditure. If that is the principle of a budget, then surely it is recognised that the Government have made a mockery of the whole concept of economic budgeting for the survival of the country.  You list the number of expenditures, add them, and borrow to meet the deficit.  I understand that is the Government's system of budgeting, but what an extraordinary way to run the country. Borrowing this year will amount to somewhere in the region of £814 million.  If a Deputy went to his bank manager trying to service an overdraft, or whatever, bringing it down to simple language, and he said he was trying to follow the Government's example in the matter of catering for the finances of his own home, I am quite satisfied the bank manager who, knowing the present Government's incapacity and incapability for running the country, having brought it in borrowing alone to a figure of £814 million in one year, would have him committed.  My own bank manager is an extremely decent man and I know it would be <Col N="317" /> the very last resort as far as he would be concerned in relation to me and his other customers.</P>
    <P>The fact is that if people trying to service an overdraft or with a credit account in their banks went to a bank manager and said they were running their bank accounts on the same lines as the Government are running the country the bank manager would laugh them out of court and would ask them to take their bank accounts elsewhere, and properly so.  We would like the Government to take themselves elsewhere, and the elsewhere we would like to see the Government taking themselves is to the people and let the people decide who should run the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the £814 million borrowed in one year, what country the size of our country could withstand that sort of borrowing?  It cannot withstand it.  The simple truth is the Government are living on the credit rating, in the eyes of the world, achieved by the last Government. That credit rating, the legacy of the last Government, will run out and with it the credibility of this country. The credit of the nation is about to be used up by the present Government.</P>
    <P>I did not realise that there were other speakers anxious to contribute and I apologise for holding my colleagues in my party unnecessarily long, but I would like to urge upon the Government that they should recognise their obligations to the nation.  As I said, the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party has already indicated what he considers to be the responsibility of the Opposition to a Government who have quite clearly lost their way.  It would now appear as a matter of record and fact that the Opposition are leading the economic thinking of the country because the Government, six months after a view articulated by the real Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, brought in much of what he said&mdash;unfortunately too little and too late.  We would ask the Taoiseach after the recess&mdash;the Taoiseach is entitled to a holiday as are all of us&mdash;to sit down with his more responsible and more responsive Ministers and work out some <Col N="318" /> form of economic plan for the future of the country.</P>
    <P>The position now is that the Government are leaving the coffers of the nation almost bankrupt and Fianna Fáil will once more have to lead the country out of that situation. They will do just that.  In the meantime, the present Government are charged with the running of the country, and they might consider when they return from their holidays &mdash;I will not say well-earned holidays &mdash;my modest proposal, to paraphrase the late great Dean, in a different context, of course.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that this is not to be a general debate on the state of the nation.  It appears that we are not going to have the opportunity of engaging in an adjournment debate.  In the meantime, it is just as well to conclude by mentioning the Government's record.  That was typified particularly between the hours of 6.30 and 7.30 this evening when the guillotine came down on their own Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Industry and Commerce turned on the Opposition spokesman and suggested that the Opposition were, in some way, to blame for the introduction of the guillotine and the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not have an opportunity to reply.  The scandal of that statement is that the Bill before the House had only one hour for its Second Stage.  Three Fianna Fáil Deputies spoke on it and it was discovered in the last two or three minutes that the Minister would not have any time to reply.  The real erosion of freedom on this aspect is that the Minister will now have to reply to the Deputies <i>seriatum</i> and privately.  It is a damn shame and it is indicative of the fact that what the Minister might have wanted to have got on the record of the House, where it should be, will now be placed in letters to Deputies.  The Government are guilty of the erosion of the principle of the freedom of debate and speech in this House.  The record should show that the Minister for Industry and Commerce replies on a Bill for which an hour was given, by correspondence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, giving effect to some of the budgetary provisions&mdash;the second budget of this financial year&mdash;set out against the background of unemployment, the serious economic situation, the high cost of living and so on has been well gone over in this House during recent weeks and months.  The recent budget had three legs&mdash;(1) to give some reliefs by way of subsidies and the removal of VAT from clothing and certain other commodities; (2) the imposition of taxation, and (3) a wage package.  It was a request by the Government to workers in the State service&mdash;which was really not a request&mdash;and those in public enterprise and business to forego certain wage claims.  Two of these are indefinite&mdash; the subsidisation of food and the removal of VAT.  These are indefinite because they are dependent on the outcome of negotiations.  I hope the Taoiseach, when replying to this debate, will have something to say about what aid and encouragement the Government are giving to the negotiations which are in progress. A Government can be helpful to the outcome of such negotiations.  In his opening statement it was very noticeable that there was no mention whatsoever <Col N="320" /> of this.  I presume the Taoiseach has left this until his time to reply comes.</P>
      <P>We are dealing then with the only definite part of the budget package, the imposition of taxation, except in so far as it is mandatory to give legislative effect by way of a Bill to the removal of VAT on clothing and the other items mentioned.  The Minister for Finance said that if there was not a successful outcome to the negotiations now in progress the food subsidies would be abolished.  He did not mention the removal of VAT from certain items which is being written into an enactment of this Parliament.  If we do reach a situation, and I hope we do not, in which the food subsidies are withdrawn&mdash;it is not necessary to have legislation to withdraw them&mdash;will the Dáil be recalled to pass another Bill to reimpose VAT?</P>
      <P>The House and the country would like the Government to say what assistance they have been giving, are giving or will give to those who are negotiating, and there have been lengthy negotiations, on the question of foregoing wage increases on which some of what is in the Bill depends. The imposition of taxation with which this Bill is mainly concerned, will be a permanent feature no matter what agreement is made.  There is no going back on this.  This contradicts the statements made by the Minister for Finance in introducing the package.</P>
      <P>I also want to mention the budgetary provisions against the background of the Taoiseach's own gloom and doom speech last week.  If the situation is as bad as the Taoiseach indicated in that speech&mdash;we think it is even worse&mdash;then these budgetary measures are not enough to deal with that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach do he and his Cabinet intend to go into a three-month recess leaving behind the situation which he spoke about, and which this budget, the second budget of this year, does nothing, or very little, to remedy and which so far has been very ineffective?  Do they intend to put this House into recess for the next three months, and take no <Col N="321" /> further serious action to deal with the situation which is worsening daily and which he felt it necessary to alert the people to in that gloom and doom speech which was followed by another gloom and doom speech by the Minister for Foreign Affairs?</P>
    <P>The only reason the Minister for Foreign Affairs was sent in to dot the i's and cross the t's of the Taoiseach's speech was to tell the people: &ldquo;Although the Taoiseach was telling you a sad economic story, a sad financial story, a sad rising unemployment story, a sad rising cost-of-living story, we should count ourselves lucky that the European countries and other countries are in the same boat.&rdquo;  This was the only reason why the Minister for Foreign Affairs came in to take some of the sting out of what the Taoiseach had been saying.</P>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, do not think what has been done in either of the two budgets has been effective in dealing with the situation which a Government must deal with, whether it be this Government now, or another Government in six months' time.  We have the increasing number of unemployed.  We have a rising cost of living, so much so that it may be necessary to further add to the food subsidies.  Yet we have Ministers of this Government going gaily around the country trying to say: &ldquo;Look, boys, the situation is not as bad as all that.  You will have so many thousand jobs after some time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Everyone knows&mdash;and I will deal with this very briefly&mdash;that this country is being used as a dumping ground by all the nations of the earth and in this Financial Resolution we are providing that, as well as reducing or removing VAT from certain items, from certain commodities used by our own people and produced by our own people, the removal of VAT also applies to every article specified here imported from any corner of this earth.  If you put that situation against the position even in Britain, which is as open a trading country as any, and has all the problems we have, they are subsidising their own producers to a certain extent.  I will give the <Col N="322" /> Taoiseach one example, and it refers to one of the commodities from which VAT is being taken in this Finance Bill, and that is clothing.</P>
    <P>We are removing VAT from clothing manufactured not only in Britain but in all other countries and imported here.  Therefore, we are making it more difficult for our own manufacturers to increase their production here and compete against those imports.  Over and above that we are not doing what Britain is doing because Deputy Keating, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was the greatest protagonist of those who were against going into the EEC, is now the most meticulous observer of the finer print of the EEC regulations. He is more European than the Europeans themselves at the expense of the Irish worker and consumer. Britain is subsidising the shirt end of the textile industry in Northern Ireland, in the city of Derry, to the tune of £10 million, so much so that each shirt manufactured in the city of Derry can be exported to Donegal bearing a British Government subsidy of £1.  How can our manufacturers of that commodity and other commodities such as these survive? Yet the Minister for Industry and Commerce will not give one penny of assistance to the Irish shirt manufacturers, nor to the factories which are going out of production in that line.</P>
    <P>I have the statement of a person in that business in this city of Dublin who asked a Northern Ireland manufacturer to quote him for cut, make and trim&mdash;the manufacturer here supplying all the materials and commodities which go into those garments&mdash; and the price he was quoted for the labour only was less than the price at which they could export a fully made shirt of their own into this country. That is the situation.  The Government are not doing a thing to remedy this.  I am not exaggerating the position when I say this country is the happy hunting ground of dumpers from Korea, Taiwan, all over the world, not alone of textiles but of boots, shoes and other commodities.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should take a dander <Col N="323" /> around some of the bigger stores in this city and see for himself what our manufacturers are up against. There is no use in talking about setting up new factories.  There is no use in talking about any of these things unless we do something.  I know there are EEC regulations, and some countries are busily getting around some of the regulations or negotiating with their fellow members where there is a panic situation in their own countries.  We are not doing that.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has said: &ldquo;Well look, boys, you have made your bed and you can bloody well lie on it now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Inflation in Italy has been reduced by measures taken to deal with their own economy from 24 per cent to 12 per cent.  On the other hand we have been advocating that many things could be done here to prevent imports and to obviate the necessity of having imports.  We have on the stocks a Turf Development Bill.  I do not know how that will solve any problems we have in the fuel line, and we have many such problems. This is something that I, and many Members of this Party, have been advocating since November, 1973, when the fuel crisis began.  However, this is the first time the Government have decided that it is a good idea to make more money available for the production of peat fuels.</P>
    <P>There are many other things the Government may have to do in six months' or nine months' time.  Why not take these measures now?  In the months of June, July and August we usually have the lowest valley of employment, the graph shows at its lowest, and from the end of August and until March-April of the following year it starts to rise again.  The graph at the moment has not gone below, subject to correction, 101,000 people unemployed.  Unless there is Government action, a definite, serious, down-to-earth business-type of action, we will have in the winter period and into the spring a rise from the present high graph point. Yet there is no provision in this budget to deal with this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> The number of people in employment has decreased.  The number of wage-earners who will be hit by this, the third leg of the budgetary package, will suffer permanently from this. Whether the other two aspects of the budget come into being or not the 10 per cent surcharge on incomes, on incomes of those who are lucky enough to be in employment will remain.  This is not fair or the right way to tackle the problem.  It is up to the Government to get down to more basic measures to deal with the situation which is worsening steadily.</P>
    <P>I should like the Taoiseach to tell us if the reduction in the green £ percentage, which the news media and others say will amount to an increase of 1 per cent&mdash;it may be more than that&mdash;will be met by subsidies. It is relevant to ask whether the degree of subsidisation which was relevant when the budget was introduced is relevant now.  The price increases arising out of the devaluation of the green £ and other price increases which arose out of nothing, arose out of the lack of price control by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I accuse that Minister of not having a proper price control system operating effectively.</P>
    <P>When goods are dumped in any country one of the reasons they are dumped and can be sold at a cheaper price is a glut or a policy of export subsidisation in their own countries.  When they come here at low import prices to the importers; when we have a situation where a 200 per cent profit is added to the import price at the retail outlet, then it becomes more attractive for retailers, wholesalers and others, to deal exclusively in those imported goods than to purchase from home manufacturers. Human nature being what it is, and profit margins and overall profits being the norm, if two travellers arrive in a Dublin store and one says he will give Cork goods on which there will be a 50 per cent profit or Donegal shirts on which there will be a 45 per cent profit and the other traveller is able to offer imported goods dumped here, in the same lines, on which there will be 100 per cent or 150 per cent profit, I know the type of goods that will be <Col N="325" /> retailed in that shop.  This is hitting the Irish worker because he is not getting the benefit of the imports.  But when you have imports and dumping and profiteering at that rate due to lack of price control and due to lack of looking after profit margins&mdash;the Government have thrown their hands in the air as far as price control and profit margins are concerned&mdash;the Irish worker, the Irish producer, the Irish manufacturer and the Irish consumer are bound to suffer and the economic situation is as it is because of that type of inaction by the Government coupled with their inaction on very many grounds.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will get all the help and encouragement he needs from this side of the House if he is prepared to buckle in and deal with these problems. If there must be imports do not make them attractive by allowing 100 per cent or 150 per cent profit.  We in a deputation to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on Monday last demonstrated beyond yea or nay that profits on certain goods dumped here were of that order.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say any more.  The message is clear.  It is necessary to do very much more than the Government are doing.  I hope they do it soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment briefly on the taxation proposals and in regard to value-added tax reliefs and the income tax surcharge which were the subjects of financial resolutions passed on 26th June.  I am disappointed with the 10 per cent surcharge on people paying tax at the rate of 35 per cent.  This applies to the middle income groups, the people who had to bear, perhaps more than others, the mismanagement of the Government for the last two years.  We still have inflation and rises in the cost of living, the most obvious example being the staggering rise in the price of petrol last Christmas.  We are now to have increased taxation on these groups. Under this proposal £8 million will be raised from this middle-income group some of whom are finding it hard to live from week to week and even from day to day as it is.  Some <Col N="326" /> of these people are able to pay this 10 per cent but there are others who have contributed a great share in the past and who are now being asked to pay more under this taxation proposal.</P>
      <P>Some figures have been given to us in the budget which were nicely rounded off in thousands of pounds as to how this tax will affect single and married persons.  A single person, for example, earning £2,500 will be paying an increase of £13.12 a year.  A married person earning £3,000 will pay an increase of £18.55. This is only where the husband is the only earner in the family.  I wonder if the Government realise that there are many married women who have to go out and work for purely economic reasons.  If a man and woman were each earning £30 or £40 a week they would be better off to live together rather than to marry because in those circumstances they would pay less tax than if they were married.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before these proposals, a single person was allowed £575 personal income tax free and the next £1,550 was taxed at 26p in the £.  After that the tax was 35p in the £.  Married couples would have twice that personal allowance and, consequently, they should have had the next £3,100 taxed at 26p in the £&mdash;that is twice £1,550.  However, this was not the case because that £3,100 was not taxed at 26p in the £ but at 35p in the £.  What has happened is that the married couple up to this have paid £139.50 extra a year or almost £12 a month extra because they were married.  That was the position. Under these proposals because of the 10 per cent surcharge on people paying 35p in the £ they will be paying £193 extra per year or £4 a week extra.  There is a nice bonus for living out of wedlock.  In other words you pay £16 a month for your marriage licence.  It is good that love still exists in Ireland, because young people trying to set up homes for themselves are getting very little help from this Government.  Young people are being hindered and frustrated by the Government in <Col N="327" /> trying to set up homes for themselves, not only as regards taxation but also because of the fact that adequate loans are not made available.  The income limits at present are completely unrealistic because of inflation.  On top of this we have this outdated taxation code.  Surely a young married couple where both partners are working should be given some relief from taxation until they get a chance to put their financial affairs in order.  As a single person I may be able to look at this problem objectively.  While I am a Member of this House I will do my best to represent married couples and to impress on the Government the problems they have in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Government might see my point a little clearer if they examined carefully the woman's role in Irish society.  I am delighted to say that in our party under our spokesman for Labour, Deputy Fitzgerald, we have brought in a policy in this regard and, while we do not want in any way to undermine the role of woman as wife and mother, we say that if she wishes to work outside the home whether for economic or other reasons she should be free to do so and any barriers in her way should be removed. One of those barriers is the highly punitive taxation system which we are imposing on married people.  I am talking particularly of young married couples, and I hope that the Taoiseach will comment on this aspect in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is described as Finance Bill (No. 2), 1975. It is the second one brought before the House and we are now only at the 23rd July.  I suppose it would be too much to expect that we would escape the remaining five months of the year without having another budget proposal, another change in direction and another Finance Bill introduced by the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the present management of our economy by the Government and oft-changed direction of the Government <Col N="328" /> are any indication of the morass in which they find themselves, then it is time, for the sake of our people, to call on them and say: Let us give Fianna Fáil a try; let them resign honourably before any more harm is done to the progress made in our economy over a number of years of Fianna Fáil administration.  As the Taoiseach is present, I would appeal to him&mdash;I respect him as a man of high integrity who is concerned about our economy at present&mdash;to stop his Minister from saying both in the House and outside that it is because of inflation abroad and the rise in the price of oil.  We have listened for too long to that being advanced as an excuse.  Excuses are not sufficient. When a man sets out to do a job, if he happens to face difficulties in it; if he does not do it properly, then a number of alternatives are open to him.  If he is honourable enough, he will resign; if he does not resign he may be forced to do so.  This is the position into which the Taoiseach is leading his Government.  If they are not prepared to resign and say: &ldquo;We have failed, we cannot hope to improve on our performance,&rdquo; then our people will deal with them at the earliest opportunity, because of the way in which they have allowed evils to grow in our society.</P>
    <P>In the budget proposals introduced by the Minister some weeks ago we find measures being taken which were suggested by the Opposition many moons ago; measures which if taken at that time would have been effective, saved jobs and helped our economy. Instead everything was let go to the stage when fire brigade action is required, when we are standing on the precipice.  We have seen some of our industries falling over that precipice never to rise again and others struggling along for a little while longer.  Action taken in time is what is required at present.</P>
    <P>VAT is now being removed from clothing and other items.  When the Minister says he is doing this in an effort to help the textile industry one questions his sincerity.  The textile industry has been ailing for so long that unless the Minister was in cuckoo land&mdash;and he must have been <Col N="329" />&mdash;for a lot of that time, then the textile industry is dependent on weak shoulders if it has taken the Minister that length of time to realise it needed assistance.  For most of those textile industries this action has come too late, and it will not save jobs lost in recent months and days.</P>
    <P>At present a number of evils face our economy.  They have existed and been growing more serious over the past 18 months.  The situation reminds me of the fellow who finds a leak in a bucket and tries to do a repair job but it is too late because the hole is too big and the water continues to leak.  But had he put a new bottom in the bucket in time it would have solved the problem.  What is required is early effective action.  There is no point in blaming outside sources or factors.  The problem exists within our economy to be faced up to.</P>
    <P>If the situation was not so serious one could think back to the last election when at every church gate throughout the country Government speaker after Government speaker said that the issues in the election were bread and butter ones.  They spoke about what they would do, the way they would reduce prices and the jobs they would create.  Are they not ashamed now of the empty speeches they made at the church gates and the empty promises they made?  If not, they must be very thick-skinned.</P>
    <P>I have said that there are a number of evils facing the economy.  The chief ones are unemployment, the cost of living and the ability of people to survive these evils.  I was pleased to hear Deputy Kitt, from Galway, dwelling at length on the income tax impositions in this Finance Bill; on the way the Government, who rely so much on propaganda, present examples favourable to their proposals on the income tax code.  I question the legality of the situation.  We have an imposition of tax, an increase in income taxation on PAYE taxpayers.  I mention them specifically because this is a retrospective imposition.  Is this legal?  It is unjust that a Government can impose tax retrospectively on people who have already paid income tax on their earnings over that retrospective period.  But the Government have reassessed that <Col N="330" /> situation and have increased taxation on those people from 6th April.  Therefore, it is retrospective taxation.</P>
    <P>In questioning it I say that the man in the middle income group, mentioned several times in the budget, is being asked to bear an impossible burden. One remembers how the Government, the then Opposition, screamed about the plight of the middle man when Fianna Fáil were in office.  I suppose that is an indication of why there have been so few contributions from those benches and Deputies opposite have shown complete lack of interest in this Bill.  Government Deputies realise the complete mess that is being made of the situation by their Ministers.  The income tax situation is a burden on our working people.</P>
    <P>It is understandable also that the Government are now pushing harder, first of all, on the smaller number of people who are working and, secondly, on people who are having their real incomes eroded because of the non-availability of overtime or bonuses freely available to them a few years ago.  These were things to which the working man could look forward, to provide holidays for his children and to keep a motorcar.</P>
    <P>If there is anything to be said of the present Government it is the piecemeal way they have been dealing with these situations.  I remember last winter the Minister for Finance announced an imposition of £27½ million on the Irish people by an overnight increase in the price of petrol.  We were told why it was done. It was a question of being out of funds and not having finance available. There were other impositions at the same time by State bodies and Departments.  Now in this measure we are providing money to help subsidise the increased cost of transport. We go a bit of the road this way and we come back another way.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that the real problem within our economy at the moment is the lack of confidence, the real concern that the Government are not giving guidance or leadership. This is one of the reasons we find ourselves without jobs and without the opportunity of creating jobs for our young people leaving schools. <Col N="331" /> They were given the opportunity of being educated within our system by a Fianna Fáil Minister&mdash;Donogh O'Malley.  Many of them would not have had that opportunity but for the foresight of a Minister for Education from this side of the House.  It is unfortunate that this education now leaves them without any hope of anything to look forward to in the future because of the lack of real action from the Government.</P>
    <P>There has been the extra imposition of income taxation on the middle income group.  There has been the played-down situation on the housing loans.  It was always the policy of our party to encourage people to purchase their homes.  In one stroke the Minister has decided to reduce the term of years for borrowing SDA loans from 35 years to 30 years and, at the same time, has decided to increase the interest rate by 1 per cent.  Yet despite doing that, he has not gone on to tackle what is urgently needed by house purchasers and prospective home-owners, and what is being preached not only by us on this side of the House but by prominent backbenchers on that side also, the increasing of the home loan limit from the miserable £4,500 at which it stands at present and has stood for far too long in spite of the rising cost of home purchase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be evident to the Deputy that he is straying considerably from the subject matter of the Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the last opportunity to discuss the financial state of our economy generally.  In the budget proposals this was one of the items played down by the Minister. It did not get across to very many people and, because of the Government's refusal to accept our leader's request for an adjournment debate, we will not have an opportunity of touching on these items again between now and the end of this present session.  For that reason, I would appeal to the sense of fair play and justice of the Chair, which has always been evident, to be tolerant and lenient with a speaker on <Col N="332" /> this side of the House on an occasion like this.  The Dáil will be in recess before 31st July, when the vital decision is coming from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I thought it would have been in the interests of the country and the people that the Taoiseach should decide that we would have an adjournment debate and that it would be held on the Thursday and the Friday and bring our Dáil session to a natural conclusion at the end of a week.  It was certainly expected on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>I referred to the home-owner situation. There is an imposition of approximately £1.50 per week in that household imposed by the Minister in the budget.  There is an extra hidden £1.50 in addition to the other measures that he has not included.</P>
      <P>With regard to VAT on clothing, on the night of the budget on the financial resolutions I questioned the Minister as to the rate of VAT on blankets.  Lo and behold, the Minister for Finance not alone did not know that blankets were not in the same category as clothes generally but he did not even know what the VAT rate was on blankets.  He promised he would examine the categories for clothing under the different VAT categories and he would examine why blankets were in a different category from clothing generally. There may be reasons for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As usual the cheap jibes came back from allegedly responsible Ministers like himself and his colleague in Foreign Affairs&mdash;who, of course, enjoyed his plight anyway&mdash;and said that perhaps they should ask Fianna Fáil.  That is irrelevant.  In the modern cliché terms of one of our Ministers, everything now is an on-going situation. If we refer to the on-going situation of the economy, we must look at it over a period of years to see what advantages or disadvantages may be gained for the community by changing categories.  It is not enough for any responsible Minister&mdash;and God knows we have not many of them&mdash;to say because somebody else did it a number of years ago it is right now.  It would be far more correct for the Minister to see is there <Col N="333" /> any advantage to any industry or to a number of little industries in our country by including blankets with other items of clothing.</P>
    <P>Other contributing to the debate referred to the fact that blankets are on a very high rate&mdash;19.5 per cent VAT, whereas fur coats and mink coats are now down in the zero category. This is not my point.  Even at this stage, my request to the Minister is to examine the possibility where industry is affected, where jobs can be preserved.  It is not important how many; every job preserved is a saving for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine the categories and to give us the promised explanation, to tell us why he has not considered a genuine request. It coincides with what I have been saying earlier, that action will be taken here too when the firms concerned with this problem will again be on the brink of the precipice, ready to topple over.  I appeal to the Minister to think about it before it goes too far.</P>
    <P>We have been promised again, that because VAT is removed from clothing and clothing is on a zero rating and certain essential foodstuffs are being subsidised our cost of living will come down.  I welcome these subsidies. Many months ago Deputy Colley in this House recommended this move, but of course the Government could not see it then.  It took them so long, with such disastrous results for our country and our people and the rising cost of essential foodstuffs, that the problem is still with us.  Despite these subsidies, the price of food is rising apace.  For example, last week 30 items increased in price, many of them foodstuffs, but because of the decision implemented by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, they were not advertised. Advertising has been done away with.  When the housewife went to the supermarket or the local shop, she discovered that the price of so many commodities such as sausages and puddings, had again gone up.  This is the type of situation we are dealing with at the present time.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this country is being governed by a ship of State.  That ship of State is floundering around, <Col N="334" /> trying to attach blame somewhere else, but is doing nothing to protect the jobs of our people.  There are 36,000 more unemployed than there were when Fianna Fáil left office.  The position does not seem to be improving. I would like to say that we could look forward to improvements.  Many Ministers, including the Minister for Finance, have been guessing different times for the revival of the world economy and trying to attach blame for our present problems to countries all over the world.  The way we have been directing our internal affairs will saddle many generations with a burden from which it will take a long time to recover.</P>
    <P>With regard to our industrial situation, I have a figure here of a number of firms that have gone into liquidation since this Government came into power.  Very many of those firms could have been saved by effective Government action.  The textile industry was the one big, black, sin of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He closed his ears to our appeals.  If those appeals had been heeded, and if the dumping had not been allowed, some of the jobs that are gone or thrown away so wantonly, might have been preserved.</P>
    <P>With regard to the footwear industry, we hear a lot of ballyhoo about the Minister's recent announcement. How effective is it?  How effective can it be when it is only reimposing the duty, as it applied prior to the 1st July?  We all know that the footwear industry was in a sorry plight before that date.  On one of his trips home, I was told in this House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs during the budget debate that effective measures could be taken for the footwear industry.  How effective can these measures be when the reimposition of protection is the same as it was prior to that time?  The employment figures in that industry have been dropping very quickly&mdash;it was 6,000 not so long ago and is now approximately 4,000.</P>
    <P>Worse than that, in those industries there is a lack of confidence, frustration at management level and factory floor level.  If we can, we should be <Col N="335" /> seen to be doing something positive towards restoring jobs.</P>
    <P>I think I am in order in referring to a Bill which is going through the House at the moment&mdash;the Employment Premium Bill which was introduced as a result of the Government proposals.  On that Bill, our spokesman on finance expressed the opinion that there was a certain amount of imagination behind its introduction. It is a pity more homework was not done.  It is a pity that the Government were not more far-sighted, and could not have seen that here was an idea that could be developed.  It is a tragedy that this Bill was included in this guillotine motion.  As a result of a guillotine motion proposed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and seconded by the chief Whip of the Labour Party, Deputy B. Desmond, we will have a mockery Committee Stage.  Deputy Desmond made a very strong case for the guillotine motion, which is guillotining a very important Bill.</P>
    <P>In Committee Stage we could have made this a good Bill if we had the opportunity of discussing it in detail. We could have made it an effective Bill for our community and not confined to a number of industries.  I hope we will create jobs in those industries but I feel there will not be enough jobs.  They will only be a percentage of the jobs lost and they will not compensate for the jobs which, I fear, will be lost in the not too distant future.  I do not want to stand here as a prophet of doom, or preaching a lack of confidence, but a lack of confidence is oozing from the Government benches right down to the wheels of our industry.</P>
    <P>There are times when strong and unpopular measures have to be taken, but if they are for the good of the community generally let us have courage.  I am sure some backbenchers would support me in that.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Burke would like to know what was on a page in <i>The Irish Times</i> today which I think would be of great <Col N="336" /> assistance to the Deputy.  I suggest he read that page, and if the Deputy has not read it already, I will show it to him.  He will have a personal interest in it.  When I am finished I will loan him the paper.</P>
      <P>This signifies the mess that has been made.  I know Deputy Burke is concerned about this industry, the future of which is in grave doubt, and would have provided jobs in my county.  Let us hope that there is no truth in that story and that that industry will thrive.  I am sure that is the wish of the Deputies opposite, too.  I know they have been spurring the Minister for Finance to take action that he has delayed taking for so long.  The bread and butter issues mentioned in 1973 would be valid now.  This Finance Bill is being guillotined. It ends tonight.  Like the mini-budget we will be having between now and Christmas, this debate could be regarded as a mini-adjournment debate.  Everything is mini now except the unemployment figures.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not referred to the point I made&mdash;the £12.50 in the cost of house purchase as a result of the measures taken here.  We appear to be having difficulty.  I think it is time that the Taoiseach spoke to his Ministers and said: &ldquo;Stop fooling the people.  Let us be honest for a change&rdquo;.  We listen to them talking about moneys being available in excess of what was available in 1971, 1972 or 1973.  They do not go on to say that the moneys available now, in the context of inflation, the fall in the value of money and the huge increase in prices right through every sector, in no way relate to the moneys provided a number of years ago.  This is the propaganda machine working for the Government. We see the figures of our jobless rising.  We see our school leavers in a hopeless situation.  We see our people finding it harder and harder to do their shopping each day.</P>
      <P>In February, 1973, there were bread and butter issues facing the people.  They may have been bread and butter issues then but the issues now are far more serious.</P>

      <P>I did not know the guillotine was coming so fast.  It has come to the stage that one can expect anything in this House.  Finally, the Minister for Finance has a lot to answer for to this generation of Irish people for his mishandling of the purse for two-and-a-half years.  He has a lot to answer for to the present generation.  I can assure him that his name will be remembered by many future generations of Irish people as being the man who failed, refused to take the steps necessary and take them in time.  He will be regarded as the Minister who was cumbersome, ponderous and indeed slow in acting. Perhaps the Taoiseach made a mistake.  The wrong man may be handling the purse.  Perhaps it should have been the man who is travelling Europe and the world.  I think he would have a certain amount of imagination lacking in the present holder of the office.  For goodness sake, take action even at this late stage or else throw in the towel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few comments I want to make on section 1.  The first one is a technical one. In subsection (2) there is a reference to section 153 (1) (d) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  I have been unable to find a reference to standard rate of tax in that.  It may be that there is an amendment to it of which I am not aware and I would appreciate it if the Minister would indicate if there is an amendment to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I want to make is <Col N="338" /> that in April last, just two months before the Minister made his announcement of what is contained in section 1, a surcharge of 10 per cent was placed on income tax payers in the 35 per cent and upwards bracket. Just two months before that the Minister spoke in this House about the fact that, in his view, our rates of tax were too high and that was having a deleterious effect on managers and their salaries.  The reduction of the top rate from 80 per cent to 70 per cent would be very advantageous and helpful not only in regard to the salaries of managers but right down the line.  Whatever one may think of that view, it does seem strange that two months later the Minister is imposing a 10 per cent surcharge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that when the country is facing an economic crisis the Opposition endeavours in that situation to take the opportunity of scoring partisan political points. I do not think it helps the Opposition's own image to behave in that way when it could bring more credit upon them and more advantage to the country if Members opposite were to endeavour to rally public opinion behind the Government in an effort to attain a reduction in the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the encouraging signs has been that there has been little objection to the 10 per cent surcharge on income tax.  The people who will be most affected by the 10 per cent surcharge have protested least.  This is an indication of the appreciation people have of the gravity of the present situation and their understanding that some sacrifices have to be made so that the country may pull through at a very difficult time.  The public in general appreciate that the principle cause of the problems affecting this country are international and are not due to mismanagement by the Government or by anybody else.  The forces which are affecting us at present are, in the main, beyond our control.  The Opposition might bear that in mind. The public expect leadership not <Col N="339" /> merely from the Government but from the Opposition.  Deputy Colley asked a question about section 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>That was inserted by the First Schedule to the Finance Act of 1974.  It was consequential to the introduction of the new rate structure, and provided that a nonresident was to be chargeable to Irish tax on income arising in this country at the standard rate on income up to £4,350.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could interrupt the Minister for a moment, I have a copy of the 1974 Act in front of me and the reference appears to be as follows:</P>
      <P>...the following paragraph shall be substituted for paragraph (dd) of subsection (1)&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(dd) he shall not be entitled to the benefit of the provisions contained in section 3 (2) of the Finance Act, 1974, (whereby the first £1,550 of taxable income is chargeable at the reduced rate of tax in certain circumstances) and accordingly, he shall be charged to tax in respect of so much of his income as does not exceed £4,350 at the standard rate of tax&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The only specific point I wanted to mention was that I made another point on this.  The Minister is entitled, of course, to express the view that the Opposition are being unhelpful, and so on, but the real point he was asked to answer, and did not, was that whatever may have been the international circumstances, and so on, how come that there was a complete reversal in a matter of two months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was not a complete reversal.  The top rate of tax was 80 per cent and the top rate <Col N="340" /> of tax now including the temporary 10 per cent surcharge will be 77 per cent.  So there is, in fact, an effective reduction of 3 per cent.  The international economic situation is deteriorating more rapidly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the Minister for Finance of Ireland has been asserting for the last nine months in OECD, in the EEC, the IMF and the World Bank that the global economic recession was deeper and more prolonged than any of those organisations were or are prepared to admit, or that the surplus countries were or are prepared to admit.  Indeed, the surplus countries were asserting&mdash;I am thinking in particular of the European surplus countries like Germany and the Netherlands&mdash;that there was no need for any further reflationary action by them.</P>
      <P>That situation persisted until this month when, for the first time, Germany, holding the key to the economic revival of Europe, acknowledged that the steps which she had taken were not sufficient, and that the German economy instead of having, as Germany anticipated this year, a growth rate, albeit a small one of 2 per cent, or thereabouts, would, in fact, suffer a decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consequence of this is that Europe is now in a deeper recession than the United States of America, although it is only a matter of some months since the Council of Ministers for Finance of Europe asked me as their President to go to the United States to persuade that country to take action to reflate their economy because Europe depended so much on the United States.  Even then, I asserted in the Council of Ministers that there was a need for the surplus countries in Europe to take action as well as the U.S.  They did not take action, and the result is that the situation has deteriorated considerably since last January and the upturn will not come about as early as even the greatest pessimists were prepared to forecast last January.  As a consequence of that, we have to take further action. <Col N="341" /> I forecast last January that it was possible that, throughout 1975, circumstances might so change as to require an adjustment in budgetary policy.  Those circumstances have, unfortunately, changed for the worse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They were there in January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This Government produced a balanced January budget to deal with circumstances as they then were.  The Opposition ought to go back and read their own speeches of last January when again and again they chastised the Government for failure to spend more public money, for failure to spend more money on grants, to spend more money on subsidies.  They said we were not reflating enough but if we had reflated more the deficit today would be even greater than it is.  Yet they say the deficit is too great.</P>
      <P>Indeed throughout this debate the Deputies opposite were very liberal in their suggestions for further and further public expenditure, for further subsidies for State bodies.  How they expected any of those things to be done without an increase in taxation I do not know.  Nobody knows.  They do not know themselves. We endeavoured to take a balanced view of the new situation by providing subsidies to bring down the consumer price index.  Those subsidies come to the relief of everybody including people who are being asked to contribute towards this 10 per cent temporary surcharge on their income tax.  All get relief and a very large number of the people who will pay the 10 per cent addition on their income tax will receive a net benefit when the subsidies and the VAT removals are taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even the person on the top income tax rate of 77 per cent will receive the benefit of the subsidies and the VAT removals.  When these are put in the balance it will be seen that the position will be better for the majority of taxpayers compared with last year or earlier years.  So far as sacrifice is involved it is worth while if it means a commencement to the end of the inflationary spiral in this country.  The goal is worth while.  It <Col N="342" /> is certainly worth striving to achieve. Because it is a worthy one and will confer benefit on all, it is surely not inappropriate that those who are best in a position to pay should bear some of the burden.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Before section 2 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>2&mdash;(1)  Section 1 shall be repealed immediately upon the happening of any of the following events during the income tax year 1975-76:</P>
      <P>(a)  the amendment or repeal of section 2 in such manner as to impose a change to value-added tax at any rate other than zero rate on all or any of the commodities specified in subsection (1)  of section 2, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the reduction or removal of all or any of the subsidies announced in the Financial Statement of the Minister for Finance made in Dáil Éireann on the 26th day of June, 1975.</P>
      <P>(2)  If section 1 should be repealed in accordance with the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, all income tax then paid on foot thereof shall be repaid by the Revenue Commissioners with all convenient speed.</P>
      <P>As you are aware, Sir, under the rules of the House, it is not permitted to circulate an amendment on Committee Stage until we commence the Committee Stage, and because of the guillotine motion it was not possible to circulate it until now.  Therefore, I do not know to what extent it has been circulated and, with your permission, Sir, I will read it out:</P>
      <P>Before section 2 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>2&mdash;(1)  Section 1 shall be repealed immediately upon the happening of any of the following events during the income tax year 1975-76:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> (a)  the amendment or repeal of section 2 in such manner as to impose a change to value-added tax at any rate other than zero rate on all or any of the commodities specified in subsection (1) of section 2, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the reduction or removal of all or any of the subsidies announced in the Financial Statement of the Minister for Finance made in Dáil Éireann on the 26th day of June, 1975.</P>
    <P>(2)  If section 1 should be repealed in accordance with the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, all income tax then paid on foot thereof shall be repaid by the Revenue Commissioners with all convenient speed.</P>
    <P>I had originally proposed to include in subsection (2) provision for repayment of the tax with interest but, for technical reasons, that would not be in order and therefore the amendment does not require that.  It will be clear that what is sought here is this. The Minister announced a package on the last budget day and this Bill is implementing part of the package. One part of the package is the imposition of an additional 10 per cent this year on income tax at the 35 per cent and upwards levels.  The other part in section 2 is the removal of value-added tax from a number of commodities mentioned in section 2.</P>
    <P>The Minister said both in his budget speech and on a number of occasions since that, in certain circumstances, the Government would have to consider the taking back&mdash;if I might put it that way&mdash;or the removal of VAT and the subsidies on the various items which are being or are to be subsidised.  The Minister has explained his reasons for that.  I want to ensure with this amendment that if the Minister's threat is carried out we will not be left with the situation where the imposition of the 10 per cent surcharge is what we are left with of the package proposed by the Minister.  I want to ensure that if part of the package goes then all of it goes.  This amendment is designed to ensure that if there should be a repeal <Col N="344" /> of the zero rate of value-added tax on any of the items mentioned in section 2 or if there should be a reduction or removal of any of the subsidies announced by the Minister in his budget statement, then in those circumstances the 10 per cent surcharge on income tax should be repealed and any tax already collected at that stage should be refunded by the Revenue Commissioners with all convenient speed to the taxpayers concerned.  I do not think there can be any reasonable objection to such a proposition.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that the Minister will not find difficulty in accepting this amendment which may well be providing something that he intends. If he does intend it, I suggest it should be written into the Bill.  If, however, he does not intend it, it would raise questions in many people's minds.  I hope that is not the situation and that the amendment represents the Minister's intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a clever amendment if one considers that being clever but unhelpful is what the country needs at present.  The Opposition deserve credit for smartness but I honestly think the situation is too serious for engaging in clever little debating points.  The Government are asking the people, in their own interest to accept a little less for a while in order to gain more in the long run.  The Government's budget proposals were designed to obtain a response from the people which would measure up to the gravity of the situation which the common people understand.  We are expecting to get that positive response on 31st July which will make it possible for the Government to continue the measures in this Bill and in the budget to reduce the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Government's budget proposals and that is its effort to stimulate the economy, to maintain employment and to provide job opportunities which would not be there unless the Government provided additional capital and money for current expenditure also.  Such expenditures need to be financed. The Opposition argued in the course of this debate that the size of the <Col N="345" /> deficit is already too high.  If the Opposition consider that the deficit is too high they should not be putting down amendments which, if carried, could lead to a higher deficit.</P>
    <P>If there is not an adequate response to the Government's proposals, the inflation rate would be higher than it need be.  If that situation were to occur, clearly our second state would be worse than the first. The Government have no intention of allowing that situation to develop because it would not be in the best interests of anybody if such a situation were to materialise.  Therefore, there will be a realistic appraisal of the situation if by any mischance it were to develop in a wrong way. However, that is an extreme situation towards which we do not expect the country to drift because, as I said, there is immense common sense here.  Whenever the people have been consulted about major issues, notwithstanding the usual parade of daft ideas, common sense has come through.  The Government are at present exercising themselves in a massive campaign to mobilise the fundamental common sense of our people.  That common sense would quickly see through the suggestion of the Opposition, that the 10 per cent income tax surcharge should be abolished if all the ingredients of the Government's package were not fulfilled in their entirety.  It is a wee bit too clever by half.  It is, I respectfully suggest, not worthy of serious consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a limited time available and I do not propose to use a great deal of it in replying to the Minister.  Stripped of all the verbiage we have heard what has now emerged is that what the Minister called a package is not a package, and that he contemplates a situation in which he might restore the value-added tax to the various items proposed to be zero rated in section 2 and 3 or reduce or abolish the subsidies on the various items he announced on budget day and still maintain the 10 per cent surcharge on income tax which we had been led to believe was part of the package.  It now appears that it is not part of the <Col N="346" /> package and the 10 per cent surcharge on income tax stays anyway.  That is what the Minister has told us.  No matter what happens to subsidies or value-added tax zero rates, the 10 per cent surcharge will stay for this year anyway.  That is the reasonable interpretation of what the Minister said.  If nothing else has emerged from the putting down of this amendment but the clarification of the attitude of the Government in this regard, it will have been worth while.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing what was recommended years ago.  We are not going to play games with the Opposition in their little legislative tricks designed to give themselves some passing pyrrhic victory.  The Government spelt out, through the statement I made on 26th June, that the budget was a two-fold exercise. First, is contained the Government's direct proposals to reduce inflation and to promote employment. Secondly it was a move that required an adequate response from others. We have not concealed from anybody the fact that it requires a response. In fact the criticism of the Government has been that the Government have proceeded by a method which involves decision-making by others. What is that decision-making?  It is inviting our people to vote for common sense, inviting our people to give their consent to a policy which is necessary for the economic salvation of this country.</P>
      <P>But apparently the Tory Fianna Fáil Party would prefer a policy in which the Government would impose certain measures on people without waiting for their co-operation, that the Government should try to settle the short-and the long-term problems of this country through compulsory procedures which history has shown, not only in this country but elsewhere, provoke a negative response. If compulsory procedures have to be resorted to experience has shown that at best they are of short duration because they stimulate antagonism which means that the compulsory measures have to be multiplied.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, if good results can be achieved by co-operation there is a far better <Col N="348" /> prospect of the wisdom which brought about the co-operation remaining.  A positive response through consultation will be available not merly in the short term but in the long term as well.  That is the Government's attitude.  We will not apologise to anybody for endeavouring to bring about this correct policy through co-operation of the social partners.  It is surely better to work with people than by compulsory methods to mobilise them against you.</P>
      <P>The amendment suggests that the budget of 26th June could be written off if circumstances occurred which made it necessary to consider the removal of subsidies and the restoration of value-added tax.  I have already written to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions informing them that the Government considers the response of the executive council in relation to the third phase of the national wage agreement to be such as would enable the Government to continue the subsidies and the value-added tax reductions; so the hypothetical situation which arises or which is visualised in the amendment is an unreal one.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with the fact of the budget and with the response from the Congress of Trade Unions to that fact.  We have indicated that the response is such as to enable the subsidies to be maintained.</P>
      <P>We have also indicated that if factors outside our control are such as to shove up the cost of living towards the end of the year, the situation will then be so serious that it would be necessary to have further consultations in the Employer/Labour Conference with the social partners in order to produce an appropriate adjustment to the national wage agreement.  These are the realities that we must deal with, not with hypothetical or mischievous postulations made by the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition in this amendment are putting forward a mischievous hypothesis.  They are seeking to suggest that the positive response the Government have sought is not forthcoming when all the indications are that it is forthcoming.  Then they <Col N="349" /> say that if doomsday should arrive and if common sense should not prevail the Government should, by accepting this amendment, divest themselves of the very responsibility which the Opposition in the course of this debate have said that the Government should exercise.  We discharged our responsibilities on 26th June and we are discharging our responsibilities again in this Bill.  We would not be discharging our obligations as a Government if we were to insert into this Bill this mischievous manoeuvre which would endeavour to limit the action which the Government might take if the economic difficulties of this country were to worsen still more.  That would be a reckless thing for us to do and it is irresponsible for the Opposition to suggest that the Government ought to do it.</P>
    <P>What is particularly deplorable is that this suggestion comes from an Opposition that has spent the last few weeks in this House saying that the Government did not know their own minds and were running away from doing unpleasant things.  They are suggesting that there was disagreement in the Government as to how the situation should be dealt with. There is no such disagreement and we are not at this stage going to accept an amendment which would run quite contrary to everything <Col N="350" /> that the Government have done.</P>
    <P>Our package has several elements in it.  The non-completion of any one particular element would be no justification for the cancellation of the lot.  If there had to be a cancellation it would have to be more than is provided for in this particular adjustment because the immense additional public expenditure which the Government have incurred in this budget of 26th June still remains.  Is the Opposition suggesting that this amendment should be accepted so that the deficit would be even greater if job promotion expenses were to remain?  Or do they suggest&mdash;if they want to complete the logic of their mischief&mdash;that the expenditure should not be indulged in at all?  If they want to suggest that now it is a pity they did not suggest it in the course of the debate.  Most of the contributions from the Opposition during the debate were to the effect that the Government were not expending enough money to maintain employment or generate new employment.  If the taxation element of the package is to go such as Deputy Colley is suggesting, then he ought to complete his mischievous suggestion by making it clear that the whole package is to go according to Fianna Fáil and then unemployment would get worse.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, as far as I know the Bill has to be put now.  I would like to refer to an item, namely, bed clothes.  As far as I know they are not included but fur coats are included.  I am very concerned about this, in view of the fact that fur coats are included and they can cost anything up to £1,000. I would be grateful if the Minister could include bed clothes as well.</P>
      <P>It being 10.15 p.m. the following questions were put by the Chair in accordance with the Order of 9th July, 1975:</P>
