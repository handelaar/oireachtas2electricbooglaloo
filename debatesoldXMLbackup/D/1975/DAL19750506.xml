      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I am arranging to have a copy of the statement which was issued after the meetings circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I have now invited the organisations concerned to participate in a small working party, drawn from the Government and the National Economic and Social Council.  This working party which would be chaired by the Minister for Finance would, subject to the views of the organisations concerned, have for its terms of reference:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to recommend remedial action to deal with the difficulties confronting the economy with due regard to the employment, financial, investment and other implications.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Following is the statement issued on behalf of the Government by the Government Information Services:</P>
      <P>The Government today held a series of consultative meetings with organisations representing industry and agriculture, employers and trade unions.</P>

    <P>The meetings reviewed the current economic situation and various ways of protecting employment and living standards. The dangers of the current level of inflation were emphasised.</P>

      <P>While it was not possible, because of the necessity to make increased provision for priority services such as housing, sanitary services and the phasing out of the cost to ratepayers of the health services and housing subsidies, to make any new grant allocations under the amenity grants scheme for the current year, it is, of course, open to local authorities, using their own funds, to continue carrying out or assisting voluntary groups in the carrying out of amenity works including the building of youth and community centres. The ability of local authorities to finance such works from their own funds has been strengthened by the very great increase in assistance to them.</P>

That is the only answer I can give the Deputy.  I would love to be in a position to give very much more to those who want to borrow money for house building. Whether or not they would be in a position to pay it back is another question.  In any case, people are availing of them at the existing income limit and amounts.

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that an applicant in May, 1973, with an income of £2,350 was in a very different position to an applicant today earning that amount? Would he not feel that many of those people who would have been entitled to housing grants and loans in May, 1973 are no longer eligible because they have gone above the qualifying income limit although their circumstances have not changed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner is forgetting the fact that just about that time I increased the income limit and the amount of loans very substantially. They had not been increased for a number of years before that.  Therefore, portion of the 37 per cent is taken into account.  I do agree with Deputy Faulkner that people <Col N="1124" /> would avail of this money if a larger amount was made available but, as the Deputy knows, there is a limited amount of money which can be made available for this and that sum is more than taken up by the applicants who qualify under the existing limit.

      <P>While the adequacy of existing legislation in regard to waste disposal is being examined, the fact is that local authorities already have considerable powers under sanitary and planning law to deal with indiscriminate disposal of waste and with lettering.  I have recently asked all local authorities to make full use of these powers, wherever appropriate, and in addition to seek the interest and support of the public and of voluntary organisations in a special effort to improve standards in this matter.

On the contrary, I believe that standards are improving, and I expect them to improve further.  It was with this in mind that last year I requested local authorities to review and reorganise their waste and dump operations and to adopt modern tipping methods.  At the same time, advice was given on the selection and management of dump sites with a view to avoiding pollution and nuisance.  I believe that these reviews will lead to changes where they are needed and to a general improvement in dumping standards in accordance with the advice given.</P>
      <P>I have no power to make regulations or enforce standards in the matter and, while the adequacy of existing law in regard to waste disposal is being reviewed, it may not be that a regulatory approach will be found to be the best one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate there are many agencies and authorities involved, not merely at governmental level but also at local authority level and at levels in between.  I should not like to make any estimate at this stage as to when agreement might be reached on the most appropriate form for the future.  I am very anxious to see an acceleration of consideration of this problem because it is likely that the arrangements we have in 1975, which are really no more than a continuance of what we had in 1925, are not suitable to the requirements of the latter half of the 20th century.</P>

However, he will also appreciate I cannot dictate the readiness of other people to respond to suggestions I offered that now is the time to make changes.  While the Government may well be of the view that certain changes should take place, to enforce those views against the opposition of others would not be the best way to obtain the co-operation that would ensure the best advantage for the western areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the fact that the Exchequer returns to 11th April, 1975, disclose a situation which is less favourable to the extent of £50.7 million than at the corresponding date last year, he will state whether the deficit on current account this year is now estimated to be greater than was forecast in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the fact that, between 1st January and 11th April this year, the amounts shown in the Exchequer return for total expenditure on central fund services and supply services less total revenue exceeded the corresponding amount for the relevant period of 1974 by £50.7 million.</P>
      <P>The projected current budget deficit, 1975 is equal to the difference between anticipated current expenditure and revenue for the year as a whole, whereas the expenditure on supply services in the return referred to by the Deputy includes expenditure on voted capital services&mdash;which is outside the ambit of the current budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will, in any event, be appreciated that, as considerable fluctuations occur in the budgetary position during the course of a year because of a number of factors, including differences in the timing of payment of expenditure and receipts, the budgetary position in the early part of a particular year will not <Col N="1141" /> necessarily reflect the eventual out-turn for that year as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it was anticipated that in the earlier part of the year the tax revenue would be a great deal less than in the latter part of the year, having regard to the fact that the sixteenth round national pay agreement would come into operation only for the latter quarters of the year and that other incentives such as the tax concessions and so on would become applicable only for the later part of the year.

      <P>The figure has taken into account also the difference in holiday periods in the two years. Because of the difference this year between the date of Easter compared with last year there were fewer days <Col N="1142" /> worked but our economy, in common with the economies of the western world, is experiencing a situation in which tax buoyancy is not as great now as it was in other years.  This is because of the decline in economic performance which, in turn, is a reflection of the world position but it would be wrong to carry over into the second half of 1975 the poorer performance which we experienced in the first quarter of the year.  The situation is very likely to improve in the latter half of the year.</P>

      <P>I can understand the difficulty to which the Deputy refers but the PAYE regulations require employers to notify the inspector of taxes of the cessation of employment. Unfortunately, such notifications are not received in many cases particularly in relation to employers of a small number of people.  Likewise, the taxpayers who may complain about receiving these notices themselves do not notify the Revenue Commissioners of changes in their circumstances.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy is referring to the level of private capital investment from abroad in the first quarter of 1975. The level of such investment is usually calculated by reference to the change in official external reserves and the balance of payments position on current account.  Since the latter is calculated on an annual basis only, it is not possible to estimate what the capital inflow was in the first quarter of this year.  I might add that the private capital inflow in 1974 was exceptionally high at £120 million compared with an out-turn in 1973 of £40 million.</P>

      <P>Does the fact that our external reserves had decreased from £495 million at 31st December, 1974, to £472 million at 31st March, 1975, indicate that there is a considerable falling-off if not a complete drying-up of the capital inflow which was such a satisfactory aspect of our 1974 external financial position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Changes in external reserves can come about by reason of a variety of circumstances.  For instance, the trade figures show that the trade deficit rose from £77.5 million in the fourth quarter of 1974 to £108.2 million in the first quarter <Col N="1145" /> of 1975.  Taken in isolation, this would reduce the reserves.  Such information as is available suggests that private inflow has continued at a satisfactory level and, indeed, at a level which exceeds previous experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy not to add to the number of mischievous and inaccurate comments. The size of external reserves can be attributable to a number of different circumstances including, in any one period, the quantity of money borrowed abroad by the State.  Taking one period with another, we have not engaged in the same quantity of foreign borrowing this year as we did last year and that, in itself, would be reflected in the size of the external reserves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>It is ominous.  The Minister is aware of the fact that, despite the very difficult circumstances which obtained right through 1974, our external reserves actually increased by £60 million.  That trend was reversed in the period between December last year and March of this year.  This is something to which we should direct attention.  I was asking the Minister reasonably if he had any explanation to offer for that ominous trend.  If he offers it, I am prepared to accept that the fact that the State did not borrow during that period is one explanation.  Is that his view of why our external reserves not only did <Col N="1146" /> not increase but actually decreased very significantly in that short period?</P>

      <P>I am suggesting to the Deputy that it is improper to use the emotive word &ldquo;ominous&rdquo;.  One of the reasons why resort was not made to foreign borrowing to the same extent is that the sale of Government securities on the domestic market has very significantly and successfully increased in the same period.  Accordingly, the necessity to borrow so extensively in the foreign market did not arise.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> My Department will co-ordinate the submission and processing of this country's applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund.  It is a pre-condition of assistance from the regional fund that public authorities in the member states must participate in the financing of any project in respect of which an application for assistance is made.  Projects to be submitted to the European Regional Development Fund will, therefore, be drawn from activities already qualifying for State expenditure.  The relevant EEC regulation provides that fund assistance may only be given for investments costing more than £20,833 and which are of the following types:</P>
    <P>(1)  Industrial, handicraft or service activities which create ten new jobs at least or maintain existing employment.</P>
    <P>(2)  Expenditure on infrastructure, which is either directly related to these activities or an essential pre-condition for them.</P>
    <P>(3)  Investment in infrastructure on mountain and hill farming and farming in less favoured regions, for instance, access roads to farms, electricity and drinking water and, in tourist areas, disposal of sewage.</P>
    <P>Suitable projects which meet these criteria will be selected by my Department in consultation with the other Government Departments and agencies involved, that is to say, the Department of Local Government and the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it quite clear that the selection of a particular project for assistance will not increase the level of aid already being paid to that project. It will simply be the means of obtaining assistance from the fund to increase our total industrial and infrastructural investment effort particularly in less developed areas.  Proposals for assistance from the increased resources which will thereby be available to the State should be submitted to the appropriate Government Department or agency directly concerned with the project.  It will not be necessary to forward a copy to any EEC agency as this will be done by my Department.</P>

The question referred to the statements on Radio Telefís Éireann on Sunday by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in relation to the outcome of the Northern Convention elections.  The urgency I imported into it is self-evident.  In that question I asked the Taoiseach if he was aware of the despondency and apprehension that this statement caused in the country, especially amongst the Northern minority, and if he would make an immediate statement to allay that despair and apprehension.

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the Government in relation to Northern Ireland is based on two principles; the necessity for a power sharing executive in Northern Ireland and the need to give appropriate recognition to the relationship which exists between the two parts of Ireland in such matters as economic and social policy and security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have in all their communications with the United Kingdom Government reiterated this policy.  In September last, after a meeting which I held with the British <Col N="1161" /> Prime Minister, Mr. Wilson, the joint communiqué issued after the meeting stated:</P>
    <P>On Northern Ireland both the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister agreed in the interest of all the people living there&mdash;and of the people of both countries&mdash;that peace and stability should be restored on a basis commanding widespread acceptance within the community there.  They reaffirmed that this objective can be achieved only if both sections of the community in Northern Ireland share power in Government.  The Taoiseach and Prime Minister confirmed that any enduring political arrangements must take account of the special relationship which exists between the two parts of Ireland.  This Irish dimension will be the subject of further consultations between the two Governments and also with elected representatives in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>At a further meeting in November last, Mr. Wilson and I reaffirmed the identify of our views on Northern Ireland as expressed in the communiqué I have just quoted.  The Government believes that continued insistence by the British and Irish Governments on their agreed policy on these matters, to which they are, separately and jointly committed will, in due course, lead to a general recognition of the fact that no alternative system of internal government in Northern Ireland, based on the exclusion of the minority from power, will be acceptable to these sovereign Governments or will be workable in practice.  Recognition of this reality by all the political leaders who seek to participate in the running of Northern Ireland's affairs is a necessary pre-condition for the creation of stable government and peace in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government will take every opportunity of making this position clear within Ireland, in Britain and abroad.</P>
    <P>In pursuing their policy it has been proper for the Government to keep in close touch with political parties in <Col N="1162" /> Northern Ireland.  They will continue to do so&mdash;in particular, with the SDLP, without whose acceptance, as the party which has repeatedly secured the confidence of the vast bulk of the minority, no effective system of government can be put into operation in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>As I indicated before the Taoiseach read his statement I had put down a question on the remarks of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on RTE last Sunday.  I did not press the point in the knowledge that the Taoiseach was going to make a statement, a statement which I was given to understand, shortly after I received information that my question was refused, would deal with the Northern Convention and the current political situation in the North of Ireland.  Apart from a reiteration of a communiqué which was published some months ago, and which takes up about half of the Taoiseach's very brief statement, there is no reference whatever to the situation that has come about as a result of the Convention, a situation which, I submit, has been gravely prejudiced by the untimely and to some extent intemperate remarks of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer the Taoiseach to the remarks&mdash;no doubt he has heard them or has been told about them&mdash;of Mr. Laird, a Unionist Member of the Convention, to the effect, commenting on the remarks of the Minister for Foreign Affairs: <Col N="1163" />&ldquo;Now the Dublin Government have learned their lesson and are backing off.&rdquo;  That is an ominous interpretation from an entrenched Unionist of the meaning of the words spoken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

I suggest that, while the Minister may have pleased the British conservative Press and the Unionist element in the North, where he may have been trying to establish himself, as I think he has done, as the darling of that Press and the darling of Unionist opinion, has he taken any account whatever of the opinions and feelings of the other tradition in the North of Ireland, feelings of being alienated, not only by the statement the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs made but by the general inactivity of this Government in relation to the situation up there? I would like to suggest to him that what I have said is exemplified in the remarks of Mr. Paddy Devlin after the Minister spoke, and later by Mr. Seamus Mallon, who said that the words of the Minister were: &ldquo;Manna from Heaven for the Loyalists.&rdquo;  In the light of that reaction, and in the light of the feeling we all know now exists among the minority population, I would like to ask the Taoiseach whether he realises the potential danger inherent in these remarks of the Minister as being more of an incitement <Col N="1164" /> rather than, as I feel they should have been, an appeasement?</P>

      <P>I would like to point out also that the Minister's statement last Sunday, taken in conjunction with previous statements made by him and, in particular, the one in which he said he was not actively working towards Irish unity, all these statements can be interpreted by all people, certainly by opponents of the political process, as an abandonment of the aspiration which has long and deeply been held by a majority of the Irish people.  Let me say it is not as though the Minister's remarks on Sunday came out of the blue; it is not as though the Taoiseach or members of the Government could not have had some prior notice of them because the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs expressed himself in exactly similar terms on the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme the previous evening, so I can only take it that his remarks were deliberate and that, by implication, his remarks were condoned, if not approved, by his colleagues in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to refer to the Taoiseach's statement.  He said the British and Irish Governments on their agreed policy on these matters, to which they are separately and jointly committed, will in due course lead to a general recognition of the fact that no alternative system of internal Government in Northern Ireland based on the exclusion of the minority from power will be acceptable to those sovereign Governments or will be workable in practice.  I do not think I need point out, either by inference or implication, that the opposite to exclusion from power is power sharing <Col N="1165" /> and if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, a member of this Government, who, through his leader, is solemnly committed to this policy, says the exact opposite, how then can the Taoiseach reconcile what he has just told the House today with the stated views of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach has he and his Government notwithstanding the leamh words used in this statement, abandoned as a means of contributing towards a solution of the Northern Ireland situation the concept of power sharing?  I want to ask further, despite again what the Taoiseach has said, will his Government continue to encourage the British Government to work towards the establishment of a power sharing Executive in the North of Ireland?  If the answer to both these questions is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, again I ask how, in the face of the remarks of a prominent Minister, can they pursue with any credibility this policy with the British Government?  We all know that the British Government have means of exercising effective influence on the development of the situation in Northern Ireland.  We know well that they are contributing hundreds of millions of pounds every year by direct financial subsidy, and in many other ways as well, and surely it is obvious to the Government and to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that this was not the time to make a statement like that when that Minister knows that the British Government have influence, influence which I believe should be directed along the lines towards ensuring power sharing as a policy in the development of the situation in the North of Ireland to which the Taoiseach tells us both his Government and the British Government are committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, too, on this side of the House, are committed and, as I said in a short statement after the Minister's speech, all parties here and all parties in Westminster are committed except, of course, the Minister for Posts and <Col N="1166" /> Telegraphs.  He has now abandoned it.  Here, again, I ask where is the reconciliation between this kind of statement and Government policy, if there is such a policy in existence? Was it not a most inappropriate time for the Minister to make these remarks, pre-judging, and adversely prejudicing, the outcome of the Convention even before it sat and, indeed, even before the preliminary sitting with the chairman of that Convention and the party leaders took place?</P>
    <P>I might say in passing that the British Government have themselves expressed dissatisfaction with the remarks of the Spokesman of the British Opposition in relation to the outcome of this Convention and I might add that it was Mr. Airey Neave who said he did not agree with all the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said but went only so far as to say that he could not share that Minister's pessimism.  These were the remarks, simple and innocent enough remarks, in answer to questions that a British parliamentarian made dissociating himself from a statement made by a member of the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has made some kind of statement to help clear up the position.  Unfortunately he has made no reference whatever to the statement of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and, in my opinion, and in the opinion of this party, he has made no attempt whatever to clear up the ambivalent approach that now seems to exist in this Coalition Government in relation to Northern Ireland matters.  This is the Government over which he presides. Within two days of a statement of this nature he gives no indication whatever to what extent, if any, he disagrees with it, or gives no indication whatever to what extent, if any he will permit individual Ministers to make ambivalent statements of this nature.  I hope never again will Northern Ireland policy be expressed by the Government in diverse tongues. This is the cost the country must pay for a coterie of people in power who have so much in opposition and who have so many diverse opinions and give expression to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" /> However undesirable and even tolerable that statements, which are not in accordance with Government policy on social and economic matters, may be, I agree it is entirely intolerable that statements by such people as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should be let go without any dissociation in the remarks made by the Taoiseach when given a clear opportunity here in this House.  I ask the Taoiseach in future to ensure that no matter how many voices might enunciate so-called Government policy that only he will tell the people what Government policy is in relation to this very delicate national political problem and that that policy will be followed.</P>
    <P>I said the Minister's remarks were inopportune.  In the absence of the Taoiseach yesterday at an official function and in the absence abroad of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach made a covering up statement.  He made the kind of statement through which one could read: &ldquo;tut tut, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&rdquo; but he went further today.  He said he would not be as positive or as pessimistic as Deputy Cruise-O'Brien in foreclosing on the manoeuvres of political parties in the Convention.  I take it he used the word &ldquo;manoeuvres&rdquo; in the ordinary political sense and without any sense of decrying the efforts that will be made to produce a workable executive. He went on further to say that the Minister went even further than he need have gone, that he need not have gone as far as he did.</P>
    <P>I believe there were two factors that adversely affected the results of the Convention election for the moderate opinion in the North.  One was the boycott and the intimidation by the Provos and the other was the so-called low profile of this Government in relation to the Northern situation.  We have been told of the virtues of this low profile, that the people in the North could solve their problems themselves but there is an element in the North that needs some support and an expression of that support from the people down here.</P>
    <P>That was not given.  The net result <Col N="1168" /> was that in at least two areas seats were lost.  One which springs to mind immediately is South Armagh where a very eminent member of the SDLP, Paddy O'Hanlon, lost his seat.  These losses were due to these factors.</P>
    <P>This party know the delicacy of the situation.  We also know where we stand and where we have always stood in relation to the North of Ireland. We have been restrained over the past few weeks in the run-up to this Convention election.  We have been restrained following the results of it. We have been hopeful that in one way or another the kind of agreed policy between the parties in this House, between the British and Irish Governments, in relation to the power sharing objective, would somehow or other work.  I believe, with the kind of statements made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, he has greatly prejudiced that situation and has set back the attainment of the aspirations of the great majority of the Irish people.</P>

Might I also ask him to clarify for me and for the people of this country as a whole, whether the statement by Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien, a member of his Government, to the effect that the withdrawal of the British from the Six Counties would be a catastrophe is current Government belief and whether, in fact, believing in that way is tantamount to saying that the British must stay, which is contrary to all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat the reference which my statement made to the basis of the Government policy in relation to Northern Ireland. I said it was based on two principles, the necessity for a power sharing executive in Northern Ireland and the need to give appropriate recognition to the relationship which exists between the two parts of Ireland. Deputy Lynch asked if we still support the policy of a power sharing executive.  Not merely do we support the idea of power sharing but, as I said, the statement that was issued after the meeting I had with Mr. Wilson in September, reaffirmed the British Government's commitment to this approach and at a subsequent meeting in November that view was again reaffirmed.</P>
      <P>In addition, it was stated then, and I direct Deputy Blaney's attention to it, that this Irish dimension will be the subject of further consultation between the two Governments and also with elected representatives in Northern Ireland.  Deputy Lynch raised, as did Deputy Blaney and Deputy Smith by way of query, the remarks of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  It is well that the remarks should be available in full. What the Minister said was this: The questioner said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien, this morning if he could <Col N="1171" /> see any possible area of agreement in the Convention.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>Well, I see no possibility of agreement on an executive at the present time.  The Loyalist majority clearly exclude a power-sharing executive and the SDLP will, of course, not accept any other form of executive and, of course, the Government here would be opposed to an exclusively Loyalist executive in Northern Ireland because of the history of the past.  So I think agreement on an executive is not available. It remains to be seen whether there is any other ground on which there could be a kind of a meeting of minds, for example, in relation to a legislative assembly.  I do not know whether that will be possible. I do not know whether there will be an attempt to hold this thing together.</P>
    <P>Later he said:</P>
    <P>Well, the Irish dimension is a fact.  Whether Loyalists or anybody else want it to go away, it will not go away.  It is there.</P>
    <P>That, I think, indicates that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was referring to the stated position of the two main groups in the Northern Ireland Convention, the attitude of the Loyalist majority and the attitude of the SDLP and he restated the attitude of the Government here, that we would be opposed to an exclusively Loyalist executive.</P>
    <P>I have reaffirmed in the statement today the Government's attitude on this matter and I think it is important in this regard to differentiate between policy and talk of support.  A good deal of the talk of support is talk; it does not strengthen the position of those involved in this and we have made our position quite clear and I think the attitude which the Government have taken up in this matter has the support of the majority of the people who recognise it as a realistic approach to the very difficult problems of the North of Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> In page 13, lines 13 to 15, to delete &ldquo;within a time specified in the notice, such information on the matters specified in the notice as is in his possession.&rdquo;  and to substitute &ldquo;within twenty-one days after the date of the notice or such longer period as the inspector may allow, such information relevant to the ascertainment of the duration of the lease on the matters specified in the notice as is in his possession.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment and amendments Nos. 2 and 4 arise from points made by Deputy Colley on Committee Stage, which I undertook to examine before Report Stage.  The present amendment relates to paragraph (c) of section 19 and inserts a new subsection (5) in section 8 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Deputy Colley expressed concern that the words &ldquo;of the matters specified in the notice&rdquo; were too wide and could be interpreted as including matters not directly concerned with the duration of the lease referred to in the opening words of the section.  I did not quite accept the Deputy's representations in the matter but in any event I have been anxious to meet him and the amendment now put forward ensures that the matters specified in the notice must be relevant to the ascertainment of the duration of the lease. The amendment also takes account of the point made on section 21 (7) of the Bill where it was suggested that the provision requiring the furnishing of information should ensure that a reasonable time would be allowed for supply of the information, with discretion for an extension of time. Accordingly, the words &ldquo;within twenty-one days after the date of the notice or such longer period as the inspector may allow&rdquo; are being inserted. Would the House agree that I should also comment upon amendments Nos. 2 and 4 at this stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, amendment No. 2 is aimed at meeting another point made by Deputy Colley on section 21 (2) about the possibility of <Col N="1175" /> some affected person being unable for one reason or another to give notice within the time limit of 21 days.  It is proposed to meet the point by bringing in the provision of section 416, subsection (7) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which deals with the situation where a taxpayer is prevented, owing to absence, sickness or&mdash;and this is the relevant phrase&mdash;&ldquo;other reasonable cause&rdquo; from giving notice of appeal against an assessment to income tax made upon him by an inspector.  That subsection empowers an inspector to admit or refuse a late appeal and enables the taxpayer to appeal to the appeal commissioners against a refusal by an inspector to admit a late appeal.  This provision will now apply to cases affected by section 21, subsection (2) of the Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 4, this amendment to section 21, subsection (7) is complementary to amendment No. 1 and, again, meets the point made by Deputy Colley in relation to the time limit for the furnishing of information to an inspector.  The amendment specifies a time of 21 days, with provision for an extension of that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has introduced these amendments and taken the points I made on this matter.  As far as I can see, the amendments do meet the points I raised.  I have no doubt that the legislation which will result from the passage of this Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas will be the better for these amendments.  It is true that in relation to the matters involved the Minister did inform us that he and the Revenue Commissioners are not aware of any particular case of the kind sought to be covered.  Nevertheless, since there were three or four sections dealing with this matter, obviously there was anticipated a possibility that such a situation could arise.  That being so, it seems to me desirable that we should make the legislation as good as possible without weakening the effort being made to close a certain loophole.  I think these amendments do that.  I am glad the Minister <Col N="1176" /> has taken the points I raised and has incorporated them in these amendments.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Provided that this subsection shall not operate to prevent any person to whom notice has not been given under subsection (1) from appealing against any such determination of the inspector which may affect that person's liability to tax.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Colley was concerned that some person affected by an inspector's determination under section 21, subsection (1), might not receive notice under that subsection.  Consequently, he might be unable to give notice of appeal under section 21, subsection (2).  Deputy Colley suggested that the words &ldquo;the determination shall not be called in question in any proceedings&rdquo; would preclude an appeal on the part of a person to whom notice had not been given.  This possibility is being met by amending subsection (3) to ensure that a person who has not got a notice under subsection (1) will not be denied a right of appeal where his liability to tax is affected.  I trust the Deputy will accept that this meets the point.</P>

      <P>In this case also I am glad the Minister has met the point I raised by introducing this amendment. I think the point to which he referred is met by this amendment and to that extent again the Bill is being improved. However, I am somewhat disappointed <Col N="1177" /> that another point raised in connection with the same wording does not appear to have been covered in this amendment. Let me briefly remind the Minister of it.  It had to do with the phrase &ldquo;the determination shall not be called in question in any proceedings&rdquo;.  I raised the point that, even in the case of somebody who has received notice, if that were deemed to be a provision to the effect that a ruling on a point of law by the inspector could not be called in question in any proceedings, this would be, to say the least, unsatisfactory and, indeed, might well be unconstitutional. It does not seem to me that the amendment covers that point. In so far as it goes, certainly I welcome it.</P>
      <P>I would urge the Minister, between now and the passage of the Bill in the other House, to look again at that point to see if there is any substance in it and, if there is, to amend the provision by an extension of the amendment now before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5.</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 49 and 50, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;34.&mdash;(1)  Section 255 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the insertion of the following paragraph after paragraph (c):</P>
      <P>`(cc)  for the intensive production of cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry or eggs in the course of a trade other than the trade of farming within the meaning of section 13 of the Finance Act, 1974, or'.</P>
      <P>(2)  In relation to a building or structure which falls to be regarded as an industrial building or structure by virtue of subsection (1), Chapter II of Part XV and Chapter I of Part XVI of the Income Tax Act, 1967, shall have effect as if&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  `one-fifth' were substituted for `one tenth' in section 254 (1) of the said Act,</P>
      <P>(b)  `one tenth' were substitued for `one fiftieth' in sections 264 (1) and 266 (4) of the said Act.</P>
      <P>(c)  `tenth year' were substituted for `fiftieth year' in section 264 (3) and the proviso to section 265 (1) of the said Act,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> (d)  paragraph (a) of the proviso to section 266 (4) of the said Act were deleted. </P>
    <P>(3)  The foregoing provisions of this section shall have effect as respects capital expenditure incurred on or after the 6th day of April, 1971, but no allowance shall be made under the said Chapters by virtue of this section&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  for any year of assessment prior to the year 1974-75, or</P>
    <P>(b)  under section 254 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, in respect of expenditure incurred before the 6th day of April, 1974.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to insert a new section in the Bill which will provide initial and annual allowances in respect of capital expenditure on buildings used for the intensive production of livestock.</P>
    <P>The question was raised on Committee Stage of the Bill and the point was made that it was anomalous to give an allowance to farmers in respect of such buildings but to deny an allowance for them when used by a non-farmer. The point was also made that an allowance is granted to market gardeners in respect of buildings used by them for the production of market garden produce.  I accepted that there were anomalies and I undertook to examine the situation further.  Having examined the position, I have come to the conclusion that the same allowances should be made available for these buildings as are available for farm buildings and market garden buildings.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the new section provides that, in respect of expenditure incurred on or after 6th April, 1974, on buildings used for the intensive production of livestock, poultry and eggs, there will be an initial allowance of 20 per cent and an annual allowance of 10 per cent.  The allowances will apply for the year 1974-75 and subsequent years.  As in the case of the farm buildings allowance, expenditure incurred on or after the 6th April, 1971, and before the 6th April, 1974, will come within the scope of the allowance subject to a notional <Col N="1180" /> write-off for the years prior to 1974-75.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) describes the class of building which will qualify for the allowance.  The allowance is not intended to extend to ordinary buildings which might simply be used for housing animals or feeding them in the normal way.  Since the person claiming the allowance will be a non-farmer&mdash; because farmers using such buildings are entitled to a farm building allowance in any event in respect of them&mdash;it is difficult to imagine that such a person would be housing or feeding animals other than in an intensive way. Consequently, the section speaks of buildings used for the intensive production of cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry or eggs.  The subsection inserts a reference to these buildings in the definition of &ldquo;industrial building or structure&rdquo; contained in section 255 (1) of the 1967 Act.  This brings the buildings within the provisions of Chapter II of Part XV of the 1967 Act&mdash; initial allowances&mdash;and Chapter I of Part XVI&mdash;annual allowances.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) adapts the sections specified therein so as to ensure (a) that the initial allowance to be granted under section 254 (1) will be 20 per cent, that is one-fifth instead of one-tenth, which is the basic fraction in the section.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) ensures that the annual allowance to be granted under section 264 (1) will be at the rate of 10 per cent instead of 2 per cent which was the basic fraction for annual allowances for industrial buildings.  Under the deeming provisions of section 266 (4), notional allowances will be written off for years prior to 1974-75 in respect of expenditure between 6th April, 1971, and 5th April, 1974.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) ensures that where the building is sold, the residue of expenditure to be allowed to the purchaser will be divided by the number of years still to run between the date of sale and the tenth year of the life of the building, instead of the fiftieth year.  In other words, if the residue of unallowed expenditure is £5,000, the purchaser will get an annual allowance of £500 and not £100.  A consequential amendment is also made in the proviso to section 265 (1) which ensures that no <Col N="1181" /> balancing allowance or balancing charge is to be made on the sale of the building after the tenth year at which time the cost of the building will have been written off.</P>
    <P>The non-application of paragraph (a) of the proviso to section 266 (4) deals with the notional write-off of annual allowances and is being adapted so as to provide for a notional write-off for years prior to 1974-75 in the case of expenditure incurred between 6th April, 1971, and 5th April, 1974.  Paragraph (a) of the proviso deals with the exceptional case of a lessor of a building entering into occupation himself for trading purposes, thus involving a change of basis of assessment.  Because of the technical structure of the relief, the notional write-off would apply for one year so that a year's allowance would be lost although the building continued to be used as such for all years.  To protect the situation, paragraph (a) of the proviso said the write-off provision was not to apply in the case of a year of assessment from 1960-61 onwards if the building was an industrial building on the day preceding the beginning of the year of assessment.  The existence of this paragraph would now prevent a write-off for years prior to 1974-75 in relation to expenditure on intensive production buildings incurred between 6th April, 1971, and 5th April, 1974.  Accordingly, the paragraph is being rendered ineffective in the present case.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) brings in expenditure incurred on or after 6th April, 1971, as in the case of the farm buildings allowance, but no actual allowance is being given for any income tax year prior to 1974-75, or for corporation profits tax purposes for any part of an accounting period prior to 6th April, 1974.  This follows from the automatic application of subsection (5) (b) (ii) of section 69 of the Finance Act, 1959 which deals with the position for corporation profits tax purposes.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (6) ensures that no initial allowance will be given in respect of expenditure before 6th April, 1974.  This applies in the case of the 20 per cent initial allowance for farm <Col N="1182" /> buildings and market garden buildings.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has introduced this amendment.  We raised this point because there seemed to be an anomaly in that the capital allowance was being granted for farm buildings back in 1971 and was already in existence in respect of industrial buildings.  The buildings involved in this amendment seemed to be suspended like Mohammed's coffin between the two.  Substantially, the effect of the amendment is what we sought, namely, that buildings of this kind used for intensive production&mdash;particularly of livestock, but it goes further than that&mdash;will get the same kind of treatment as farm buildings although they are being treated as industrial buildings.  The amendment meets the point we were putting forward.  It cures the anomaly and I am happy the Minister put forward the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 25, to delete lines 41 to 55, and in page 26, to delete lines 1 to 27, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;46.&mdash;Every enactment levying or charging Estate Duty, Succession Duty, Legacy Duty or the duties referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the First Schedule to the Finance Act, 1894, is hereby repealed in respect of any property passing on a death which occurs on or after the 1st day of April, 1975.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to enable the Minister to make an honest man of himself and his colleagues in the Government or, alternatively, to call his bluff.  It is a very simple amendment because what it provides is that all death duty legislation would be repealed in so far as it affects property passing on a death occuring on or after 1st April, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be recalled that in relation to this matter on Committee Stage we <Col N="1183" /> drew attention to the fact that this Bill does not abolish death duties despite the fact that the marginal note opposite section 46 reads: &ldquo;Abolition of death duties.&rdquo;  I do not ever recall seeing a marginal note in a Bill which, on its face, is inaccurate and untrue if one reads the section.  In this section&mdash; which I am seeking in this amendment to delete&mdash;we find a marginal note which reads: &ldquo;Abolition of death duties&rdquo; and a section which details the various death duties and which says they will no longer be chargeable on or after 1st April, 1975.  Of course, they do not repeal or abolish death duties.</P>
    <P>In the course of discussion of this matter, the Minister did not advance any argument to justify his claim that he was abolishing death duties except one.  The other arguments he advanced were, when analysed, to the effect that he was adjusting the death duty limits. He is changing the name to inheritance tax.  Effectively, what he is doing is adjusting the death duty limits&mdash;and this is something with which we would not disagree&mdash;but he is not abolishing death duties, although a marginal note was inserted to give the impression he was doing so.</P>
    <P>When it was pointed out to the Minister that the death duty legislation was not being repealed, the only real argument was in a sentence reported at column 775 and 776 of the Official Report dated 30th April.  Interspersed with a certain amount of abuse by the Minister, he said:</P>
    <P>The Deputy knows well that deaths which arose before 1st April, 1975, give rise to a liability and until such time as these matters are discharged the legislation has to remain there so as to be applicable to those unfortunate events.</P>
    <P>I replied:</P>
    <P>That is about .01 per cent of death duties which the Minister can easily deal with.</P>
    <P>Of course, the amendment here would easily deal with that because it does not purport to repeal the legislation in respect of any death occuring prior to the 1st April, 1975 so that the case <Col N="1184" /> made by the Minister is, of course, met by this amendment.  This, in one way, may be viewed as a fairly sterile argument and in one sense I view it that way.  On the other hand, I doubt if it is a totally accurate description of the matter when what we are trying to do here is to get the Minister to deal plainly and honestly with the people and not to pretend that he is abolishing death duties when he is not.  It seems to me that if the Minister really means to abolish death duties then he should have no difficulty in accepting this amendment which repeals death duty legislation in respect of deaths occurring on or after 1st April, 1975.  If he really is abolishing death duties and if the marginal note really means anything the section in the Bill which we propose to delete should be taken out and the amendment we propose, the new section 46, should be put in because that is precisely what the proposed new section does.  It repeals death duty legislation in respect of all deaths occuring on or after 1st April, 1975.  The Minister, therefore, should not have any great difficulty in accepting the amendment.</P>
    <P>It is of some importance to look at what is behind all this.  Why did we get a marginal note which on its face is untrue and why do we have to introduce an amendment providing for the repeal of death duty legislation?  The reason, of course, is that the Minister and his colleagues, prior to the last general election, promised and undertook to abolish death duties.  We, on our part, in the Fianna Fáil Party, promised to have a fundamental review of the whole death duty legislation and the position arising therefrom.  It was reasonable to expect, on foot of what was promised by my party, that there would be a substantial raising of the exemption limits under the death duty code but it was reasonable to assume, from the promise made by the Minister and his colleagues, that death duty legislation was to be repealed because death duties were, according to him, going to be abolished.  In fact, for various reasons, which the Minister may or may not choose to elaborate on, he does not propose to abolish <Col N="1185" /> death duties and he does not propose to repeal death duty legislation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister came into the House with a section on the lines of section 46, without the misleading marginal note, and said: &ldquo;All right, we promised to abolish death duties but I find for reasons a, b, c, d and e that I cannot do that but I do propose to have very substantial improvements in the exemption limits&rdquo; that would be an understandable situation.  That is not what the Minister did.  He came in with substantial increases in the exemption limits but, at the same time, he pretended that he was abolishing death duties.  He felt apparently obliged politically to continue the pretence that he was abolishing death duties.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to enable the Minister and his colleagues to make honest men of themselves or alternatively to call their bluff because if they are abolishing death duties the Minister can have no objection to the repeal of death duty legislation in respect of death duties occurring on or after 1st April, 1975.  If he has no objection to that repeal we will have struck a blow for honesty in public life.  If, however, he finds himself unable to accept it then we will have established clearly, beyond any shadow of doubt, that all claims by the Minister and his colleagues to the effect that they are abolishing or have abolished death duties are fraudulent and without foundation.  I look forward with interest to the Minister's approach to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For a number of very cogent reasons this amendment is unacceptable.  The purpose of the amendment is to delete section 46 of the Bill and to substitute a new section in its place and it is apparently based on an objection to a marginal note which speaks of the abolition of death duties.  The only criticism that can be applied to the marginal note, which has not statutory effect, is that it did not add:</P>
      <P>Abolition of death duties affecting deaths occuring on or after the 1st April, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section itself makes it clear that it is to be operative with effect from <Col N="1186" /> 1st April, 1975.  We have had a great song and dance about the marginal note as though it was the law.  The objective could be achieved in a number of ways, for instance either by repealing a very long list of existing enactments&mdash;it would be a list much longer than that offered by the Deputy&mdash;or by providing, as section 46 does, that the existing duties should cease to be levied in connection with deaths or events occuring after the 1st April, 1975.  If the first alternative were to be taken the Schedule would run into, at a conservative calculation, about ten pages of print at least and we have already had objections about the length of a comparatively short Finance Bill. Obviously where law in relation to death duties is spread over three-quarters of a century there would be quite a number of enactments to be specified in any repealing section. The section itself would necessarily have to provide that the repeal would have effect only in relation to deaths occurring on or after 1st April, 1975. It would thus leave all the existing enactments fully in force in relation to deaths occuring before that date.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly there would, therefore, be no distinction in principle between either of the two methods. The second alternative was chosen as offering the simpler and more straightforward solution to a difficult problem.  Apart from the old, obsolescent duties referred to in subsection (2)  of section 46 the duties being abolished are estate duty, legacy duty and succession duty.  Estate duty is a mutation or transfer duty chargeable on all property passing at a death.  It is charged on the whole estate, on the corpus of an estate as defined in the various enactments relating to estate duty.  Legacy and succession duties are acquisition or inheritance type taxes payable by beneficiaries on property acquired by them, in possession, on death or on the happening of certain events, some of which are not necessarily connected with a death.  Because of the different natures of these three taxes and the difference in the incidence of the taxes, including the type of payment, <Col N="1187" /> it is not possible to take the three of them together as has been done in the amendment.  The expression &ldquo;property passing on a death&rdquo; is meaningful only in the context of estate duty.  Clearly, it has no relevance in a technical sense either to legacies or succession duties.  The section proposed in the amendment would have the effect of leaving in force charges for legacy or succession duty in numerous cases, whereas, section 46 would remove them.  For these reasons I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The bluff has been called.  I have heard weak efforts in this House, particularly from the Minister for Finance, but what we have heard now is the most classical calling of a bluff that I have ever heard.</P>
      <P>If I were Minister for Finance, I would not dare to stand up and say what has been said by the Minister. No one with even the faintest modicum of respect for himself, for his promises or for those of his party, could do so.  The tragedy is that this will be painted as being technical legal jargon between solicitors but that is not so.  What we have heard is the kernel of the matter and that kernel is the votes which were bought under false pretences on February, 28th, 1973.  It has taken two years, two months and seven days to call the bluff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let it be understood clearly that the National Coalition have refused to repeal death duties.  The law relating to death duties, as a result of this refusal, remains in force but will not be levied in respect of deaths occurring on or after April, 1st, 1975.  The law relating to death duties&mdash;the charging and incidence of them&mdash;can be re-enacted in this House in five minutes by a one section Bill repealing section 46 of the Finance Act, 1975.  Deputy Colley proposed an amendment to this Bill which would have the effect of repealing death duties.  Section 46 of the Bill as proposed does not repeal them.  The Deputy invited the Minister to accept <Col N="1188" /> an amendment which would do what the Government are not doing but the Minister has declined to accept the amendment.  He began his remarks&mdash;I had expected him to continue for 20 minutes or so&mdash;by saying that for a number of cogent reasons he did not propose to accept the amendment.  I sat back as I thought we would hear some reasons cogent or otherwise but we heard none. Instead, we got an ultra-technical exposition of the phrase used in the amendment, &ldquo;property passing on a death&rdquo;.  We were told that property passes on a death only in relation to estate duties but not in relation to succession and legacy duties and that for that reason and because it would leave legacy and succession duty in force, the amendment could not be accepted.</P>
    <P>In the first place I dispute that argument seriously.  I cannot see how a succession can arise so far as succession duty is concerned other than on a death.  It might arise in circumstances where something was given to someone for 20 years with the remainder to be given on the expiration of the 20 years but one rarely, if ever, sees a provision of that kind.  While I dispute the reasoning put forward by the Minister, I will take it on myself, for the purpose of this argument, to say that even if he were right, we would amend the amendment to meet his point.  I am sure Deputy Colley will not object to my making that point.  Legacy duty can arise only on a death, on property passing on a death.  Surely the whole point of legacy duty concerns a legacy left by someone who has died.  I know that in some elaborate settlements, a settlement is, for some reason, made in a very obtuse way where there may be a technical passing of benefit that is not on a death.  If that is so, there may well be a smaller number of such cases but we would be prepared to add another subsection to make clear that such duties are repealed too.</P>
    <P>Having told us that he would be putting forward several cogent reasons for not accepting the amendment, the Minister went on to refer to our objection to the marginal note.  I shall have something to say about that in a few <Col N="1189" /> minutes but in the meantime suffice it to say that it has nothing to do with the amendment.  As we pointed out on the last day, the marginal note is a misstatement of the effect of section 46 of the Bill.  Regardless of what might be the marginal note or of what it might be called, we are concerned that it is being accepted now, that it is not questioned by anyone, that the effect of section 46 as drafted does not abolish death duties.  Deputy Colley has put it to the Minister that he should abolish death duties and has put down an amendment to that effect but the Minister refuses to accept it for no other reason than something very technical regarding succession duty not being payable on property passing on a death.  It is payable on a succession arising.  In 99 cases out of 100 a succession arises as a result of a life tenant or some such person dying.</P>
    <P>There may be some circumstance in which a succession arises other than on a death.  If there is, we will cover it. There may be one case in 1,000 in which the succession would not arise on a death.  If there is, we will get somebody to draft an amendment which will cover that point.  The Minister can do it if he is sincere and if he wants to abolish death duties.  Deputy Colley put it to him that if he did not accept this amendment his bluff was called.  He did not accept it and he did not give any reason other than a technical lawyer's reason about this phrase &ldquo;property passing on death&rdquo; which is quite irrelevant.  I believe there is no substance in it but he thinks there is.  If there is, let us amend the amendment if it is now the wish of both sides of this House to repeal death duties legislation.  I do not believe that an amendment to the amendment is necessary but, if the Minister insists it is, let him consult his advisers and we will get some new terminology, some new words used in addition to &ldquo;property passing on death&rdquo;.  We can add in &ldquo;any succession arising&rdquo; or some phrase of that nature.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed on one side of the House only that we should repeal death duties legislation.  That proposal is now coming from the Fianna Fáil Party and it is now being opposed by <Col N="1190" /> the Fine Gael Minister for Finance. Let that be clearly understood in particular by those who believed the promises made to them in February, 1973.  Let them see the full circle which the wheel has now turned.  Let them see the man who is supposed to fulfil those promises, grovelling here in legal jargon and technicalities and trying to justify his refusal of this amendment. I wish they could be here today to see this because, unfortunately, this is not the type of thing which carries through into the newspapers.  I wish they could be here to see the grovelling, grasping attempt made by the Minister to justify this because of some doubtful few words in the amendment.  Does he or does he not accept the principle involved? That is all that matters.  He does not accept that principle.  He has said so.  His bluff is called.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to an amendment I put down to this section and which I was told was out of order and would not be printed.  I understood that even if an amendment was out of order it would be printed.  It must be a new ruling of the House that amendments which are out of order are not printed.  I understand that the next amendment will be ruled out of order by the Chair but, nevertheless, it appears on the amendment sheet. The effect of my amendment was of little substance really so far as the Bill is concerned.  It related to the marginal note to which the Minister referred.  I wanted the marginal note to be in accordance with the facts. As the Minister knows and everybody else knows, it is not in accordance with facts.  I wanted to change the wording of the marginal note from &ldquo;abolition of death duties&rdquo; which is not what is affected by the section to &ldquo;non-levying of death duties&rdquo;.  For some reason which has not been explained to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Naturally, I accept the Chair's ruling on this matter but it seems that the question of marginal notes is a totally arbitrary matter and whoever happens to be printing the Bill can more or less put in whatever side note he wants to and that it does not matter whether or not it bears any relation to the section.  I regard that as very unsatisfactory.  I will suggest to you, Sir, that you might refer this practice to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to be looked into.  If it does not matter twopence what the side note is, anybody can put it in and he can put in anything he wants to.  This House which is supposed to be creating legislation has no control over it and apparently the printer in Cahills can put whatever he wants to if he feels like it.  I regard this as totally unsatisfactory.  It is not often that one comes across a situation in which the marginal note&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Rarely is <Col N="1192" /> this procedure of the title of a section and marginal note abused, but it is abused in this case.  It is regrettable that the House should have no control over the marginal notes.  Apparently the printer can arbitrarily put in anything he likes and there is nothing the House can do about it.</P>

I should like to feel I had the support of the Chair in doing so in view of the fact that the Chair must be conscious of the rights of all Deputies in relation to legislation. I am sure the Chair is conscious of the fact that legislation should not mislead the public as this marginal note does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Colley put it with regard to his amendment, the Minister has had his bluff called.  He has now refused to repeal death duties legislation which is in existence.  This matter should be drawn to the attention of everybody who listened to the many wonderful promises made to the public in February, 1973.  The Minister gave one other reason which was that if we were to set out every Act relating to death duties that list would be several pages long.  He seemed to find this unsatisfactory.  I do not find it unsatisfactory.  This list would be in some Schedule at the end of the Bill.  We would not go through each one individually and ask the Minister about the Legacy Duty Act of 1793, or whatever the first one is.  We would take the lot together.  It is not necessary to set them all out.  What Deputy Colley has proposed here covers them all.  It is totally comprehensive.  He covers estate duty, succession duty, legacy duty and the four duties referred to in paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the First Schedule of the Finance Act, 1894.  They are four archaic duties which do not arise now but which are technically still part of our law.  I do not remember the names of them <Col N="1193" /> but they have something to do with customs duty.  They are strange ones which operated in the 18th and 19th centuries but do not operate now.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that it is necessary to set out every one of those Acts one after the other but even if it is it can be done in two or three pages. I looked at the list in the volume which the Revenue Commissioners produce for the Statutes relating to death duties and it runs to a little more than four pages.  There is a full list of all Acts and sections at the start and it runs to more than four pages because each individual section in the 1984 Act is set out separately. If it was to be confined simply to the titles of the Bills, it would be less than that.  I do not believe that is necessary but if it is we should have four pages of a Schedule.</P>
    <P>The Schedules in this Bill run from page 30 to page 40, inclusive, and I have heard no complaint about their length.  Another four pages or less would not have made much difference if the Minister wanted each one set out separately.  What Deputy Colley has suggested is adequate.  One reason the Minister gave was that each Act would have to be set out separately and, consequently, it would be too long. His second reason was a silly one, the sentence, that any property passing on a death does not cover succession duty and legacy duty.  We dispute that it does not cover them but if there are some instances where successions arise or legacies become payable other than on a death we have no objection to words such as, &ldquo;or a succession which arises&rdquo; being added there.</P>
    <P>The Minister has seen fit to refuse a Fianna Fáil amendment on what he and his colleagues partially succeeded in getting themselves elected in February, 1973.  Glossing over it by saying that three or four pages of a Schedule is too long or that some technical words were left out of this amendment, does not get away from the nub of this point, that this Government in this matter as in so many other matters not the least of them being prices, unemployment and redundancies, have once again reneged on their promises to the Irish people.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Two years ago the average person, having read the 14-point plan, understood that death duties would be abolished but having listened to Deputies Colley and O'Malley it is obvious that the Minister is not abolishing them.  If he was sincere about abolishing death duties, he would accept Deputy Colley's amendment. Farmers and businessmen are under the impression that death duties have been abolished but by virtue of the fact that the Minister is adamant in refusing Deputy Colley's amendment I am convinced now that death duties are not abolished to the average person.</P>
      <P>From the outset we knew that death duties would be replaced by capital acquisitions tax and the other taxation proposals.  The taxation package being put through this House by the Government is far more penal than death duties.  Many people are waking up to this fact now.  Death duties are being called a different name under the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.  It is easy to call them a different name and collect the same amount in taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that certain sections in the <Col N="1195" /> Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill are acceptable but very few would accept the entire taxation package to replace death duties.  Section 45 is misleading to the average person.  The Minister misled the people in his election promises of two years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Malley, I regret that the people who heard the Minister and his colleagues promise sincerely to abolish death duties cannot be here to hear the same Minister refuse to accept an amendment which would repeal death duty legislation and at the same time refuse or omit to bring in his own amendment having the effect of repealing death duty legislation.  It is clear beyond any shadow of doubt, and the Minister has admitted it, that death duty legislation remains.  In case anybody might have thought it was an oversight on the Minister's part this amendment gave him the opportunity, if he wanted to accept it, to repeal all death duty legislation applying to deaths occurring on or after 1st April of this year which he said he was doing.  The Minister refused to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No amount of marginal notes or assertions that the Minister abolished death duties can alter the fact that all death duty legislation is remaining on the Statute Books.  Not an iota of it is being repealed and the Minister has refused to repeal it.  We are entitled to ask why the Minister is refusing to repeal death duty legislation if, as he says, he has abolished death duties.  There is only one logical explanation for the Minister's refusal to repeal death duty legislation and that is that he has not abolished death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that it is amended and has increased, in most cases, the exemption limits under death duty legislation and has changed the name to &ldquo;inheritance tax&rdquo;.  It is carrying on precisely the same system we have always had.  The Minister is changing the limits but he had to pretend he was abolishing death duties because that is what he and his colleagues promised <Col N="1196" /> to do.  Since he was not abolishing death duties, but simply changing the limits, he had to go through the elaborate artifice of pretending he was abolishing death duties so he introduced a Bill with all sorts of elaborate provisions in relation to something he calls &ldquo;inheritance tax&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has to pay this tax will find it impossible to distinguish between death duties and inheritance tax.  In addition, the Minister had to go to the extent, unprecedented as far as I know, and I think Deputy O'Malley has raised here a most important point that should be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges since we cannot control marginal notes on Bills or the index in front of a Bill of including a marginal note that was clearly false and clearly did not do what it purported to do, namely, describe the section to which it was attached.  It is most unusual to have such a situation but again the Minister found himself forced to do this because he had to go through this elaborate hoax of pretending he was abolishing death duties. If the Minister were abolishing death duties it would be a simple matter for him to accept our amendment or, if he felt our amendment did not effectively repeal death duty legislation, he could bring in his own amendment. Either course was open to him.  He has chosen to adopt neither.  It is important that those who voted in the last election should know clearly that the Minister had a choice of repealing death duty legislation and refused to make that choice.  They can draw their own conclusions from his refusal. They can see clearly that he is refusing to repeal death duty legislation and, more clearly still, that he is maintaining death duties under another name.</P>
    <P>We had two pathetically poor reasons, and only two, put forward by the Minister for refusing to accept our amendment.  The Minister started off by saying, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out, that there was a number of cogent reasons, but he gave only two.  One was that it would require a long schedule to list all the legislation. Is the Minister seriously suggesting <Col N="1197" /> this is a good reason for refusing to repeal death duty legislation? If he is, nobody will take him seriously.  One would have thought in the light of the announcement from the Government Information Services: &ldquo;Halleluia, death duties have disappeared&rdquo;, and in the light of what was said by the Minister and some of the Deputies behind him about an historic occasion in relation to the removal of death duties, that the necessity for introducing a long schedule to list all death duties legislation for the purpose of repealing it would not have been too much trouble.  Nobody could take seriously &mdash;I doubt if the Minister himself intends to be taken seriously&mdash;that the reason for refusing to repeal death duty legislation is because the schedule listing the legislation would be too long.  The other reason given was that the phrase &ldquo;property passing on death&rdquo; was not relevant to legacy or succession duty.  That statement is not correct and the Minister should know it is not correct.</P>
    <P>There is no need for us to get involved in technical arguments on this. Deputy O'Malley rightly pointed out that, if the Minister believed that was so and if he believed this amendment did not effectively repeal death duty legislation, it was open to him to bring in his own amendment or suggest an <Col N="1198" /> appropriate amendment of our amendment in order to achieve the repeal of death duty legislation.  The Minister stolidly refuses to repeal one single provision of death duty legislation. That is an inescapable conclusion. Can anybody advance one single cogent reason why the Minister should refuse to repeal this legislation?  I can think of none and the Minister did not give us any reason.</P>
    <P>There is one possible conclusion&mdash; we put it forward before and it is now confirmed without any shadow of doubt by the Minister himself&mdash;and that is that he is not abolishing death duties.  He is using the same instrument and the same paraphernalia to collect death duties under the name of inheritance tax.  That is what his refusal to accept this amendment or introduce his own amendment for the repeal of death duty legislation means. That is what it establishes.  All I am anxious to ensure is that those who voted for the Minister and his colleagues in the last general election on foot of a solemn promise to abolish death duties will now learn of the Minister's refusal to repeal death duty legislation and the Minister's refusal to accept this amendment makes that crystal clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann favours the appointment of an Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>It is important that this motion be given serious consideration.  It is something about which we have spoken over the years and to which we have given very little consideration.  It is important also to consider the role of an ombudsman.  In my view he would act as a controller of equality, a watchdog in ensuring the rights of individuals and that people with grievances would be protected.</P>
      <P>We are entering into an era of the welfare State and all that that entails. As a result, the majority of our population come under the social welfare code and are part of the vast bureaucratic machine.  In addition, there is the enactment of a large volume of new legislation providing for insurance and health benefits, pensions, family allowances and other social services on a nation wide scale.  When one looks at the situation in that context alone, it is important to appoint an ombudsman to investigate complaints. Some people say there are 144 ombudsmen in this House.  I suppose we are such and that some Deputies feel they can handle the situation.  It is my firm belief that Deputies on all sides of the House would welcome such an appointment.  I think we hear half the story only.  The ombudsman would hear the whole story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> Other aspects of modern-day life include planning legislation, the regulation of development land.  With regard to house building, many people feel they are not given a proper hearing, despite the fact that resort to appeals exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There is still the need for the ultimate appeal.  There is now also a vast area embracing semi-State bodies such as the Electricity Supply Board, Bord na Móna, the Sugar Company, Aer Lingus and CIE to mention but some of them.  One of the problems with regard to semi-State bodies is that they exist in isolation and are not accountable to this House.  In those areas also it is important that there be a person to whom the ordinary man in the street can go to have his complaint dealt with openly, fairly and impartially.</P>
      <P>I make those points bearing in mind the fact that the standard of administration in this country is very high. But we are in the throes of a great bureaucracy which on occasion, either through lack of knowledge or indifference, can cause hardship to people. It is important that justice be done and be seen to be done.  I realise that is a hackneyed phrase but, nonetheless, it remains true today.  A man of substance can deal with such situations. He is near the establishment.  He enjoys status and influence which will ensure for him an air of authority.  He can endeavour to solve his problems by applying legal remedies.  He knows his way around.  Indeed, that is indicative of the whole legal system today. But too often the ordinary, humble, citizen, is slow to assert himself.  He has become used to being pushed around.  One of the problems in our society is that too many people take what is said at the top as being gospel and accept it without question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that the appointment of an ombudsman would create a questioning attitude amongst people with regard to demanding their rights and <Col N="1202" /> not accepting merely what is handed down because it is important that all our people be equal.  All people, regardless of their income, should have recourse to justice and fair play.</P>
    <P>It is important that the person appointed ombudsman will be one who will command the full respect of the public and the administrators.  This will happen if he is a person with humanity and understanding and I hope the first ombudsman will set this trend.  I am not against the legal profession but I would favour somebody outside that profession for this office.  We have tended to look to that profession when we want people to arbitrate but in this case we should look over a wider range and should seek a person who has a deep insight into the problems of people.  The right person will chart the course suitable for us.  Every country is concerned about its own problems and the aspects of life peculiar to it.  The office of ombudsman will evolve.  I should not like to think that our only contribution would be to introduce legislation into this House and leave it at that.  This matter should be examined to ensure we are getting the best type of service.</P>
    <P>In this instance we cannot be accused of rushing matters.  We have dragged our feet over the years for one reason or another.  When we consider that Sweden instituted this office in 1809, Finland in 1918, Denmark in 1955, Norway and New Zealand in 1962 and England in 1966, we realise we are not forerunners in this area.  In fact, we are coming in rather late but it is never too late.  I would urge the Minister to bring legislation before the House at an early date.  We often pass measures here about which the public are not concerned or even aware but they want this kind of legislation.  As the bureaucratic system gets larger, many people have the impression they are getting smaller and less important and they have no means of recourse other than going to their public representative.</P>
    <P>The ombudsman will be of great benefit to Members of this House because he will have the right to examine files in a Department, which we cannot do, and he will get information <Col N="1203" /> we cannot obtain.  When we write to a Minister we get a nice letter from him which we pass to our constituent involved in the case.  While we hope the information we get from the Minister will be of help to our constituent, there is really little we can do if this is not the case.  On the other hand, the ombudsman will be able to carry out an independent investigation and will be able to follow up matters.  He will be able to highlight any grievances that exist.  In many instances people consider they have a grievance but when the case is studied it emerges this is not so.  However, the person concerned may not be satisfied.  When the ombudsman investigates a case, at least the people concerned will know it is being pursued to the fullest extent.</P>
    <P>When the ombudsman finalises a case he will issue a report to both parties.  This is an important consideration. Public representatives have many day-to-day problems to cope with and they are not too concerned or have not the time to eliminate the causes of the problems.  The ombudsman will be able to make recommendations that help in this area.  Although people may have recourse to the courts, the latter are only concerned with legislation.  They are not concerned with natural justice but the ombudsman must be concerned about that.  He must be concerned about people.  One of the important aspects of his office should be informality. That would break down people's suspicions of bureaucratic systems. People will not have great trust in the office if they see it as another form of bureaucracy.  He should investigate complaints without any serious disturbance in whichever Department he is investigating.  If he goes in and upsets a Department the whole thing will have a negative effect.  When he is carrying out investigations in a Department he should be completely independent of the Executive.  He should be his own man.  He should go in and examine files and make reports. If he is not independent, facts will not be forthcoming and things may be clouded over or covered up.  If the <Col N="1204" /> ombudsman does not have independence we will continue on our merry way and just write letters, as we do now and get letters back without any proper investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not go down to the Departments himself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do indeed.  I very often go to the Departments and I find the officials first class.  I think we have a very fine standard of administration.  That does not mean that errors do not occur.  If one looks at the Order Paper one sees the stupid questions tabled by some members of the Opposition about phones here and phones there and other fiddling things.  With all due respect, I do not think the Deputy goes to Departments.</P>
      <P>It is also important that the ombudsman should investigate local authorities because they are becoming a very important part of life.  They deal with housing, compulsory purchase orders, road traffic and so on. When they make an order it affects many people.  The ombudsman should have power to investigate local authorities. I say this without prejudice to any of the officials of local authorities. I think they are first class.</P>
      <P>I believe officials will be very happy about the appointment of the ombudsman because in most cases it will be found that the Department took the right decision.  This will give a greater status to officials and it will mean a greater public understanding of officials.  The findings of investigations will be published and people will become aware of the high standard of administrator we have running our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Different countries have different ways of doing things.  In Denmark and in Finland the actions of Cabinet Ministers may be examined.  I personally would not be too keen on that. I believe that if we have a Government we must give the Government the power to act.  In New Zealand the ombudsman cannot criticise actions of the Cabinet.  In Germany, Sweden and Norway there is an ombudsman for military matters.  I believe that <Col N="1205" /> would be superfluous in our situation. We should stick to the ombudsman for the general public and see how that operates.</P>
    <P>The ombudsman should furnish reports to the Government and to the public on his activities, on his ideas, on his projections and how he would see Departments operating in the future and he should make representations to the Government.  There is no point in having such an office unless it streamlines the system.  He should initiate his own investigations without waiting to be prodded and he should be looking for areas which he thinks should be investigated.</P>
    <P>It is important that when complaints come in they are dealt with quickly.  The big problem with most complaints is that they have been allowed to fester and to generate heat. If a person has to resort to the courts it is both costly and time consuming and for many human problems unsatisfactory. That is another reason why an ombudsman should be appointed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It is important that when a complaint is being investigated it is not seen as a witch-hunt to get at some official.  That would defeat the whole purpose of the exercise.  The whole idea is that constructive proposals for change, if change is necessary, should come from the ombudsman.  By being able to report back in this way we could eliminate many of the problems that might arise.  One wonders whether in some cases, at any rate, the problems are due to suspicion but problems that appear to be genuine should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to be able to hazard a guess in regard to the number and the types of complaints that would be received by an ombudsman. Perhaps, initially, people would be slow to bring their problems to him because they might be suspicious of the office in the early days.  However, it might be worth noting the situation in this regard in Sweden where, with a population of 7,500,000, the office of ombudsman deals each year with 1,000 complaints, while in Denmark, where there is a population of 4,500,000, the number of complaints <Col N="1206" /> dealt with each year is approximately the same as in Sweden.  It would appear, therefore, that the Swedes, with their social security state, have a fairer system of administration than have the Danes, but I do not know what is the reason for the disparity in the proportion of complaints as between the two countries.</P>
    <P>In both these countries the ombudsman discharges his duties efficiently and with the help of a small staff.  We need not fear that the appointment of an ombudsman here would create another vast administration.  That would not be so.</P>
    <P>An ombudsman is necessary because the people need the services of such a person.  Those of us who deal with constituents often hear them complain about the way they are treated by the various Departments. Regardless of whether the complaints are well-founded, very often there is a suspicion on their part that they are not getting a fair deal and, consequently, they seek the help of their Deputies.  However, there is no need for any Deputy to fear that the appointment of an ombudsman would diminish him in any way.  Irish people will always tend to seek the help of their Deputy.  If we had an ombudsman, a Deputy who was of the opinion that he was not getting satisfaction from a Department in regard to a constituent would have recourse to the ombudsman.  I would not agree, though, with the English system whereby complaints to the ombudsman must go first through a Member of Parliament.  However, I understand that there are proposals there to have the complaints submitted direct from the public.  This is as it should be.  We are elected to legislate and not to act as general factotums on behalf of the people we represent. The availability of an ombudsman would leave us more free to study legislation, to innovate ideas and, in particular, to read the legislation that comes before the House because there are times when we are so involved with constituency work that there is not time available to read all the legislation proposed.  To devote more time to legislation would make us better <Col N="1207" /> Deputies in that we would be able to serve better those we represent.  I am not suggesting that a Deputy should dissociate himself from the problems of his constituents.  His communication with them enables him to assess better their needs and their problems. Indeed, at election time our people would reject us if we had not listened to them and tried to do our best for them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, Deputies should not resent in any way the appointment of an ombudsman.  Rather, we should welcome the change because we could approach him in respect of any difficulties we might have with Departments, with local authorities or with any semi-State body that might hide behind their board of directors.  I have the greatest respect for administrators. It is easy to be critical of them but when we have good people we should appreciate them and stand by them.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an ombudsman would make for better relations between the administration and the general public and would allay any deep-seated suspicions that people might have.  That, in itself, is important.  Too often we hear people knocking the establishment.  They knock it because they do not know it and they feel there is a wall between them and it. With the appointment of an ombudsman there would be a breaking down of that barrier.  Dialogue would be made much easier.  There would be a general examination and an opening up of files.  People would be able to see for the first time the reason why they did not get X, Y or Z.  They would feel there was somewhere they could go to seek justice.</P>
    <P>This was the policy of this Government on coming into office two years ago.  We are in office now long enough to make a decision to bring a Bill before the House dealing with this matter.  I did not go into any of the technical aspects because we can do that on Second Stage and on Committee Stage we can bring in any necessary amendments or proposals which would make it a better Bill.  I am just giving the reasons why I think this motion is important and <Col N="1208" /> why it is important that this appointment should be made.  I earnestly request the Minister to introduce a Bill at an early date and I would ask him to indicate that when he is replying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  I believe there is a necessity for the appointment of somebody called an ombudsman, or whatever you like, to find out in certain cases if justice has been done or if justice has been denied to any person or association.</P>
      <P>In Ireland seeking after justice has been left to Members of the Oireachtas. They are approached by their constituents and told about various cases of hardship, or inconvenience, or even injustice.  If they are good Deputies and if they are efficient, they find out the background to such complaints and allegations.  Invariably, after representations, these problems are solved some to the dissatisfaction of the constituents and more to their satisfaction. In the national sense I believe an ombudsman would be a very useful addition to the Civil Service.  I suppose this would lead to extra expense because the ombudsman would have to have an administrative office and set up as a neutral civil servant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Would he be just another civil servant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I will explain that for the edification of the Deputy.  He would have an administrative office and he would act as a neutral civil servant, as a seeker of justice between the ordinary people and the Civil Service. In some cases the ordinary people do not believe they are getting justice from the Civil Service because they are not used to the technicalities and red tape which we meet in every Department and which we must surmount.  To my mind that would be the duty of the ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to read from a document on the problem in Ireland by Max W. Abrahamson.  He said that in Ireland a convicted criminal has a right to appeal against sentence, generally to a Supreme Court judge and two High <Col N="1211" /> Court judges sitting as the imposing Court of Criminal Appeal.  The case is heard in public and the convict may argue in person or through a lawyer and the court gives reasons for its decision.  The decision settled by the court may be mitigated by the Minister for Justice who acts in private on the advice of anonymous officials.  A convict, therefore, has no right to see that his case is fairly presented to the person deciding it.  We have been told by the Minister that it is not the practice to disclose the grounds on which the Minister has acted in the exercise of his statutory duties and it would not be in the public interest to do so.</P>
    <P>If an ombudsman was acting in such a case all the evidence would be made public.  It would then be a matter for the person before the court to hear the evidence being put forward on his behalf and make up his mind as to whether he is getting justice or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not much good if the person concerned is going for the long drop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people deserve the long drop and some do not.  If a person deserves the long drop, he should get it.</P>
      <P>I do not think anything could be more out of balance than this.  A person on trial should be satisfied that his case has been fairly presented and be able to make up his mind whether he is getting justice or not.  In my view we should have some person like an ombudsman to present a case, especially for the poor people and that service should be free to those people.  In European countries some years ago after people were convicted, and in some cases executed, examinations were carried out and those concerned were found to be innocent.  Such cases would have been better presented by an ombudsman than a lawyer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>

What really makes me a little suspicious is remembering that the British Government, under extreme pressure, appointed an ombudsman in the North of Ireland, where there certainly was victimisation.  If any memory serves me correctly, in the first year only 25 cases came before him.  It is rather strange that in the countries cited he should get so few cases.</P>

We do not want to be in the position in which, when we raise a matter here, we are told that it is <i>sub judice.</i> It could easily happen that if we are working on a case which has gone to the High Court for a decision and although the ombudsman might know the result we could be told that it is <i>sub judice.</i> That would be a very serious matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>In Sweden and Holland, in order to get questions answered, it is something like an adjournment debate.  Each debate takes 45 minutes and only one question is dealt with every day.  They naturally want some person to look after their problem.  If only one question was answered on each day the Dáil sits it would take a very long time to deal with problems.  I am pointing out the weakness in the countries which have brought in an ombudsman and the reason why countries like ours have been a little bit slow in bringing it in. We have parliamentary Question Time when we can ask questions, ask supplementaries and if we are not satisfied with the replies we receive we can ask the Chair to bring the particular Minister back on the Adjournment when we have a half-hour debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>We want something to help our existing system.  If an ombudsman could do something like that it would be a great help to Deputies.  We would like to ensure if an individual goes to an ombudsman it will not prejudice our parliamentary system and will not ensure that any case we are working on is <i>sub judice.</i> When we go to discuss cases with civil servants they open the files for us and show us the reason why they made particular decisions. It would be of some help if we could look at those files by right.  Deputy O'Brien did not say how the ombudsman would work.  He mentioned the rights of the individual and the man-in-the-street but we did not get any details on how the ombudsman would work.</P>

      <P>The movement to make an ombudsman, as he is called, a familiar feature of administration in Western Europe got a lot of impetus in this part of the world in the late 1950s and early 1960s in consequence of a couple of very celebrated instances of maladministration in Britain.  The people in Britain who were interested in trying to correct maladministration in a simple and direct way looked over their shoulders at the institution which was familiar in Scandinavia and in New Zealand and said: &ldquo;We ought to have something like that here too.&rdquo; What they had in mind chiefly was a paid official, of high standing, recruited, so far as possible, in such a way that his independence and impartiality would be beyond question; that he would be in a position, as Deputy O'Brien and others have said, to go in, take out files, comb through a particular case from its origin to a final decision being challenged and make <Col N="1222" /> up his mind whether or not the administration had functioned well or badly. At the root of this agitation was the idea that bad administration was fairly common and that the ordinary citizen was fairly powerless to do anything about it unless he went to law, and law is expensive, wearisome and uncertain. It seemed unfair that his rights, in a matter which might affect his property, prospects and business should be left dependent on the outcome of a legal trial.</P>
      <P>The reason I give this introduction to what I have to say is that I do not think that kind of approach is appropriate in Ireland.  I do not want merely to pay an empty compliment to the Public Service when I say this, but I do say it sincerely.  I think there is very little maladministration here in the sense which led to the institution and maintenance of the office in other countries.  I am very far from believing that things are better here generally or that we are perfect here in contexts where they are imperfect abroad.  I consider that humbug.  But I do think, perhaps because of the relatively small scale of the country, because it is, as is commonly said, a country where everyone knows everyone else, there is very little maladministration in the strict sense of the word. I would think the number of cases in this country in which anything like bribe, prejudice, personal bias or gross personal incompetence on the part of an official resulted in a bad decision being taken or a bad piece of administration are terribly rare.  I would not put a figure on them but I would say they are so rare and so few as scarcely to be worth bothering about.  That does not mean that wherever such a thing might occur or might be said to occur it is not important to have some way of remedying it.  Even were Deputy O'Brien to put his case on that basis&mdash;that even in these rare cases there should be somebody who can make sure that justice is seen to be done, and justice seen to be done cheaply and quickly for the aggrieved citizen&mdash;it would still be worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do think that the agitation which proceeded in other countries on the basis that a lot of maladministration took place would be quite out of place <Col N="1223" /> here because I do not believe there is any significant incidence of maladministration, of dishonest, grossly incompetent or neglectful administration here.  Anyway, that has not been my experience.  On the contrary.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we are to have an ombudsman, and I would support Deputy O'Brien's motion, the reasons for so doing must be sought elsewhere. I believe there are strong reasons for having such a person in our administrative and political structure but they are not reasons of trying to correct flagrant or frequent abuses.  I do not think we suffer from flagrant or frequent abuses in the Public Service. Certainly, I have not run across them and very seldom have I heard allegations of them.  If we are to have such a person we must look for the reasons for him elsewhere.  Apart from that, the kind of ombudsman who has been adopted in England would not suit us at all.  I have often had cause to complain in this and the other House, and outside of both Houses, of the terrible Irish habit which I regard as slavish, of waiting until the English do something before we do it.  We did not have warnings on cigarette packets before the English had them; we did not have yellow cross-hatched boxes at road junctions until the English had them; we did not have parking meters until the English had them; we did not have a Workmen's Compensation Act until the English had it.</P>

      <P>Although I respect and admire Deputy O'Brien's dedication in putting down this motion and pursuing it, I suspect that a lot of the attention given to it by the Devlin <Col N="1224" /> Committee and others in recent years never would have been given to it had it not popped up in the neighbouring island as well.  Why cannot we look around us, see what needs to be corrected here and go and correct it without reference to what happens in England?  If we find a different type of ombudsman from that existing in England would suit us better, let us have that different type and construct that office fearlessly.  I do not think the English type would suit us because it can only be activated through the intervention of an MP in the first instance.  There is no direct access by the ordinary citizen.  In addition, the ombudsman is prevented from looking at local government matters or at matters where a pure discretion on the part of the Administration is concerned. In other words, a very large range of decisions about which Deputies on all sides were concerned would be outside the purview of this official.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 7 in the name of Deputy Colley has been ruled out of order.  Amendments Nos. 8 and 10 in the name of Deputy O'Malley are cognate and may be taken together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In pages 36 and 37, paragraph (1), Part I, Fourth Schedule, to delete &ldquo;one thousand pounds&rdquo; in each place where it occurs and substitute &ldquo;two thousand pounds&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of the two amendments is to increase the exemption limit in respect of stamp duty on very small sales from £1,000 to £2,000.  The £1,000 limit was fixed in 1973 and since then there has been a very considerable drop in the value of money and, because of inflation, the price of most types of property has increased, not in real terms but in paper money terms. If £1,000 was regarded as a reasonable figure in 1973, £2,000 should be regarded as a reasonable figure now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> The amendments I put down to some extent arise from an amendment I put down on Committee Stage when I sought to extend the exemption on small sales to an exemption on small lettings also.  While the Minister agreed with my reasoning on that occasion and with the principle of what I sought to achieve, he told the House the Revenue Commissioners used the stamping of tenancy agreements and similar documents to obtain information for the purpose of charging income tax.  He said this was a good way of getting information that they might not be in a position to obtain otherwise.  I do not know if the same reasoning is supposed to apply to what I propose in relation to outright sales.  I trust it is not.  There are not very many sales of property other than plots for the building of a house where the consideration would be less than £2,000.  Plots for house building would mainly be exempted here.  It would be some small contribution towards lowering the costs for people who are endeavouring to build their own houses if this amendment were accepted.</P>
    <P>The figure I have suggested is reasonable and, for the most part, it would cover the sales of plots but not anything else.  I do not think any type of house would be sold for less than £2,000.  Part of the reason involved in the introduction of this exemption in 1973 was that it was doubtful whether it was economic for the Revenue Commissioners to collect the very small amounts involved in these small sales.  I think the same reasoning applies today.  The rate of duty between £1,000 and £2,000 is only ½ per cent.  The duty on £1,100 would be £5.50 which is not a figure that will enrich the Revenue Commissioners in any way.</P>
    <P>I do not think the principle the Minister enunciated on Committee Stage with regard to tenancy agreements and his refusal then to exempt agreements, even for very small amounts where the duty was as low as 5p, 10p or 15p, would apply here. There is no income accruing to anyone from the sale of small pieces of property for less than £2,000 and, <Col N="1226" /> therefore, the question of checking up on their income tax would not arise.  For these reasons I would ask the Minister to accept my amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy pointed out, the amount of stamp duty in these cases is very small.  It is only one-half of 1 per cent and, therefore, it cannot be said it imposes a hardship on anyone involved in the transaction.  The ceiling of £1,000 was fixed in the Finance Bill, 1973&mdash;only two years ago.  Having regard to the fact that inflation has not doubled in two years and that property values have tended to fall in the last year, I do not consider any change in the ceiling would be warranted at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  I heard the Minister argue in regard to this matter on Committee Stage. Having regard to all the circumstances and the relatively small amount of duty involved, he should accept this amendment.  If I understood the Minister correctly, he made the case that the amount of duty was not very great and, therefore, he said there was not any hardship.  However, when he argued such matters before, he abolished duty where it was not great because the cost to the Exchequer of collecting the small amount of duty exceeded the return to the Exchequer.  In most cases that principle is a sound one and I suggest the Minister could apply it here.  As he pointed out, in 1973 he applied the exemption to amounts up to £1,000.  I thought the Minister might give us some information as to how much the yield would be on transactions between £1,000 and £2,000 and, correspondingly, what the cost of collection of that would be but he did not appear to give that kind of information.  Naturally, we do not have that kind of information available. It is true, as the Minister said, that inflation has not gone up by 100 per cent in the interval.  Nevertheless, it is almost certain that if the cost of collection up to 1973 exceeded the revenue on transactions of up to <Col N="1227" /> £1,000, it is more than likely that the cost of collection on transactions between £1,000 and £2,000 now, having regard to the inflation which has occured since, does exceed the revenue.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I would have thought that the Minister would have thought it a good idea to accept Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  I am surprised he has not done so and surprised that, if he is justified in not doing so, he did not give us figures to show that he is so justified in refusing to accept the amendment. I would be surprised if his brief did not contain those figures.  If his brief did contain those figures and he did not give them, then one assumes that they may not have suited his case and that he had some other reason for not accepting it.  Owing to the rules of order, the Minister cannot tell us now I suppose whether he has such figures or not although I imagine the House would not object if the Minister wanted to intervene briefly just to give that information.  It would help us in our approach to this amendment if we knew the estimated revenue and the estimated cost of collection in regard to the transactions between £1,000 and £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I anticipated that the Minister would just reject the amendment out of hand without giving any valid reason for so doing.  He pointed out that because the duty involved was small it would not cause any hardship.  Of course, when he created an exemption limit of £1,000 the duty involved was even smaller and created even less hardship so I do not see the force of that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me foolish that the Revenue Commissioners would have to retain machinery for collecting these small sums of duty which hardly seem worth the cost of collecting.  I would have thought that the Minister would have been prepared to accept this amendment.  He did not make any reference to the Revenue Commissioners using this as a means of obtaining information.  I do not suppose it arises on these kinds of sales because, <Col N="1228" /> even if stamp duty is not payable on them, provided they are not registered land with an unredeemed annuity, the stamp has to be affixed in any event to the deed even though it is free of duty and in that way the Revenue Commissioners will get the information they require in relation to the transaction even though no stamp duty is payable.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister's argument that these duties create no hardship is a valid one because the duties which were abolished in 1973 created even less hardship.  I regret that the Minister has adopted the approach he has and I would ask him, even at this stage, to change his mind.  I do not think he will lose the Exchequer any large sum of money.  As Deputy Colley said, it was rather a pity that the Minister did not give us the figures in relation to the deeds which would fall into this category.  They cannot be very significant either in number or in the duty that would potentially be collected on them.  We would be in a better position to form a judgment if we had that information.  I understand the Revenue Commissioners keep a very accurate set of statistics in relation to deeds which they stamp, about the consideration, the number of deeds and the various other details which would be of value to us on this occasion, which are readily available but which, unfortunately, the House has not been given.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 38, paragraph (8), Part I, Fourth Schedule, to delete &ldquo;£2.00&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£1.50&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment would be to reduce the stamp duty on transactions between £20,000 and £50,000 from 4 per cent to 3 per cent which it was before the recent budget.  Since the 1st March last the duty has been raised under some order which was <Col N="1229" /> made subsequent to the budget from 3 to 4 per cent in respect of transactions falling within this bracket.  It was also raised in relation to transactions in excess of £50,000 from 5 to 6 per cent but I have no amendment in relation to that because I am less concerned about the properties involved there and the considerations are such that it will probably cause less difficulty to the individuals involved and who are liable for the payment of duty.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the House that nowadays all but the smallest of farms would make £20,000 and most businesses, if they are of any signifinance, would make £20,000 on sale. Very little land which a builder might buy in order to build houses on it for people could be bought for less than £20,000 unless it was a very small quantity for just a few houses.  Therefore, a huge volume of transactions by quite small people are caught by this unwarranted increase which was introduced in the budget.  I cannot believe that the Government are justified in once again increasing the direct cost for people who are trying to acquire a farm or business or land for the purpose of building houses.</P>
    <P>Costs are being increased and here, again, we have a perfect example of the Government contributing deliberately and directly to and creating inflation. The amount of money that the State might get from the individuals concerned by this increase would be fairly sizeable.  Overall, I do not know what it would be because, unfortunately, we do not get estimates from the Minister for Finance in relation to most of the changes in taxation.  Even in respect of the most major new taxes we are fobbed off with the excuse that, basically, he does not know the amounts involved.  Perhaps he does not know.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the state of the country is such that it is impossible to estimate as accurately as one could have done in the past what will be the net effect of various taxation changes.  We were not given this information in relation to the last pair of amendments I had tabled and I can only assume that we will not get the information in relation to these two amendments either. <Col N="1230" /> Therefore, it is difficult to know precisely how much is involved overall but for the individuals concerned there is a significant amount added to their costs.  The Minister may argue that in some cases the figure may be only £100, £150 or £200 but all the bits and pieces add up.  It is this kind of unnecessary action by the Government that is forcing up prices of what are, for the most part, productive assets, that is forcing up costs on those who are trying to produce goods from those productive assets and all of this is adding continuously to inflation.</P>
    <P>This is a comparatively minor example of it, perhaps, speaking comparatively, a very minor example.  We have seen this attitude in relation to such matters as health and social welfare contributions, both by employer and employee, in relation to the with-drawal of various subsidies, to the enormous increases in postal and telephone charges and in many other matters of this kind where the Government are pushing up the costs deliberately of goods and services that are part of the everyday economic life of the country.</P>
    <P>In this instance moderately-sized farms and businesses are costing more to buy because more duty is being levied on them.  It is the purchaser, who, perhaps, is already short of money, who is called on to pay on these occasions.  The Minister may argue that because the increase is no more than 33? per cent on the existing tax, by present day standards of this Government, the increase is comparatively moderate.  However, it is an increase that will mean several hundred pounds extra on the purchase price of a moderately small farm or business.</P>
    <P>If this House is serious in its dislike of inflation and if it recognises the dreadful damage that inflation is causing to our economy, this amendment should be accepted regardless of whether the Minister agrees with it if only to make some kind of gesture that is within our power in trying to keep down inflation and costs for people who are trying to produce goods for the betterment of the country.</P>

      <P>If the Opposition are serious about wanting to reduce Government expenditure, they should stop demanding daily additional public expenditure.  The way to cut public expenditure is to refrain from demanding it.  When somebody asks the Government to spend more money, the Opposition should tell them that it is not right to make such requests but they never do that except when it comes to taxation.  Then, they say: &ldquo;Forget all the demands we are making on you to spend more money; simply reduce taxation.&rdquo;  Deputy O'Malley was in Government long enough to know that that kind of trick cannot be performed.  The cost to the Exchequer of accepting the amendment would be £500,000.  As I announced in the budget, the increase was imposed to raise additional taxation to provide additional revenue for necessary purposes.  The consequences of foregoing this revenue would be that the State would not be in a position to expend the money on the necessary services which the Opposition are demanding so generously. In fairness to the Opposition, who wish for increased Government expenditure all the time except when they are dealing with the Finance Bill, I am sorry but I am not able to join in their contradictory demands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to hear the Minister on this topic.  I have heard some of his colleagues on the same topic during the past few years. What is interesting about it is that to them either you increase Government expenditure and you increase taxation or you do not increase taxation and you do not increase Government expenditure.  It is not as simple as that.  The real problem is that the Minister for Finance, primarily and before any other Minister, is charged with the responsibility of so arranging Government expenditure as to ensure that it does not entail enormous increases in taxation.  I will not say this is a science.  It is an art at which the present Minister is singularly inept.  It never seems to occur to him that another course open to him and a duty that rests on him as Minister is to examine all items of <Col N="1232" /> Government expenditure and, where it is appropriate, to prune them.  This does not mean to cut back radically in such a way that there is the kind of problem we have now whereby secondary schools are about to come to a halt.  It means a proper balance of expenditure with revenue.</P>
      <P>This Minister has proved himself to be inept in what he has just said&mdash; he has underlined this&mdash;in dealing with this kind of problem.  That kind of thinking on his part makes one realise the reasons for the enormous increases we have had in all kinds of taxation and in matters under the control of the Government and as referred to by Deputy O'Malley.</P>
      <P>The latest figures available for the increase in the cost of living relate to the quarter ending in mid-February. In that quarter the increase was 8 per cent of which 40 per cent was a direct consequence of Government action.  It was by far the highest increase we have ever had.  This illustrates very clearly the whole approach of the Minister and his colleagues to the problem of taxation, revenue and expenditure.  The very obvious consequence of where taxes are increased with a consequential increase in the cost of living, resulting in increased claims under the national pay agreement, is that the cost to the community&mdash;to Irish industry and business&mdash;is inordinately high compared with the revenue the Minister gets from these increases.  The net effect on our whole economy is disastrous. Somewhere, somebody must cry halt and take a stand on this question of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not much hope that the Minister or any of his colleagues will ever take a stand on inflation.  Their whole record is one of having abdicated their responsibilities in the fight against inflation.  Instead of fighting every inch of the way, and every small item that contributes to it, and resisting it as far as it is humanly possible to do so, they appear to have opened the floodgates and said: &ldquo;We cannot do anything about it.  We have to wait for foreign Governments to change their policies and we will cash in on it when <Col N="1233" /> that happens.&rdquo;  In my view, that is a total abdication by the Government, or by any Government, of their responsibilities. As Deputy O'Malley said, this is a very minor matter in relation to all the other increases which have been imposed by this Minister and this Government.  This is a place to make a start.  By making a start we say: &ldquo;We will not add to the cost of housing or acquiring farms or businesses.&rdquo;  The saving may be very small in each individual case but our inflation is made up of a whole lot of small items like this.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for the Minister to tell us the estimated revenue and ask: &ldquo;Where do we get the money for our expenditure if we do not have this £500,000 revenue?&rdquo; The Minister has the responsibility to tailor his expenditure to his revenue.  He cannot evade liability and responsibility for the consequences of shoving on taxation and raising our cost of living further and further with that accumulating throughout our economy.  If you do the sum you will see that the total cost to the economy of most of the actions the Minister has been taking is absolutely out of line with the alleged need to get in revenue.  Listening to the Minister one would think he went in for balancing budgets.  Of course, he does not.  He has not balanced one budget yet.  I do not want to stray too far from the amendment before the House, Sir, but you will recall that the Minister opened up the topic of Exchequer receipts and expenditure.</P>

In fact, it is small relative to the size of the Exchequer receipts and relative to most of the transactions which will be affected.  It is by taking the small step I suggest here that we can start, if we want to, to fight inflation.  The Minister's dismissal of the whole matter on the grounds on which he dismissed it is very disheartening and the outlook is very inauspicious for the economy as long as he is charged with responsibility <Col N="1234" /> for its management.  Clearly, either he is unable or unwilling to manage our economy.  This is another small but significant example of that inability or unwillingness on the Minister's part.</P>

We got a lecture from him on the need to have expenditure paid for by taxation. As Deputy Colley has said, if there was anyone ever in the history of this country from whom those sentiments come more ill, I do not know who it was.  The Minister is beggaring the country with foreign borrowing and enormous deficits to try to keep going and to try to curry as much favour with as many people as possible.  I would not grudge the Minister the £500,000 involved here if he would spend it, and a bit more besides, on our school children.  Is it not extraordinary that money can be found for things in which there are votes?  He can have this £500,000 and a lot more if he will spend it on giving back to our school children what they got in 1967 and what has been taken away from them in 1975, that is, free education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was answered very well by Deputy Colley.  I will not deal with that aspect of it any further. To come back to the provision in the amendment, I should like to point out that in the Minister's view this does not matter.  This is simply an increase of 33? per cent in the taxation on the transfer of land and houses valued between £20,000 and £50,000.  What <Col N="1235" /> about it?  It is only an increase of 33? per cent.  It helps to keep costs up and, if costs are kept up, the returns from VAT are up and that helps the Government. That is a good thing.  It puts up the price of each house by perhaps £10.  That might be the effect where someone has bought building land for £30,000 or £40,000.  This increase of 33? per cent might increase the cost of each house by £10, but what harm. There is more VAT to be got out of it.  That is the Minister's attitude.  It does not matter if it costs an extra £10.  The price will probably increase by another £1,000 in the next few months so it does not matter.  Farmers' costs buying small or moderately small farms in this category are put up.  They need to borrow more money.  They have more to repay. They have more interest to pay but that does not matter.  They can look for more for their produce and keep things going up.  Basically, it is beneficial to the Government that prices are going up.  The fact that this is crucifying the country is immaterial to the Minister as he has demonstrated very ably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He told us it was necessary to impose taxation in order to finance expenditure.  I wonder has the Minister such a short memory that he cannot recall what he said here with his tongue in his cheek at the end of November, 1974, when he increased the price of petrol by 15p per gallon. He told us it was not to obtain any revenue but simply to prevent people living in Northern Ireland coming across the Border to buy it.  I wonder if the considerations of which he is now so conscious about balancing <Col N="1236" /> budgets and getting in taxation in order to pay for Government expenditure were present to his mind on that occasion, or was he totally misleading the House.</P>
    <P>While only £500,000 is involved in this, a matter of principle is involved. We in this party believe it is wrong to increase the taxation on the transfer of small and moderately sized farms by 33? per cent and let it slide through this House as if it did not matter twopence.  This stamp duty is considerable and significant and creates hardship for many people.  I know this from my own personal experience in dealing with people.  It creates hardship for people.  They forget about it. They do not know that the Government get a rake off.  They have all their bits and pieces added up and they are down to their last penny and you have to tell them that they have to pay 2, 3 or 4 per cent, or whatever the figure is, in stamp duty as well. This duty is additional to other duties which may be payable as a result of the sale of a farm, in one or other of the various capital taxation measures at present before the House.</P>
    <P>As a matter of principle someone has got to make a stand sometime, somewhere.  This is one place&mdash;I know of better places&mdash;where one can make a stand and say it is wrong from the point of view of our economy that the tax on the transfer of comparatively small property such as is involved here should be increased at this time of tremendous inflation by 33? per cent.  That is, unfortunately, what the Government have already done.</P>
    <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the figures proposed to be deleted stand.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill, 1975, is close to passing through this House and on to the other House.  Before we let it pass it would, I think, be no harm if we recorded our views on <Col N="1239" /> some of the matters contained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The first matter that needs to be underscored is that the Bill&mdash;this appeared from the debate to be deliberate policy on the part of the Minister&mdash;provides for increases in personal allowances under the income tax code deliberately restricted to 15 per cent although the cost of living increase is 25 per cent.  The Minister indicated that he thought efforts were being made in the national pay agreement, and otherwise, to compensate workers for increased taxes and he apparently thought this should not be done and he deliberately therefore kept down the increase in tax allowances to 15 per cent.  The figures he talked about in regard to the items of taxation he thought should not have been recovered did not come to anything like 10 per cent; nevertheless, that was the justification given by the Minister for failing to increase income tax allowances commensurate with the increase in the cost of living, an enormous and unprecedented increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No effort was made to provide any compensation for the increased imposition on both employees and employers in respect of increased social welfare contributions and health charges.  At the same time the Bill contains a statutory provision for the unprecedented increases in taxes imposed by the Minister on beer, tobacco, wine, table waters and bets. In addition, increased revenue is being taken from gaming machine licence duty and dogs.  Indeed it is difficult to avoid the impression that the Minister was searching around everywhere he could possibly go, scraping the bottom of the barrel, for revenue from any source from which he could get it without any regard whatever to the consequences of what he was doing on the cost of living and the consequential claims arising on foot of the national pay agreement.  As I pointed out a little earlier, the cost to our economy of these increases in the cost of living, produced directly by Government action, is far greater than the amount of revenue to be received by the Exchequer.  I also <Col N="1240" /> drew the attention of the House to the fact that the most recent figures available for quarterly increases in the cost of living, at mid-February, disclosed an all time high of 8 per cent increase in one quarter, of which 40 per cent was the direct consequence of Government action.</P>
    <P>I have tried on a number of occasions to impress on the Minister the folly of imposing increases and allowing increases in Government controlled circles which, when the whole sum is done, cost the Exchequer, in many cases and certainly cost the community, a great deal more than is received from the Exchequer on foot of those increases.  This general attitude of the Government on the imposition of taxation, the cost of living and the effect it has on our economy is the primary cause of why we are now suffering a rate of inflation of at least 25 per cent per annum and also why we are at the head of the league for inflation.</P>
    <P>There was a time not so long ago when the Minister and some of his colleagues were fond of drawing attention to the cost of living figures and inflation rates in other countries. We do not hear them talking about that now because we are away ahead of practically all the other countries in Europe.  Some of them are at a rate almost one-third of our rate of inflation.  This is not happening by accident but because the Government long ago gave up the battle against inflation.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains more of the same from the Government.  It contains more of the enormous increases in taxation imposed without regard to the economic consequences.  The Minister, in dealing with these matters, attempts to talk about the amount of revenue to be received and the amount of expenditure he has to face as though he has no control over the expenditure and as though these were the only relevant calculations and that the effect of what he is doing on the cost of living and on wage claims is irrelevant.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is highly relevant and goes to the root of his responsibility. As Minister for Finance he has prime <Col N="1241" /> responsibility for the management of our economy.  Apart from that this Bill contains, as we indicated earlier, section 45, which is referred to in the index as &ldquo;Abolition of death duties.&rdquo; If there was any doubt we demonstrated clearly today, and so did the Minister, that whatever the section is doing it is not abolishing death duties. The Minister was given the opportunity, with an amendment of ours, to repeal death duty legislation but he refused point blank to do so.  I will not labour that point as I think the facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>This Bill also contains provisions which were designed by the Minister to assist certain types of businesses which are in difficulties by making special provision in regard to relief on income tax and corporation profits tax arising out of the consequence of inflation on stock values.  He said the estimated cost of this was £12 million. The relief which he is giving in this Bill is certainly a step in the right direction but it does not apply to many firms which are at least as much in need of it as those who will benefit, people who are likely, as the result of failing to get any relief, to have to create further redundancies and further unemployment.</P>
    <P>I believe it is also true to say that when this relief was announced on budget day and the cost of it given at £12 million the Minister was, in announcing it, acknowledging what we had been telling him for some time, that there were a number of businesses on the verge of bankruptcy and in dire need of assistance.  He was acknowledging the truth of that even if the steps he has taken to deal with it are inadequate and too little.  The Minister, having acknowledged the necessity for this assistance, was then a party, with his colleagues in Government, to imposing on businesses the cost of additional social welfare contributions and health charges far in excess of the relief he was purporting to give.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the logic behind that approach by the Government. I have not heard the Minister attempt to explain if there is any logic behind it.  The reasoning behind it <Col N="1242" /> escapes me.  If that relief was necessary how can one justify imposing greater burdens subsequently than the amount of the relief?  I suggest this performance illustrates the total, if I may use a colloquial phrase, &ldquo;ad hocery&rdquo; of the Government.  They run up against a problem and they may try to find a solution, which sometimes they do not.  If they do they produce some solution and then they come up against another problem. They try to find some solution to that without any reference to what went before.  It all adds up to the fact that the whole approach illustrated in this Bill is one of absence of even the remotest semblance of planning or programming.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the difficulties involved, particularly at a time like this, in producing and adhering to any programme or any plan.  That does not mean one can run the affairs of this country effectively simply by rushing from one problem to another without any regard to an overall approach.  Surely by now it is clear to the Minister and to his colleagues that it is essential to lay down a general assessment of our resources and our likely resources over the next few years, of the demands which will be made on those resources, and to out-line the order of priority which the Government see and the general manner in which they see, over the course of a few years to come, the economic management of our affairs being conducted. I freely acknowledge that any such approach has to be flexible.  The absence of any such approach has produced the kind of situation in which the Minister provides in this Bill for relief which is absolutely necessary to prevent businesses closing down, throwing their workers on the unemployment heap and subsequently imposing even greater charges on them.  That, and the lack of logic involved, are the clearest illustrations one could get of the great need there is for some general, overall approach to the economy.  Such an overall approach has been singularly absent and there is all the appearance of running from one problem to the next and dealing with each on a purely <Col N="1243" /><i>ad hoc</i> basis without reference either to decisions taken on previous problems or ones that will have to be made on further problems looming up.</P>
    <P>There is little that we on this side of the House can do except as we have done&mdash;and indeed will continue to do&mdash;to spell out the kind of approach the Government should adopt, and should have adopted, if we are to make any attempt to get over the enormous economic difficulties in which we now find ourselves. Apart from the question of drawing up some very flexible plan or programme, is it not clear that the first priority of the Government should be to start fighting inflation, something they are not doing?  It is suggested in some quarters that there is some dichotomy between, on the one hand, fighting inflation and, on the other, fighting unemployment. Of course, there is not any such dichotomy because, if we allow inflation to continue at its present rate, there is nothing we can do that will prevent the growth of unemployment. Unless we can conquer inflation unemployment will continue to rise.  That is the reality of the situation. If we are to conquer, we must conquer the two, both go together.  If we cannot tackle inflation, we can forget about trying to tackle unemployment.</P>
    <P>I have urged the Minister on a number of items in this Bill and in some of the amendments we put forward to take a stand somewhere in the battle against inflation.  He has refused to do so.  Instead, we find he is piling on more and more taxation, allowing more and more charges under the control of the Government to increase, at frightening rates and with frightening rapidity, without apparently the slightest regard to the economic consequences of this when it works its way through the economy into wage claims and is added to the impositions he has already imposed both in regard to the costs of manufacturing industry and business generally and of the individual citizen.</P>
    <P>The spiral continues.  It is being fed by the Government in a most irresponsible fashion, reaching its climax&mdash;I <Col N="1244" /> suppose it could get worse under this Government&mdash;where 40 per cent of the absolute record increase in inflation for one quarter, of 8 per cent is a direct consequence of Government action.  I do not know what we can do on this side of the House beyond spelling out, as we have done and will continue to do, where the duty of the Government lies and where they are failing in that duty.  We have tried to do that on this Bill and other matters, obviously with very little success.  But we will continue to do our duty as far as we can.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in due course the public&mdash;who were misled by the Minister and his colleagues in many ways and, in particular, as illustrated in section 46 of this Bill&mdash;will get their opportunity.  When they do I believe that this Minister will not get a further opportunity to preside over the enormous economic damage he is doing or permitting to be done to our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I shall not delay the House very long.  We have discussed this Bill for a considerable time.  We all know that the Finance Bill is undoubtedly one of the most important Bills coming before the House in any year.  This year's Finance Bill was reckoned to be one of the most important ever to come before the House.  I say that throwing my mind back over the past 12 months before the last budget.  If we had been reading the papers, taking heed of what leading economists throughout the country were saying we would have seen that they were warning the Government about what would happen, telling them what type of budget they should introduce and what this Finance Bill should be like. This is not a time for playing politics with our economy and I have no intention of so doing because it is too serious a matter.  One has only to look at industry and business people today to see the precarious positions in which they find themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were all looking for certain guidelines in the budget and in the Finance Bill.  It was spelled out time and time again by leading economists what would happen if some help was <Col N="1245" /> not given by the Government.  Certainly, I looked forward to some definite help being given to industry and business generally in an effort to check inflation.  At present it is quite obvious that if we do not take some stand in checking inflation this country will go bankrupt.</P>
    <P>Instead of such help being granted to them, what did industry get?  What help did they receive from the budget we are finalising in this Finance Bill? They got a deferred payment of £12 million.  It was obvious that that was of no help to them at all at that time. Anyone who has been following the trend of industry here and who throws his mind back over the past four or five years will see that we were losing in foreign markets.  I know exports were good last year.  But, if one observed a unit cost four or five years ago, we were then in a competitive position <i>vis-á-vis</i> our European partners. In my opinion we have lost out on this and it is something for which we will pay dearly in years to come. I would recommend that we do not look back on last year's exports too much because it will probably be very difficult to maintain them at that level this coming year.</P>
    <P>This situation has been developing and, if it is allowed continue, there is no doubt that we will lose on foreign markets.  In his last budget the Minister gave a deferred £12 million to industry which, even at that time, was of no significance.  Certainly, it would not have helped industry or business generally in the position in which they then found themselves.  The fact that £12 million was deferred was some help but six weeks later he imposed on business people a contribution for social welfare that was equivalent to £12 million.  That cannot be regarded as anything other than double-thinking.</P>
    <P>What the Minister has done is having its effect on industry.  Business people will be under considerable strain to keep their firms going.  There are increases under the National Wage Agreement that will have to be paid but it will not be possible to implement the agreement unless the Government take some positive action to check inflation. <Col N="1246" /> The workers were entitled to seek a 25 per cent increase in the National Wage Agreement when we consider how the cost of living has soared, but we should not underestimate the impact it will have on industry.</P>
    <P>In the newspapers this evening there is the statement that the ESB have sought to increase their charges by 18 per cent.  Rates are increasing, as is the cost of living generally.  In the present economic climate I do not see any hope of reducing the unemployment figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but I am anxious that remarks be confined to what is in the amended Bill before the House. That is the subject matter of the discussion, and I should like to dissuade the Deputy and others from embarking on a general debate on the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I do not intend to extend the debate in that manner, but we are talking about the Finance Bill which is a continuation of the budget and which affects every person.  The Government will have to do something positive if inflation is to be checked.  I do not believe the trade unions will cut their standard of living and they are right not to do so.  If industry and business cut back on profits they will go out of business.  It is the duty of the Government to give a lead and if they do not do so the economic situation will deteriorate even more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a businessman were asked to relate his profits to those of three or four years ago he would soon give an answer.  I am convinced the Government took the decision to introduce capital taxation at the wrong time. Although I realise death duties are not abolished to any great extent, I welcome what has been done in effecting any reduction.  However, to introduce capital taxation at a time when the economy is at its weakest ebb&mdash;indeed, it is at its weakest point in 40 years&mdash; is most undesirable.  The Government should try to encourage people to invest and to expand.  Perhaps it might be possible in ten years' time to introduce <Col N="1247" /> a wealth tax when we get the return from our oil resources and from our mines but it is fatal to penalise industry at the wrong time and this is where the Government have made a mistake.  If I were the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce I would scrap the capital taxation measures and would concentrate on economic policies.  We could come back to capital taxation in five or six years' time when the economy is on a proper footing.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister for Finance, only £13 million will be collected. That sum has little significance in a current budget of £1,200 million. Our aim should be to build up confidence in the country and abroad so that industrialists will invest here. The approach in this Finance Bill is a negative one and will not help.  The £12 million will not be of any assistance to the economy.  I agree that trade unions and business can help but it is up to the Government to give the lead.  Without that lead there will not be any response.  The worker and the business man realise their responsibilities and are fully alive to the situation but the Government are pushing ahead with their inflationary policies with regard to increased taxation. At least the revenue obtained from beer and spirits went towards social welfare benefits but the social welfare contribution placed a severe burden on industry.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with this Finance Bill, and this disappointment is shared by people in industry.  The Government have not laid down any guidelines. We are just drifting along without any target in view.  It is not in the power of the ordinary person to check inflation, but the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce could do much to help. Confidence is lacking and I have never seen the economy is such a weakened state.</P>
    <P>Germany and France are trying to get inflation under control.  Many of the other European countries are doing it.  What sort of situation will we face if next year we have inflation <Col N="1248" /> running at 25 per cent and European countries are down to 7, 8 or 9 per cent?  Then we will want to see what our exports are like but it will be too late.  The time is now.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance should get down to working out a good economic policy and put the rest of their capital taxation into cold storage until such time as the country attains prosperity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill, 1975 will be remembered as the most significant tax reform Bill in the life of this Parliament to date.  It abolishes death duties with effect from 1st April, 1975 which means that all persons dying after that date will not be affected by the Legacy Duty Acts which were introduced in 1796, the Succession Acts introduced in 1853 and the Estate Duty Acts introduced in 1894. That, perhaps, is why the Opposition have spent so many hours opposing the Finance Bill, 1975 because it makes a most dramatic improvement in the whole tax code.</P>
      <P>The debate on this year's Finance Bill has been the longest in my memory. More hours have been spent on it.  We have heard more irrelevant speeches.  We have had many budget speeches virtually on every Stage and section and we have had <i>ad nauseum</i> mischievous, malicious comment about matters which are not in this Bill but related to the Government package of capital taxes.  We will now get an opportunity of getting down to the nitty gritty of those Bills which the Opposition do not want to have discussed.  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked for a delay of five or six years.  What he really wants is to allow Fianna Fáil five or six more years in which to cause mischief and suspicion and fear in the hearts of people who, if they were to live to be 100, would not be affected by the capital taxation proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not afford them that opportunity because we intend to see to it that the capital taxation <Col N="1249" /> proposals are implemented this year so that people will see that all the mischievous, outrageous, outlandish suggestion made about them are without any foundation whatever.</P>
      <P>This Finance Bill copperfastens the Government's economic policy in what is admittedly the most difficult economic situation in which this country has found itself since it achieved its freedom in 1921.  The world is going through a greater economic upheaval than anything it has previously experienced.  The world is now more inter-dependent than ever before and in that situation, in which we have become more dependent on the outside world for our prosperity, it is not extraordinary that we should be experiencing economic difficulties at present.  In the face of those difficulties we produced a budget which was carefully expansionary.  It was indeed the most expansionary budget ever produced in this Dáil, with a deficit of £125 million.  We have given, in two successive budgets, personal income tax reliefs costing the Exchequer £60 million.  We have given to companies this year tax reliefs costing £12 million in one year and £24 million in two years.  We are also abolishing death duties.  The Opposition, who increased the rate of company taxation from 50 to 58 per cent in the recent past, who failed for 11 years to make any adjustment in income tax allowances and then gave totally inadequate adjustments in the autumn of their years in office, chastise us for not doing more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course no Minister for Finance is ever satisfied that a Finance Bill is all that he would desire.  It is not this year.  It could not be in any year but in a year of considerable international difficulty which is reflected in our domestic situation it certainly could not achieve that situation.  It is well to remember that out of every £10 of current Government expenditure which is meeting necessary needs £1 is borrowed from abroad.  Out of every £10 which is being expended for capital and current purposes £2.50 is being borrowed from abroad.  This has been criticised by the Opposition who, at the same time, criticise the level of <Col N="1250" /> taxation as being too high.  The only alternative to these borrowings is to have further taxation at home at a time when the economy is suffering because of lack of demand, a lack of demand which is the pattern in the whole western world particularly in those countries which are oil-importing. To have increased the tax load and not resorted to the degree of borrowing we have resorted to would have been the wrong economic package. What we have produced is one which is carefully expansionary in a most difficult situation and if the forecasters are right and the end of 1975 sees an improvement in the economic performance of the industrial countries with which we are associated in OECD then it will be seen that our budgetary policy is the right one and that the incentives and the reliefs and the taxation in this budget were the right ones in that difficult situation.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill contains two of the four new taxes which are being introduced allegedly in lieu of death duties but, as was pointed out at some length by Deputy de Valera, the two taxes contained in this Bill, gift tax and inheritance tax, are in effect a replacement for death duties simply under another name.  If proof of that fact is required one has only to look at the concluding sections of this Bill which make provision for the filing of an inland revenue affidavit with the Revenue Commissioners after death and the provisions are basically much the same as the provisions under the existing death duty code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met a solicitor recently who had not read this Bill but who had, like many other people, believed what he read in the newspapers of the various statements made by the Minister for Finance to Fine Gael branches in Rathmines <Col N="1251" /> to the effect that death duties had been abolished as and from 1st April. He believed it and he said to me: &ldquo;Is it not great now that we will not have to be bothered with schedules of assets and all the rest of it?  Death duties are gone.  All we need do is go to the Probate Registry with our necessary documents for that and take out a grant of administration or a grant of probate.&rdquo; I asked him if he had seen the Bill and he said he had not.  I said: &ldquo;All those provisions are there&rdquo; at which he was very much taken aback and he said: &ldquo;Then it seems to me that death duties have not, in fact, been done away with&rdquo; to which I replied that in my view they had not.</P>
    <P>Essentially the situation we would have on the passage of this Bill would be that death duties would be retained with much higher exemptions than exist now, particularly in so far as spouses and children are concerned, with, in some cases, lower exemptions than existing ones in respect of other people but with a considerably raised threshold, particularly for wives and children.</P>
    <P>There are a number of anomalies in relation to this.  One is that in table A which is the table giving a threshold of £150,000 it is not, as is the case in the present code, a wife and children who get relief.  Rather significantly, it is a spouse who gets relief.  I am not to be taken necessarily as complaining about this but it could be very beneficial to a husband who, if he were to survive a wealthy wife, would get no relief under the present provision&mdash;the £4,000 figure. Those who do not get the value of this threshold are grandchildren unless they are the minor children of a deceased child.  I do not know why this distinction has been made.  It appears to be very arbitrary.  The existing provision in favour of a surviving wife, rather than a husband, seemed logical and fair enough, but that is changed in a very big way because a surviving husband gets relief now of up to £150,000.  Another significant difference is that whereas before, the reliefs operated on the entire estate up to a certain figure, <Col N="1252" /> they now operate in respect of each gift.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out in reference to the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill there is the extraordinary situation which I consider undesirable, that is, that a widow and four children, irrespective of the age of children&mdash; they could be 50 years old and each very wealthy in his own right&mdash;are entitled to an inheritance of £150,000 each without capital taxation of any kind being payable.  This is put before the public as progressive legislation, as something that will make matters easier for those who are less well off while making them more difficult for the rich.  I wonder how, by any stretch of the imagination, that kind of situation could be regarded as being in accordance with the particular provision of this Bill.  How can it be said that the rich will be worse off if the net effect for them is that a man can leave £750,000 between his widow and four adult and, perhaps, rich children and that none of them will have to pay a penny in taxation on that money, while on the other hand tax is payable in respect of a small farm worth, say, £12,000, which is left to a nephew by an uncle who was not married.  I cannot see any equity in that situation.  If anything it is far more inequitable than the present death duty code, where that sort of situation would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>So far as the inheritance tax is concerned I wonder whether this Bill is designed to help the very rich who are fortunate enough to have children of their own.  In effect, these are the people who are helped.  Is it the view of the present Government that a man worth £750,000 should be allowed to pass all of that vast fortune to members of his family without attracting any taxation?  One can only assume that is their view since this is the provision of the Bill.  It is a very wrong approach.  It is a totally lopsided, false and unjust approach to taxation.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised that while there was tremendous opposition from some people in Fine Gael to practically all of the four Bills of this so-called package, there was a strange welcome in the middle of that opposition from <Col N="1253" /> some of those members for the provision we are discussing here because for some very wealthy people this is a godsend, provided they have sufficient among whom to distribute their wealth.</P>
    <P>While there is tremendous generosity to a surviving husband, wife or child, this generosity breaks down very quickly, because people who are not part of the immediate family will find that in many cases they may be paying tax where they would not have paid it before, that they will be paying duty under the term &ldquo;inheritance tax&rdquo; where they would not have paid it before. During the past few years there has been a very valid case to be made for a considerable raising of the threshold of liability for duty.  If there were such a raising of thresholds in regard to the old death duty system, there would be much the same result as there is in this Bill under the name of inheritance tax which, in some way, the Minister tries to convince us is replacing death duties.  What is being done here by way of relief for surviving spouses and children could have been done as easily by amending the existing death duty code, but the Minister chose not to do that because he had made a promise which he realised he could not fulfil.  However, he tried to con the people into believing that he could fulfil that promise by making very radical changes in the old death duty code but instead of retaining the terms, estate, legacy and succession duties, he put them together and called them inheritance tax.  The difference in terminology should not fool anybody.  I would have no objection as to what he called the tax but it did not stop at simply making changes which appear before us now as inheritance tax.  It also entailed the introduction of three other taxes on top of it.  At least one of them, before it has been passed at all, has proved very harmful. One of the others, while it is all right in theory, is drawn in such a way that it is grossly unfair.  It taxes the man of honest endeavour who has spent his lifetime building up a farm or a business in the very same way as it taxes the short term speculator who <Col N="1254" /> may have made an enormous gain in a period of only a few months.</P>
    <P>If you balance the two packages, the old death duties system and these four new taxes, from the point of view of the national economy I do not think there is any doubt as to which is the more satisfactory.  We have only to look around us today to see the harm these new taxes have done to the economy before they have been passed.  If there were individual cases of hardship, as probably there were because of inflation in recent years, under the old death duties system could it not have been amended radically as we said we would do before the last election?  In effect, that is what the Minister is doing but, because he is changing the name, he is using that excuse to bring in three other taxes which it was not necessary to bring in.</P>
    <P>This is a very long Bill.  It is longer and more detailed even than the Finance Bill which we have just finished.  This Bill runs to 51 pages.  If anyone thought the Finance Bill was complicated, technical and difficult he should read this one.  This one is about four times more complicated and difficult.  Most of the points I want to make are more suited to the Committee Stage and I will not go into many of them now in any detail.  To give an indication of some of the problems we will run into on Committee Stage which, incidentally, will be for more lengthy than the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the provisions of section 26 which is headed &ldquo;Enlargement of Interests&rdquo;.  This section is all one sentence.  I will not quote any of it because it runs to 12 or 14 lines and you either read it all or you do not read any of it.  I will summarise its effect reasonably by saying that the intention of the section is that if somebody has a limited interest in property, which normally would be a life interest, and if that person comes into possession of the remainder interest which is contingent on the cessor of his own life interest, a method is used for the valuation of the remainder which falls into possession by the person <Col N="1255" /> acquiring it either by way of gift or by way of inheritance.</P>
    <P>The easiest way with a complicated Bill like this is to give an example. The example I will give is as follows. If a deceased person leaves a house worth £30,000 to his wife for her life, with remainder to a nephew absolutely, and the nephew is well to do and decides he does not really want the house after her death and in the circumstances he releases his remainder interest in the fee simple to her, if she is aged 55 years which, I suppose, is a reasonable age to pick, you go to Table A of Part II of the First Schedule to value her life interest.</P>
    <P>You find that the value of an interest in a capital of £1 for a female life aged 55 is .7206 of a £.  In this transaction, the effect of that is that the life interest in the house worth £30,000 is £21,618.  The taxable value in the words of the section of the estate in remainder is the difference between that and the present capital value.  Accordingly it is £8,382.  In order to find the gift tax payable on the release by the nephew of his interest in remainder, you are required by the section to deduct from the value of the remainder interest, namely, £8,382, the value of the life interest or limited interest, namely, £21,618.  Therefore, the section requires you to subtract £21,618 from £8,382 and pay tax on that.  That is not on.  That cannot be done.  I can only assume that, in the drafting of this section, examples were not before the draftsman or he could not have drafted it in a way which requires the taxpayer to do something which is impossible. I can only assume that the net result of all that is that because the sum will not work out mathematically the person in question is told she does not owe any tax.</P>
    <P>If that type of section were passed I could see it going to the High Court or the Supreme Court to try to work out what exactly is its meaning, what is its effect, and so on.  I picked that example out almost at random.  There are many other examples of serious anomalies and difficulties which are likely to arise under this Bill.  One <Col N="1256" /> which strikes me on reading the Bill is that it is not at all clear to me and I cannot find any provision in the Bill which would make it clear, that, for example, a grant payable by the IDA to an industrialist is not a gift within the meaning of a &ldquo;gift&rdquo; as defined here.  There is no consideration for that.  There may be some part somewhere which will cover that kind of situation.  Those are the type of things that spring to mind on a reading of various parts of this Bill. The number of anomalies in it is very large, and not least in the various Tables set out in Part I and Part II of the Second Schedule.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking on the Finance Bill I mentioned that there seemed to be an anomaly that if a testator left property not to his child but to the spouse of his child, that spouse would be classified as a stranger in blood under Table IV and become liable for tax from £5,000 upwards, whereas if the bequest or devise was to the child himself or herself, there would be a threshold of £150,000.  Looking further at the Schedule where the rules for the computation of tax are set out, it is not easy to understand all of them, but I find that the case I mentioned on a previous occasion is partially covered by Rule 8 of the Rules for Computation of Tax in Part I of the Second Schedule.  Provided the child of the testator was dead at the time of the testator's death, a bequest or devise to the surviving spouse of the child of the testator would be classified as a gift direct to the testator's child and, accordingly, would come under Table I with a threshold of £150,000. Before any testator could safely make a disposition in favour of his son-in-law or daughter-in-law his own child would have to be dead.  That is otherwise under present law.  I know of several cases where prudent testators, for very good reason, left property not to their child but to the spouse of the child because there was good reason for not leaving it to the child himself or herself.</P>
    <P>Those people are now being put in an impossible position.  It is not as bad as I thought it was at first sight, but <Col N="1257" /> nonetheless it is an unfair situation that a testator is being deprived of his right to leave property to the spouse of his or her child rather than to the child himself or herself.  It is not necessary to go into detail as to why that would frequently be a more suitable and prudent disposition than a simple devise or bequest to a child. However, if the child is ill, in particular if a child is suffering from a disease such as alcoholism or mental illness, a prudent testator will not leave property to such a person if that person's wife or husband is not suffering from any disease or illness and is in a position to look after the property which the child might not be.  That is one example of the kind of anomaly that appears to arise.  On the face of it one cannot see any good reason why these kind of anomalies should arise.  We will be going into this matter in considerable detail on Committee Stage and the Minister will have to justify these rather arbitrary changes in what has been the settled order of things for some time.  The present position in relation to a lot of these matters was not arrived at arbitrarily; it was arrived at as a result of years of experience and finding that this was the best and fairest way of doing things.  Suddenly, a lot of these desirable developments were swept away and changed overnight.</P>
    <P>Simply because death duties are being retained under another name is no reason why a lot of rules which had been built up over the years for the benefit of situations of the kind I have referred to should be swept away also.  There are various other reliefs that exist at present with regard to death duties which do not appear to be granted here.  The Minister may well make a case that because the thresholds are considerably higher than they are under the existing system the need for these rules in relief of the taxpayer no longer exists.  I am afraid there will be many hard cases under this legislation if it is passed in the form in which it stands at present.</P>
    <P>One of the general causes of complaint in relation to this Bill in so far as the gift and inheritance taxes are concerned is that while acknowledgment <Col N="1258" /> is made in it of the need for special relief for agricultural land there seems to be no provision for any form of relief in relation to a business or industry of any kind.  The failure to allow some kind of reasonable relief for industrial property or business property is going to cause great hardship.  Agricultural land is picked out, even though the definition of it is very confined, for special relief and I am glad to see that.  However, there are other people in similar categories, apart from industrialists and business people, who might feel, legitimately, that they are entitled to the same kind of relief or exemption.</P>
    <P>Is it not very difficult to justify exempting agricultural land and not exempting fishing boats?  Is it not very difficult to give exemption to agricultural land and not give any kind of relief to hotels?  Why is there the anomaly that special provision is made in the Wealth Tax Bill in respect of hotels but that there is no provision under either of the taxes in this Bill? These are some of the innumerable anomalies which appear to exist and which will have to be teased out and thrashed out at great length and in great detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have no objection, and I do not think my party have any objection, to the inheritance tax as such provided it is made clear that it is death duties re-enacted under another name with higher exemption limits or higher thresholds, as long as the people understand that that could have been done easily under the existing code, retaining the existing code, and raising the exemption limits.  The Minister for Finance is not fulfilling his obligations or his promises by allegedly putting into abeyance, not abolishing, the death duties about which there was so much fuss two years ago and re-enacting the same form of code under another name with higher exemption limits and with three other forms of capital taxation which this country did not know before and saying that the whole package of capital taxation is a substitute for the old death duties.  It is not a substitute. The old death duties are not gone. The fact that the name has been changed and that the limits are <Col N="1259" /> raised does not make them any different. If the price that we have to pay for the same thing with a new name is a whole series of other taxes which even before their enactment have done great damage to our economy then that price is too high.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a most interesting debate, the most humorous part of which was when Deputy Haughey said that before he could express a complete view on the Government's capital taxation proposals he would need to consult the theologians, philosophers and the moralists on the concept of taxing gifts in excess of £150,000 to each of the donor's children.  It is a pity Deputy Haughey did not see fit to consult the theologians, philosophers and moralists when he was taxing gifts to children where the property was in excess of £5,000 left by a deceased person.  I cannot see that there is anything wrong in taxing gifts of such dimension from people of considerable substance to their immediate family at the comparatively low rates proposed, which are much lower than rates of 55 per cent which existed under the death duty system now mercifully abolished.</P>
      <P>The undertaking of the parties now comprising this Government was to replace death duties with a system of capital taxation which would relieve the burden of the immediate family.  That is precisely what we have done.  We did not propose to introduce exemption from taxation on capital gifts to people outside the immediate family but we have proposed, even for them thresholds much higher than now exist under the estate duty code or the legacy and succession duty code and the rates to which we are subjecting these gifts are lower than the existing rates.  What we have done in the capital acquisition tax and in the other forms of capital taxation, which will apply only to the really wealthy, is to provide a package of taxes which does not provide people of substance with all the avoidance loopholes they used to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one were to analyse the reasons <Col N="1260" /> for the persistent attacks upon the new system of capital taxation one would find that the cause is not attributable to the rates because the rates by any standard are extremely generous&mdash;infact, if they have an error, that error is on the side of generosity towards the taxpayer&mdash;one would find the causes for the attacks are attributable to the fact that avoidance opportunities are gone.  Some Members opposite said the new capital taxation proposals would spread the net more widely and that the mesh was smaller.  That is a fair description but when a person will be caught in the net in future that person will be a person of comparative wealth and the liability to tax will be payable at a time when a gain is made on the disposal of the property or a gift is received and it will be paid by the person who receives the gift or it will be paid on wealth where wealth exceeds, in the case of a married couple, £100,000 plus a house and its contents and an acre of ground, and then only at the rate of 1 per cent where it exceeds the exemptions.  In the case of agricultural land there is a further exemption up to £200,000.  It will be taken at half its market value.  If the wealth is a productive asset there will be a 20 per cent reduction in liability to tax.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Opposition to show me any country where capital taxation of the type we propose exists and also show that the rates here are harsher than they are anywhere else. The rates and thresholds of exemption here are more generous by any comparison and that is the reason why, notwithstanding all the cries of ruination we hear from the pessimists on the Opposition benches, the private capital flow into Ireland is running at an unprecedented rate; contrary to their reckless allegations that there was a flow of money out the capital flow is inwards.  In 1974, when capital taxation was first announced, the rates were higher and the exemptions less than the Bill now proposes; the inflow was £120 million which contrasts significantly with the previous year when the inflow was only £40 million.  Why?  Because people who <Col N="1261" /> have substantial funds are aware that capital taxation proposals in Ireland are by any test equitable and, indeed, benign.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the proposed rate of tax on gifts made during life, 25 per cent below that for any inheritance, is an inadequate incentive to people to transfer during life. I do not think it is an inadequate incentive.  Remember, the kind of persons we are dealing with here are not persons who will be making small gifts because small gifts will not accumulate into a gift accumulation of £150,000; they are people who will be making substantial gifts and a concession of a 25 per cent reduction is, I believe, a very significant incentive to people to transfer their property during life.  Most other countries about which I have been able to get information give no concession in respect of the rate to be charged on gifts during life and, having regard to the practice elsewhere, our proposal is an extremely generous one.</P>
    <P>Most of the points raised are Committee Stage points and I think the best thing I can do is to bear in mind what has been said when dealing with the sections on Committee Stage.  In the case of valid points I will propose appropriate amendments.  I commend the Bill to the House as one which provides a justifiable alteration in the law in present circumstances.  It provides taxation on money transferred by people of considerable wealth to others who will be fortunate to receive it and the liability to pay the tax will lie primarily on the recipients.  That is a fair tax and anyone fortunate enough to receive a gift of £150,000 has no genuine reason to complain if called upon to pay a small proportion of that gift for the public good.  The tax will encourage wealthy people to distribute their property amongst their next of kin in order to avoid liability to tax.  It will operate equitably.  It will discourage the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few and it will encourage a wider distribution of wealth, not in the way of confiscation by the State, or anything like that, but by a more equitable distribution of property over a larger number of people. <Col N="1262" /> That was one of the reasons for the introduction of estate duty originally Apart from the revenue it was a form of taxation which discouraged accumulation of wealth.  As we argued if the White Paper, and as I have argued on numerous occasions in recent months, any tax code must seek not only to raise revenue but to operate fairly and equitably from the point of view of the social good.  We believe this Bill will achieve social good.  It is economically justifiable.  It will relieve most people from any liability to pay tax and it will make it comparatively easier for those lucky enough to receive substantial gifts to bear their tax liability.</P>

      <P>Those recommendations of the former Food Hygiene Advisory Committee which relate to hygiene education, including the suggested role of a central body in such education, have been brought to the notice of the bureau which will, I feel sure, give them full consideration when their plans for future activities are being formulated.</P>

      <P>The entitlement of the person concerned to unemployment benefit depends among other things on certain contributions paid during the year 1973 and in respect of which there is doubt as to whether they were paid in respect of employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  Inquiries necessary to establish the admissibility or otherwise of the contributions have not yet been completed, but every effort is being made to have the matter brought to an early conclusion.  Pending a decision on his claim for unemployment benefit, his possible entitlement to unemployment assistance is being examined.</P>

An objection lodged on behalf of the owner came for hearing before the lay commissioners on 26th July, 1972, when the case was adjourned for three years.  Until such time as the objection is finally determined it is not possible to say whether the proceedings will be continued.</P>
