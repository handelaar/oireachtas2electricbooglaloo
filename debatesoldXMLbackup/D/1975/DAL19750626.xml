      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not finalised the amendment to amendment No. 75 yet.  Is that what the Minister is dealing with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We were discussing these for one-and-a-half hours last night and surely we are not changing the procedure now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want it to be clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported, I was explaining to the House why I think it is appropriate and, indeed, necessary to proceed with amendments Nos. 75, 76 and 77 to be taken with the amendment to amendment No. 75 on the understanding that amendments which would be similar in their principle would be introduced by me on Report Stage to deal with the staffs of planning authorities and the members and staff of the appeal board.  I do not propose to go over the ground again but I would ask Deputies opposite to adhere to the agreement reached early on Committee Stage and allow the House to proceed to consider the actual amendment I have proposed in relation to local councillors.</P>
      <P>These amendments may not be perfect in every detail.  For example, in my opening remarks on amendment No. 75 I mentioned that subsection (4) of the proposed new section 28, as drafted, may go too far and that consideration might be given to limiting its application to certain kinds of cases.  I am genuinely anxious, therefore, to have the views of Deputies on the amendment.  I can assure the House that I shall be fully prepared to accept any reasonable changes suggested and put down any necessary Report Stage amendments.  I may also point out that any changes in approach decided on for reconsideration by the House on amendments Nos. 75, 76 and 77 can be built into Report Stage amendments relating to board members and their staff when these are being drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody can deny that my approach to the Bill has been a reasonable one or that I have failed to listen to and accept wherever possible <Col N="1841" /> suggestions for changes made by Deputies.  I find it difficult to understand why Deputies opposite have been attempting to deny the House the opportunity of having a Committee Stage debate on the amendments I have put down.  Accordingly, I would ask them to reconsider their position in this matter and adhere to the agreement reached here as long ago as 14th January, 1975 that we go ahead with consideration of the present amendment on the basis of a definite undertaking by me to put down appropriate Report Stage amendments to deal with board members, staff of the board and local representatives.  So far the discussions have related only to these implications.  We cannot ignore the fact, as I said last night, that as a result of newspaper publicity&mdash;God knows I am not in favour of legislation by newspaper reports&mdash;Members of this House who are members of local authorities and members of local authorities were abused and held up to ridicule.  The only way I can see to prevent that sort of thing happening is by having a declaration of interest by everybody so that anybody who wishes may go to see it and cannot then make veiled insinuations which apparently cannot be followed up in a court case.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we get these amendments through.  I have given a guarantee that I will bring in the amendments that have been suggested by the Opposition on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Going back to the earlier discussion on this, I think the Minister is mixing up two things; first, we have a local government package deal on declaration of interest and the Minister was quite right last night.  We agree with him; we would prefer to see the whole matter of declaration of interest dealt with as a unit, not to tie up other Departments by what we may do here.  It would be better to have a streamlined declaration of interest process or system for all Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is our basic argument.  It is a logical one with which I feel sure the Minister will agree.  If he wants a declaration of interest packet of legislation <Col N="1842" /> I do not think he should split it up in so far as it refers to his own Department in the Planning Bill before us.  It should all be done together. The Minister promised to introduce a comprehensive Bill before the recess but he has not done so.  That is fair enough: we will not lacerate him for not doing so.  The Government have their problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>So have you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is doing this in this Bill in respect of local government, then he should at least not subdivide again.  He is differentiating in this Bill between elected representatives and other persons who have very important work to do in regard to planning decisions and appeals.  He is getting out of the planning decision process himself: that is the whole purpose of the Bill and of the parallel legislation drafted by Fianna Fáil.  Therefore, at Departmental level, at elected representative level in this House, we are taking the Minister for Local Government out of planning and his interest accordingly does not arise.  But the interests of the board which he will appoint do arise and the Minister gave a promise that the members of that board also would be covered by a provision to declare their interests.</P>
      <P>We are accusing the Minister of providing for only elected members to declare their interests and not providing that members of the new appeals board, a very important body who will replace the Minister, should declare their interests.  We propose that they too, as well as local authority officials, should be covered by this provision. We want to see covered all officials engaged in planning decisions.  That covers a fairly wide range.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We say the Minister is wrong when in one sphere of government, local government, he differentiates between elected representatives and others.  No matter what appears in the Bill covering his Department, the Minister should set the pattern he has in mind for the forthcoming comprehensive Bill.  The pattern I have in mind for any comprehensive Bill dealing with this matter is that elected representatives are not <Col N="1843" /> the only persons who should be asked to make declarations of interest.  If the Minister is to narrow it down to local government in this Bill, then he should include all persons involved in the process of planning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was replying last night I got the impression that he misunderstood the line I had taken.  The case I was making is that first of all I would have preferred to have seen all the matters raised on these subsections included in a comprehensive Bill, but in the event of the Minister not agreeing, I wanted to provide that all involved in the planning process, as well as elected representatives, would be included.  Perhaps the Minister would briefly outline the various other categories involved in these provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had made it perfectly clear.  Originally, it was proposed only to be applied to elected representatives, but following Opposition representations, particularly Deputy Molloy's, that has been changed.  At first, Deputy Molloy mentioned county managers.  I asked him if he were speaking only of county managers and he said &ldquo;other officials in planning&rdquo;.  I asked him if he would accept the principle that those not already proposed would be included and he answered that he would.  He asked about the people on the Planning Board and I resisted this for a while not because I thought they were a special type of people, like Caesar's wife, but that they were a people above suspicion&mdash;an ex-High Court judge would be chairman.  Eventually I came round to the idea that we would include those and my firm understanding on 14th January last was that at the Committee Stage we would cover elected representatives and that the amendments I would put in would be accepted.  I have given a guarantee that I will include at Report Stage the other categories, those involved in planning at local level as well as at appeal level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this in the general Bill?  The Minister has mentioned <Col N="1844" /> two things: he mentioned a Bill which would cover all Departments&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us put the other Bill to one side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it that at Report Stage the Minister will be doing what we have been advocating this morning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and before this morning&mdash;on 14th January.  That is on record in the Official Report of the House for 14th January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In case there would be any misunderstanding&mdash;we are not being suspicious of the board or anybody else&mdash;let me make it clear that all we wanted was to have included all those involved in planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On reflection, I think it is fairer to the people involved. There have been too many suggestions going around, ulterior motives and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be a situation where the Chairman of the appeals board could hold that position this year and be, say, an elected member of Donegal County Council next year.  It would have been unfair to have him declaring his interest as an elected representative but not doing so as chairman of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there are many High Court judges offering as candidates for Donegal County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was the strongest on this question of the appeals board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The appeals board was definitely the Deputy's idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that anybody who has any connection with planning will be included and will have to make a declaration.  I do not see why the chairman of the board or anybody else should be excluded while a public representative should have to make the declaration.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 76:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 46 and 47, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;29.&mdash;(1)  Where, at a meeting of a planning authority or of any committee of a planning authority, a resolution, motion, question or other matter is proposed or otherwise arises either pursuant to, or as regards the performance by the authority of a function under, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1974, or in relation to the acquisition or disposal of land under or for the purposes of those Acts or any other enactment by the authority, a member of the authority or committee present at the meeting shall, if he has a pecuniary or other beneficial interest in, or which is material to, the matter&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  at the meeting, and before discussion or consideration of the matter commences, disclose the nature of his interest,</P>
      <P>(b)  withdraw from the meeting for so long as the matter is being discussed or considered,</P>
      <P>and accordingly, he shall take no part in the discussion or consideration of the matter and shall refrain from voting in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  A member of a planning authority or of any committee of a planning authority who has a pecuniary or other beneficial interest in, or which is material to, a matter arising either pursuant to, or as regards the performance by the authority of a function under, the Local <Col N="1846" /> Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1974, or in relation to the acquisition or disposal of land under or for the purposes of those Acts or any other enactment by the authority shall neither influence nor seek to influence a decision of the authority as regards the matter.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purposes of this section but without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) or (2) hereof, a member of a planning authority or of a committee of a planning authority shall be regarded as having a beneficial interest if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  he or his spouse, or any nominee of his or of his spouse, is a member of a company or any other body which has a beneficial interest in, or which is material to, a resolution, motion, question, or other matter mentioned in subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section,</P>
    <P>(b)  he or his spouse is in partnership with or is in the employment of a person who has a beneficial interest in, or which is material to, such a resolution, motion, question, or other matter.</P>
    <P>(c)  he or his spouse is a party to any arrangement or agreement (whether or not enforceable) concerning land to which such a resolution, motion, question or other matter relates,</P>
    <P>(d)  his spouse has a beneficial interest in, or which is material to, such a resolution, motion, question or other matter. </P>
    <P>(4)  For the purposes of this section, a person shall not be regarded as having a beneficial interest in, or which is material to, any resolution, motion, question or other matter by reason only of an interest of his or of any company or of any other body or person mentioned in subsection (3) of this section which is so remote or insignificant that it cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to influence a member of a planning authority or a commitee of a planning authority in the consideration of discussion of, or in voting on, <Col N="1847" /> any question with respect to that matter.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where a member of a planning authority or a committee of a planning authority has a beneficial interest mentioned in subsection (1) or (2) of this section by reason only of the beneficial ownership of shares in a company or other body by him or by his spouse and the total nominal value of those shares does not exceed the lesser of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  five hundred pounds, or</P>
    <P>(b)  one-hundredth part of the total nominal value of either the issued share capital of the company or body or, where that capital is issued in shares of more than one class, of the issued share capital of the class or classes of shares in which he has an interest, </P>
    <P>neither of those subsections shall have effect in relation to that beneficial interest.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where at a meeting described in subsection (1) of this section a disclosure is made under that subsection, particulars of the disclosure and of any subsequent withdrawal from the meeting pursuant to the said subsection shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting.</P>
    <P>(7)  Subject to subsection (8) of this section, a person who contravenes or fails to comply with the requirements of subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
    <P>(8)  In any proceedings for an offence under this section it shall be a defence for the defendant to prove that at the time of the alleged offence he did not know and had no reason to believe that a resolution, motion, question or other matter in, or in relation to, which he had a beneficial interest was being considered at the relevant meeting, or that the beneficial interest to which the alleged offence relates was one in <Col N="1848" /> relation to which a requirement of subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section applied.</P>
    <P>(9)  In this section &lsquo;shares&rsquo; includes stock and &lsquo;share capital&rsquo; shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person has money in the bank he does not have to declare that but will an ordinary farmer who is not dealing in the business of buying and selling and property transactions, have to declare his interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Cunningham is misunderstanding the position.  The question of somebody having money in the bank will not be likely to have an influence on a decision at a meeting.  If a discussion comes up at a meeting which affects a farm or property owned by somebody, certainly he would have to declare his interest.  That is the whole point.  It is right that it should be so. The amendment proposes to insert a new section which is designed to prevent members of planning authorities or committees thereof from voting on or otherwise influencing a decision on a planning or land acquisition matter where they have a pecuniary or other beneficial interest in or which is material to the matter.  That is the most straightforward case of the whole lot.</P>

      <P>There is a difference here because the new section which the Minister has inserted lays down standards of behaviour in regard to voting on matters in which a member of a local authority has an interest. Deputy Molloy's amendment, No. 76a, is obviously concerned with extending the same sort of provision to the employee.  If a member of a local authority is prevented from voting on a matter in which he has an interest, surely there is a much better case for preventing an official from performing a function in relation to a matter in which he has an interest?</P>

      <P>Take the manager as one of the officials concerned. Suppose a proposal is made at a county council meeting in regard to <Col N="1851" /> a matter in which the manager may have an interest and in respect of which he must make an order or sign a planning permission document. What arrangement does the Minister propose to make so that somebody else will do that?  There could be an awkward situation which may necessitate an amendment of another Local Government Act.  The manager might have an interest in a planning decision and he may be the person who will make an order in respect of that decision.  It may be a decision of some other official; it may be a decision of the local authority.  It may be an order designating an area a high amenity area or redesignating a high amenity area for some other purpose. You could have an awkward situation that the only person who would make the order or sign the order or do the official mechanical act would be the manager who had a financial or other interest in the decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain amount of merit in Deputy Cunningham's argument.  The way I had been looking at it was that he would have to declare an interest anyway before this, so everybody would know.  He is in a different position from the elected representative because he is an employee of the council that is making the decision and therefore his job is on the line if he wishes to do something hookey but there is the possibility that he could nominate somebody else to do the job although that might not be satisfactory.</P>

      <P>We discussed this last night under another section but Deputy Cunningham is attempting to <Col N="1852" /> have it discussed under this section although it is not relevant to it.  In the event of section 4 being invoked a manager would not be entitled to take certain action without the permission of the council.  We are talking about a straightforward matter.  The Deputy has a point but I suggest that it be left aside for the moment and, perhaps, dealt with at Report Stage by way of amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;30.&mdash;(1)  Where a person is convicted of an offence under section 28* or 29* of this Act, the following provisions shall have effect:</P>
      <P>(a)  in case the person is a member of a planning authority or a member of any committee of a planning authority, he shall on such conviction cease to be a member of the authority or the committee, as may be appropriate,</P>

    <P>(b)  in case the person is a member of both a planning authority and any one or more such <Col N="1853" /> committees, he shall so cease to be a member of both the authority and every such committee, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the person shall be disqualified for being a member of the relevant planning authority or committee during the period which, but for the cessation of his membership under this section, would be the remainder of his term.</P>
    <P>(2)  In case a person contravenes or fails to comply with the requirements of section 28* or 29* of this Act, or acts as a member of a planning authority or committee of a planning authority while disqualified for membership by virtue of this section, the fact of such contravention or failure or of his so acting, as the case may be, shall not invalidate any resolution or proceeding of the authority or committee.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a company within the meaning of section 155 of the Companies Act, 1963, is deemed under that section to be a subsidiary of another or to be another such company's holding company, a person who is a member of the first-mentioned such company shall, for the purposes of sections 28* and 29* of this Act, be deemed also to be a member of the other company.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It would appear to me that what Deputy Haughey has said was true in relation to this subsection. It appears to give the Minister very wide powers.  In fact, it is open to him to do whatever he wishes.  The purpose of the Bill is to pass the power held by the Minister to the board and the responsibility presently held by the Minister in relation to planning appeals.  If the Minister continues to have this power it would nullify to a considerable extent the powers of the board.  I can appreciate that the Minister would need to control general policy.  For that reason he must have the right to make regulations. But to have the broad power to make regulations, what is termed here as incidental, consequential, transitional or supplementary provision as may appear to him to be necessary goes a bit far.  He could <Col N="1860" /> receive advice on which, if he acted, would result in a major change in the Bill itself.</P>

      <P>The point Deputy Faulkner seems to miss is that the ruling part is the last bit&mdash;&ldquo;to give full effect to any of its provisions.&rdquo; Therefore, the suggestion that it can widen the scope of the Bill by having things done not included in it is not justified.</P>
      <P>My impression is that the amendment was introduced by Deputy Molloy to deal with the question of fees in the event of their being continued. When the fees are abolished, there is no reason why this should be interfered with.  Actually the powers given in section 28, subsection (1) (c) are carefully restricted by the terminology of the draftsman. In a Bill of this kind it is necessary to provide for the possibility that difficulties would be created by some details which had been overlooked in the complexities arising from the transfer of functions to the Board. Regulations may make incidental, consequential, transitional or supplementary provision but only in so far as is necessary or proper for any purpose of the Act, or in consequence of&mdash;and here comes the crunch&mdash;&ldquo;to give full effect to, any of its provisions&rdquo;. It is not possible to give effect to something which is not already a provision of the Bill.  Therefore, the question of fees could not arise.</P>

If the Minister does not have that responsibility there is no point in having it at all.  There must be somebody and that must be the Minister.  It mainly deals with the period between the change over from one to the other.  If that is not done we are in fact damaging this Bill.  This is very exact terminology introduced by the draftsman.

      <Col N="1864" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 85:</P>
      <P>Before section 30 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of subsection (1) of section 4 of the Principal Act are hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put in this amendment to give me the opportunity of highlighting the fact that certain developments are exempted under the Planning Acts.  Particularly in the field of agriculture a lot of development is exempted, such as section 4 (1) (a) of the Principal Act which states:</P>
      <P>A development consisting of the use of any land for the purposes of agriculture or forestry (including afforestation) and development consisting of the use for any of those purposes of any building occupied together, with land so used.</P>
      <P>That is deemed exempted development. As the Minister is aware there has been a lot of criticism of certain types of agricultural developments which have caused heavy pollution in lakes in particular and in rivers to a lesser extent.  I am referring to intensive farming involving piggeries, slurry pits, and the location of silage pits.  The heavy concentrated effluent which comes out of these has been known to contribute substantially to a loss of fish and other marine life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure my amendment is properly worded.  When I decided to put down the amendment it was to use it as a vehicle to highlight this problem and to ask the Minister why he had not made any provision to cover those buildings.  If the Minister has provision elsewhere I will withdraw my amendment.  I am reasonably satisfied that my amendment, as it stands, is probably inoperable but it is there to give me a vehicle to make the point that agricultural buildings have come in for severe criticism. Surely there should be some control over their location.  The proper authority to control that would be the planning authority.  I know that arrangements have been made between officers of the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1865" /> and Fisheries and the officials of local authorities whereby before the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries sanctioned the payment of a grant for agricultural buildings they communicate with the local authority officials.  Whether that is a satisfactory way to deal with this problem which can be serious, as we have known to our regret in parts of the midlands and the north east where there is a lot of intensive pig and chicken rearing in progress, I do not know.</P>
    <P>As worded my amendment may not achieve my objective because it would mean the deletion of all these exemptions and the bringing in of everything under the Planning Act.  I would be obliged if the Minister would give his opinion on the amount of control that exists at present and tell us if he is satisfied that under another part of the Bill he will be able to exercise greater control over this type of development or whether he disagrees with the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in this matter because I had experience of the difficulties to which the existing law can give rise.  A piggery can be exempt from any constraints and the situation to which Deputy Molloy has adverted is of no avail, the situation where the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, in theory, will not give grants unless they are satisfied that the proposed building does not constitute a menance from the point of view of pollution.  That is of no significance whatever in this context.  I do not think the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries take it very seriously, and in the case I am aware of the people concerned were not interested in the grant from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  If the grant from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries was going to cause them any problems in this regard they were prepared to dispense with it because it was not of any importance to them from the economic point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case of which I had personal experience concerned the construction of a piggery a distance from the public <Col N="1866" /> road.  Because of this it was exempt, but the piggery happened to be situated beside a stream and that stream proceeded to meander off into the countryside.  While the piggery, situated where it was, might not be greatly objectionable to anybody the fact that it would pollute the stream which went into many other areas could be, and was, responsible for serious problems.  I should like to hear the Minister expound on that aspect. There is no doubt that many methods of intensive modern farming bring in their train real dangers from the point of view of conservation and preservation of the countryside.  We would all like to encourage the best possible methods of modern farming, and farmers are entitled to ensure that their methods of production are as efficient and as modern as possible.  At the same time there is a real danger, and this has surfaced in many places, that these modern intensive farming methods can be serious causes of pollution.  I would be interested to know how the Minister sees the situation; whether he is satisfied that the existing provisions in this Bill and in other legislation are adequate to deal with the situation.  From my experience I am not satisfied that they are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that as far as the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are concerned there is rigid control in relation to silage pits, piggeries or other modern developments of farming.  For a silage pit it is necessary to have a slurry and a liquid tank so that no pollution can escape.  It is also necessary to keep away from lakes or rivers.  A nephew of mine who was erecting a silage pit had to spend a lot of money in siting the structure away from rivers.  He had to remove a hay-shed to comply with Department regulations.  I agree with those regulations. I made the statement in case the impression is created that farmers can erect silage pits or piggeries anywhere they like.  Deputy Haughey was referring to those who were not interested in a grant, and I would like to see control put on such individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be some control where <Col N="1867" /> a person who is not concerned about the grant erect piggeries or silage pits. Deputy Haughey's point is valid although very few farmers could afford to by-pass the Department's grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey knows a good number who would not be interested in the Department's grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be people who would not build them up to the proper standard and they should be controlled.  The Department's standards are very high and costly. The covering for the liquid tank costs £90, with a bit of concrete on top of it.  That gives an idea of the size of tank required for the liquid.  These are very costly.  You could get the odd person who would say: &ldquo;If I can put up a makeshift construction that will not be near my house, it will do the job for me.  I am not interested in the grant and I will not have to comply with the stringent regulations of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.&rdquo; On the other hand, the ordinary person has to change haysheds and so on to comply with the regulations. Farmers should not be allowed to pollute the countryside any more than anybody else.  A person could destroy the whole place if he could bypass the regulations by not availing of the grant.  I should like to see such a person brought within some type of regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I just explain the amendment?  It has two purposes and I should like each to be discussed separately and that the agricultural aspect would be dealt with first.  The second aspect is a requirement on local authorities to go through the procedures of informing the public about developments that they themselves propose to carry out, because at present all development undertaken by any local authority is exempted development and often the first the public hear of these things is when the workmen arrive on the site to begin construction.  This is far too lax and I should like to suggest some improvements. Subsection (1) (a) of section 4 <Col N="1868" /> deals with the agricultural aspect and the others deal with the local authority aspect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Molloy in the last statement he has made.  I feel it is a source of grave discontent among groups and individuals who are seeking planning permission when various local authorities such as county councils, corporations or urban councils can proceed with developments without seeking permission when they themselves find very often that even for the most trivial type of development they have to seek permission and have the whole matter processed by the planning authority and even in some cases by the Minister on appeal.</P>
      <P>What appears to be discrimination was highlighted on a number of occasions when permission was refused to a private developer or to an individual and later on the same area was developed by the council itself.  Provision whereby the planning authority must give its reasons for refusing to permit development will go some of the way towards overcoming that problem.  Equally, on some occasions the local council went ahead with developments which, to the ordinary citizen, did not appear to conform with the standards which were laid down by the planning authority. Therefore, I would agree with Deputy Molloy that we should insist that the local authority would seek permission in line with the democratic principle that they should be subject to the same constraints in this field as is the ordinary citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is unacceptable because the Deputy proposes to repeal parts of section 4 (1) to the 1963 Act, paragraph (a) of which exempts from planning control the use of land for agriculture or forestry, and paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of which exempt planning authorities from having to apply to themselves for permission to carry out developments in their own districts.  In relation to agriculture, what the Deputy has in mind is probably the larger farm buildings used for intensive farming, for example, pig and poultry <Col N="1869" /> breeding.  These not only can be a source of public health nuisance but may also, in certain cases, cause water pollution.</P>
      <P>Here I may say that the Water Pollution Bill, which is almost completed, will be introduced hopefully, in the Autumn and that is the proper vehicle for dealing with this question. Legislation is not required to bring the erection of these buildings under planning control.  The matter will be dealt with in the revision of the regulations which will follow the enactment of this Bill.  The effect of the amendment would be to require permission for a change of use to farming and this, I am sure Deputy Callanan and many other people like him who know a great deal about farming, would resent very much.  The authority is already there in the 1963 Act and the regulations can be framed to have done what is suggested here.</P>
      <P>It could be argued that even if it is a bit farcical for planning authorities to admit to their own controlled procedure, it would at least ensure public notice and a right of appeal. Deputy Faulkner refers to the question of a private individual being refused permission by the local authority who then proceed to acquire the property to build on it themselves. That is not such a bad thing because the public interest comes in there. If somebody wants to build a house or two in a field, and the local authority want to house 50 or 60 people in the same field, I think the right of the public should be paramount there and I would not see it in the same light as Deputy Faulkner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not object in the event of the local authority having in mind at that specific time that they were going to develop the land themselves but sometimes it happens that, maybe two or three years after having refused permission to individuals, they make a decision to use it themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the sort of change of mind in regard to planning throughout the country that I have commented on.  In many cases they <Col N="1870" /> have changed their minds; they have said one person can do it and another person cannot do it and so on.  I think this is wrong but if we stick to the question of the local authority acquiring land to build on if they require it, that is a legitimate procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Against that it can be said that local authority proposals generally are well publicised and many are subject to statutory procedures which provide for objections and public inquiries.  Furthermore, section 39 of the 1963 Act imposes a statutory obligation on each planning authority not to effect any development in their area which contravenes materially the development plan.  This is more stringent than the provisions in relation to private developers and other bodies who can with the consent of the Minister be given permission for development at variance with the plan. Deputy Callanan and Deputy Haughey had, I would think, two slightly opposite views on the question of farming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Haughey said was that there were people who were not interested in the grant and who would not have to submit to the stringent conditions laid down by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries before grants are paid. Deputy Callanan said he did not think there were many of those but he made a very strong point&mdash;and this is one for which we have to be very careful about making regulations&mdash; about people who, instead of applying for the Department's grants, would do a substandard job.  I would say there are far more of those people who throw up just any old thing at all, know it will not pass the Department's regulations but are still under the umbrella of being exempt.  However, this matter can be dealt with by means of regulations.  The Minister is empowered to lay down regulations under which agricultural development is carried out.</P>

      <P>Under the 1963 Act.  I shall get the reference to it in a minute.  I think the matter can be dealt with in this way.  Let me say immediately that I am as appalled as some of the Deputies opposite are at some of the so-called developments and some of the actions by people who, in the main, are not really farmers, people who go into agriculture and out of it as quickly; they are there for a quick kill.  They are the people who do not care about planning laws or for the interests of their neighbours.  The appalling thing is that it is very often visible: somebody with a lot of money buys a sizeable farm and proceeds to use it in a way that is a source of annoyance to everybody in the district.  He may contaminate a stream or lake or the whole countryside.  This is all too common.  I propose, in the regulations, to deal with that sort of person very strictly, but if we accept the principle that the farmer must apply in the case of everything he wants to do for planning permission just like everybody else, we are taking a very big step from what was written into the 1963 Act.</P>
      <P>As regards the local authority, I should not like to put any more obstacles in their way than are already there.  They are behaving reasonably.  There is plenty of advertising of what they propose to do; everybody knows it for months in advance.  If necessary there can be various types of appeals, public inquiries and so on.  I do not think the second part of this is a matter for consideration at all but the first part is definitely something that will have to be examined very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exempted development regulations made in 1967 in part 3 on page 47 give a description of a development which can be exempted. They give many details which I need <Col N="1872" /> scarcely read out of developments that can be carried out without permission. I can change this by regulation.</P>

      <P>The point is&mdash;are you going to?  The situation exists at present.  The danger to which we have adverted exists.  I am not talking theoretically because I have practical experience of what is involved in the question of farm buildings.  A number of farmers are not interested in the grant for one of two reasons: they are people who go in for a very specialised, very intensive type of operation and the scale of the operation is such that the Department's grants are irrelevant.  The other type of case which I have come across frequently&mdash;I came across it when I was Minister for Agriculture&mdash;is where the Department of Agriculture lay down conditions as to the sort of building which has to be constructed and very often the farmer does not wish to comply with these regulations either because he does not believe in them or because he wants to do it his own way.  I know a case where the Department were laying down certain regulations regarding piggeries and a particular co-operative society had their own ideas of how the piggery should be constructed and because they were not prepared to build it as the Department wanted they said: &ldquo;We will build it in the way we think is most efficient and the Department need not give a grant.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another type of farmer is not prepared to make the elaborate arrangements that the Department of Agriculture sometimes insist on.  Quite a variety of people are involved and the concept of trying to control this situation through Department of Agriculture grants is wrong.  At best, it is an indirect form of control and the job of the Department is to encourage and assist farmers and it is wrong in theory that they should be an enforcing authority in this sphere.  It is the job of the Minister for Local Government to look after conservation and so on.  The Minister has brought up the matter of these regulations and I suggest to him that it is no use to us to say that he could deal with this <Col N="1873" /> situation under the regulations.  We want to know if he will do so.  Will he change the regulations to cope with this problem which is real?  Practically everybody in the House has some experience of it?  The Minister himself says he has plenty of experience of it.</P>
    <P>To revert to the other aspect, the Minister in reply to Deputy Faulkner quoted a case of housing.  I suggest that is special pleading because I know of cases where the local authority refused an applicant permission for industrial development, then proceeded to acquire the property and themselves permitted industrial development subsequently, which is a different case, perhaps, from housing. We all agree with the Minister in regard to housing, but when a local authority is guilty of semi-sharp practice in regard to industrial and other types of development, then I think Deputy Faulkner and Deputy Molloy have valid points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give the Deputy the position.  It is set out in a regulation <Col N="1874" /> made&mdash;and I am quoting Statutory Instrument No. 176 of 1967, page 47, which states under &ldquo;Description of Development&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The construction, excavation, extension, alteration or replacement of any store, barn, byre, shed, glass-house, pen, sty, poultry house, silo or other structure on land not less than 30 feet from any public road the metalled part of which is more than 12 feet in width or from the site of any road improvement work or new road and carrying out or construction of which is an objective of any development plan or, during the period prior to the making of a development plan, is declared by resolution of a planning authority to be an objective which they propose to include in a development plan.</P>
      <P>This is an exempted development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to apply to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think what Deputy Callanan is talking about is that the Department of Agriculture, in order to ensure that regulations which they want observed are carried out say: you must get this sanctioned by the local authority for grant purposes. This has nothing to do with the Planning Act regulations.  There are some conditions in the regulations which provide that no such structure shall be used for any purpose other than the purpose of agriculture or forestry; no such structure for the housing of pigs or poultry or for the making of silage shall be situated within 100 feet of any dwellinghouse save with the consent of the owner and occupier thereof and no such structure within 100 yards of any public road shall exceed 21 feet in height above ground level.  Those regulations were made in 1967 and can be changed at any time.  But for the fact that this Bill is before the House I would have changed them before now because I am as dissatisfied as other people are with the way in which certain people have abused regulations and appear to be getting away with <Col N="1875" /> it.  But because we were introducing this Bill and could deal with the whole matter together I had hoped that we would be able to deal conveniently with these regulations.  However, if it takes as long to get through the remainder, I may have to change the regulations under the 1963 Act.</P>

      <P>One thing the Minister could do with these regulations very quickly is, where regulations speak of buildings contiguous to a roadway to add &ldquo;to a waterway&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If provision is not made now under the Planning Act the evasions that we have seen will continue. The whole purpose of planning is to ensure orderly development and to preserve scenic and amenity areas for the public good.  If there is an area of development which is exempted from the strictures of planning, there are people who will use the exemption for their own benefit.  For instance haybarns that are back the few feet that the Minister mentioned under the regulations can be erected without permission and have been erected in areas of high scenic beauty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amenity is a matter of interpretation. People have very strong complaints that some officials see amenity in everything in order to turn down proposals.  If one can imagine a place of real beauty where there would be no argument as to its quality and beauty, the elected members of a planning authority would unanimously support opposition to development.  They would support the officials.  Yet an individual could erect an ugly haybarn in the middle of it under the Planning Act as the Minister is prepared to leave it. That should not be the case.  This type of development and anything over a certain square footage should be included in planning and should be required to go through the process so that the spirit of planning and orderly development would be maintained.  If we allow loopholes whereby people can circumvent the spirit of planning and erect buildings which are completely out of line with the intention of the Bill we are only fooling the public and <Col N="1876" /> pretending that we are serious about the matter.</P>
    <P>It would seem to be the Minister's intention that buildings for intensive rearing of animals, piggeries and places where chickens are reared in large numbers, where there is very heavy concentrated effluent every day that is very dangerous unless properly treated before discharge into waters, are to be exempted provided they are so many feet from the road and so many feet from a house.  There is no reference to waterways, no reference to strict conditions being applied, no reference to having to go through the process of planning so that the plans will be properly examined before the building takes place.  I am surprised that the Minister sees fit to continue the existing position in view of all the criticism of it that there has been.  I will be surprised if the Minister does not see reason in the amendment.  I would ask him to reconsider it for Report Stage.</P>
    <P>On the effect of repealing paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of subsection (1) of section 4 of the Act, as suggested in the rest of the amendment, local authorities should be obliged, just as every member of the community is obliged, to publish in newspapers their intention of constructing a building or carrying out major development.  There have been cases in every county where the local authority has begun to construct a building without the people in the area having any prior knowledge of it.  Great resentment has been expressed at the fact that although the planning authority enforce the strict terms of the Planning Act in regard to individuals in the community to ensure orderly and proper development, they do not apply the same strict rules to their own activities and have been known to erect buildings which have been very much out of line and out of character with the area where they have been built.</P>
    <P>I have known a case where a local authority erected a building which broke the building line in a housing estate in a city.  Persons applying for planning permission to the authority were always required to comply with the building line.  When the local authority broke the building line nobody <Col N="1877" /> had the right to object.  A fine panoramic view of a beautiful modern building was cut off.  There was great resentment. Short of knocking down the building there was nothing that could be done about it.  The local authority thumbed their noses at the people. There have been many such cases.  The only way to deal with them is to bring them to court.</P>
    <P>There were other cases where the planning authority were brought to court to prevent their going ahead with buildings.  If the proposal had been published and if there were some obligation on the authority to make known in advance their intentions and to provide some system of appeal to the public it would satisfy the needs of the community in this matter.</P>
    <P>It is easy for the Minister to argue against it, to say that it is ludicrous to ask the planning authority to apply their own rules to themselves.  I am anxious to obtain some system whereby the public will be informed in advance of development and will have some way of making known their views in regard to it and of lodging objection to it if they so wish.</P>
    <P>The board or the Minister should be the final arbiter in a case where a person seriously objected to a development proposed by the planning authority. They are not all angels in local authorities.  They have taken chances. They have erected buildings which are very ugly and which do not comply with their own strictures.</P>
    <P>It may be difficult to meet the point I am making but I am expressing a point of view which is shared by many people in the community.  If the amendment does not meet the case, and I suspect that it would not meet it fully, I would ask the Minister to direct the mind of the draftsman to the idea, to see if the procedure could be provided in the Bill which would impose the obligation on planning authorities to inform in advance and to give the right of appeal and of objection to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to come in on what Deputy Molloy has said, some of which I would agree with now because of the provision in the Bill that the local authority will be the final arbitrator <Col N="1878" /> and interpreter in regard to all objections.  We are annoyed because of the extent to which officials interpret what is and what is not an amenity.</P>
      <P>It annoys me when I hear people talking about amenities.  Any ordinary person is as good at judging amenity values as is an engineer.  An engineer may plan and build a better house but he does not know any more about adding to the beauty of the countryside than an ordinary individual.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, if it is situated in certain high amenity areas. I should not like to be travelling through Connemara without a house in sight.  We have heard about houses being out of character, and it annoys me when planning permission is refused because the house would be out of character.  I like to see variety in houses, whether the houses be out of character or not.  The person who is building the house is going to live in it and he should be allowed to plan that house.  If we had more variety in housing the country would be more beautiful to live in.  Unfortunately there are certain standard plans and people must conform to them.</P>
      <P>It has been said that in the matter of building sheds and so on, the local authorities will be reasonable.  It is obvious that you could put up a hay-shed where you would not be permitted to build a bungalow.  This reminds me of the suggestion that local authorities themselves should have to give notice of their intention to develop sites and to build on them. It is only fair to their neighbours that they should.  The neighbours should have some say about the type of development, the type of buildings, local authorities put up.  There should be the same safeguards for individuals against local authority developments as there are in regard to private development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that it might appear senseless if local authorities had to apply to themselves for permission.  I do not like the board that are being <Col N="1879" /> set up under this Bill.  It cannot be said that I am against the members of that board, because they have not yet been appointed, but I do not like the prospect that people who are mere names will have the final decision. The Minister or any other Member of the House has to face the country but the new board will not have to face anybody.  However, if the board are to be established I suggest it is to them that the local authorities should apply for permission when they are planning buildings or other development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the case made by Deputy Molloy, especially in regard to farm buildings, and the Minister has indicated that he is equally unhappy about this.  On every road one travels out of Dublin, main and secondary, mile after mile one can see old haybarns.  They invariably reflect the farmers' bad husbandry. They have been allowed to fall into disrepair with sheets of galvanised iron falling from them.  And, of course, there is the nearby byre which in some cases represent a health hazard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy made the case for high amenity areas.  I accept that, but when we are talking about areas of great scenic value we should not blind ourselves to the fact that there is a greater obligation on us to ensure that places which are already ugly do not become uglier.  Of course we should not allow areas of high scenic value to deteriorate but it is even more important that we retain whatever scenic attractions there are in other areas.  Therefore, I would not emphasise exclusively high amenity value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated his intention to introduce regulations, and I think it is important this should be done as soon as possible to remove from the scene such things as the galvanised sheds and byres to which I have referred.  Adjoining the byres are old dungheaps which are flowing not only into adjoining streams but on to main roads.  If the Minister indicates this can be rectified through the provisions of the Bill he would be setting <Col N="1880" /> the minds of many people at ease, and I know that is his constant wish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been mention of two types of people, one, those who deliberately erect sub-standard buildings, and two, those who cannot afford to build.  There is another type of person who could be described as being a bit lazy.  In some areas, old flax stands are sometimes used as places where effluent is kept.  They are quite good for a certain length of time but when there are sudden flash floods, as happened in my area last year, the water supply can become contaminated.  This could be avoided if the person is obliged to get in touch with the county council especially in the matter of effluent disposal.  The council would be able to give him advice as to what should be done.  This method of effluent disposal is very prevalent in Mayo and damage is done not deliberately but through accident.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to the suggestion that local authorities should look for planning permission from themselves.  It is only right that they should have to do so.  The Minister had at least two deputations last year in relation to a building in Ballina.  If the UDC had had to publish a notice at that time saying they were about to start erecting the building, to some extent the controversy could have been lessened and the feelings which ran very high could have been sorted out or soothed before the matter got to the stage it did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister either to accept Deputy Molloy's amendment or some form of it or to indicate that he will bring in regulations to make it obligatory for farmers to write to the local authority and get an exemption in writing from them.  That would take care of the few people who might violate deliberately the planning laws. It would be no harm if the exemption had to be given by the local authority. In most cases this could be done without delay.  This happens at present in some instances where, for instance, reconstruction grants are being paid. At least, in Mayo if a building is demolished and a new one erected, the county council take into consideration <Col N="1881" /> the building that was demolished although a new one may be slightly more than 120 square feet in area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made the point first that in relation to agricultural buildings there should be much stricter control, and the proper place to provide for this control is in the Planning Act; secondly, that where a local authority propose to carry out developments there should be some procedure whereby the public are informed in advance and have a right to lodge an objection to the development if they so wish.  We wish to know whether the Minister is prepared to consider those points later or whether he is rejecting them.</P>

In respect of (a) which relates to developments consisting of the use of any land for the purposes of agriculture or forestry, the Deputy is suggesting that a farmer should not be allowed use the land in any way he wishes.  The other paragraphs refer to development by county councils, corporations and councils in urban districts.</P>

      <P>Regarding the question of local authorities, section 78 of the 1963 Act states that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" /> Regulations made in relation to any specified cases or classes of cases of development proposed to be carried out by local authorities who are planning authorities may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) require the authority to give public notice in any specified manner of development which they propose to carry out,</P>
    <P>(b) require the inclusion in any such notice of an invitation for the making by interested persons of objections to the proposed development,</P>
    <P>(c) in cases where any such objection is made and is not withdrawn, require the authority to have the consent of the Minister before carrying out the proposed development.</P>
    <P>This is the way in which it could be done but in which it has not been done.  It is rather odd to find such pressure now when obviously it was evident to people for a long time that certain things were being done by the agricultural community which should not have been done.  No changes in the regulations were made before my time and I did not change them because of the fact that this Bill was being prepared.</P>
    <P>At present I am having the regulations vetted.  The House will appreciate that the views of all other interested parties must be taken into account.  I expect that, for instance, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries would hold views that are different from mine.  Therefore, the matter must be discussed and we must reach agreement with all concerned.  I am convinced of the necessity for more stringent regulations so as to prevent some of the abuses which have been referred to here today.  If this Bill is not passed within a reasonable time, I shall bring in regulations to govern the 1963 Act.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of local authority housing, section 78 would entitle me and would have entitled my predecessors to have this requirement carried out but is it not the case that very often when a local authority scheme is being developed people <Col N="1883" /> already living in the area and who should know better do their best to prevent the development of the scheme?</P>

      <P>(a) by the planning authority when considering an application mentioned in subsection (1) of the said section 27, in deciding whether it is expedient to serve a notice under the said section 30, 31, 32, 33 or 35 and in deciding pursuant to the said section 36 or 37 whether a structure should be removed or altered or a use of land should be discontinued or any conditions should be imposed on the continuance thereof,</P>
      <P>(b) by the Board when considering an appeal on an application mentioned in subsection (1) of the said section 26 or subsection (1) of the said section 27 and in deciding to confirm, modify or annual a notice served under the said section 30, 33, 36 or 37.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) by the Minister in deciding whether to direct a planning authority to serve a notice under the said section 31, 33 or 35, in any case where the relevant permission, development or condition <Col N="1885" /> relates to land situate in the Gaeltacht or where the relevant structure is so situate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I read the following portion of my amendment:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding sections 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36 and 37 of the Principal Act, regard may be had to the special interests of the Gaeltacht and the Irish language&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) by the planning authority when ...</P>
    <P>(b) by the Board ...</P>
    <P>(c) by the Minister ... </P>
    <P>in deciding appeals. </P>
    <P>I shall not read all of the wording of the amendment but that is its purpose. It seeks to ensure that regard can be had to the special interests of the Gaeltacht and the Irish language in the operation of planning control powers generally.</P>
    <P>Section 26 of the Principal Act lays down that:</P>
    <P>the authority may decide to grant the permission or approval subject to or without conditions or to refuse it; and in dealing with any such application the planning authority shall be restricted to considering the proper planning and development of the area of the authority (including the preservation and improvement of the amenities thereof), regard being had to the provisions of the development plan, the provisions of any special amenity area order relating to the said area and the matters referred to in subsection (2) of this section.</P>
    <P>But it does not allow a planning authority to take into consideration the special position and interests of the Gaeltacht and of the Irish language. This matter was highlighted at the time Mr. Kevin Boland was Minister for Local Government.  Difficulties arose in obtaining planning permission in certain Gaeltacht areas for developments closely associated with promotion of the Irish language and of industrial development in the Gaeltachts. In view of the special Government policy at that time it was felt <Col N="1886" /> incongruous that the Planning Act should operate in this way against the interest of the Gaeltacht and the successful implementation of that Government's policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister at that time suggested an amendment of the Planning Bill which he circulated in 1969&mdash;the introduction of special provisions to take heed of the interests of the Irish language and of the Gaeltacht.  This matter was being considered by me also when I was considering the changed amendments to the Planning Act while I was Minister.</P>
    <P>When the present Minister published the amendments to the original Act, for some reason, he excluded those proposals which had been the intention of both his predecessors.  I have heard the Minister state that local authorities, in their development plans, can provide for the special interests of the Gaeltacht and of the Irish language.  It was not the considered opinion of the planning section in his Department, while Mr. Kevin Boland was Minister, nor while I was Minister, that such was the position.  The strictures of section 26 lay down quite clearly that the proper planning and development of the area are the primary principles that must be adhered to.  There is no allowance for a local authority taking into consideration the special interests of the Gaeltacht or of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>At that time the advice given to Mr. Boland, subsequently to me, and accepted by both of us because we were anxious to have this provision included in the planning laws of the country, was that this section was necessary.  My amendment is more or less of similar wording to that proposed at that time.  I was greatly surprised, when this Bill was published, to find that the Minister had dropped this section.  It indicated to me that the change of Government had brought about a serious change in attitude to the Gaeltacht and to the Irish language, or that the interests of the Gaeltacht and of the language were matters not considered by the new Government to be of very great importance and for that reason <Col N="1887" /> dropped.  I hope that is not so.  I accepted the advice I was given at that time&mdash;that these sections were necessary to enable planning authorities to make decisions in the best interests of the Gaeltacht development and the Irish language policy.</P>
    <P>If I may quote an example: the present Minister for the Gaeltacht announced that the Department of the Gaeltacht would be transferred to Furbo.  There is a certain anomaly involved here because, on another occasion it was announced that the Department of the Gaeltacht was to be abolished and that Údarás na Gaeltachta was to replace it.  Leaving aside that argument, the statement was made that the Department of the Gaeltacht was to be transferred to Furbo, County Galway.  No progress has been made on the construction of the building at Furbo because there is a conflict between the local planning authority, Gaeltarra Éireann and Roinn na Gaeltachta, the latter two working together in this matter of siting and building the offices, as to where these offices should be located.</P>
    <P>Gaeltarra Éireann and Roinn na Gaeltachta say there is adequate land on the site at Furbo, that it is suitable to accommodate the new buildings but the planning authority say otherwise.  The Government Department, being an exempted grouping under the Act, could push ahead if they wished, without permission, but may be reluctant to do things in that fashion and are seeking the co-operation of the planning authority.  I am informed that the planning authority has been quite adamant that the location proposed by Roinn na Gaeltachta is not suitable from a planning point of view.  I do not agree with the planning authority in Galway in this matter.  If a provision, such as I propose here, were included in the Bill, the planning authority would be unable to take the stand they are taking. Strange as it may seem, the difficulty the present Minister is experiencing with the planning authority in Galway over the location of Roinn na Gaeltachta at Furbo is very similar to that experienced by the then Minister for <Col N="1888" /> the Gaeltacht and Gaeltarra Éireann, and the Minister for Local Government, Mr. Boland, with the same planning authority who objected to the location of the Gaeltarra Éireann Offices at Furbo in 1968, 1969, or whatever year it was.  The planning authority in that area interpreted the planning laws very strictly and informed the Department that all the sites they proposed were not suitable for planning.  Arising out of that case the Minister of the time felt that, in order to implement Irish language policy and Gaeltacht policy, a special provision must be written into the Planning Act to ensure that no planning authority could stymie Government policy in relation to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>That is the whole intention of my amendment.  Deputy Faulkner, our spokesman on Local Government matters, may have some knowledge of the shenanigans that went on around the time that he was Parliamentary Secretary.  The intention behind my amendment is quite clear.  We have had cases, a few of which I have quoted, where the planning authorities have been operating to the detriment of Government policy in relation to the language and the development of the Gaeltacht, have not accepted that the Gaeltacht can be made an exception in any planning matter; have made no provision and are not entitled so to do in their development plans, unless they get the authority from the Principal Act and its amendments.  I suggest that that change should now take place to allow them to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Molloy in what he has said and I also support his amendment.  There is a need to take particular note of the planning problems in the Gaeltacht areas.  All of us accept the importance of the Irish language.  The number who speak it as a vernacular at the present time is relatively small but, nevertheless, it is vitally important for the preservation and the development of the language generally.  We ought to do everything we can do to ensure that the language will not only be retained in the Gaeltacht areas but further developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1889" /> The Gaeltacht has a special interest and for that reason we might look on it from two points of view.  The first is that there should be permission to develop particular areas in the Gaeltacht if it is to be to the advantage of the people in the Gaeltacht, where normally this type of development might not be permitted in other circumstances. Equally we should be in a position to refuse permission for certain types of development which we feel would not be to the advantage of the language and would not materially add to the development of the Gaeltacht or assist in any way the people in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy mentioned the problems that are related to the siting of the headquarters of Gaeltarra Éireann in Na Forbacha.  That happened during my time.  It was objected to by the local planning authority.  I might develop the point I have already made in relation to matters such as this.  The planning authority objected because they said it would interfere with the environment generally.  The headquarters of Gaeltarra Éireann in Na Forbacha, is on the opposite side of the road from the sea.  There was an old building between the road and the sea and because that old building was there the planning authority, because of the Act as it stood, had to grant permission for development.  There was quite a big development on the side of the road which would be regarded as most important in relation to the preservation of the environment.  That had to be permitted, evidently, according to the planning laws.  If you were passing along at the moment, you would not be able to see the headquarters of Gaeltarra Éireann from the road.  It is on the other side of the road from the sea.  It was not permitted because it was suggested that the area was not suitable.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if we could manage to legislate for that type of situation.  Where a particular development will materially assist the people of the Gaeltacht we should be able to overlook the particular type of problems which I would not suggest ought to be overlooked in any other area. There is also the question of industrial <Col N="1890" /> development.  In planning, every possible assistance ought to be given by the planning authority in relation to industrial development in the Gaeltacht. When I was in the Department of the Gaeltacht there used to be an argument that by bringing industry into the Gaeltacht you were damaging the language.  It was a Hobson's choice because if you did not bring industry in you had nobody there to speak the language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not Deputy Molloy's point.  While I did a very considerable amount in relation to the development of industry in the Gaeltacht I emphasised the need to have people using the Irish language in managerial positions because I felt that unless we developed along that particular line the language would be lost. We have got to do two things here.  On the one hand, we have got to develop industrially but, on the other hand, we have to do everything in our power to ensure that the language is preserved. There are other types of development which we should be in a position to do something about&mdash;for example, development of luxury houses in an area which contribute nothing to the Gaeltacht except that the houses are built there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question. We can very easily ensure that the language is preserved in the Gaeltacht, that everything we do in relation to planning should have as its objective the material improvement of the position of the people living in the Gaeltacht. After that you can have it as you wish.  I have had very considerable experience of the need to develop industry, particularly tourism, and in the Gaeltacht areas.  We should try to ensure that, where possible, we do not infringe&mdash;this is what Deputy Molloy wants&mdash;on the development of the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment because it is necessary to make it clear that in legislation it is desirable to give special attention to developments in the Gaeltacht areas, which will go to fostering and helping not alone the Irish language but Irish culture and traditions.  The policy of our party in regard to the Gaeltacht is that we must have more development.  We must have more industrial development, development of fishery resources and the development of tourism.  This Bill should spell out the desirability of giving a slant to the operation of planning in the Gaeltacht areas.  It is very difficult to quantify what we have in mind in regard to this amendment. What we have in mind must help towards our aims.  I suggest that the proposed Údarás na Gaeltachta, in respect of which the Minister for the Gaeltacht has promised to introduce a Bill&mdash;we would like to have seen it introduced before now but it has been promised for after the Recess&mdash;be represented on the planning appeals board.  Údarás na Gaeltachta will be representative of all the Gaeltacht areas stretching from Waterford to Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to ensure that special regard will be given to Gaeltacht areas in this Bill, that in the counties which have Gaeltacht areas&mdash;some of them small areas&mdash;the emphasis on the promotion of the development of these areas will not be overlooked in the general planning and development of the country.  It is not necessary that this should be included in this Bill <Col N="1892" /> but the Minister should set a headline by appointing members of Údarás na Gaeltachta to the planning appeal board.</P>
    <P>Industrial development is desirable and I should like to congratulate our spokesman on Local Government, Deputy Faulkner, who when he was Parliamentary Secretary responsible for the Gaeltacht established advance factories in Gaeltacht areas.  I should like to congratulate Gaeltarra Éireann on their work also.  In erecting buildings they used Irish materials and made use of Irish names.  A planning authority can do a lot in this regard.  At present there is agitation in the Gaeltacht areas about road signs.  The planning authorities responsible for Gaeltacht areas should ensure that signs are in keeping with the areas.  It is incongruous to permit the erection of huge signs by multi-national oil companies in the Gaeltacht areas.  From a planning point of view some of them should not have been erected but, certainly, they should not have been allowed in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should remember that local authorities must give permission for the erection of those signs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them were erected before planning permission was necessary.</P>
      <P>There is a cultural aspect involved in this, something we cannot put down by way of amendment.  The Minister should have no difficulty in accepting this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I find this remarkable. Deputy Molloy referred to the question of the &ldquo;Boland Bill&rdquo; and his amendment is almost a lift from that. However, he left out one subsection which referred to the: &ldquo;social and economic needs of the area of the planning authority&rdquo;.  It is possible that there is a significance in that. That Bill was prepared but it never saw the light of day.  It fell to me to prepare a planning Bill later.  I have not heard from those who have spoken on this amendment what they mean by: &ldquo;regard may be had to the <Col N="1893" /> special interests of the Gaeltacht and the Irish language&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am one of those people who believes that we are an island of 32 counties, a 32-county all Ireland.  We have our own troubles with six of them but is it suggested here that there are special reasons why certain people should not be allowed to live in the Gaeltacht?  Is there any reason why Irishmen who wanted to build a house cannot build a house in the Gaeltacht because they are not Irish speakers?  Deputy Faulkner was talking about people who were not Irish speakers.  Is it suggested that there should be a portion of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What is meant by &ldquo;special interests of the Gaeltacht and the Irish language&rdquo;?  Should factories not be established because people who do not have a knowledge of Irish would move in?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to raise matters.  I am not sure what the Deputies opposite mean.  Do they want to build a barbed wire fence around the Gaeltacht and permit nobody except those who are fluent Irish speakers in or out?  If that is so they should say so, but if it is not they should spell out what they mean.  That is my interpretation.  It says here that regard should be had to the special interests of the Gaeltacht and the Irish language. I have not heard from anybody on the opposite benches what exactly those special interests were.  What are they talking about?  Surely they should not hide their light under a bushel.  If there is something which they know is being affected by the existing planning legislation, the 1963 Act which was passed <Col N="1895" /> through this House, or if there is something in that legislation which is detrimental to the Gaeltacht, would they not tell us so that I can consider whether this Bill before the House should be amended to ensure that that will not be continued?  I cannot see why it should be necessary to have special consideration for an area because, like ourselves, those who live in that area are Irish people and it is our duty to give similar treatment to them wherever they are.</P>
      <P>It has been stated here that the idea is not to keep the non-Irish speaker out of the Gaeltacht.  Deputy Faulkner referred specifically to the man who would build an expensive house.  What is wrong with an expensive house if somebody can afford it, and in what way will that interfere with the interests of the Gaeltacht and the Irish language?  Those are reasonable questions to which I think I am entitled to an answer from the Opposition.  I am prepared to consider the whole matter when I get the full facts.  So far I have not got them.  Let me go back again to the question of the people in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I want the Bill.  Let me go back again to ask specifically why the Opposition want this done. Can they envisage regulations which would ensure that those who are administering the Act would make restrictions?  It could not be done as Deputy Molloy suggested.  That would not do.  We would want to know what the special considerations were.  I would want to know so that they could be put into the Bill and the House would have to accept them. Should we write into the Bill: &ldquo;Nobody shall be allowed to erect a house in that area unless he has a knowledge of the Irish language&rdquo;, or go further and say that no tourist who has not a knowledge of the Irish language should be allowed to go there because he might do some harm?  This would appear to be the sort of woolly thinking that is behind this amendment. I myself have a leaving certificate <Col N="1896" /> honours Irish, but my Irish is not good enough to debate matters in this House in Irish.  I am not alone in that. Two very respected statesmen of this country, the late Seán Lemass and the late Erskine Childers, had no Irish at all.  Nobody could fault them for that, because they were Irish.  I am suggesting that if this provision were put in the Bill, people like that could be debarred from going to live in the Gaeltacht if they wished to go there.  Deputy Faulkner is tut-tutting, but he is the person who referred to the big house being built in the Gaeltacht, who said that that might not be the proper place for it and that there might be a better place to build it.  Let us decide in the Bill that big houses are not to be built in any part of the country, but do not let us try to cover up a very loose interpretation here in this way, that big houses should not be built in the Gaeltacht because in some peculiar way, it would be against the interests of the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.</P>

      <P>As spokesman for the Gaeltacht I would like to make it clear, as I thought I did in my previous contribution, that the aims of Fianna Fáil were to develop the Gaeltacht by building factories, and Deputy Faulkner whom the Minister is accusing is the person who sanctioned factories for the Gaeltacht, and Deputy Molloy sanctioned houses of all kinds for the Gaeltacht and gave planning permission.  Our policy is to develop the Gaeltacht, and we are not narrow-minded in this.  Normally I would make a contribution in the Irish language on this amendment but because I realise that the Minister's Irish, while reasonably good is not good enough, as he said himself, for debate on this, I am speaking in English.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make our policy clear.  We have fostered tourism.  We want to develop tourism further, and tourism means the erection of buildings, and very large expensive buildings.  We want to foster industrial development and this means the erection of very large factory buildings.  The same applies across the whole spectrum of development in the Gaeltacht.  We are not against people coming into the Gaeltacht; we want to attract people there.  Indeed AnCO centres have been set up in order to train workers in the Gaeltacht.  All this is development, but for development you need planning.  By this amendment we want to ensure that <Col N="1898" /> the planning authorities in Gaeltacht areas will realise that planning and development are necessary.  There are areas outside the Gaeltacht which need to be preserved for some purpose. There are areas in the Gaeltacht where, if they were outside the Gaeltacht, factories would not be allowed to be built.  There are areas outside the Gaeltacht where more hotels will not be allowed to be built.  However in the Gaeltacht we must lean over to ensure that nothing in the planning laws will prohibit development in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that the planning authority will be able to say, after the passing of this Bill, to the planning board by way of appeal that what they have done in granting planning permission was done, first of all, because they felt the planning was right, or as near right as possible, and, secondly, it was something which would help the Gaeltacht and, if there is any query by the board or by appellants about any matter, we want the position to be that the local authority giving planning permission will be able to say they did whatever it was because the Act says they must pay attention to development in the Gaeltacht which will foster the Irish language.</P>

      <P>Possibly that sensitivity on the part of the Minister is inclined to distort the position.  I make that point first.  The Minister has no <Col N="1899" /> fluency in Irish for the same reason that I have no fluency in French.  I do not get an opportunity of speaking French.  I get an occasional opportunity of speaking Irish and, because of that, I have a relative fluency in it. Nobody on this side of the House has ever tried in any way to be offensive to any degree to anybody who does not speak the Irish language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not lip service at all.  Where housing is concerned you get bigger and better grants if you <Col N="1900" /> live in the Gaeltacht.  Where agriculture is concerned you get bigger and better grants if you live in the Gaeltacht.  In respect of children attending school, you get grants if you are living in the Gaeltacht.  In respect of hotels you get special grants if the hotels are in the Gaeltacht. The Minister is suggesting that by this amendment we are trying to put the Gaeltacht into (1) a position of prominence and (2) an isolation it has not hitherto enjoyed.  There is no basis for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Minister to bear with me when I give my final example.  Some years ago it was decided that the students in a school in a particular part of the Gaeltacht should be moved two miles down the road to another part of the Gaeltacht. It was our Government decided that should be done and the Government of which the Minister is a member tried to establish that, because there was movement from one part of the Gaeltacht to another, it would be injurious to Gaelic culture and to the Irish language.  The Minister's Parliamentary Secretary, now sitting beside him, lauded the responsible Minister at the time.  Here we have the Minister for Local Government now trying to establish that there should be no difference at all between the Gaeltacht and the Galltacht.  That is my answer to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner made it crystal clear that he was concerned there was an effort by the local planning authority to reject the building of the Gaeltarra headquarters in Na Forbacha.  That was the example he gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not end there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>He gave an example of a situation where there was a proposal to bring in an industry and the local planning authority was rejecting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But the planning board could reverse that decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner was the Parliamentary Secretary who actually introduced industry into the Gaeltacht.  It was he built these advance factories in the Gaeltacht. How it could be argued that he was trying to prohibit the introduction of industry to the Gaeltacht I do not know.  I can only conclude that the Minister did not hear properly the case being made and, not having heard properly, he is trying to distort it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tunney has more or less made the case I proposed to make.  If I might refer briefly to the fluency of the Minister in the Irish language, all I want to say is that I never at any time made any efforts to denigrate any Member of this House because of lack of fluency in Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather pleased recently to find the Minister replying to a question addressed to him in Irish in Irish.  However, to get back to the Gaeltacht, the Minister tried to make the point that there was no difference between the Gaeltacht areas and the rest of the country. Every Government has recognised the special position of the Gaeltacht and made special grants available to Gaeltacht areas.  Not alone that, but a person living in the Gaeltacht whose vernacular is not Irish cannot get certain kinds of grants.  A very positive distinction is made between Irish speakers and others.  The only benefits that accrue to people residing in the Gaeltacht are general in character, such as grants towards the repair of small roads and so on.</P>
      <P>The benefits, generally speaking from the Gaeltacht Department are specifically directed towards the people living there who speak Irish. There are special grants for housing, building factories and for the children who speak Irish in their homes.  These special grants are directed especially towards the Gaeltacht areas, because those areas were recognised by all Governments as being special.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1902" /> The Minister referred to the fact that some people might not want factories in the Gaeltacht.  By that I assumed he meant us.  As I said previously, we have been responsible for a considerable number of factories in the Gaeltacht, particularly in Gweedore. We were also responsible for the small industries grants which have helped considerably towards making more employment available.  We never said that these factories could not be introduced because they came from outside the area or the country.  We were more concerned about ensuring that employment would be available. We were also ensuring&mdash;and I want to stress this&mdash;that those who worked in the factories, at whatever level, would be competent to speak the Irish language. All the workers on the floor could speak the language.  I was very perturbed about the middle- and upper-management, particularly the section of management dealing with the workers.  I wanted to ensure that they, too, would be competent in speaking the Irish language.  For that reason we set up training courses.  Here, too, we made special grants available.  We also made grants available for tourism and for those who erected hotels in Gaeltacht areas.  We did not insist that the people who owned the hotels should be native speakers.  We were concerned that the Gaeltacht would be developed in accordance with its culture and traditions.</P>
    <P>In my view, this Government are not as serious about the Irish language and the development of the language as they might be.  I assumed that the Minister would have been particularly keen to bring in a section, if Deputy Molloy's amendment was not suitable, to try to help not only to preserve the Irish language but to develop the language in the Gaeltacht and, through the planning laws, the material welfare of the people, rather than putting forward as many obstacles as he could to the amendment and trying to denigrate the motives behind it.</P>
    <P>I have never denigrated anybody's attitude to the Irish language nor do I propose to do it now because that is a personal matter.  It is up to each person to decide whether he wishes to <Col N="1903" /> speak it or not.  My attitude, while Minister, was that every child was entitled to learn the language.  What he did afterwards was his own business although I hoped he would continue to speak it.  I would have been much happier if the Minister had stopped questioning the motives of those who put down the amendment and those who spoke in favour of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>If the intention behind Deputy Molloy's amendment could be brought to fruition in some other way, I still feel it is worthwhile emphasising our dedication towards the <Col N="1904" /> development of the Gaeltacht and our concern that the language should not only be perserved but developed.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Tully said, there has been and, until such time as the Irish language becomes more widely spoken, there should always be special emphasis on Gaeltacht areas which relate to culture and so on.  We accept that the people in the Gaeltacht have more problems than people in other areas. The land is not as good for agricultural purposes as it is in other areas. The basic problem is that the people there, whom I know very well not only because I was in the Department of the Gaeltacht but because I spent a considerable part of my life in a Gaeltacht, have done a very worthwhile job for the nation by preserving the language against tremendous odds.</P>
      <P>To suggest we are saying that people who do not speak the language should not be allowed into the Gaeltacht as tourists and so on is contradicted by our actions when in Government.  We did everything possible to get as many people as we could to go to the Gaeltacht and the Gaeltacht colleges.  We gave special grants to hotels to ensure that as many people as possible would go to the Gaeltacht and that would benefit the material well-being of the people there.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to reconsider the situation.  I am not trying to be awkward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely believe what I am saying.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to think it over and see what he can do to meet us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never envisaged that the &ldquo;small schemes&rdquo; programmes should be carried out in total in any one year.  Although the capital provision for sanitary services is £16.75 million this year, the volume of work in progress is so high that the amount which could be made available for small schemes is necessarily limited. This amount was allocated between local authorities with due regard to the programmes submitted and the need to carry out the more urgent schemes.  The £30,000 for Galway is one of the highest allocations and should enable them to undertake two or three of the nine schemes submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that Galway County Council got nothing for those schemes last year and that, instead of the £74,000 mentioned in the question, it should be £100,000 having regard to the £26,000 which was sanctioned last year and which we did not get.  Since Galway got nothing last year, would the Minister agree that we are getting a very small share of the large cake he mentioned yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I wrote to Deputy Callanan on 30th May giving him particulars and I hope he got my letter.  Galway County Council did not submit their applications until 20th December, 1974.  The estimated overall cost of their small schemes for 1975 was £74,000.  They sent in two further schemes costing £26,000 on 28th January, bringing the total up to £100,000 roughly.  I must repeat that it was never envisaged that all the schemes submitted by any local authority could be paid for and carried out in any one year.  We divided the amount over all the local authorities and Galway got £30,000 which means they are doing pretty well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that £26,000 was sanctioned for 1974 and we did not get it.  That means that the total application is for £100,000.  We <Col N="1906" /> got £30,000 although we got nothing in 1974.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>The point is that Galway County Council did not look for any money under this scheme until 20th December, 1974.  I am sure Deputy Callanan would agree that it would not have been possible to give them money to spend last year because they did not apply for it.  They must now take their place along with everybody else.  They got £30,000 this year.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for each local authority to decide on their waste disposal arrangements.  My <Col N="1907" /> Department keep developments regarding methods of disposal under review.  The evidence available at present indicates that incineration is an extremely expensive method of disposal as compared with traditional methods.  Apart from the cost factor, incineration of waste requires a high energy input and can create considerable amenity problems.</P>

      <P>Refuse collection is a matter for the county councils.  They got an allocation and over the years they have made arrangements for waste disposal.

I am disappointed to hear that he is unaware of the situation now.  Is he aware that as the present regulations stand one man can have a car six years old which he can licence for £1.50 while his neighbour, who may be in the same business, has to provide a vehicle under two years old and his licence costs £30?

      <P>Representations have been made to me by residents of South Finglas regarding their domestic heating problem.  I have already replied to these representations and informed the residents of the provision of grants for the installation of fireplaces or solid fuel burning appliances in their houses.  These grants, including supplementary grants, may total two-thirds of the cost of the work up to a maximum of £400.  I understand that the residents have also communicated with the corporation about their problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has repeated what he said yesterday, I suppose I may repeat what I said. Does he accept that indicating to families who already owe the ESB £400 in respect of heating bills that they qualify for grants or for anything which requires them to spend money is poor consolation to them? These people have no power at the moment.  There are 20 families there with no form of heating or power for cooking and does the Minister not think that he could do better than indicate grants for which they are eligible but which we know they cannot avail of and that something will have to be done before the position worsens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Dublin County Council on their own initiative are providing on request alternative means of heating in their rented houses which have central heating only.  This consists in the provision of Super Ser heaters at a cost of about £30 each.  These are being provided in various areas in the county and the cost is being met in full by the county council.  The Department is not aware of any other area where a local authority has provided an alternative means of heating in centrally heated houses.  As I said yesterday to the Deputy in private conversation and last night in the debate. I have sympathy with these people but that is no use to them. They have been encumbered with a system of heating and cooking which is no use to them.  They are the victims of the system.  All I could do <Col N="1914" /> was to stop that system being installed and give them the opportunity of installing solid fuel heating systems where possible.  There is no legislation which permits the Department to take over payment of heating bills for council tenants and that cannot be done.  If we talk about it for 12 months, we would not come any nearer solving the problem.  I suggest the matter be taken up again with the local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I admit these people are the inheritors of this poor system, they are also victims of the present economic blizzard and this has worsened their situation.  The Minister might exhort the local authority to introduce some form of differential payment in respect of heating in those houses.  When we have differential rents I do not see why he could have differential payments in respect of these charges which are in excess of the rents they are required to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The differential rents scheme is a national scheme.  If what the Deputy suggests could be introduced I could see local authority tenants all over the country validly saying to the Department of Local Government: &ldquo;You paid for heating and cooking costs in houses in Dublin; why can you not do it everywhere else?&rdquo;  This is not possible. While I have all the sympathy in the world for these people, I cannot do anything to help and there is no point in trying to suggest that I can.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1915" /> The standard of fire protection in an area depends on a number of factors&mdash; the strength and efficiency of the fire brigade; the operation of planning and bye-law controls; the local fire prevention programme including inspections under the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.  The requirements in large built-up areas, or in areas in which there are special fire risks of one kind or another, will be different from those in other areas and it would not be appropriate to think in terms of the same kind of protection in all areas.</P>
    <P>Standardisation where appropriate and improvement is promoted by my Department through the technical advice provided; the financing of capital investment in the service and the provision of central training courses.  Fire protection standards have been recommended by my Department. The development of these standards is being undertaken as part of the new system of building regulations being prepared by my Department.</P>
    <P>The question of additional measures that may be appropriate to bring about improvements or greater standardisation in the service will be considered in the light of the report of the working party on the Fire Service which I have received, and which will be published in the near future.</P>

      <P>Considerable powers exist in the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948 enabling local sanitary authorities to control temporary dwellings in their areas <Col N="1916" /> and to prohibit such dwellings in particular places.  It is a matter for the local authority to decide on any initiatives to be taken on foot of those powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that this is a problem of fairly recent origin and that despite the best efforts and best intentions of Kildare local authority and despite questions to the Minister for Justice, we have made no progress whatever with regard to this matter and that it is something that now demands a solution? I would hope that the Minister would not pass the buck to somebody else.  Would he not agree that something definite needs to be done to solve this problem and that he has the power to do it if he so wishes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legislation under which I can deal with it except that which already is in the hands of the local authority and, indeed, the Garda have already dealt with about 400 cases under section 98 of the Road Traffic Act for obstruction of traffic but whether or not anything further can be done is something which I am not in a position to say. My advice is that it is not possible for me to do it but it is open to Kildare County Council to make a prohibition order banning camping on the site. This has not been done.  The order would be subject to confirmation by me.  It would have to apply to all temporary dwellinghouses and could not be related to dealers only.  Another possible approach would be to have closer control of mobile dealers generally.  Deputy Power will say that I am passing the buck but that is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the problem; I know it because I see it when going through the country, but there is nothing I can do except give the powers which local authorities have to deal with it themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that to ban them from one <Col N="1917" /> locality will only mean that they will hoist their tents or caravans and move to another area and that you cannot designate every area in the country as being banned and that the Minister for Justice has informed me that the Garda have no authority to remove itinerants from the camping sites or to prevent their camping on a particular site?  Therefore, it would appear that the legislation which county councils have is not sufficient to deal with the problem and that stronger legislation is required to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Power there because I believe a lot of this is caused by the fact that local authorities do not want to take the powers which they have far enough. It is easy for them to complain and to say that the Department should do something about it.  My predecessors did, in fact, lay down legislation and passed it on to local authorities.  They are not using that legislation.  It is a case, to use Deputy Power's expression, of passing the buck and there is nothing I can do about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>Since land for amenity purposes is generally acquired by a local authority by agreement and since the cost of acquisition is only sometimes financed by way of loan, my functions in the matter are limited, relating only to sanction to such loans as are sought and dealing with the rare proposal for compulsory acquisition.  It would be more appropriate, therefore, if the Deputy sought the comprehensive information he requires from the local authority concerned.</P>
      <P>On the specific case of Marley Grange, my Department has not been involved in any way in relation to the acquisition of this property and, again, the more appropriate course would be for the Deputy to address his inquiry to the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it would be a function of the Minister's Department to bring this information to the notice of the House at the request of a Deputy who puts a question to the Minister in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the matter is brought to the notice of the Department by the local authority it would not be so in order.  There are many matters about which it would be possible for the Department to ask local authorities for information which could be got much more easily by local representatives at local level. It is not that I am not anxious to give Deputy Andrews the information but <Col N="1920" /> there is a precedent involved in this case, which it would be very difficult to get over at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>What precedent is there?  Let us be fair about it.  I agree that there are certain questions asked in the House which could quite easily be asked by letter or telephone call. This is an extremely important issue in the area that I and other Deputies represent.  In the circumstances, surely the Minister could have got the information for me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If we went to the trouble of asking the local authority and gave Deputy Andrews the information which he wants, any Deputy would be entitled to put down a question to me asking me to give the history of dealings between a local authority and the purchaser of lands anywhere in the country.  It would be an impossible situation.  It would cause a lot of complications. I am not being difficult about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister's point.  The answer to Question No. 22 in relation to the purchase of Marley Grange is relative in the context of the reply the Minister might give to Question No. 23.  There is some suggestion that it is not possible to purchase lands at Newtownpark Avenue due to lack of cash.  My information is that the Government have purchased over 200 acres at Marley Grange and that the acreage involved in Question No. 23 is only 22 acres.  It seems extraordinary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of public open space for the benefit of the residents of the area referred to by the <Col N="1921" /> Deputy is primarily a matter for consideration by the planning authority, Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question is related to the recent decision by the council to grant outline planning permission, subject to conditions, for housing and flat development on the land attached to Newtownpark House. Several parties have appealed to me against this decision and the main point put forward in support of the appeals is that the land in question should be reserved for use as public open space.  As the Deputy is aware, an oral hearing of the appeals has been sought and this will be arranged as soon as possible.  At this stage, it would not, of course, be proper for me to make any statement in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the Minister's intention to grant an oral appeal, it might not be proper to comment to any great extent but I would ask him to keep in mind when considering this very important matter that the lands involved are the last remaining piece of open space in the Blackrock area, known as McGuire's land. I see Deputy Desmond coming in behind the Minister.  Deputy Desmond supports me fully in my campaign to have these lands acquired for the residents of the Blackrock-Newtownpark area in the County of Dublin.  It is the last remaining open space, the last remaining lung.  I would ask the Minister to consider these matters when coming to a decision arising out of the oral hearing.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the number of planning permissions granted on appeal since 1st April, 1973, where (a) the original application for planning permission was refused by the planning authority and (b) a subsequent application to the planning authority for retention was also refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested is not available in my Department. For the period from 1st April, 1973, to the 31st May, 1975, the number of appeals against refusals of permission which were determined by the granting of permission, either with or without conditions, was 3,004.  I am unable to say, however, whether the applications to which these appeals related were the original applications. It is not unusual where permission has been refused, for a revised application to be made.  If a second or third application results in an appeal to me, I would have to deal with the proposal before me and it would not necessarily come to attention that there had been any previous application.</P>
      <P>Similarly, in regard to the second part of the question relating to permissions granted for retention, I am unable to say in how many cases the application for retention followed an earlier application to the planning authority for permission to carry out development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

Is it the form in which the question has been put down that has been inhibiting him in his reply?  I ask him again is it possible that he would have decided on an appeal in relation to the retaining of a building without his knowing what had happened in relation to that case prior to its coming to him on appeal?

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>I have not been particularly contentious in regard to <Col N="1926" /> these matters.  All I wanted was a little information and the Minister is simply not giving it to me.  To be quite frank, just before the question was answered I guessed there could possibly be a play on words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if Deputy Faulkner thinks this.  I assure him it is not so.  The information I have got is exactly as I have given it to him and if there is anything further I can do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say from the background information he will have in how many cases on appeal he granted permission to retain a building where the planning authority had refused planning permission and when the person concerned persisted in building and was refused retention permission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that information but the question seems to imply that it is improper to reverse a decision of a planning authority or to give permission for the retention of a structure.  Of course, specific provision is made in section 26 of the 1963 Act for appeals and in section 27 for retention of structures.  There would be no point in having those provisions there if they were not intended to have an effect.  What Deputy Faulkner appears to be trying to say is that it is wrong, that it is a crime to give this, when in fact provision was made in the Act passed by this House for the purpose of allowing this to be done.  If he has a specific case which he wants to discuss, perhaps he would put a question down and then we will know what he is talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in mentioning specific cases.  I simply wanted to know in how many cases this had occurred.  One of the supplementary questions I would have asked is that where a person deliberately and with full knowledge breaks the law and has been perhaps convicted of breaking the law, would the Minister feel that the proper thing to do in a case like that was to reward such a person by allowing him to retain the building?</P>

      <P>This House decided it was proper for a Minister to give permission in those circumstances and it made the necessary provisions in sections 26 and 27 of the 1963 Planning Act.  There is no point in Deputy Faulkner trying to get out of these facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the considerations which influenced him in granting permission on appeal to build a house in the high amenity area of Burren, County Clare, against the background of four refusals by the local planning authority, two refusals on appeal by a previous Minister and one refusal by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I granted an outline permission in this case because I considered that the construction on the site of a suitably designed singlestorey house need not be contrary to the proper planning and development of the area.  The decision on the previous appeal was to refuse outline permission on the grounds that the proposed development by being obtrusive would detract from the natural beauty of the area and would thereby seriously injure its visual amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application to which the second appeal related specified that the house proposed was intended for a permanent home, to be erected in cottage style and in keeping with the traditional character of the area.  After careful consideration, I decided to give outline permission subject to a condition which would facilitate the <Col N="1929" /> integration of the house into its surroundings. The house is to be of single-storey construction, the walls are to be finished predominantly in local stone and the roof is to be of dark-coloured tiles and low pitched.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in circumstances where the planning authority refused permission on four occasions, where the then Minister refused permission on two occasions and where the present Minister refused it on one occasion, there is grave danger of undermining the confidence of people in the planning Acts by such decision as the Minister has given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that Deputy Faulkner consult with the two Fianna Fáil Deputies who made representations asking that permission be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the general question.  The Minister is aware that in many instances when people request a Deputy to make representations the representations are made and the Deputy may not go into the detail that I am engaging in.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the public, seeing a situation of this kind, would regard the final decision of the Minister as being extraordinary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  People can get the impression often that by reading the newspapers one can decide on an appeal case.  The only way in which appeals can be decided is by a study of all the relevant material in the Department.  I was satisfied in this case that the last appeal made was the one which should be granted.  I was strengthened in my view by the fact that two respectable Members of this House, who happen to be members of Deputy Faulkner's party, recommended strongly that permission be given.  I agree, that they were right and acted accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

The relevant extract from the publication of 30th May, 1975 alleges that, of the clerical workers employed by the Racing Board from the Public Service and insurance and banking businesses &mdash;and this is the statement&mdash;</P>
      <P>On racing days some will be on leave, others on casual sick days, privilege leave days or simply absent from work.  87 civil servants are employed by the Racing Board on a casual basis, along with 15 teachers, 13 members of the Garda Síochána and one member of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>There is no objection to a civil servant taking part-time employment with the Racing Board provided it does not interfere with his official duties.  Of course what would obviously be irregular would be his absenting himself from his official duties under the guise of sick leave.

      <P>It is a long answer. Under the 1963 Act the formal classification and the operative word is &ldquo;classification&rdquo;&mdash;of any material as secret or confidential, if that is required, is a Ministerial responsibility. Therefore, if a Minister says that a matter is confidential or secret that is his responsibility.  When civil servants enter the Public Service they are asked to sign a form saying they will respect the confidentiality or secrecy of any documents or statements they may read or hear.  It is a matter for every Department within the Civil Service to act accordingly.</P>

      <i>Background</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have witnessed and are still seriously affected by the most dramatic turnabout in the economic fortunes of the western world since the late 1920s.  At the start of the year, not only was economic activity in the world at large at a very low <Col N="1941" /> ebb, but there were widespread indications that the recession was deepening. The only ray of light on the horizon was that an upturn in the world economy was expected around the middle of this year.  Against that background, the Government made it clear that their approach to our economic problems would give priority to the maintenance of employment and the preservation of living standards.  We also stressed the necessity to reduce the rate of inflation and made it clear that the Government could succeed only if all sections accepted self-discipline in incomes.  We pointed out, for instance, that the better-off should not insist on recouping, in higher pay, the taxes they must pay if the poorer sections of the community are to be protected against rising prices.  It is disappointing that this last exhortation, which few, if any, have publicly disputed, has not yet been acted upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget of January last sought to give effect to the Government's objectives.  I made it clear at the time that the pace of inflation&mdash;then running at some 20 per cent a year&mdash;and the size of our balance of payments deficit&mdash;then standing at some 10 per cent of gross national product&mdash;would in normal circumstances have required immediate corrective action, involving a reduction in domestic demand and the running of the economy well below capacity levels, possibly for a prolonged period.  This would have involved heavy unemployment and possibly a resumption of emigration. The Government set their face against this course and opted instead for what I described at the time as a carefully expansionary budget, designed to preserve employment and maintain living standards.  This strategy was founded on a pattern of public expenditure which was designed to protect the weaker sections of the community, help the agricultural sector over the difficulties it had encountered in 1974 and stimulate industrial growth and employment through a combination of taxation relief and capital expenditure. In short, the budget was intended to float the economy over the rocks of <Col N="1942" /> recession into the flood-tide of world economic recovery.</P>
    <P>This strategy was not without risk. The world recession could turn out worse than was then foreseen, the eventual recovery could be delayed.  Since then, world recession has turned out to be deeper and more prolonged than any international or national authority foresaw at the start of this year. Unemployment particularly has deteriorated in Europe and the United States of America.</P>
    <P>Steps taken in many countries to stimulate economic activity have not yet been effective and the timing of the long-awaited upturn cannot yet be predicted with confidence.  In the two &ldquo;lead&rdquo; economies of the western world&mdash;the United States and Germany &mdash;a full resumption of economic activity is improbable until near the middle of 1976.  Even then, such recovery as is likely, particularly in the US, will be founded on their own internal strength, rather than on growth in world trade, to which we must look for our future prosperity. Indeed, given the normal time lags inseparable from our peripheral economic position, we cannot realistically hope to see a resumption of the export-led growth path before the second half of 1976.</P>
    <P>This means that for the next year or more, we shall have to tackle and solve our economic problems largely on our own and without the benefit of the growth in international trade on which we have become increasingly dependent during the past decade.  Furthermore, if we wish to participate in the fruits of that trade when it does revive, we must put ourselves during that period in a position to do so.  That means improving our international competitiveness&mdash;and that means curbing inflation now.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Inflation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Let there be no ambiguity about this: inflation is the economic enemy that must first be beaten before we can progress.  Unemployment, which is a chronic and a corrosive evil with deplorable social effects, is an inevitable consequence of inflation.  The difficulties of deficit financing and <Col N="1943" /> foreign borrowing are considerable, but they are largely caused by inflation and they limit the freedom of action by the Government to cope with the problem.  Future prosperity and growth depend on exports, which simply cannot be achieved if inflation erodes our international competitiveness. It is beyond question that none of our major problems can be solved until we first cure this terrible disease of inflation.  Other countries including our partners in the EEC have taken action, in some cases quite drastic and unpopular action, to curb inflation. It is apparent that Britain is considering special efforts to reduce the rate of inflation there.  As others are wisely getting off the accelerating merry-go-round of inflation, we must do the same or suffer the consequences if we do not.</P>
    <P>It is of fundamental importance that the country at large should understand the absolutely basic nature of this task.  There is no possibility of making any substantial reduction in the present number of unemployed, much less providing for the growing labour force of the future, unless we can curb inflation. It is no longer possible to consider any aspect of economic or social policy&mdash;whether affecting employment, welfare, education, investment or the public service&mdash;without having to take account of either their impact on inflation or of the extent to which inflation reduces their real value.  In short, it is not possible to make any sort of economic or social advance until this cancer in the economy has been dealt with.</P>
    <P>The country's economic future now depends on this.  The goal of full employment in the medium term can, essentially, be reached only on the basis of export-led growth.  This can be done only if industries operating here are internationally competitive &mdash;and recent experience in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries shows that in free trade conditions this means being competitive on the home market too.  Up to recently, we were helped by the fact that inflation was common to all OECD countries <Col N="1944" /> and our own inflation rate was not substantially in excess of our competitors'. This is no longer true.  At the moment, our inflation rate is about twice the European average; next year, with the increasing success of other countries in bringing their inflation under control, it could easily be three times that average.  Unless it is swiftly reduced, this could be a recipe for unemployment on a scale previously unknown and intolerable living costs at home.</P>
    <P>Nor can we console ourselves with the thought that at least we are inflating no faster than Britain, our main trading partner.  Apart from the fact that this leaves us terribly vulnerable to corrective action taken by the UK to safeguard its own position, the effects of current inflation on the economy are such as to make it intolerable even in the short run; it offers no credible basis whatever for long-term economic and social development.  As thousands of workers know only too well by now, current inflation rates are speedily making many of our industries increasingly uncompetitive.  It is not so often realised that this kind of inflation can have profound effects in the public sector too.</P>
    <P>Consider some of the main elements in public expenditure.  Public sector pay and social welfare expenditure have been increasing faster than inflation in recent times.  These two comprise about one-half of current public expenditure.  Another fifth is now accounted for by debt service charges, which increase both with rising capital costs and interest rates and also with the larger capital repayments needed because borrowing to meet deficits can only be arranged on a short term basis. Inflation is, therefore, a powerful engine inexorably pushing Government outlays to intolerable levels, even before account is taken of the limitless demands for further and further moneys for expansion and extension of public services and subsidies.</P>
    <P>It is sobering to consider the effects of current inflation on public expenditure even over a short space of time. Since the publication of the current budget on 15th January last, the Government have had to approve additional <Col N="1945" /> current expenditure by Departments totalling £76 million or 7.3 per cent of the budget estimate for these expenditures.  Almost 85 per cent of this is a direct reflection of the present inflationary situation.  The balance is mainly due to the need for increased expenditure on security services.</P>
    <P>The principal headings on which extra expenditure arises are health, £18.8 million; social welfare, £8.1 million; CIE subsidies, £8.0 million; education grants, £6.6 million; justice, £3.3 million; agriculture, £3.0 million; defence £2.9 million and post and telegraphs, £2.0 million.  An increase of £20.1 million in the global provision for public service pay increase is also necessary because of the additional unforeseen cost of the 16th pay round and of certain anomaly increases.  It has also been found necessary to provide a further £10 million for servicing the public debt because of the high cost of borrowing in present inflationary conditions.  Large as all these increase are, they are far short of the total additional expenditures for which approval has been sought, and the Government have had to refuse to sanction a substantial amount of these.  We are tightening the control of public expenditure so as to avoid any further increases during the remainder of the year, apart from those I will be announcing later in this statement.</P>
    <P>As regards revenue, the rate of inflation is not on the Exchequer's side. Inflation at present rates is a brake on consumption and economic activity, not a stimulus.  The growing uncompetitiveness of Irish industry and the resultant layoffs and short-time working have further reduced purchasing power and added to uncertainties about the future.  This in turn has caused a reduction in consumption and investment. As a result, the growth of receipts from both direct and indirect taxes has fallen off.  The unpalatable fact is that to date in the current year tax revenue is running at a rate below that expected last January.</P>
    <P>As a result of double-digit inflation, therefore, public expenditure has risen enormously, while revenues are being <Col N="1946" /> squeezed.  It has been possible to maintain the level of public activities only through large-scale borrowing, which itself has risen greatly in recent years. The rate of foreign borrowing has risen fivefold in the last two years. Notwithstanding that present circumstances necessitate such borrowing, there are sound economic reasons why this trend should not and, indeed, cannot continue indefinitely.  A compelling one is that the raising of money on the scale required would simply not be possible.  The Irish economy does not have an unlimited capacity either to borrow resources or to repay them&mdash;a fact no less apparent to our creditors than to ourselves.</P>
    <P>Last January we attempted a &ldquo;holding operation&rdquo; to cope with the situation until general worldwide recovery enabled a more fundamental restructuring of the economy.  That operation, while successful in preventing a worse situation than the one we find ourselves in, has not been enough, largely because the recovery in the world economy has not yet taken place.  I may be pardoned for recalling that last January I pointed out the limitations of an annual budget in a period of great instability and said that further corrective measures might be required if the global and home situation did not improve throughout the year.  Many countries, for similar reasons, have been obliged to resort to more than one budget a year in these exceptionally difficult times.</P>
    <P>The White Paper stressed, and I reiterated as forcibly as I could in my January statement, that it was essential that self-discipline and moderation be observed in seeking income increases, that the questions of competitiveness and the wider national implications of pay increases be given full weight in negotiating the 1975 National Pay Agreement and that the better-off should not seek compensation for any additional tax on nonessential items if we were to avoid increased unemployment and permanent damage to the economy.</P>
    <P>Events have shown that our economic difficulties would be less acute if these precepts had been taken more <Col N="1947" /> fully to heart.  It is now clear that the current national pay agreement gives increases in pay, including increases reflecting taxes on alcoholic drink and tobacco, which cannot be paid in present economic circumstances without doing serious economic and social damage.  It superimposed price-related pay increases on the increases already given under the 1974 agreement.  That agreement ensured that the majority of workers obtained an average increase in pay of about 30 per cent over a 12-monthly period&mdash;well in excess of the price rises that took place during the year.  This meant that most employees got real income increases far in excess of real economic growth&mdash;growth which was, as we now know, negligible.  The economy cannot absorb this any longer.  Last year, external sources accounted for threequarters of our inflation, so that the domestic causes were overshadowed; this year, external sources will contribute less than 20 per cent of our inflation&mdash;the rest of the wound is self-inflicted.</P>
    <P>The situation is now extremely grave.  There is a growing threat, caused by our intolerably high rate of inflation, to employment and to business generally.  There is now an inescapable obligation on all of us to accept that, collectively and individually, steps must be taken to curb inflation now.  The withdrawal symptoms will undoubtedly be painful, but they will be far less agonising than the dreadful consequences that will ensue if we fail to correct present tendencies.</P>
    <P>The Government have, over recent weeks, consulted the main economic interests in the country through the Working Group on the Economy, in which Ministers took part with representatives of labour, industry and agriculture, and the National Economic and Social Council.  I wish to express the Government's thanks to the members of both these bodies for the time and attention they have given to these problems.  Their comments and deliberations have been of much value to the Government in our consideration of the measures needed in these difficult times.  In the course of consultation <Col N="1948" /> with these bodies, there has been a broad measure of agreement on the problems of inflation and unemployment facing our people&mdash;though, understandably, rather less agreement on the measures needed to cope with them.  In these circumstances, it is the duty of the Government to act in the general interests of all the people, unaffected by sectional favour.  The measures devised by the Government should be seen in this light; they are designed to tackle the problems of inflation and unemployment simultaneously.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Incomes</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government and many reputable institutions both national and international have reiterated time and again the over-riding necessity for moderation in pay claims if inflation is to be curbed and employment to be protected.  The package which I will outline later represents a carefully-considered effort by the Government to give a lead in tackling inflation and unemployment.</P>
    <P>Measures of the kind I will outline, however, cannot achieve their aim and could well increase inflationary pressures unless other parties make their contributions.  A financial sacrifice, in the form of additional taxation, will be sought from certain taxpayers.  The well-being of each citizen will be most closely affected by the success or failure of the Government's efforts.  Unless he, too, plays a major part, that fight cannot succeed.  It is, therefore, in his own as well as in the community interest that he makes his contribution.  What is needed?  Primarily, that the dangerous inflationary pressures in the economy should be relieved.  By whatever detailed renegotiation is necessary, we must take immediate steps to ensure that the measures which the Government are taking to wind down inflation will be matched by an appropriate revision of the remaining national agreement increases&mdash;for example, by dropping the third phase or by modifying the third and fourth phases or some equivalent adjustment.  How exactly the agreement should be revised to achieve this end is a matter for consideration in the <Col N="1949" /> first instance by the Employer-Labour Conference and I am asking the chairman of the conference to have it convened urgently to put this examination in hands.</P>
    <P>I want no misunderstanding to arise. There is no question of reneging on or abandoning the national agreement. This Government have openly pinned their faith on the value of national agreements.  We have consistantly tried to uphold the agreements both in the letter and in the spirit and that remains our policy.  What we are asking is that, in return for a slowing down of price increases, there should be a corresponding slowing down of income increases and that the parties should agree to make the necessary changes in the agreement to ensure this.  We are not asking people of small means for a financial sacrifice.  That is being asked of those better able to bear it.  What we are asking each income earner to do is to respond to the Government's action to reduce the cost of living below what it would otherwise be by abating the nominal income increase he would probably have needed if the Government had taken no action.  In the end, the ordinary worker will certainly be no worse off but he and the community at large will be much better off in terms of competiveness and employment.</P>
    <P>I must point out that there is a critical time-scale to these proposals. The essence of the measures I have described so far is that there should be a tangible step, in the form of a scaling-down of the national agreement provisions, towards the easing of inflation, in return for the measures taken by the Government to reduce the cost of living and to boost employment. If this is to result in a start to winding-down our intolerable inflation rate, the first milestone on this road will be the next quarterly consumer price index figure, on which payment of the third phase of the national agreement is to be based.  It is, therefore, crucial that it should be clear within a matter of weeks whether, in fact, there is to be an adequate response to the Government's initiative. It would be completely unacceptable and most harmful to the whole <Col N="1950" /> economy if the costs, risks and sacrifices involved in the package of measures that I will announce should be undertaken without an adequate return to the community in the form of a revised national agreement that corresponds to the Government's anti-inflation package.</P>
    <P>The time available to the Employer-Labour Conference is, therefore, short; I know they will approach their task in full consciousness of this and in full awareness of their responsibilities. If there is an adequate response in terms of pay restraint to the Government's initiatives, the Government will take steps to impose a corresponding restraint on dividends and professional fees.  If, on the other hand, modifications of the national pay agreement should be refused or if they should be inadequate, the Government would be reluctantly obliged to consider revoking the price reliefs which are a significant feature of this budget.  As will be seen, the proposals I am announcing will transfer part of the cost of some goods and services from the consumer to the Exchequer but the overall cost to the nation will be the same.  The purpose is to maintain the real value of incomes as distinct from nominal increases which in the absence of Government action would be further eroded by inflation.  If people insist on maintaining all the terms of the national pay agreement intact it will simply not be possible for the Exchequer to meet the increased cost of today's package of proposals plus the cost of implementing in full the national pay agreement.  To try to do both would only add to inflationary pressures and make a difficult situation worse.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special pay increases</i>
    </P>
    <P>A particular difficulty, which has been the cause of anxious concern to the Government, arises in regard to pay increases and other improvements in conditions of employment over and above the standard increases of the national agreements.</P>
    <P>It would, in the Government's view, heighten social tensions and cause serious inequity if particular groups <Col N="1951" /> were to get special extra increases at a time when workers generally are being asked to accept restraint.  Furthermore, as we know, some firms have already indicated that they may not be able to pay even the standard increases of the 1975 agreement.</P>
    <P>The plain facts are that, in our present circumstances, any group can secure special increases only at the expense of others and that those most secure in their jobs are in the best position to press sectional claims.  The Government consider it crucial, as part of the fight to slow inflation and protect jobs, that any modification of the standard increases of the 1975 National Agreement should be accompanied by an embargo on special increases.  This will, no doubt, be covered in the forthcoming Employer-Labour Conference discussions and it is the Government's earnest hope that, in the national interest, the parties will be able to reach quick agreement on this provision.</P>
    <P>Pending these discussions and in view of the urgency, the Government have decided that, within their own direct area&mdash;which includes the civil service, local authority and health services, teachers, Army and Garda&mdash;no further special improvements of any kind in pay or conditions will be approved as from today, except in accordance with a finding already made&mdash;or to be made shortly in a case where the hearing has been completed&mdash;by one of the public service arbitration boards or by the Labour Court itself, or where at conciliation there has been a firm and unconditional offer not related to changes in the employment concerned.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention that all other public sector employers should act in a similar manner and Ministers will be in touch with these bodies.  In the meantime, I must ask them to take this statement as Government policy and, accordingly, not make any improvement in pay or conditions except in accordance with a finding already made by the Labour Court itself&mdash;or to be made shortly in a case where the court's hearing has been completed&mdash;or where at conciliation <Col N="1952" /> there has been a firm and unconditional offer not related to changes in the employment concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Trends in Government Expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>Public expenditure has been rising at a rapid rate in recent years to meet unavoidable increases in existing services and to provide much needed improvements.  This is a matter for concern.  The exceptional inflationary conditions of the past year or two have given an added impetus to this rise, but the underlying upward trend has persisted for the past decade or more and continues to add pressures on taxation and borrowing fronts.  Exchequer financing at high levels leads to undue pre-emption of available national resources to the detriment of the private sector.  In so far as this trend has been a feature of the public capital programme it can be more easily tolerated because of the extent to which total national investment, and through it capacity to repay, derives directly or indirectly from the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>It is in relation to non-capital expenditure, however, that the overrapid rate of growth is particularly worrying.  It is this that gives rise to budget deficits on current account which have to be met by borrowing.</P>
    <P>Moreover, non-capital expenditure is mainly used to defray the costs of on-going services, which, though often laudable, do not create lasting assets of a productive nature.  A large part of this expenditure is devoted to social services such as health, housing and social welfare payments.  The demand for such services is so high and their cost so sensitive to the effects of inflation that it is essential to ensure that they and, indeed, all other non-capital expenditures are kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>The Government intend, therefore, to adopt a policy of moderation in regard to non-capital expenditure generally in order to conserve scarce resources for productive purposes. The naïve notion that all can be provided by the State if enough clamour is generated will have to be replaced by a patient realisation that nothing more can be provided until extra <Col N="1953" /> resources become available.  Desirable improvements or extensions of existing services, or the introduction of new services, will have to be shelved until the present economic difficulties have been overcome and resources once more become available to meet additional costs.  Existing expenditures are being reviewed to identify those that might be curtailed or eliminated. Such expenditures would, for example, include those which are no longer appropriate because of changes in the circumstances which gave rise to their introduction in the first instance or because of changes since then in the circumstances of the sectors or groups of individuals who benefit from them. Consideration will also be given to making realistic charges for public services which are either provided free at present or are charged for at uneconomic rates.  This may involve a review of the pricing policies of some State bodies.  Exchequer subsidies to various bodies which should more appropriately be supported from other sources will also be looked at critically. In general, all low-priority services, particularly those which have a small or negligible employment content, will be reviewed to see what economies can be achieved.</P>
    <P>As a further measure to control the excessive growth of non-capital expenditures, strict observance of budgetary limits will be insisted upon.  This will mean in the case of openended grant schemes, for example, that when the annual budgetary allocation has been exhausted further expenditure will, in general, be deferred to the next budget period.</P>
    <P>The Government will maintain as high a level of expenditure on the public capital programme as is possible in the light of the available resources.  The first priority will continue to be investment which creates permanent and self-sustaining employment. While every effort will be made to maintain a high level of social investment, expenditure on industrial, agricultural and infrastructural investment will have first call on scarce capital resources because <Col N="1954" /> this kind of investment is a pre-condition of growth.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Government measures</i>
    </P>
    <P>I now propose to outline the measures which the Government have decided to take to deal with the situation. Further details will be made available when I have concluded my statement.</P>
    <P>These measures must be viewed as a whole, rather than by reference to the particular efficacy of individual components of the package.  If inflation is to be defeated, any attack on it must comprise two related elements: first, steps to break the &ldquo;inflationary mentality&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, measures to convince people that there is nothing inevitable about the continued rise in prices&mdash;and second, the more specific measures which will ensure a gradual winding-down of the inflationary spiral.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Reduction of Consumer Price Index</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have therefore decided to</P>
    <P>&mdash;increase the subsidy to CIE in order to reduce fares to their level before 12th May last; this will mean that fares can be reduced by an average of 25 per cent.  The amount of the reduction in any particular fare will, of course, depend on the amount by which it was increased in May.</P>
    <P>&mdash;subsidise the price of bread by 5½ per loaf of 800 grams and of flour by 4½p a kilo</P>
    <P>&mdash;subsidise the price of butter by 10p a lb.</P>
    <P>&mdash;subsidise the price of milk by 2p a pint</P>
    <P>&mdash;reduce the price of town gas by 12½p per cent and</P>
    <P>&mdash;remove VAT from electricity, gas, all fuels except road fuels, and clothing, clothing materials and footwear.</P>
    <P>The bread subsidy will absorb an increase of 1½p which otherwise would shortly come into effect.  The subsidies will be brought into effect as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made.  The VAT reliefs will take effect on and from 1st July, 1975.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1955" /> The net effect of all these measures will, it is expected, be to reduce the rise in the Consumer Price Index by four percentage points or more.  By this means, the Government hope to break the fatalistic expectations of continuing inflation which in present circumstances can too easily become self-fulfilling.  The Government expect these very significant price reductions to be transmitted into a winding-down of the inflationary process through a revision of the current National Pay Agreement.</P>
    <P>The measures chosen are designed to give the maximum possible assistance to those who, relatively speaking, have to spend much more of their disposable income than others on the staple foods and who have been hardest hit by the rise in fuel prices.  Additionally, of course, as I announced in my Budget Statement last January, all weekly social welfare and related health allowance payments will be increased from the beginning of October in line with the increase in the cost of living since last April.  The removal of VAT from clothing and footwear will also be a significant aid to the maintenance of living standards, as well as giving assistance to that section of Irish industry that has suffered most from the recession during the last twelve months.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employment Premium</i>
    </P>
    <P>Another main aim of the Government is to stimulate employment especially when it can result in the production of marketable goods and services.  I say this because to create employment in uneconomic activities, or in &ldquo;make-work&rdquo; programmes, would merely help to undermine further the long-term competitive position of the economy and ensure that our ultimate situation would be even worse.  An essential requirement in present circumstances, therefore, is to introduce a measure which will avoid these dangers while instilling confidence in manufacturers so that they can be ready to avail themselves of the opportunities that will arise as soon as the upturn appears.</P>
    <P>The main brunt of the increase in <Col N="1956" /> unemployment during the past twelve months has been borne by manufacturing industry, which has, in consequence, a considerable amount of spare capacity. At the same time, the productive capacity and potential of those who are unemployed is being wasted at great loss to the country as well as to themselves.  While a basic objective of the combination of measures I am announcing is to provide a substantial stimulus to employment generally, the Government consider that special and direct action is necessary in the case of manufacturing industry to provide employers in that sector with an extra incentive to re-employ workers who have been laid off in the recent past.</P>
    <P>The Government have therefore decided to introduce with effect from 27th June, 1975, until 30th June, 1976, a temporary scheme of employment premia for manufacturing industry other than some highly seasonal food processing operations.  This will subsidise employers who recruit from the Live Register net additions to their full-time work force.  Up to 31st March, 1976, the premium will be at the rate of £12 a week for each additional worker employed; from 1st April, 1976 to 30th June, 1976, it will be £6 a week.  Employers will not be chargeable to tax in respect of the premium payments and legislation to provide for this will be introduced in good time.</P>
    <P>The scheme, to be known as the Premium Employment Programme, should make both the re-employment of workers and the creation of new jobs an attractive proposition in cost terms.  Employers who can take up spare capacity in this way will obviously be in a position to respond quickly and smoothly to the expansion of their markets as world conditions improve.  The Government expect, therefore, that a significant number of extra jobs will be created in a short time.  Because of the many imponderable factors involved I am unable to give an estimate of the cost of this entirely new scheme.  To the extent to which it is successful, however, expenditure on the premia should be offset by a reduction in social welfare costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1957" /> Further details of this scheme will be circulated when I conclude and the Minister for Labour, whose Department will administer the scheme, will make a further statement as soon as possible on its operation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Footwear Industry</i>
    </P>
    <P>In addition to bringing unemployed workers back into employment, it is equally important that existing employment be preserved wherever possible. As I mentioned earlier, there are certain sectors of manufacturing industry which are finding it difficult to maintain production and employment. The most seriously affected as regards unemployment is the footwear industry. A further approach has recently been made to the EEC Commission with a view to the adoption of immediate arrangements which will enable the flow of imports of footwear to be regulated in the interest of employment in the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stimulus to capital expenditures</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1975 public capital programme was settled last January at a level which, together with other Government policies, was designed to assist in achieving the twin objectives of maintaining living standards and preserving employment.  In February last, as a further boost to the construction industry, local authorities were authorised to spend on their housing programmes an extra £7 million, of which £3 million was provided through an increase in the public capital programme. This ensured the provision of 1,000 additional jobs.  In their current examination of the economic situation, the Government have decided to give a further stimulus to employment and to demand generally by adding over £27 million more to the public capital programme.  This brings the total of the programme for 1975 to £490 million, an increase of 27 per cent on the 1974-75 figure.  The main components are Housing £10.5 million, Telephones £8 million, Industry £5.2 million and Agriculture £3.4 million. The £5.2 million extra for industry goes to Fóir Teoranta (£4 million) and Gaeltarra Éireann (£1.2 million).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1958" />
      <i>Construction and house purchase</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government recognise the importance of the building and construction industry in any strategy to sustain and stimulate the economy, both because of the relatively short &lsquo;start-up&rsquo; time often involved and because of its relatively low import content.  Housing, in particular, has been a priority area of concern to this Government from the outset.  Of the additional £10.5 million now being provided for housing, £9 million will be devoted to additional local authority loans for private housing and £1.5 million to private housing grants.  The total Exchequer allocation for local authority house purchase loan schemes this year is thus increased to £46.5 million, which should be sufficient to finance mortgages for about 11,000 houses.</P>
    <P>The additional provision for housing in 1975 will ensure a continuation of the Government's housing programme and its impact should be felt throughout the country.  Roughly, 2,000 additional jobs should directly result in the house-building sector, together with an increased demand in the industries which manufacture and supply building materials.  Since the schemes now being allocated additional funds are already in being, this increase should take effect with a minimum of delay.</P>
    <P>A refreshing development has been the recovery in the inflow of funds to the building societies.  In the first five months of the current year, the net inflow was £20 million compared with £7 million in the same period of 1974.  In the first quarter, loan approvals were up 50 per cent on the first three months of 1974.  Given a continuance of these trends, the societies' contribution to financing the housing programme will be well in excess of last year's £40 million, another £15 million or thereabouts.</P>
    <P>In view of the major importance of a prosperous construction industry and the need to maintain the housing programme, I am particularly pleased to inform the House that the major Associated Banks have indicated their willingness to make available £40 million over the next two years for <Col N="1959" /> house purchase loans.  Discussions are being held with the banks and a further announcement will be made as soon as the details of the scheme have been settled.  The banks' move has the approval of the Central Bank. It demonstrates in a positive manner the desire of the banks to assist in the solution of our current difficulties and the Government welcome it for that reason.</P>
    <P>Concomitant with the stimulus being received by the construction industry from the Government, the building societies and the banks, it is appropriate to rationalise in some degree the financial apparatus that underpins it.</P>
    <P>For some considerable time now, the rate of interest charged on advances from the Local Loans Fund to local authorities for the house purchase loan schemes has been below the average rate at which the Exchequer can borrow for the purpose of issues to the Fund.  At the same time, the period of 35 years allowed for the repayment of such loans has been in excess of that normally allowed by building societies and other lenders such as insurance companies.  The Government have decided that these loans should be brought more into line with current lending terms in other sectors.</P>
    <P>As from today, therefore, interest on new advances from the Local Loans Fund to local authorities for these loans will be increased from 10 per cent a year to 11 per cent and the repayment period will be reduced from 35 to 30 years.  As a consequence, the normal interest rate of loans to new borrowers will be increased from 10½ per cent to 11½ per cent a year.  For those who avail of the maximum loan of £4,500, the net additional charge to the borrower will be approximately 75p per week income tax relief at 26 per cent on interest payments is taken into account.  The change in the Local Loans Fund rate will result in extra non-tax revenue of about £0.4 million annually.  The effect this year will be nominal.</P>
    <P>The building societies have been in receipt of an Exchequer subvention since May, 1973.  This subvention, which is due to expire on 30th June, <Col N="1960" /> 1975, amounts at present to one percentage point of the societies' shares and deposits and enables them to offer a rate of 8 per cent to investors while charging a mortgage rate of 11¼ per cent.  The Government have decided to extend the subvention beyond 30th June, 1975.  However, the decision to increase the rate of interest on local authority house purchase loans to 11½ per cent makes it necessary to consider the present rate of subvention which, if continued unchanged, would give borrowers from building societies an interest rate advantage of ¼ per cent over local authority borrowers.  The Government have decided, therefore, to reduce the subvention from 1 per cent to ¾ per cent with effect from 1st August.  The cost to the Exchequer of extending the subvention to 31st December next will be about £1.1 million, none of which will fall due for payment in 1975 because the subvention is paid six-monthly in arrears.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Personal income tax surcharge</i>
    </P>
    <P>I stated earlier that the present situation demanded collective and individual action to cope with the problems. This cannot be painless and it is only equitable that the relatively better-off should be called upon to make some temporary financial sacrifice.  The Government have accordingly decided that, as from the current income tax year, 1975-76, a 10 per cent surcharge will be imposed on income tax paid by individuals which is charged at rates of 35 per cent and upwards on taxable income.  For example, in the case of the 35 per cent rate, the effect of the surcharge will be to increase that rate to the equivalent of 38.5 per cent.  Taxable income is gross income less the various allowances and reliefs to which a taxpayer is entitled, and income tax is charged at an increasing rate on each successive slice of taxable income. The surcharge will not apply to tax on the first £1,550 of taxable income, which is chargeable at 26 per cent and, therefore, individuals whose total taxable income in 1975-76 does not exceed £1,550 will not pay any surcharge. As a further contribution to arresting downward trends in production and employment, the Government have decided that companies should be excluded from the surcharge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1961" /> The effect of the surcharge in 1975-76 can be illustrated.  An individual with taxable income between £1,550 and £4,350 will pay additional tax ranging from zero to a maximum of £98.  With taxable income between £4,350 and £6,350, he will pay a maximum of £188; between £6,350 and £8,350, the maximum is £298; while from £8,350 to £10,350 it is £428. Over £10,350, the cumulative effect of the surcharge will depend on the amount of taxable income.  I would like to give an illustration which may help to avoid any misunderstanding, accidental or deliberate.  A married man with two children would not, for example, be affected by the surcharge if his gross income did not exceed £2,930 and if his income exceeds that figure the surcharge will apply only to the excess and not to any portion of his income up to £2,930.  The estimated yield to the Exchequer from the surcharge is £8 million in 1975.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Changeover to PAYE by employees not yet covered</i>
    </P>
    <P>When PAYE was introduced in 1960 it was not extended to groups which had been subject to a separate statutory tax deduction scheme since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Those concerned are civil servants, national teachers, army, gardaí, industrial workers employed by the State, members of the Oireachtas, judges, public service pensioners as well as employees and pensioners of the Central Bank of Ireland, Dublin Port and Docks Board, the Commissioners of Irish Lights, the Representative Church Body and employees recruited by the Bank of Ireland prior to amalgamation with the National and Hibernian Banks.  These are assessed to income tax by reference to their earnings in the preceding year.</P>
    <P>The scheme of PAYE was brought into effect in 1960 to facilitate the general body of taxpayers by providing machinery for regular tax deductions from current earnings and also to improve the collection machinery for an important source of revenue for the Exchequer.  At that time, there was no expectation of money incomes increasing at the rate they are increasing <Col N="1962" /> today, so no question arose as to the equity of assessing the majority of employees on a current year basis and the rest on a preceding year basis.  There can, however, be no doubt that, whatever the position may have been in 1960, nowadays, when large general increases in money incomes occur at frequent intervals, individuals assessed to income tax on a preceding year basis enjoy an advantage over taxpayers under PAYE.</P>
    <P>The Government have accordingly decided that equity requires that this situation should not continue and that all remuneration at present outside the scope of PAYE should be brought within the system.  The changeover will, however, involve considerable preparatory work by the Revenue Commissioners and by the accounts branches of public departments and of other employers affected by the change.  Some idea of the size of the task may be gauged from the fact that there are over 100,000 taxpayers involved. Furthermore, the current work-load on the revenue machinery involves dealing with nearly threequarters of a million individual income taxpayers.  It is intended, however, that all employees will be brought within the PAYE system as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Value-added tax reliefs</i>
    </P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, the Government have decided that, with effect on and from 1 July 1975, the zero rate of VAT will be applied to the following categories of goods which are at present subject to the 6.75 per cent tax rate:</P>
    <P>(a)  clothing and clothing materials and footwear</P>
    <P>(b)  electricity and heating fuels generally. </P>
    <P>The removal of VAT from these commodities will result in an estimated loss of revenue of £8.2 million in 1975.  Because of the two-monthly accounting system for VAT the 1975 figure represents only a 4 months' loss of revenue.  So far as consumers are concerned, however, the removal of VAT will operate from 1st July.</P>
    <P>The success of these measures will <Col N="1963" /> depend on traders responding to them by price reductions which will fully match the tax being removed.  The Department of Industry and Commerce will ensure that customers will get the full benefit of the relief in reduced prices.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Revised deficit</i>
    </P>
    <P>I will now summarise the budgetary position consequent on the measures I have announced.</P>
    <P>The deficit on the current budget last January was £125.3 million.  Additional current expenditure by Departments of £76 million and the provision of a further £10 million for servicing of the public debt, which I have already adverted to, bring the deficit to £211.3 million before taking account of the package.  The net Exchequer cost of the package this year is £20 million. This takes account of the direct additional costs of the subsidies (£18.5 million), VAT reductions (£8.2 million) and of offsets from the Income Tax surcharge (£8 million) and other factors such as expected reductions in public expenditure consequential on the package.  As I have already stated, tax revenue today is running well below that expected in January&mdash;so much so that I consider it prudent to trim the January post-budget estimate of total revenue by £11 million.  I might add that even this reduced estimate allows for some improvement in tax revenue receipts which could not be expected to take place in the absence of today's package.  This leaves the revised current budget deficit at £241.6 million or £116.3 million greater than in the January budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Resources</i>
    </P>
    <P>Taking account of all the adjustments made, the revised capital budget requirement comes to some £786 million as compared with a figure of £649 million in my January Budget.  To this figure must be added some £38 million extra required to finance the placing of agricultural products in intervention.  The additional amount is required mainly due to worsening market conditions and also to the unforseen necessity to take milk-powder into intervention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1964" /> Total requirements therefore come to £824 million as compared with £649 million in January.  On the resources side, sales of Government securities on the Irish market have been very buoyant, showing investors' belief in the underlying strength of the economy, and I think I could now reasonably expect some £40 million more from that source this year than I expected in January.  In addition, I can expect an increase of £15 million from sales of securities to the commercial banks, arising from an increase in the level of current and deposit accounts in these institutions, but I must take account of an expected reduction in payments from the European Regional Development Fund.  The net effect of all these changes is to put the residual financing requirement for 1975 at £372 million.</P>
    <P>The commercial banks have accepted, following consultations with the Central Bank, that it is appropriate that moneys for intervention purposes should be provided through the banking system and have already agreed to provide £58 million for this purpose, being the amount advanced by the Exchequer for this purpose to 31st December last.  Discussions are now being opened with them on the additional £38 million required in the current year.  On the assumption that this amount will also be forthcoming, this would leave a balance of some £276 million to be raised to finance Exchequer requirements this year.  A large part of this will clearly have to come from external borrowing, some of which has been secured or is being arranged.  In my Financial Statement in January last I stressed the danger of relying too much on such borrowing for the financing of public expenditure. While I feel that a reasonable amount of external borrowing is justified, I have some hopes that part of the residual requirements may be raised at home without recourse to external markets.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the Central Bank, in its last Annual Report, stated that on the basis of substantial adherence to the then budgetary dispositions, it considered it appropriate to help in financing the Exchequer borrowing requirements. It is proposed to have further discussions with the Bank in the <Col N="1965" /> light of the revised dispositions which the Government consider necessary in present circumstances.  The Central Bank will, moreover, be reviewing its credit policy next month in the light of the Government's present measures and of the desirability of ensuring that monetary policy contributes effectively to the achievement of the overall aims of reducing inflation and promoting economic growth.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Savings</i>
    </P>
    <P>It has been suggested that national savings would be increased if index-linked savings schemes were to be introduced.  In speaking on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill on 16th April last, I warned of the danger of believing that general indexation is the cure for our troubles.  It is illusory to believe that a country can enable itself to pay higher prices for imported goods by increasing individuals' incomes by amounts sufficient to cover imported costs.  That process compounds inflation; it certainly does not compensate for it.  As any general scheme of index-linked savings would have to be matched by index-linked interest charges to borrowers, thereby fuelling inflation, indexation must be carefully limited.</P>
    <P>There is however, one area in which I think it socially desirable that an index-linked scheme of limited application should be introduced.  I refer particularly to the savings of our older citizens, who usually like to have a small nest-egg to provide for contingencies.  I propose, therefore, to introduce a scheme of savings indexation limited both as to those who may participate and as to the total extent of their participation.  I am also considering a limited scheme of indexation, related to the National Instalment-Savings Scheme, confined to those who are prepared to set their savings aside for a minimum fixed period of time.  I hope to be in a position to announce particulars at a very early date.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sterling link</i>
    </P>
    <P>It has been suggested of late, with increasing frequency, that exchange rate adjustment and particularly the breaking of the link with sterling offers a way out of our problems.  It is <Col N="1966" /> important that the public should not be distracted from the task of tackling inflation now by the chimera of instant salvation through the exchange rate. Whatever advantages there might be, in certain circumstances, in a severance of the sterling link, they could not be attained unless we first of all effectively tackled the current malaise of domestic inflation.</P>
    <P>A high rate of inflation in our main trading partner undoubtedly contributes to our own intolerable inflation. Given a one-for-one link with sterling, our inflation rate will, in the long run, relate to the British rate. The fact is, however, that for some years now our inflation rate has been faster than the British rate and it should, irrespective of any other considerations, be possible by domestic policy alone to reduce our rate below that of Britain over a similar period.</P>
    <P>It would be illusory, however, to think that we have much scope for manoeuvre as regards exchange rate variation.  Anyone who is tempted to think otherwise might with profit study the comments in the recent NESC report on inflation.  It is only by embarking on a programme of regular upward revaluation against sterling that we could hope to insulate ourselves from this particular source of inflation. I do not hold any objections of principle to this course, but I am bound to point out some severe limitations on its immediate practicability.  First, the immediate effect of a revaluation would be to make Irish industry less, not more, competitive, with immediate and widespread results in unemployment.  Second, for this and other reasons it would simply not be credible to attempt a revaluation until domestic policies to curb inflation and improve competitiveness had been implemented and were seen to be working.  I might point out, moreover, that the alternative to a link with sterling could be a link with another major currency, which in present circumstances would impose an even more severe deflationary discipline on the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Even if conditions were such that exchange rate adjustment could be contemplated, this would not of itself ensure that our inflation rate would improve. <Col N="1967" /> All it would do, if successful, would be to help to insulate the economy from imported inflation.  It would be as necessary as ever to ensure that domestic economic policies and developments contributed to reducing inflation, not increasing it.  The Government have, therefore, concluded that a change in our existing currency arrangement could not in present conditions be relied upon to make any worth-while contribution to the solution of our economic problems.</P>
    <P>In quite a different climate it could be worth while to review our exchange rate arrangement but any change would have to be, and be seen to be, the result of sound judgment to maintain and improve a healthy economy.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Future developments</i>
    </P>
    <P>Action cannot stop with this package of measures.  Once the counterattack on inflation has started, with the winding-down of the price/wage spiral, the momentum must be carried forward.  We must already start looking ahead to the next national pay agreement, negotiations on which will in any event be starting in the autumn. We must avoid becoming the victims of inflation-making procedures of our own devising.  The form, duration and content of the next National Agreement will require the most careful consideration to ensure that it carries forward the anti-inflation momentum started today.  The Government will take steps to bring the implications of national economic priorities to the forefront of these negotiations.  At the least, it is now beyond question that any form of pay indexation in future National Agreements must not be linked to changes in prices brought about by tax increases needed to protect the deprived sections of the community against inflation.  A clear acceptance of this principle by the negotiating parties should be forthcoming; I do not think this can be regarded as an unreasonable request in the circumstances of our time.  It may prove desirable to formalise this position, but I would hope that the spirit of national partnership and the sense of national responsibility which, I know, informs the parties to national agreements, <Col N="1968" /> would make this unnecessary.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Medium-term outlook</i>
    </P>
    <P>The measures outlined above are designed as a short-term approach to the problems of inflation and stagnation. They are intended merely as temporary measures to get the economy moving on a path of growth with reducing inflation.  In particular, we do not regard the taxation, subsidisation or employment premium measures as being needed&mdash;or, indeed sustainable&mdash; for more than a very limited period of time.  There is the danger, however, that the solution they produce could be short-lived unless supported by policies over the medium term ahead aimed at maintaining the confidence restored, the stability regained and the renewed growth in the economy.  This stabilisation programme must be succeeded, therefore, by an effective strategy for medium-term growth which takes full account of the problems affecting us and embodies the changes required to ensure that they do not persist or reappear.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions, I have stated that I did not then regard it as opportune to publish a formal national plan, mainly because of the global economic uncertainty and prevailing inflation rates.  It scarcely needs pointing out in current circumstances that talk of solving current economic problems by formulating a &ldquo;plan&rdquo; is futile unless the plan includes steps to control inflation. Without a stabilisation policy for abating inflation, an economic &ldquo;plan&rdquo; would simply not be credible. With this economic package under way, however, we can prepare a plan for recovery and growth.  In doing so we shall have to consider how, over the medium term, we can redress the damage to our growth potential caused by the inflation to date and the world recession which may hopefully soon begin to ease.  In the past, planning concerned itself mainly with the policies necessary to increase employment and incomes; it tended to take for granted that the consequential increases in Government expenditure&mdash; which are high in the Irish economy given the lead role of the public sector &mdash;could be financed without great difficulty and it more or less assumed away <Col N="1969" /> the inflationary problems arising from the demands for income redistribution. Any future plan will have to be firmly grounded on realistic assessments of resources and on realistic programmes of public expenditure, both current and capital.  It will also have to deal explicitly with the inflationary side-effects.</P>
    <P>Previous plans did not, in practice, succeed in achieving the acceptance of the results for taxation and savings of the planned distribution of growth among the various needs and demands &mdash;investment, social welfare, government expenditure generally and wages and profits.  The past few years should have taught us that a plan is futile unless the community accept the redistribution involved without seeking compensation through income increases. Any medium-term perspective must spell out the cost, in terms of added taxation and demands unsatisfied, that is necessary for the achievement of its objectives, and the discipline involved in terms of income distribution policies over the medium term must be accepted by the social partners.  Otherwise it is doomed to failure.</P>
    <P>We must grapple immediately with a key element in the development of a medium-term strategy, namely, the role of public expenditure over the next few years.  The Government have before them projections of public expenditure for the years 1976 to 1979 inclusive.  The kind of inflationary conditions we are at present experiencing makes multi-annual budgeting a more uncertain and difficult undertaking than it would be in more stable conditions.  However, the Government hope to take decisions shortly on the broad outlines of expenditure and on an order of priorities for those years having due regard to the estimates of likely resources and the choice of objectives which can be achieved.  Any such attempt will be fruitless unless we first create an economic environment in which we as a community are in a position to make choices instead of having them forced upon us.  It is essential that the discipline inherent in the economic package I have presented today should be accepted by all sections of the community. There are substantial rewards <Col N="1970" /> to be gained from such discipline.  Its rejection would condemn us to economic decline and social upheaval which would imperil the very intitutions on which our existence as a free democratic nation depends.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Effects of the package</i>
    </P>
    <P>The package of measures which I have today presented to the House is one of the most significant ever produced by a Minister for Finance of this State.  It should be clear that my primary purpose is to secure an immediate and significant reduction in the rate of price increase.  I am confident that the social partners will recognise that this action alone would be worthless without a matching response on their part.  If this is forthcoming then today's measures will represent a major step towards breaking, or at least winding-down, the inflationary spiral in which our economy is trapped.</P>
    <P>The immediate effect of the subsidies and tax reductions will be to reduce the rise in the cost of living for the average household and therefore the consumer price index by four percentage points.  Before these measures, the prospects were for a price rise of the order of 24 per cent by the end of the year; now, provided there are no untoward developments in external prices, we can hope that prices will not rise by more than 20 per cent.  This is still, of course, an excessive figure but no one will disagree that we will be moving in the right direction.  The longer-term benefits could be of greater significance. Instead of a steadily worsening and increasingly demoralising flight to higher and higher levels of inflation, we have now the opportunity to bring our price rise to a tolerable level. There should be no doubt that the Government's measures depend for their success on the full co-operation of all sections of the community, and that includes the Opposition.  It is my earnest hope that this will be forthcoming. If the spirit of partnership, which the Government are seeking, prevails, then we can look forward with confidence to a steady, even if not dramatic, improvement in our economic situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1971" /> While the achievement of a reduction in our rate of inflation is unquestionably a pre-condition for continuing progress on the employment front, the Government have not been content to concentrate all their fire on inflation.  While the economic environment has radically altered&mdash;for the worse unfortunately in the world&mdash; since the Government entered into their commitment to maintain employment and preserve living standards, we have no intention of reneging on this commitment.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Government's measure is, therefore, two-fold in nature.  Priority is being accorded to tackling the problem of inflation and to stimulating economic activity.  The stimulus provided by my January budget has, in the light of subsequent developments beyond our control or prediction both at home and abroad, proved inadequate.  There is, as mentioned in my Department's publication, &ldquo;Review of 1974 and Present Outlook&mdash;June, 1975&rdquo; a very real possibility that the volume of national output this year will, in fact, be lower than in 1974.  The fall in output in the first half of the year was so marked that the rise expected in the second half could well be insufficient to offset it.</P>
    <P>The need for a further stimulus to growth is, therefore, clear.  The Government's measures, I am confident, meet this need.</P>
    <P>The elements of the package have been carefully chosen with a view to producing the greatest possible benefit to domestic employment.  While estimates of the employment effects are difficult, because of the lags involved before some of the measures take effect and of uncertainty about the response to the premium employment programme, we are hopeful that these measures will have the effect of raising employment over the next year by 15,000 to 20,000 more than it would otherwise have been.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is essential that the discipline inherent in the economic package I have presented today should be accepted by all sections of the community. <Col N="1972" /> There are substantial rewards to be gained from such discipline.  Its rejection would condemn us to considerable human misery as a consequence of economic decline and social upheaval. Its rejection would imperil the very institutions on which our existence as a nation depends.  This debacle can be avoided by our joint resolve as a people to act reasonably in the most severe economic conditions to threaten this State since she achieved independence 54 years ago.</P>
    <P>If we persevere in the course which we now set, the journey to recovery will not be unduly long or onerous. The goal of a return to economic growth and real improvements in living standards is surely worth the discipline which the Government are seeking.</P>
    <P>Government action alone cannot ensure that jobs will be provided and preserved or that the wild horses of inflation will be harnessed and brought under control.  They need the assistance and co-operation of all sections of our people, workers, trade unionists and management, farmers, businessmen and professional men. Every man, woman and child in this country has a vested interest in having inflation brought under control as quickly as possible.  The package being offered by the Government is not and cannot be a one-sided bargain. It involves the principle of &ldquo;give and take&rdquo; and this principle must be recognised and accepted by all if the package is to succeed.  This is neither the time nor place for the &ldquo;I'm all right, Jack&rdquo; mentality or for pressing sectional interests.  The crisis affects us all and the plain truth is summed up in the sean-fhocal &ldquo;Ar scáth a chéile is ea a mhaireann na daoine&rdquo; and the same sentiment is echoed in G.P. Morris's oftenquoted phrase&rdquo; United we stand, divided we fall&rdquo;.  Leaving aside all considerations of patriotism and consideration for others, enlightened self-interest and common sense, which do not move everybody, should make us all recognise that the only way out of our current dilemma is to cooperate fully with the programme for economic recovery announced here today.</P>

      <P>It makes a change to hear this Coalition Government acknowledge just how serious the situation is.  Even more, it makes a change to hear them propose to take some steps which, however ineffectual and belated, are designed to tackle the problem we are facing.  The picture with which we are faced is frightening.  The Minister for Finance has painted in a number of the details, but he did not paint them all in.  It would take him far too long to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment our economy is in the most dire straits.  Inflation is virtually out of control.  Unemployment, <Col N="1977" /> already at unprecedented heights, is rising.  The volume of retail sales is down.  The volume of our industrial exports on which we have lived for so long and based our growth is practically static.  Our balance of payments deficit is at a dangerously high level and held in control for only one reason&mdash;because of the downturn in our economy.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, which went through so much under this Government, is now facing an even worse situation.  The situation in the cattle industry is grim. As the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has acknowledged, there has been a disastrous fall in the utilisation of fertilisers.  All this adds up to long-term loss.</P>
    <P>As the Minister indicated, there is not only no growth in our economy, but there is a contraction&mdash;it is getting smaller.  Now, at last, the Coalition Government, with which this country is saddled, acknowledge that inflation is our major problem.  Unless inflation is tackled effectively all other problems, especially unemployment, will get worse.  Already inflation here has cost thousands of jobs because it has priced out of the market goods produced in factories here, whether sold at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>If you put yourself in the shoes of a foreign investor and take a look at what is happening here because of inflation, the heights to which it has been allowed to go and the effects that has had on wage rates, would you seriously consider setting up a business here so long as that kind of thing is allowed to go on?  It would be cheaper to set up your operation in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>Inflation has also caused grave hardship to old people on fixed incomes and pensions.  As I said in this House before, inflation is the greatest force there is for the redistribution of wealth in the wrong way&mdash;making the poor poorer.  Of course, none of this news to anyone, except the members of that Government.</P>
    <P>The pattern of this Government's actions up to now, apart from their words, and it is their actions that count most, has been a total disregard of the <Col N="1978" /> inflationary effects of the increased taxation they have imposed, of the price rises they have allowed for Government services, of the large budget deficits for unproductive purposes&mdash;and these deficits were, in the main produced because of political weakness and not for economic reasons&mdash;of the inflationary effects of excessive Government borrowing and the cost of servicing the national debt.  All these things have been totally ignored by this Government. To listen to the Minister for Finance today one would think that this was a new problem which had suddenly hit him and that he, or any of his colleagues, had no responsibility for the situation in which we now find ourselves.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, on this sombre day, I might be permitted to introduce a little note of light relief by quoting a very eminent economic expert, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who defined in this House what an inflationary budget was.  As reported at columns 127 and 128 of the Official Report of 28th April, 1970, he said:</P>
    <P>...what is illegitimate and irresponsible is to produce a budget which, far from having even a small surplus, is likely to produce a deficit and which will inflate the economy further.  In simple terms, the Government have lashed out £22 million in extra expenditure and increased taxation by a net £12½ million.</P>
    <P>That is what an inflationary budget means.  It is a budget on which decisions taken by the Minister involve increasing expenditure more than increasing income.</P>
    <P>As I say, I introduced that merely for light relief.  It is not a situation really for light relief.  All of these inflationary factors for which the Government were directly responsible, and which they totally ignored, were pointed out by us at the time of the Coalition's first budget and consistently ever since. We were not just preaching.  I would remind the House that we practised what we preached.  In our last budget we imposed no new taxes while giving substantial income tax relief and social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1979" /> Our objections, consistently expressed, were dismissed from the other side of the House and in certain other quarters as being either sour grapes, ignorance of economics, or sabotaging the national interest.  I would suggest that it can now be seen clearly which side of this House understood economics and who was serving the national interest.  For far too long this Coalition have tried to blame oil prices and world trading conditions for what has been happening here.  They pretended they could do nothing about inflation.  Of course, most of our competitors who are dealing with the same increases in oil prices and the same difficulties in world trading conditions have inflationary rates between one quarter and one half of our inflationary rate.  The difference is that their Government tackled inflation.  Our Government made it grow, deliberately and for short term political advantage.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Minister for Finance can be very well documented and I propose for the record to quote some things stated by the Minister for Finance in connection with the budgets of 1973, 1974 and their first budget of 1975.  They all illustrate what I might call the confidence trick attitude that has been expressed by the Minister and his colleagues consistently up to now.  Speaking in this House on 16th May, 1973, as reported at column 1286 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Everybody's prospects are being substantially improved by the growth in economic activity resulting from the massive injection of a 27 per cent increase in public capital expenditure and the expansionary effects of this budget.  There are new opportunities for investment in an expanding economy which is being prudently managed.</P>
    <P>On 3rd April, 1974, in connection with the next budget, as reported at column 1460 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the Government have decided to provide a further boost for the economy in the current budget, on top of that arising <Col N="1980" /> from the level of the public capital programme, by not increasing taxation to cover the deficit. The injection of additional purchasing power into the economy, through the opening deficit, the income tax reliefs and the social welfare benefits, is expected to raise the national output, over what it would otherwise be, by one percentage point in this calendar year and by one-and-a-half percentage points in the 12 months to March, 1975.  Increased economic growth will, as it did last year, generate additional revenue and reduce the deficit.</P>
    <P>My budget today has three main aims.</P>
    <P>The economic aim this year&mdash;as it was last year&mdash;is to promote growth and ensure that the economy operates at a level close to full utilisation of capacity.</P>
    <P>One has to listen to and read these extracts in the context of what is happening in the country.</P>

      <P>In January of this year, speaking on the budget which he introduced then, as reported at column 243 of the Official Report of 15th January, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The tax adjustments and the allocation of increased funds to stimulate employment, production and demand, qualify this budget for the description &ldquo;carefully expansionary&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Six months ago he said that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken only a few examples.  There are many others. They indicate the tone of what was being said by the Minister and all his colleagues.  That was as late as six months ago and then we have the picture presented today, a much truer picture, let me add, than we have had before and, as we know from the steps announced today, a much more <Col N="1981" /> serious situation than was ever admitted by the Minister before.  As I said, we on this side of the House have consistently said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has given me a good excuse to read out more than I intended to.  From the introduction of the first budget by the Coalition consistently on this side of the House we have pointed out the direction in which their policies or lack of policies were leading us, to where we find ourselves today.</P>
      <P>Speaking in this House on 16th May, 1973, on the Minister's first budget, as reported at column 1310, I said:</P>
      <P>A major test of this budget will, of course, be whether or not it is effective from the point of view of its effect on prices and income inflation. I could hardly believe my ears when I heard some of the proposals which are clearly, and this must be in the knowledge of the Minister for Finance, going to cause further price increases, apart altogether from the direct effect of the increased taxation he is putting on.  He must know of the effects on prices of what is contained in this budget.</P>
      <P>Just over two years ago, on 13th June, 1973, as reported at column 382 of the Official Report, I said:</P>
      <P>I want to say here and now, and I want to go on the record as saying, that the action of the Government in this budget will increase prices substantially, directly and indirectly, and the indirect effect may well be worse than the direct effect.</P>
      <P>On the same day, as reported at column 395, I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as we are concerned, the budget has demonstrated clearly the incompetence in economic management of the Government.  The full consequences of that incompetence will not appear for at least two years but in the meantime enough had happened for people to be <Col N="1982" /> very concerned for themselves and for the future of our economy.</P>
    <P>In 1973, also on 11th July, at column 702, I am reported as saying:</P>
    <P>He will see the price of every commodity other than food, whether it is an essential item such as clothing, footwear and fuel or whether it is a less essential or even luxury item, increasing because of deliberate Government action.  This is in addition to the increased prices which are coming as a result of what might be called normal inflationary pressure.  In those circumstances I cannot imagine any overall approach to our economic problems which could be more ill-conceived or mistaken than that adopted by the Government and outlined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>For the sake of the public and of our economy generally, I very much hope I am wrong in that assessment but unfortunately, there are indications already that I am right. I am as sure of this as I can be of anything, that at budget time next year it will be clear to every man, woman and child that this Bill, in the taxes it imposes and the general approach to the problems of the economy which it embodies, is a disaster.</P>
    <P>On 3rd April, 1974, at columns 1478 and 1479, I am reported as follows:</P>
    <P>In our economic circumstances, some of which are outlined by the Minister in his speech, and having regard to the international climate, particularly in relation to oil prices and the shortage of various raw materials, it is gross irresponsibility on the part of the Government to bring in a budget providing for a deficit of more than £66 million. Having regard to the constraints in the supply of raw materials, the effect of the increase in oil prices and the consequent limited capacity of our economy to grow in the coming year, any stimulus to the economy above its capacity to grow is a direct production of inflation by the Government.  It is not by the workers, the trade unions, the shopkeepers <Col N="1983" /> or the industrialists, it is by the members of the Government.</P>
    <P>On 15th January this year at column 276, I am reported as follows:</P>
    <P>My fear is that the deficit announced today may well go the same way, with the same serious consequences.  Time is running out for us.  We do not have the time for the Minister for Finance to discover a long time afterwards, as he did in the other areas I have mentioned, that we were right.  We just do not have that time.  There is an opportunity this year, I believe, to take our economy by the scruff of the neck and get it moving again but the Minister did not do that in this budget and we will all have to suffer the consequences.</P>
    <P>Today we are hearing of the consequences, six months later.  Finally, on 15th January this year, at column 274 I said:</P>
    <P>We know what happens.  I described that budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is the one of April, 1974</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;as fraudulent and irresponsible. If one looks at what has happened since, I wonder was I wrong.  I ask that the Minister learn from his experience of the last nine months. He should stand back and have a look at what he is doing.  What has he done to stimulate the economy? How much of this deficit of £125 million will stimulate the economy? How much of it is geared and directed to that purpose?  I suggest that a very small portion will be channelled in that direction.</P>
    <P>We know now how much stimulation or lack of stimulation there was in the economy provided by the budget introduced by the Minister in January of this year.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of the steps announced today such as the subsidies on food and the benefit to electricity and gas, reduction of VAT rates, aid to the building industry and so on, are all things which were being spelled out by us for a very long time.  They were urged by us quite a long time ago but I spelled them out in considerable <Col N="1984" /> detail in a speech I made in Cork on 9th September, 1974.  We spelled them out again as part of a comprehensive package to tackle the emergency situation which this Government had produced, before the budget in January.  But the Government did nothing about it.  That is the crucial matter and I shall come to it later&mdash;why the Government did nothing about it at that time.</P>
    <P>If the House will bear with me for two more quotations I should like to get it on record that we did urge the Government to take the steps, most of which they are now taking.  That is on the records of the House and I want to prove it but I am not doing so merely to take the line of &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;, although it is perfectly legitimate for us to point out that we knew what we were talking about in regard to the economy while the Government, with all the resources available to them, did not.  Apart from that, there are two other very important reasons why I think this position should be made clear.  The first is that the cost of the steps which the Government announced today and which we urged last autumn is now approximately 15 per cent higher than it was then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The other important reason is that in the meantime and directly as a consequence of the Government's delay thousands of jobs have been lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is at the door of the Government and I hope they will be able to explain it to those who lost their jobs.  At that time we suggested that there was an emergency situation and, as a method of dealing with it, that there should be quite substantial borrowing.  The Government went ahead with substantial borrowing but used it in the main for purposes which were neither productive nor designed to reduce inflation. The result is that today we hear the most frightening figures which the Minister airily reduces by £30 million, <Col N="1985" /> £40 million and in one case, £50 million pending discussions with the Central Bank or the associated banks. This is all on top of the money the Government have already borrowed and they have virtually exhausted our credit.</P>
      <P>To put it on the record I want to quote this.  On 15th January this year, at column 272, I am reported as follows:</P>
      <P>If we consider what happened during the course of last year we find that if the Minister had taken the steps we were advocating in the autumn&mdash;to bring in either temporary food subsidies or certain other kinds of subsidies, to reduce VAT and to take other measures in respect of certain categories of people &mdash;people would have been able to buy more.  They would have kept up demand because they would get more for their money, thereby sparing many workers a Coalition Christmas on the dole.</P>
      <P>This would have meant, too, that the cost of living payment due in March under the escalator clause would have been only 6 and not 10 per cent and that firms now facing enormous liquidity problems would have had a less severe demand for extra cash with the inevitable increases in consumer prices that follow this situation.  Last autumn the Minister was blinded by the economic blizzard he had created for himself.  He had no idea of what course he ought to have steered the economy on.  It seems to me that he has no such idea yet.</P>
      <P>The final quotation in this regard is also from 15th January of this year, at column 273, where I am reported as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an emergency facing business which requires immediate action.  What the Minister did today is a step in the right direction, but it does not go nearly far enough.  I ask the Minister to think again about that and to do something worth while for business. Otherwise, he might well find that many of the estimates on which he based his figures will turn out to <Col N="1986" /> be totally wrong because the businesses and the employees from whom he is hoping to collect taxes and other duties will not be in a position to pay because businesses will have closed down.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister could have given specific help to certain industries.  For example, for the expenditure of a few million pounds he could have restored the situation of the house-building industry with an enormous impact on our economy.  But not a word on that.  He could have announced the steps which should have been taken long ago to give some degree of protection to the textile and footwear industries.  But we did not hear anything about that either.</P>
    <P>It was last January that I was telling the Minister that and still nothing done.</P>
    <P>Instead of tackling the basic economic problems of the country which have been getting more and more serious under this Government, what were they doing?  First, they were wasting the time and energy of themselves, of the Civil Service and of Dáil Éireann in damaging and irrelevant measures like the wealth tax which, on the Minister for Finance's own admission, will not redistribute wealth and will yield approximately £1½ million in a year.</P>
    <P>But the Government were doing something else.  They were also wasting time and energy on a totally artificial controversy about the re-broadcasting of BBC.  Could there be a clearer indication of this Coalition's silly and tawdry priorities?  While the economic situation grew steadily worse the Government said they could not do anything about inflation and they publicly abdicated their responsibility while they waited and relied on the action from other Governments to benefit them.  In the meantime, they said.  &ldquo;We will concentrate on protecting jobs&rdquo;. Look at what has happened.  How unsuccessful can a Government be in achieving their objectives?  Of course, the true explanation, by now, should be clear to everyone.  This Coalition has been the most complacent Government that this country has ever had, including <Col N="1987" /> the previous Coalition, and when they finally recognised what was happening they were beset by inertia and paralysis of will and what we have heard today is brought about only by desperation on the part of the Government and the imminence of economic chaos.</P>
    <P>There are questions arising out of this which the Government must answer.  If they do not answer them here they will have to answer them to the voters.  The first question is: why did they not know what we knew about the economy and, if they did know, why was no action taken until now and, if they did not know, why did they not give consideration to the suggestions that we proposed and act on them then instead of waiting so long at the cost of so many thousands of jobs?</P>
    <P>At the time of the last budget, in January, the Government knew, as everybody did, that the national pay agreement was being negotiated.  Why did they not frame their budget in January in such a way as to reduce the rise in the consumer price index, as they are now trying to do, and thereby reduce the level of pay rises under the national pay agreement, as we had advocated, and thereby save jobs and get our economy moving even to a limited extent?</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, this Government have made many mistakes, have had many failures, but perhaps the most crucial or certainly one of the most crucial has been that they introduced in January a budget knowing precisely what the situation was, knowing there was a national agreement coming up, and they failed to take the steps that they are now taking today at greater cost.  Why did they not do that in January?</P>
    <P>The success, if any, to attend the measures announced today depends to a very great extent on the gamble of a renegotiation of the national pay agreement, and whatever the outcome of such negotiations the Government are seriously endangering any further national pay agreements.  The parties to the national pay agreement did what the Government asked them in their White Paper on national partnership <Col N="1988" /> but the Government failed miserably to do its part in the January budget.</P>
    <P>Workers who have received the first phase under the national pay agreement have, in fact, received a smaller increase than the cost of living in the relevant period, and they are now being asked to agree to renegotiations under much more difficult circumstances. I am asking the Government, and there will be many other people asking the Government, what is known now about the likely trends in the consumer price index that was not known in January?  If it was known in January, as we knew and everybody else knew&mdash;presumably the Government knew what the trend was going to be&mdash;what excuse can the Government offer for introducing in January a budget that was not doing the kind of things the Government are doing today, things which we had been telling them long before that they should have been doing?  That is the question the Government will have to face.  That is the question to which they must give an answer.  We know what the answer is but we will be interested to hear the Coalition's reply to that question.</P>
    <P>This whole performance of this Coalition Government is a monument to their incompetence but with the gravest implications for the future in regard to national pay agreements and many other areas of our economy. The Government are now asking everyone else to show discipline, to show restraint, in the national interest. Why have the Government not imposed on themselves the same discipline? I was working on figures before I heard the Minister's speech. This is probably out of date, but up to the time the Minister made his announcements today they had almost doubled Government expenditure, both current and capital, in two years. The charges under their direct control, such as postal charges and television licences, were inordinately increased, and various State bodies have been allowed by the Government either to by-pass the National Prices Commission or have been allowed increases far higher than were recommended by the National Prices Commission. None of this kind of freedom is open <Col N="1989" /> to any other sector of the economy. Yet the Government engaging in this kind of self-indulgence asked&mdash;and I would like to know by what right they ask since they do this&mdash;that other people should exercise the discipline and restraint which is singularly lacking in all the activities of this Government up to now.</P>

      <P>There is an aspect of our economy which the Minister did not touch on at all today and which is of vital importance to us.  I have referred to it in this House on a number of occasions.  The truth of the matter is that as a direct consequence of the increase in oil prices, if we were merely to maintain our consumption of oil as it was before the prices went up we could not do anything other than suffer a reduction in our standard of living unless we step up our exports earnings to compensate for that.  It is clearly one of the first priorities and should have been so regarded as soon as the oil crisis broke.</P>
      <P>I spoke about it in this House on 8th May, 1974.  At that time, the Minister for Industry and Commerce apparently was totally bereft of any idea of anything that could be done to assist the export trade, so I told him that he might have a look at the scheme for credit for exporters which we introduced some years previously on an experimental basis, that it had worked and worked well, and that now was the time to expand it. That was May, 1974.  Nothing happened until one year later, May, 1975, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce announced&mdash;or it might have been the Minister for Finance at Killarney&mdash;that a scheme had been renegotiated with the banks and everything was okay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a disgraceful delay considering <Col N="1990" /> the vital importance of it, but imagine my horror when I was told only a few days ago by one of our very large exporters that when he went along to his bank to avail of the facility he was told: &ldquo;That scheme has not been fixed up at all yet.&rdquo;  He could not get any details because they could not get any details from the Government.  The Minister will probably know whom I am referring to because I have been informed that the firm have written to him and to the Minister for Industry and Commerce about this in the last few days.</P>
    <P>This is just a vignette of the kind of negligence and inertia that this Government have been engaged in and it has led us to what we had to listen to today.  We have had, of course, the most enormous borrowing by this Government and we will have a great deal more of it, but I wonder how much of it will be of any assistance in increasing production or even in fighting inflation.  I know that the Government have been scraping the bottom of the barrel here and abroad. I got figures from the Minister for Finance some time ago in reply to a parliamentary question in regard to how badly they were scraping the bottom of the barrel, figures which are frightening almost.  They show that the national loan sinking fund accounts, which had £47 million in them when we left office had, at 31st March this year, £100,000.  The savings certificate reserve fund, which had £7.9 million when we left office, had nothing in it at 31st March this year.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to some of the measures the Minister announced today.  The subsidies on CIE fares which were announced are welcome.  It is relatively one of the cheaper ways of reducing the consumer price index because the index <Col N="1991" /> is out of date.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to one aspect of this.  CIE have already reduced their provincial services and only yesterday it was reported that they were planning much more major reductions in these services.  Already there are many people who have no public transport to their work because it is just not available to them, and if the activities of CIE that have been reported continue, more people will be without public transport to get to work. The reduction in the fares will be no help to them.  They are the people all over the country outside urban areas. The announcement of help for the building industry, while limited, seems to suggest either that the Minister for Local Government has been misleading the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have heard from the Minister that the commercial banks propose to make available a sum of £40 million for house loans in a two-year period.  This money is presumably available because the private sector is unable to avail itself of the credit: it is so far down on its knees that it cannot take loans because it cannot pay them back.  Therefore, this money is available.  But the question I should like to pose in this regard is this.  If the commercial banks advance £40 million on house loans, which are long-term loans, and if the economy ever gets off its knees again, will the effect be that the private sector will be totally squeezed for credit because the banks will have lent £40 million long term, money that has been left to them when the Government had not squeezed the rest out of them to satisfy their voracious borrowing requirements?  In the long term, that could be a serious matter.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the PAYE system is one on which I noted he was very vague.  He did not say when it would happen or what the effect would be on the Exchequer. Quite clearly very careful phasing will be needed in this regard, but the Minister will want to give an absolute assurance that in the process of what he is doing people will not be double taxed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When they do get it back is another matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will no doubt in due course think up an <Col N="1993" /> answer to it.  All of the subsidies on bread, butter, milk CIE fares, gas, are steps in the right direction, but why so late, why when they are costing 15 per cent more, why now when they have cost so many thousands of jobs?  Why did they not do it when we told them to do it?  Why did they not do it in January at the lates? We urged all of those things including the abolition of VAT on electricity, but it was not feasible or worthwhile. I had an amendment down to this year's Finance Bill trying to get VAT off electricity for old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>The employment premium is an imaginative gesture and I congratulate the Minister on it.  However, I am not sure as to how it will work.  I suspect that it may not work as well as one might think, but to the extent that it will work, it is a good idea.  I am concerned that the Minister has not a notion as to whether it will work or as to its cost.  The large figures of deficits and so on that he has been giving us do not take account of that. At the same time, it is the right kind of approach.</P>
      <P>The Minister tells us that the current budget deficit of £241.6 million is £116.3 million more than that projected in January which was only six months ago.  Surely this increase requires some explanation.  Much of it is due to the extra cost involved in the Government's delay in doing what we urged them to do.  That figure, huge as it is, probably does not include the cost of the social welfare improvements that are due in October, or the cost of the employment premium announced.  All of this adds up to the likelihood of our having a third budget this year in order to produce the money needed for the social welfare benefits and the employment premium, if nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are aspects of the income tax surcharge which ought to be referred to.  First, it seems clear that if one is in the 35 per cent tax band and, consequently, becomes liable for the surcharge, he will pay the same extra income tax regardless of whether he has no dependants or of whether he has ten dependants.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong but that is as I see it.  The surcharge is on the <Col N="1994" /> income tax after taking account of the allowance for dependants and so on.  Therefore, so far as the implementation of this surcharge is concerned, the Government do not care whether one is supporting 12 children or is supporting only oneself.  That would appear to be a major flaw and drawback in this proposal, and one which I trust will be remedied by the Minister during discussion on the Finance Bill.  It would be grossly unjust to have it operate in this way.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this which mystifies me a little is that, speaking in this House a little more than two months ago, the Minister said, as reported at column 1581 of the Official Report for April 15th:</P>
    <P>Nominal incomes in Ireland are, in fact, in real terms worth much less than in any other European country I know of because of the very high levels of tax associated with brackets of income, the thresholds of which are below those applicable in other countries.  In order to try to cool the situation for top executives' salary demands, which will have a beneficial effect I believe right down the line, we consider it is appropriate in the income front alone, if wealth tax were never to be contemplated, to make these adjustments in the thresholds and the rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that at a time when he reduced the top rate from 80 to 70 per cent.  Two months later he introduces a 10 per cent surcharge. Whatever the merits or demerits of the proposals today what really emerges is that here is a Minister who does not know from day to day what he is doing.</P>

      <P>There is no consistency in the approach of the Government to economic matters.  In respect of the measures announced today the first question to be asked is whether they will work.  The impossible position into which the Government have got themselves means that whether these proposals work depends to a great extent on bargaining between <Col N="1995" /> the employers and the trade unions in order to have even a limited effect on our economy.  However, the Government do not control this but they are gambling on it.  Even if it worked to a limited extent these measures will not tackle our basic problem.  As I have been demonstrating, the Government have no overall plan.  Today the Minister told us that they could not have any such plan but he seemed to be suggesting that given certain circumstances he might contemplate an overall plan.  Obviously, somebody has been twisting his arm but not enough because he still has no intention of any such plan.</P>
      <P>Let us suppose that instead of lurching along from one crisis to another the Government produce an overall economic plan&mdash;an unlikely event&mdash;is it not clear from their hamfisted amateur handling of our economy that such a plan could not work under their administration?  They could not implement it.  Anything they have done confirms their incompetence and inability in the economic field.</P>

      <P>With confidence there is virtually no limit to what can be achieved but without it it does not matter what the Government do or how much money they spend, the economy will continue on a downward trend.  Because of their mishandling of our affairs up to now this Government cannot obtain the confidence of the people on whom depends the progress of our economy.  That being so one must consider what should happen now.  The Irish people have demonstrated time and again that, given leadership they can follow, they can achieve almost anything, can put up with all sorts of hardships in order to get this country moving but first, they must have confidence in those <Col N="1996" /> who are purporting to give the leadership.</P>
      <P>What have we had from this Government? We have been drifting into ever-worsening chaos.  There is nothing but inconsistency.  A decision taken one day is reversed the next day because of pressure.  For so long as this Government are in office nobody can have confidence in the future of our economy.  The message is clear. Given the present shambles of our economy it is clear that its restoration is an unpalatable task for anyone, but for the sake of this country we in Fianna Fáil are willing to tackle and we ask those in the Coalition to get out before they do any more damage to our unfortunate country and let us get on with getting this country moving again.</P>

      <P>I shall not go over <Col N="1998" /> the ground just covered by my colleague, Deputy Colley.  We find ourselves in this House today trying to deal with a drastic situation.  But the drastic situation did not arise only today.  As has been pointed out, we knew&mdash;and the Government should have known&mdash;that such a situation existed many months ago.  We not only urged the Government to take action but pointed out the type of action that should be taken.  Having gone some of the way to taking some of the action that might be expected of an Opposition in trying to support a Government in such a situation, unfortunately the action, as we have indicated, is too late.  Unfortunately also those who are less able to bear the brunt of that action are again being asked to pay.  The only section of the community asked to make any sacrifice immediately&mdash;a sacrifice imposed by this House&mdash;are the people in the 35 per cent income tax waveband.</P>
      <P>According to the Minister's Estimates, the value to the Exchequer is £8 million.  The cost of the whole package is something in excess of £20 million.  The budget deficit, estimated at some £116 million in January of this year, is now double, bringing it to something like £240 million which will have to be found by borrowing.</P>
      <P>Nobody else is asked to make any contribution to today's package, or to the £240 million deficit, except those least organised and who are always called upon to make contributions when the Government look for some input into the economy.  People now with an income rate of £1,500 to £4,300 per annum will be called upon, this year, to pay an increase of anything from £1 to £100.  These are the people on whom the Minister relies to give new impetus to the manufacturing industry by reducing the rate of VAT, that is the rate of VAT on clothing and footwear.  These are the kind of people on whom the Minister can depend to give that impetus.  But he is going to take the kind of impetus that they could give, through enjoyment in the reduction of the VAT rate from them in this fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from registering our protest about the imposition of <Col N="1999" /> this tax by voting against it&mdash;as we propose to do&mdash;we intend to register our protest at the ineptitude and tardiness of the Government in handling this problem; in making a bad situation, bad as it was in the winter of last year and spring of this year, worse by their tardiness, their lethargy and ineptitude in the handling of the whole economic spectrum.  For those two reasons we propose to vote against this Resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question on this Resolution? The Minister referred to the fact that approximately 100,000 new persons will be brought under the PAYE system.  Is it intended that that change will be applicable during the course of this income tax year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is unlikely that the arrangements necessary to bring them under the scope of PAYE will be completed within the current tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the arrangements are made will the changeover involve these 100,000 people paying, in the one year, income tax in respect of their earnings in the previous year and PAYE in respect of their earnings in the current year?  Can we have a categoric assurance from the Minister that that will not happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured there will be no double payment. He will recall that, when PAYE was introduced in 1960, there were certain adjustments made to avoid that situation.  The circumstances are not entirely comparable. The different categories are not treated precisely the same even under existing practices.  Some pay within a financial year; others have an entitlement to pay in arrear beyond a tax year.  These are some of the matters of detail that will have to be worked out.  But the Deputy may be assured that appropriate adjustment will be made to avoid the possibility of double payments having to be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I am asking is capable of a very clearcut and categoric answer.  These 100,000 <Col N="2000" /> people at present are on a system under which they pay income tax, this year, on the basis of last year's earnings. When the changeover occurs&mdash;in whatever income tax year it happens &mdash;can we be assured they will not, in the same year, be paying income tax on their previous year's earnings and PAYE on their current year's earnings?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister seek to justify the fact that income tax, deductible at the standard rate of 35 per cent, for example, from company dividends will continue to be deducted at 35 per cent in respect of dividends payable to companies and, in particular, holding and investment companies for wealthy people; but, where the dividend is paid to a private individual, who has a family to support, the rate of tax to be deducted will now be 38.5 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are satisfied it would be wrong, in existing economic circumstances, to charge the higher rate of tax or to impose this surcharge on the profits of companies, and that to do so would only have the further effect of dampening the possibilities and prospects of employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If you are wealthy enough to have a holding company or an investment company you pay 35 per cent tax but if you are a private individual trying to support a family you pay 38½ per cent tax.  Thank you.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That, with effect on and from the 1st day of July, 1975&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972 (No. 22 of 1972), be amended by the addition of the following paragraphs to the Second Schedule&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(xvii)  clothing, including textile handkerchiefs and footwear;</P>
      <P>(xviii)  fabrics, yarn and thread of a kind normally used in the manufacture of clothing, including elastics, tape and padding materials in the form supplied for the manufacture of clothing;</P>
      <P>(xix)  sole and upper leather of a kind supplied for the manufacture and repair of footwear, and also soles, heels and insoles of any material;</P>
      <P>(xx) (a)  coal, peat and other solid substances held out for sale solely as fuel,</P>
      <P>(b)  gas of a kind used for domestic or industrial heating or lighting, whether in gaseous or liquid form, but not including gas of a kind normally used for welding and cutting metals or gas sold as lighter fuel,</P>
      <P>(c)  electricity,</P>
      <P>(d)  hydrocarbon oil of a kind used for domestic or industrial heating not being hydrocarbon oil sold for use in internal combustion engines.&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>(b)  in consequence of the amendment specified in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, be further amended as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  by the deletion of paragraphs (xi), (xii) and (xiii) of Part I of the Third Schedule,</P>
      <P>(ii)  by the substitution, for paragraph (xxiii) of Part I of the Third Schedule, of the following paragraph: &ldquo;(xxiii) fuel other than fuel of a kind specified in paragraph (xx) of the Second Schedule;&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>(iii)  by the insertion in paragraph (xxiv) of Part I of the Third Schedule, after &ldquo;(including greases)&rdquo;, of &ldquo;other than hydrocarbon oils of a kind specified in paragraph (xx) of the Second Schedule&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>(iv) by the insertion in paragraph (xxviii) of Part I of the Third Schedule, after &ldquo;specified in&rdquo;, of &ldquo;the Second Schedule or&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>(v) by the addition of the following paragraph to Part II of the Third Schedule:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(viii)  the hiring of goods of a kind specified in paragraph (xvii) of the Second Schedule&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>(vi)  by the substitution, in section 8 (3) (a) (i), of &ldquo;, (xv) and (xx) of the Second Schedule&rdquo; for &ldquo;and (xv) of the Second Schedule&rdquo; (inserted by the Finance Act, 1973 (No. 19 of 1973)) and by the substitution of &ldquo;and (xxii) of Part I of the Third Schedule&rdquo; for &ldquo;, (xxii) and (xxiii) of Part I of the Third Schedule&rdquo;,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /> (vii)  by the substitution, in section 8 (3) (b) (ii), of &ldquo;, (xii) to (xv) or (xvii) to (xx)&rdquo; for &ldquo;or (xii) to (xv)&rdquo; (inserted by the Finance Act, 1973),</P>
    <P>(viii)  by the substitution, in section 11 (1) (b), of &ldquo;, (xii) to (xv) and (xvii) to (xx)&rdquo; for &ldquo;and (xii) to (xv)&rdquo; (inserted by the Finance Act, 1973), and</P>
    <P>(ix)  by the substitution, in section 11 (1) (d), of &ldquo;,(xii) to (xv) and (xvii) to (xx)&rdquo; for &ldquo;and (xii) to (xv)&rdquo; (inserted by the Finance Act, 1973), and</P>
    <P>(x)  by the substitution, in section 15 (2) (a) (ii), of &ldquo;, (xii) to (xv) and (xvii) to (xx)&rdquo; for &ldquo;and (xii) to (xv)&rdquo; (inserted by the Finance Act, 1973). </P>
    <P>(2)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927). </P>
    <P>The resolution removes from the value-added tax by application of the zero rate the following items : clothing (including textile handkerchiefs and footwear); certain clothing and footwear materials and fuels, including electricity but not road fuels.  The relief, which will take effect as and from Tuesday next, will have the effect of entirely removing the existing tax, 6.75, from the items affected. As a consequence the prices involved should be reduced as from 1st July for supplies made and paid for on or after that date.  The cost to the Exchequer of granting these reliefs is £8.2 million in the current year and £27.2 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I should like to add, in reply to a question raised earlier, that registered sellers may continue to obtain a credit or refund in respect of any tax suffered by them on their purchase of taxable goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, in the light of the wellknown difficulties in the clothing and textile industries, whether he considers the removal of value-added tax may, in fact, increase imports of such goods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I <Col N="2006" /> obviously share a concern that any increase in the demand for goods which may be generated by this reduction in price will not leak into imports.  However, in the final analysis the decision as to whether or not Irish people buy Irish goods or foreign goods lies with each purchaser, but a tremendous responsibility lies on traders.  It is for traders to decide whether or not their interests, and the interests of Ireland, lie with their purchasing goods manufactured by Irish people or purchasing from outside the country.  I am sure there are many members, myself included, who have experienced difficulty themselves in endeavouring to buy in retail stores in this city items to which the Deputy refers like garments, textiles and footwear.  Sometimes it is difficult to obtain goods manufactured in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The principal factor in determining whether or not Irish goods are for sale or bought lies on us and not on any arrangements which governments may make.  The Deputy is aware that there are constraints on us now by reason of EEC obligations which restrict the scope which we at one time had in relation to restrictions on imports. However, we have already raised with the EEC the steps which we propose to take to restrict the importation of footwear.  There are special reasons why it would be possible to do it in respect of footwear which do not apply to the other items.</P>

On the question of how much it would mean for an individual family, it is clearly not possible to state what relief it might give to any family because family expenditures can vary considerably, but the consequence for the consumer price index of these reductions would be about 1 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put one or two questions but before I do may I comment on the remark made by the Minister that we voted against taxation? We voted against this taxation for the two reasons I already gave but I would remind the Minister that <Col N="2008" /> the last vote we had was the only vehicle for voting against the Minister's package and his failure to handle the whole situation.  In a couple of minutes' time the General Resolution will be moved; that will be debated tomorrow and on Tuesday, as I understand it, and will be adjourned <i>sine die</i>.  The first opportunity we shall have of voting on these specific measures the Minister proposes will be in the Finance Bill, I take it, which is due some time in the autumn.  Therefore, we wanted to take the earliest opportunity to mark our disapproval and, indeed, our condemnation of the activities of the Government and the Minister.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question on the subsidies.  The explanatory memorandum is all-embracing in relation to VAT and subsidies.  In the pink explanatory memorandum the Minister says :</P>
      <P>A further subsidy is now being provided to enable CIE to reduce the fares it charges on Dublin city bus services, road passenger provincial servies and Dublin and Cork commuter rail services...</P>
      <P>I take it that does not exclude city services in the other county boroughs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>He also says in the same memorandum &ldquo;A subsidy will be paid to producers of town gas&rdquo;. He used the same words in his statement today &ldquo;town gas&rdquo;.  It is more general in the Financial Resolution No. 2 where it describes it as &ldquo;gas of a kind used for domestic or industrial heating or lighting whether in gaseous or liquid form.&rdquo;  Do I take it that includes bottled gas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The subsidy applies to town gas.  VAT is being removed from bottled gas and piped gas.  The items of fuel which will be relieved from VAT are fuels of all kinds used for domestic or industrial heating or lighting, including electricity, for example, coal, coke, turf, firewood, firelighters, heating oils, central heating oils, fuel oils other than those used in internal combustion engines, paraffin oil, piped gas and bottled gas.</P>

      <P>Does the subsidy on fares apply exclusively to CIE or is it the intention that it will be extended to other transport operators, and, if not, does this not mean that these private operators will be placed at a very serious disadvantage in relation to CIE?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say they will be placed at a serious disadvantage.  CIE are providing many transport services which are really social services and are not commercial propositions.  It is they who have to carry losses which the private sector would not carry. It is on that account they have to pass on to users of transport the losses which are suffered by them on the many social services which they provide by way of transport facilities in areas of small demand, and, therefore, it is for CIE alone that the subsidy will be provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the cost of such operations tend to be less than the cost which CIE must charge because CIE are providing many services which are uneconomic.  Hitherto it has not been the practice to provide any subsidies for any of those private concerns, but for many years, in fact, decades now, subsidies have been provided for CIE.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister to clarify further the statement that retailers who have paid VAT on goods purchased from wholesalers can apply for a rebate on the amount of VAT already paid?

Without having the Official Report before me I am not in a position to say whether he did or did not say a particular thing.  As I have already said in reply to Deputy Faulkner, the process of collecting the necessary information on which to base a further approach to the Commission of necessity took some time.  The information being now available which justifies an approach to the Commission under Article 135, the approach has been made and, on foot of that, action is now being taken.</P>

He raced out to Brussels two days before the Private Members' <Col N="2020" /> motion was discussed.  We discussed it again very recently.  He told us there was a very narrow confine to what he could do.  As Deputy O'Malley said, according to the Minister, one of the few ways in which he could take action was under Articles 104 and 108 of the Treaty of Accession. This meant that the country could claim it had a balance of payments problem.  Deputy O'Malley and I want to know whether there is a balance of payments problem now and if that is the reason why it is possible to go to Brussels and do something about it.</P>

      <P>With a sweep of the hand the Minister says we are removing VAT from various items for the purpose of cutting down prices and generating employment.  The Minister deliberately excluded road fuels.  One industry, together with the building industry and the footwear trade, which is having problems, is the motor trade.  Last year the Minister introduced savage increases in the tax on road fuels.  Would the Minister not consider that he should have given some relief to the already over-burdened section of the community, the motorists and the motor trade generally, to stimulate purchases and employment? He had that opportunity today but, as he did in relation to many other sections of the economy, he failed miserably.

      <P>In regard to the textile industry and the footwear industry could I ask if the considerations or the constraints which the Minister <Col N="2022" /> for Industry and Commerce mentioned have been surmounted?  Is the removal of VAT from shoes and articles of clothing the only distance he has been permitted to go?  Surely the imposition of duty on these articles would be a further step.  Surely the removal of VAT from the sale of imported shoes and boots does not give home manufacturers any advantage. In other words, the concession of the removal of VAT will mean more purchases and a lowering of the cost of living, but that does not go to the root of the problem.  Has the Minister sought the removal of any constraints other than VAT?  If VAT was one of the constraints he mentioned, has the Minister for Industry and Commerce gone further?  With what result?  Do the Government propose later to introduce anti-dumping measures and duty measures on imports?  Otherwise they are not differentiating between imported goods and home-produced goods, all of which will be free from VAT.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; because you may not use that to discriminate against goods on a national basis, but 70 per cent of clothing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Seventy per cent of clothing in the country is Irish made and if the Deputy and his colleagues who are criticising us would encourage people to buy Irish, nothing else need come into the country.  We have the <Col N="2023" /> capacity to supply the whole Irish market in all these commodities.  In many cases the difficulty these firms are experiencing at the moment is attributable not merely to imports but to a slackening of demand on the home market for all goods.  Removal of VAT should help to stimulate demand and, therefore, have a beneficial effect on the sale opportunities of Irish manufacturers.  Where the Government have evidence of dumping they will not hesitate to act to prevent that dumping but Deputies opposite who encouraged the Irish people to vote for membership of the EEC should not now in Opposition pretend that there are no contraints.  There are constraints and we are still in a position so far as clothing and textiles are concerned, of exporting more than we are importing.  We are producing and selling more textiles and clothing on the Irish market than we are importing.  We have a net advantage in these items.  The situation in footwear is different and that is why it is open to us to take the action we are taking in that regard.</P>

      <P>In view of the danger that the removal of VAT from clothing, textiles and footwear may stimulate imports, would the Minister say whether consideration was given to the categorisation of footwear or clothing or textiles to determine those categories in which there was a predominantly imported element for the purposes of assessing the categories from which VAT should be removed and those from which it should not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Either.  The restrictions may apply in different ways but they are there.  The EEC is a net exporter to the rest of the world and it is not in the interests of the EEC or of this country to have restrictions applied by third countries to our exports.  The Government are taking <Col N="2024" /> action in the case of footwear as it is possible by reason of circumstances that have arisen to take action in that area.  Do the Deputies opposite agree that the best action that can be taken in this area is for Irish people to buy Irish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, we have said that on numerous occasions. Would the Minister agree that action could have been taken months ago on the same basis as he is speaking of now?

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the removal of VAT from certain items and the subsidies introduced would bring about a reduction in the cost of living.  Bearing in mind that a subsidy is being provided as well as a reduction in VAT in the case of town gas, did the Minister take into consideration a possible subsidy on bottled gas which is used for domestic purposes?  If so, why was this not favourably considered as this would be a definite way of reducing the cost of living for a huge section of the community?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the answer to the question I asked.  The Minister did state that VAT is coming off bottled gas and gas bills&mdash;I take it.  There will also be a subsidy of 12½ per cent for town gas.  Was consideration given to providing a subsidy on bottled gas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In selecting items for subsidy and for removal of VAT we were concerned to ensure that any subsidies given or any VAT relief given would be passed on to the consumer. Obviously, when we were concerned to reduce the consumer price index there would be little point in giving widespread relief which would not be passed on to the consumer. Obviously, electricity and piped gas are items which can very easily be policed and we can ensure that a reduction given in these areas will be passed on to the consumer.  That is the special reason why they got the treatment they did get.  In respect of bottled gas, the relief has been given by the removal of VAT.  The same applies to electricity, as regards removal of VAT.  That is the relief given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the relief in the removal of VAT from bottled gas, does the Minister <Col N="2026" /> not realise that he had a wonderful opportunity to reduce the cost of living for many thousands of people by giving a subsidy on gas?  Why did he not avail of this?  His argument is very thin.</P>

    <P>The Minister circulated a document called a Table Explanatory of the Revised Current Budget which indicates that payments to the Road Fund are to be reduced from those stated in the Financial Statement of 15th January. What will the effect of the reduction be?  Which local authorities will suffer a reduction in allocation?  Road estimates meetings have been held and road allocations have been issued by the Department of Local Government to the local authorities.  Work is planned. <Col N="2027" /> Will this mean a further cut back in the level of road work undertaken by local authorities who this year are put to the pin of their collar even to maintain the existing permanent labour road work force?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. O'Molloy Mr. O'Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 in the names of Deputy Faulkner and myself:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 26, after &ldquo;committed&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;at that place&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises out of a discussion we had on the section on Committee Stage.  We pointed to the difficulty about notices being affixed by traffic wardens possibly long after the offence or alleged parking offence or non-display of a tax disc had arisen. At that time I made the suggestion that some form of time limit would be placed on the affixing of the notice after the vehicle had been moved. I suggested various periods of hours which might be considered suitable. On reconsideration, I can see difficulties in regard to a time limit after the movement because whatever period one fixes could be regarded as either too long or too short in various circumstances. Accordingly we are of <Col N="2029" /> the opinion that the proper way in which to prevent notices being affixed long after the offence takes place would be to amend subsection (3) by providing that a notice can be affixed where a traffic warden has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence to which the section applies involving the use of a mechanically propelled vehicle is being or has been committed and then to add the words &ldquo;at that place&rdquo;.  That would get over the difficulty of fixing a time limit.</P>
    <P>The point the Minister made yesterday that a problem could be created by the form of amendment we originally suggested, that in the case of a vehicle which was on a clearway, providing it remained on the clearway until after the time it ceased to be a clearway, it was possible under the form of amendment we suggested that a notice could not be affixed.  That is the only objection the Minister had to what we were suggesting yesterday, and that point is met by the amendment because the vehicle would be remaining in the same place.  It was simply that the category of the road would have changed from a clearway to an ordinary road after 6 p.m. or whatever the time would be but the vehicle would remain at that place and therefore the notice could be affixed.  The only objection which the Minister saw to it yesterday would in that sense be overcome and the possible abuse or unfairness of attaching a notice hours or even days later would be prevented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the section further considered and I am not prepared to accept the amendment because of the fact that I do not think it is necessary.  It is in conflict with existing powers of wardens and the gardaí under section 1 of the 1961 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, no complaint of that sort has been made since 1961 about either gardaí or traffic wardens affixing tickets to cars afterwards.  In addition, the wording of Deputy O'Malley's amendment does not make sense if he reads it in conjunction with the subsection.  However, I am not <Col N="2030" /> objecting to it because of that but because I do not think it is necessary. It is suggested that the words &ldquo;at that place&rdquo; be inserted.  At which place?  There is no place mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says there have been no complaints about these notices having been affixed after the offences being committed, but he would not be in a position to know. The Department would not be in a position to know.  If persons thought they were being wrongfully treated they would go to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They can still do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They would explain the position to the justice and I assume he would dismiss the case. That would be the appropriate procedure for somebody so aggrieved. Few, if any, people in the circumstances would complain to the Department. Another thing I would bring to the Minister's attention is that the Bill makes provision whereby every local authority in the country, from the smallest upwards, will have authority to appoint traffic wardens. Up to now only four or five authorities did it and some of those had only one warden employed.  The only places where they were employed in any substantial numbers were Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  Therefore, experience of the working of it is limited in area and in terms of time.  It is in very recent times that some of the five areas concerned have at all employed wardens or have asked the Garda Commissioner to employ them on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all convinced that the subsection as it stands is not open to abuse.  The fact that it has not been abused to date is not any indication it will not be abused in the future, because for the most part the enforcement of all traffic regulations was in the hands of the Garda Síochána.  We will now be dealing with a new body who have not the training or the experience of the gardaí, and I do not <Col N="2031" /> think it is sufficient simply to say that because it was provided in the 1961 Act and operated almost exclusively by the Garda Síochána, the same thing will continue in relation to people who are not members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct that.  The Dublin and Cork warden systems are not in the hands of the Garda Síochána.  Apart from that, an amendment to subsection (3) would also affect subsection (2) which states:</P>
      <P>Where a traffic warden has reasonable grounds for believing that a person is committing or has committed an offence to which this section applies, he may deliver to the person a notice in the prescribed form stating&mdash;</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley is attempting to amend one subsection.  Other amendments would be required if this were done.  A very big number of wardens have been operating very successfully since 1961 doing their jobs well, and as far as we are aware nobody made this complaint when the 1961 Bill was being debated.  Deputy O'Malley said that aggrieved persons would likely go to the courts.  That is a protection in itself.  For those reasons I am satisfied with the section as it is.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 45, after &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to add the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and where the sums accruing to a local authority under section 3 exceed the expenses of a local authority under this Act, such excess shall be paid into the Road Fund&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Committee Stage we introduced an amendment which was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle, I assume because it would impose a charge on the Exchequer. Our reasons for introducing this amendment are to avoid any costs being put on the rates or, on the other hand, avoiding a situation where the local authority might regard it as a <Col N="2032" /> means of collecting extra revenue. Because it was not possible for us to deal with the rates aspect, we rephrased the amendment.</P>
    <P>Our main purpose in putting it forward is to ensure that local authorities will not use traffic wardens to increase their revenue.  We also fear that particularly at holiday resorts there might be a temptation to pressurise people like tourists by following them very closely and in that way getting extra revenue.  It might be a temptation particularly to the smaller authorities. So as to remove that possible temptation, we suggest the Minister might adopt this amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the money taken in fines would go to the local authority in whose area the offences were committed, and we think this would add to some extent to the temptation I have mentioned.  Though the money might not necessarily be devoted to works in the area in which it is collected, nevertheless it will accrue to the Road Fund and that would remove the temptation to pressurise motorists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few misconceptions in the Deputy's mind. Local authorities do not pay moneys directly into the Road Fund.  Disbursements from the Road Fund are for the Minister for Local Government subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance who decides what money will be paid from the Exchequer into the Road Fund.</P>
      <P>There is a very long procedure involved. Moneys collected by a tax office are lodged in the taxation account at the local bank, transferred later to the Central Bank and from there to the Exchequer and, as required, amounts needed are transferred from the Exchequer to the Road Fund account.  I would draw the attention of Deputy Faulkner to section 3 (8) which states that moneys accruing to the local authority under this section shall be disposed of in accordance with regulations made by the Minister.  That section has been passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us suppose that the Road Fund is not the appropriate <Col N="2033" /> one and that the money is returned to the Exchequer, would that prevent the Minister from deciding how it should be disposed of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a cumbersome and uneconomic procedure. Some people seem to think that traffic wardens will be advised to catch the stranger.  Unless he is breaking the law nobody need fear any action by traffic wardens.  That is an important point.  All of us have expressed the view that the motorist who parks either dangerously or in a prohibited place or who fails to tax his car or to display a tax disc should be dealt with by the law.  This is for the good of the general public.  To suggest that instead of doing that traffic wardens will be waiting at the tourist office for a strange car to enter the area is unreasonable.  It is unfair both to the local authorities and to the traffic wardens&mdash;those already in existence and those to be appointed.  These will be decent people who will be doing a reasonable job so it is wrong that any attempt should be made to denigrate them in this way.</P>
      <P>A local authority would be entitled to recoup the money that is being collected in their area.  Deputy Faulkner's fears in this respect are totally unfounded, and I suggest that we leave the section as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy Faulkner was referring specifically to traffic wardens taking advantage of the unsuspecting visitor.  Perhaps what was in his mind was that a local authority, consisting of the local elected representatives, might see here a handy way of getting extra revenue for various pet schemes.  Can the Minister say what will be the position where a local authority decide to institute a £4 or £5 fine for an ordinary parking offence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Without going back over what I have said already, I had been making the case very strongly that we should indicate in this Bill particular consideration for the Gaeltacht areas as is the case in many other facets of government.  We should indicate that we have in mind specifically these areas of the country and the people who live in them.  We are determined in so far as possible to insert a section that will assist the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doubtful yet as to what the Opposition mean by their amendment.  I take it the amendment purports to enable planning control to be operated with due regard to the <Col N="2036" /> special interests of the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.  That is what it says but it does not spell out what are those interests nor does it give any indication as to how they would operate. I hope these matters will be clarified during the debate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner listed his accomplishments, as Minister for the Gaeltacht at the time, and said that these things had been done.  They were done under the 1963 Act which does not contain the words now proposed to be inserted by the Opposition.  That did not prevent Deputy Faulkner, his successor Deputy O'Donnell or anybody else from doing the things that needed to be done.  For the life of me I cannot see what exactly the Opposition want done.  When we refer to the Gaeltacht we usually refer to the old Gaeltacht in the west.  There are two Gaeltacht areas in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  One in particular, Rathcairn, is a very good one.  They have factories there and they will have one in Gibbstown very shortly.  The Planning Act does not in any way interfere with them.  What I do not want to see happen&mdash;and I want to make this very clear&mdash;is something being inserted which would give the impression that there is some special provision being made, because what is suggested in the amendment would not mean a damn thing in so far as the administration of the Planning Act is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the people who have spoken about this are genuine in their interest in the Gaeltacht areas.  At the same time I dislike intensely this question of lip service&mdash;and without being offensive I suggest that the insertion of the words would simply be paying lip service to the Gaeltacht, saying: all right, this is what we are doing for you.  God knows there has been so much promised them under various headings.  What is needed in the Gaeltacht is something to keep the people there.  It appeared from some things said here before lunch that there was an impression that the Gaeltacht, in some way, could be cut away&mdash;at least <Col N="2037" /> that is what I took out of it&mdash;from the rest of the country; that they were places where only people who were Irish speakers should be allowed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the impression I got and I am entitled to express my opinion.  I said that I felt this was a wrong approach and that it would not be a way in which we would be able to maintain the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>It has been claimed that certain developments proposed in Gaeltacht areas are delayed or experiencing difficulties because there is no provision in the law of the kind now proposed.  I cannot see why this should be so.  Development in any area may be refused planning permission for valid reasons, because it might create a serious traffic hazard, pollution or something like that.  That applies equally to Gaeltacht areas, but special efforts to overcome the difficulties should be made in such areas.</P>
      <P>One instance of planning permission being held up was referred to this morning.  The Parliamentary Secretary informs me that, on appeal, he granted permission for a building refused at local level.  As long as there exists the right of appeal, as of now, to the Minister, or to the new planning board, there can be no question of somebody at local level preventing development in the Gaeltacht because the words proposed to be inserted by way of amendment are not in the section. Quite honestly I cannot see the merit of their insertion at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amendment means anything it means that development should be allowed irrespective of other planning considerations.  I am quite sure that is not what is intended.  But, if it is not what is intended, would somebody please spell out for me what exactly is intended?  &ldquo;Regard may be had to the special interests of the Gaeltacht and the Irish language&rdquo;: what exactly is meant by those words What will be achieved by their insertion?  In what way will the treatment of a planning application be affected?  Remember we are dealing here only with planning applications and appeals.  In what way would a planning application in the <Col N="2038" /> Gaeltacht be dealt with differently were this inserted as compared with the law as it stands?  It has not prevented the present Minister or his predecessor from doing what they felt necessary in the Gaeltacht areas.  Possibly one result of its insertion would be that planning authorities would interpret the proposed provision in a different way, that they would see it as an extra criterion intended to be operated restrictively. That is one way of looking at it.  But I should be glad if the Opposition would confine themselves to this issue: what benefit to the Gaeltacht will accrue from the insertion of those words?</P>

      <P>During his rather lengthy explanation the Minister said we were seeking to make the Gaeltacht something special, to isolate it from the rest of the country and confine it to Irish speakers.  This is very wide of the mark.  The first point is valid: we want to make it something special.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  Let us take the whole ambit of planning. First of all, there are county development plans.  We want to ensure that the plans created and which may be revised now&mdash;will place emphasis on Gaeltacht area development in a particular local authority area; that that development will include&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may help Deputy Cunningham.  The sections quoted in the amendment do not relate to the development plan.  I mention that merely to short-circuit the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>What we seek to do in this section is ensure that planners whether at local level or at central Government will bear in mind proper development of the Gaeltacht. It is wrong of the Minister to argue that we should not give special planning considerations to the Gaeltacht because we do so in other Departments. <Col N="2039" /> In practically every other Department there are special facilities and considerations given to the operation of a particular Department in the Gaeltacht areas.  For instance, there are the county development plans.  A local authority should be able to make exceptions for any reasons, be they economic, cultural or otherwise, in a Gaeltacht area.  For instance Bord Fáilte grant special concessions to certain areas, grants will not be available for the erection of hotels in certain areas but there will be in others.  In a planning sense it may be necessary to have less stringent considerations applicable in the Gaeltacht areas than in others.  If we must contravene a county development plan in respect of the Gaeltacht we should indicate that that was the intention of this House, when drawing up this measure, that it is a guideline to planners and the people who will operate the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I went so far as to suggest earlier that the planning appeal board, which will be set up by the Minister, should have somebody from the new Udarás na Gaeltachta and in county development plans provision should be made for the Gaeltacht areas to have names of factories, hotels and other signs in Irish.  Maybe it is possible to do a lot of these things without the amendment, but by inserting it we give a hallmark to it, which is discernible to planners and those operating planning legislation in Gaeltacht areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party take a very strong view about the matter under discussion.  They have very strong feelings that the amendment should be accepted.  We are quite satisfied that the amendment, as worded, meets the situation we are anxious to see achieved in this Bill. Our satisfaction in that matter is confirmed by the knowledge that the wording of that amendment, as included in the list of amendments in my name, has been carried out by parliamentary draftsmen and officers of the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no way in which the Minister can come back and say that what we are anxious to achieve might be <Col N="2040" /> worth while but it cannot be achieved under the amendment as worded, that if we withdraw it he will have another look at and possibly come back with an amendment on Report Stage.  We have had that approach from the Minister time and time again and on a number of occasions we have accepted the Minister's good intentions and have withdrawn our amendments on the ground that he will come forward with something on the next Stage.  We are fully satisfied that the way the amendment is worded is the best possible way it can be.  The wording is nearly identical to what was put forward in 1968. Some words have been omitted but they are not important.  I deemed they were not that important and in the Bill, which was being prepared before we left office, I intended leaving them out. I left them out in this amendment but as it stands the amendment is properly constructed.</P>
    <P>Before one debates an amendment such as this one must establish if it is Government policy to encourage the growth of the Gaeltacht areas and if it is Government policy to encourage and develop the Irish language, in its use and in every other form.  If the Government are opposed to either of those aims then I can see why they would oppose our amendment.  The Minister may be opposed to one of those aims but indications have been given by the Government that they support the development of the Gaeltacht areas.  In order that special consideration be given to Gaeltacht areas to help foster those parts of the country where the Irish language is spoken by the people and in order to foster its continued use, the Fianna Fáil Party set about introducing special aids to encourage people to live there, to try to make life easy for people living there and create employment opportunities so that the young people need not go on the emigrant ship or seek migratory jobs in other parts of the country.  These policies were actively and successfully promoted by Fianna Fáil when in Government.  In order to achieve the success we did in the Gaeltacht it involved higher rates of grants in nearly every area of development. These included special house grants, road grants, fishery grants <Col N="2041" /> and grants on every aspect of economic life in the Gaeltacht.  We had a policy to give extra assistance and provide greater incentive there than in any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>In the 1963 Planning Act it was not felt that the Government's policy in relation to the development of the Gaeltacht and the fostering of the Irish language might in any way be hindered through the operation of that Act.  It would have been difficult to foresee that at that stage.  During the years that Act has been in operation several instances have come to light where the Government's policy was not given recognition by local authorities when dealing with planning matters for the Gaeltacht areas.  The planning authorities rightly claimed that nowhere in the Planning Act did it state that, in deciding planning applications or even in drawing up development plans, there was any obligation on them to make special provision for the Government's policy in relation to the development of the Gaeltacht or the Irish language.</P>
    <P>That omission came to light and caused some difficulty over the years. Mr. Boland, who was Minister for Local Government prior to my appointment, first became aware of this and took steps to have a section included in a Bill.  That Bill had not gone through the House by the time I became Minister.  My contribution to that Bill was certain major changes. I proposed the major change, which the Minister has continued, of establishing a planning board.  Mr. Boland was not going that far and the previous Government decision was not going that far but I felt strongly about the establishment of a planning board and won support for that idea from my colleagues in Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that the preparation of that Bill was well under way.  One of the sections which I indicated quite clearly was to be included in the Bill was the one Mr. Boland had prepared, although in slightly amended form, that is the one in relation to special consideration for the Gaeltacht areas.  Most of the proposals in relation to the Planning <Col N="2042" /> Bill, which were discussed in my time, have been included in some form or other in this Bill.  Others have been added by the Minister and he has made certain changes on the proposals floating around at that time. He has agreed to most of the principles I had got agreement for from my colleagues.  We have the establishment of the planning board in this Bill but when it was published I was surprised to see he omitted the provisions in relation to the Gaeltacht. This indicated to me a certain lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Government in pursuing any policy in relation to the Gaeltacht or the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Most of the policies they have followed in this field since they came into office have done more damage than good.  There has been a lot of publicity seeking on the part of the Minister appointed in charge of the Gaeltacht but outside that there is very little result to be seen for those efforts in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>We are here debating this amendment which is introduced to place the obligation on planning authorities when deciding planning applications that arise in Gaeltacht areas that they must keep in mind the special policy the Government have in relation to the Gaeltacht and the Irish language. If the Minister wants to leave that out I can only come to the conclusion that the Government do not want to have any special consideration given to the Gaeltacht and do not want to pursue a policy of special encouragement for the growth of the Gaeltacht areas in comparison with other areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not want to see barriers but they are already there. There is the language difference, which makes the area special.  If the Government are sincere about the language, as the Fianna Fáil Party are, then he cannot but support the amendment.  So far he has been opposing it.  Something which highlights the necessity for an amendment of this kind is the fact that our Gaeltacht areas, with the exception of the Gaeltacht in County Meath, are in high amenity areas which have their own special planning difficulties.  The <Col N="2043" /> main topographical features in these areas are mountains, lakes, rivers, moors and seascapes.  With all the attempts in development plans throughout the coastal counties to try to preserve the scenic beauty of these areas for future generations one can see that it will increase planning strictures.  The difficult counties as far as planning are concerned are these coastal areas and, in many cases, they are Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Where a development is considered necessary or advantageous to the Gaeltacht but is deemed to be obstructive in a certain location the primary overall Government policy in relation to the development of the Gaeltacht must be taken into consideration.  In such a case permission must be granted and the reason given for granting that permission can state that, taking into consideration the new section we are proposing which seeks to bear in mind the special interests of the Gaeltacht and the Irish language, the decision was made to grant permission.  A statement to that effect must be adequate to justify allowing a building which was obtrusive and, in normal circumstances, would possibly have been refused. Gaeltacht areas should be given special consideration and in that sense the planning laws should not be applied as rigidly as they are intended to be applied elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Another aspect to this has been highlighted in Spiddal in County Galway.  An application was put forward for a housing development in that area on behalf of Luxury Homes, Limited.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should tell us about the <Col N="2044" /> trip to him about the Circular Road application in Galway.</P>
      <P>The community in Spiddal are very conscious of the fact that they are a Gaeltacht area.  They are proud of the Irish language heritage which is theirs and are anxious to foster it. Active groups are working in the area to achieve those aims.  This housing scheme was approved by Galway County Council.  The feeling in the Spiddal area is that the houses which could be very expensive are not being built for local people.  That intention is obvious to one who knows the average income of the people living within five or six miles of that area. Those people feel that those houses will be only within the reach of persons who are employed in Galway city who may not have any interest in the language or knowledge of it.  The fear is that they will buy the houses because they like the location.  A very difficult situation is arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people fear that if the application is allowed&mdash;it is the subject of an appeal at present&mdash;and the houses are sold to 20 families who have no knowledge or interest in the Irish language their children will be sent to school in Galway city where they can learn through English&mdash;the local school teaches through the medium of Irish.  Those children will be reared outside the environment of Spiddal and they will lose the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the language They will be a strong community <i>vis-á-vis</i> the total population in that area.  Approval of this application could mean that a strong English-speaking influence would be introduced into the heart of a solid Gaeltacht village.  If the company concerned applied for 100 houses and if they complied with the Planning Act, if the provisions for effluent were suitable, the supply of water was adequate and the site was suitable, the council would find themselves in a position of having to grant permission. If 100 families settled in Spiddal in houses out of the reach of local people they would be introduced in one concentration into the heart of a Gaeltacht village.  The effect of that must be obvious to anyone who is <Col N="2045" /> concerned about preserving and encouraging the development of the Gaeltachta and to get more people outside these areas to speak Irish.</P>
    <P>That can happen as the law stands at present.  Galway County Council cannot take into consideration any of these factors.  The council ignores completely the fact that the Government have a policy in relation to the Irish language.  In my view that must come first if there is to be sincerity in trying to implement that policy. Luxury Homes Limited propose to build 20 homes in Spiddal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The company has been discussed in newspapers, on radio and television so many times that there is no question of nobody not knowing the name of the company involved. If 20 English-speaking families move in there will be a real problem. The local community council have lodged their objections to this application. They are upset about the matter. Down the years there has been criticism of county councils who have Gaeltachts in their area.  The size of the Gaeltacht in comparison to the size of the county would be a small percentage&mdash;in Galway it is less than a quarter of the county's size.  There would not be a quarter of the population of the county living in those areas.  For this reason they will not get special consideration from the county council and they have complained that the opposite is happening. We must provide in this legislation protection against discrimination agianst them and we should see to it that they are given special consideration, which is what the Government want them to get.  The Government should either forget about the Gaeltacht and the Irish language policy and tell the people they are not interested or, if they are, they must support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sections of the Principal Act referred to in the amendment are sections 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36 and 37.  If I quote some of those the <Col N="2046" /> House will see the necessity for my amendment.  Section 26 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>...the planning authority shall be restricted to considering the proper planning and development of the area of the authority (including the preservation and improvement of the amenities thereof), regard being had to the provisions of the development plan, the provisions of any special amenity order relating to the said area...</P>
    <P>There is no reference to the Government's policy in relation to the Gaeltacht or to the overall national Government policy in relation to the Irish language.  Section 26 restricts them merely to the proper planning and development of the area.  Section 27 (1) (b) says the same thing:</P>
    <P>...the planning authority shall be restricted to considering the proper planning and development of the area of the authority...</P>
    <P>and so on.  Section 30 also provides this.  This line will be found in all of these sections.  That is the gospel of the planning authority&mdash;proper planning and development.  That is a physical thing.  There is no allowance whatsoever for consideration of anything outside of that.</P>
    <P>We say that when the application is in a Gaeltacht area the council must be allowed to take note of it being a Gaeltacht area and must take note of the Government's policy in relation to the Gaeltacht and the Irish language. Our amendment must be written into the Bill to protect the Gaeltacht community who are very special but who are ignored as if they did not exist in all of their planning legislation.  If decisions similar to the one made by Galway County Council in Spiddal were to continue to be made without any regard being had to the Gaeltacht then I can see the Gaeltacht area being destroyed.  Even though the economy of this country has been allowed to be run down by the Government to a state where we are in a deep recession, I have hopes that the Government will not last that long and that with a change of government we will be able to get this country moving again economically and be <Col N="2047" /> able to create employment opportunities and opportunities for development and that we will see some improvement in investment in the country.  It is obvious that a change of government would be necessary, having regard to the disaster we have had up to now and the weak attempt at remedial measures we had today. If that does come about, if a climate of confidence and investment can be generated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just a joke in the Gaeltacht now.  There is no point in following that one up.  If there are a series of these applications such as that in Spiddal I can see the Gaeltacht being destroyed.  Where will these people go?  They will go right into the heart of the existing villages where the councils and the Government have been providing services over the last ten years where piped water and sewerage facilities have been laid on. They will build schemes of 50, 60 and 100 houses at high prices for English-speaking people, second holiday homes for some and community homes for others who will be working in the industrial areas in the city. At the moment there is no way in <Col N="2048" /> which the local authority can stop such developments and very little the Minister can do unless he gives himself power in the legislation.  They will be going into Inverin, Lochán Beag, Carraroe, Carna, Lettermore and Lettermullen&mdash;wherever they find facilities provided, and you can say goodbye to the Gaeltacht.  It will be the Planning Act that will destroy the Gaeltacht possibly in ten years but definitely in 25 years.  This development has already started in some areas, any part of the Gaeltacht that is close to an area that has been expanded. Galway city experienced growth for a period of 15 years.  It has been hit like every other place at present.  There is not much growth there now.  The building industry has stopped, factories are closing, no new jobs being provided, people on the dole.</P>
      <P>However, we are not pessimistic enough to believe the Coalition will stay in power forever and that there will not be a change and confidence brought back.  When it does, people have to be housed, and even in that period of 15 years people have been acquiring property all around the roads, wherever they can get permission. In many cases these people have no interest in the Gaeltacht and have become a foreign influence there.  There is great danger in this, and if the Minister cannot see it I do not know what words I can use to get the message across to him.  However, that is what we are anxious to provide for, and I would appeal to him to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>At long last we really have got the thought behind this amendment.  Deputy Molloy at great length told us that only a certain type of person should live in the Gaeltacht. It is regrettable and it is a reflection on any Irishman that he should suggest where any person, whether he speaks Irish or English, should spend his life, whether it is in the Gaeltacht, in the Breac-Ghaeltacht or here in Dublin.  That is completely irrelevant. This amendment is put down for one reason, that is, to give Deputy Molloy a chance to make a speech about what Fianna Fáil have done for the Gaeltacht. <Col N="2049" /> The people of the Gaeltacht are sick and tired of listening to what Fianna Fáil have done for them, and the proof of that is in the bye-election in West Galway, when the combined votes of Labour and Fine Gael outflanked Fianna Fáil.  This is a dying effort to retrieve the ground that was lost.  Deputy Molloy need not worry. The people of the Gaeltacht are safe with the National Coalition, and the proof of our concern for them is that there was another £1,500,000 given for the Gaeltacht in today's budget. That is positive proof of where the heart of this Government lies in regard to the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>In the Kerry Gaeltacht we have a special county development plan drawn up for the Gaeltacht, tailored to meet the needs of the Gaeltacht. In that plan we shall probably be more lenient than we would normally be in so far as proposals for giving employment in the Gaeltacht are concerned.  If an industrialist came into the Kerry Gaeltacht and put his eye on a certain spot, if it was regarded as a special amenity area, in the green belt, or the blue belt or whatever you wish to call it, the industrialist will decide where he wants to go and, if we can provide the necessary water and sewerage and any other facilities that may be required, he will build his factory, having got planning permission to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very wrong that a member of this House should take the opportunity of castigating an industrialist prepared to go into the Gaeltacht, establish an industry there and build a certain number of houses for his employees, especially when the matter is under appeal. Raising it here in this House could create a hostile attitude or engender an unwelcome hysteria.  I do not know who the man is.  I do not know the first thing about him.  What I do know is that he should not be castigated here in the fashion he was.  He is prepared to provide employment and I am quite sure he did not specify that the houses he is building were for any particular nationality.  His <i>bona fides</i> should have been accepted.  If the wrong type of person was going into these houses, as Deputy Molloy suggested, there <Col N="2050" /> might be reason for complaint.  To baldly state that 20 families were going to come into Spiddal and bastardise the area is to me quite shocking.  Our own emigrants in England and in the United States of America could easily decide to spend the end of their days in the area in which they were born. Would Deputy Molloy deprive them of doing that?  What has the Fianna Fáil Party come to?</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner was not here to experience Deputy Molloy's outburst. The western counties have borne the brunt of emigration and these emigrants are quite entitled to come back to their different Gaeltachta and pass on to the young people there the knowhow they have learned in other countries. It is regrettable that any Fianna Fáil Deputy would try to deprive these people of the right to come back, but that is the kind of amendment Deputy Molloy wants made in this Bill.  It should be treated with the contempt it deserves.</P>

      <P>The suggestion was that Fianna Fáil gave them these grants and they would lose the grants if Fianna Fáil did not get back into power.  How many times did we hear that argument?  The people in the Gaeltacht today are quite sophisticated and quite mature.  They are not easily taken in.  They are prepared to welcome back the emigrant, the national from another county or the foreigner who is prepared to live in the locality and create employment for the people there.  Nationals in other counties have as much Irish now as the people who have lived all their lives in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a ploy.  Fianna Fáil want to give special status to the <Col N="2051" /> Gaeltacht.  Deputy Molloy would have planning restrictions on houses if Gaeltacht people were not going to live in them, people who know and use the Irish language and are prepared to use Irish on all occasions.  I was born in the Gaeltacht and all belonging to me were born in the Gaeltacht.  As far as I am concerned, anyone who wants to come and live in the Gaeltacht and provide employment there is welcome.  &ldquo;Special&rdquo; is not defined in this amendment.  Any industrialist will have to bring in technicians, be they Dutch, French, German or anything else, in order to develop his industry.  These technicians must be housed.  According to Deputy Molloy, they should not be housed because they will adversely affect the area.  Deputy Molloy is making a desperate effort to retrieve lost ground.  His argument here could close the door to every industrialist anxious to establish industry and create jobs in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The face of our Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Tom O'Donnell, is as well known all over the Gaeltacht as that of Arthur Guinness.  The people have confidence in him.  He has achieved a great deal for the people.  Deputy Molloy is not with it any more.  I would advise him now to give credit to the Minister who has renewed hope in the people of the Gaeltacht, the man who has brought industry to the Gaeltacht, the man who got £1½ million for the people of the Gaeltacht today.</P>

      <P>Let the Deputy take some of his own medicine for a change.  This is a two-way traffic.  The people in the Gaeltacht have confidence in this Government.  Deputy Molloy would have it that the Gaeltacht is finished if this amendment is not accepted.  The people will not be threatened any more.  They are, as I say, more sophisticated and more mature now and they know what is good for them.  If Fianna Fáil were honest and stated openly that <Col N="2052" />&ldquo;special&rdquo; meant planning restrictions as far as the Gaeltacht is concerned they should say so.  I do not know what &ldquo;special&rdquo; consideration means in planning terms for the people living in Gaeltacht areas.  Deputy Molloy has one interpretation.  He says that the special consideration should mean that any group of people or any contractor, whatever his name, if he wants to build a group of houses in the Gaeltacht should be denied that right unless he could tell the local planning authority that only Gaeltacht people, native speakers, would live in those houses.  What have we come to?  Are we going to build a wall around the people of the Gaeltacht? Are we going to make Indian reservations of the Gaeltacht areas?</P>
      <P>If industrialists, immigrants or well wishers&mdash;and there are many well wishers&mdash;want to build a holiday home in the Gaeltacht, or commute, that is their business.  While they are building their houses they are giving employment locally.  They come to the Gaeltacht for their summer holidays and allow their children to play with the Gaeltacht children, or even to go to Gaeltacht schools, to improve their Irish.  It is not for Deputy Molloy to decide where these people will build their houses.</P>
      <P>The more I look at this amendment the more convinced I am it should be rejected.  It is farcical.  I hope Deputy Molloy will see the light and withdraw the amendment.  From 1961 to 1971, over 10,000 people left the Gaeltacht We had a steadying-off from 1972 to 1975.  The people are staying there now because they have confidence in the present Minister and know he is interested in them.</P>

      <P>This amendment has not made the points Deputy Molloy wanted.  The only point he made was that a special type of person should live in the Gaeltacht.  For that reason alone the amendment should be rejected. Every county development team should have a special plan for the Gaeltacht, as we have in Kerry.  I do not know the score in Galway or Donegal.  I cannot say if they have a special development plan for the <Col N="2054" /> Gaeltacht in County Meath.

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did his job.  When the Minister left he was told to keep talking, if necessary, until the Minister got back.  I congratulate him on a very good parish pump speech.</P>
      <P>Let us take the case he mentioned of an industrialist wanting to build a factory in the Gaeltacht.  This amendment wants to ensure that he will get planning permission without strict reference to the provisions of this Bill.  In other words, when planning permission is granted, reference is had to only planning considerations, as spelt out in the Bill.  At no time was this section more necessary than now.  In the past we had Ministers who were favourably disposed towards the Gaeltacht areas.  I am sure the Minister for Local Government is also favourably disposed towards the policy of this, and past, Governments to the fostering and development of the Irish language in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>When a planning appeal came before past Ministers&mdash;I am sure the same applies to the present Minister and Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;he was in a position to say that that factory was for the Gaeltacht.  The planning authority may have recommended that it should not be granted or, if it is, there may be an appeal by a third party to the Minister.  The Minister, in carrying out Government policy towards the Gaeltacht areas, can grant planning permission despite the facts of planning considerations.  This has been done as the Minister knows. Advance factories were built in Gweedore.  The local authority could have refused planning permission.  We were lucky that we had a local authority who were favourably disposed to building these factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are writing into this Bill by way of this amendment, a statement which says that special consideration must be given, as far as planning is concerned, to Gaeltacht areas.  The situation is very different under this <Col N="2055" /> Bill.  Under this Bill the Minister will be setting up an appeals board&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and on that board will be technical planners.  One will be a high court judge or whatever the decision is.  Another may be an expert planner.  I am suggesting that somebody from Údarás na Gaeltachta should be selected as a member of that board.  Unless special consideration is given to Gaeltacht affairs, the board will decide planning appeals purely and simply on planning considerations and nothing else.  No regard will be had to whether a refusal of a planning appeal deprives a Gaeltacht area of a factory, or a hotel development, or an industry or a fish-processing industry.  Naturally a fish-processing industry must be located close to the sea.</P>

      <P>You could have a pure planner who would feel he was bound by this Planning Bill and who would not take into account anything other than purely planning considerations. This amendment is necessary because it will be a technical planning appeals board who will eventually decide on planning appeals.  Under the previous Act a Minister could use his discretion and Ministers, including the present Minister, have done this.  A board might not be as likely to lean in favour of a planning appeal from a Gaeltacht area.  Therefore it is necessary to write the amendment into the Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary made some points which were so silly that I do not want to follow them.</P>

I understand that earlier Deputy Molloy made the point Deputy Faulkner made last night about luxury houses.  Can we get this clear? The reason this amendment is introduced is that Fianna Fáil do not want luxury houses built in the Gaeltacht by people who are not Irish speakers.</P>

      <P>The suggestion is that a scheme of luxury houses should not be built if people are not Irish speakers. Deputy Cunningham now says he <Col N="2057" /> wants the amendment written in so that the planning board can give special consideration to the Gaeltacht areas.  In other words, the planning board he does not trust to give a fair decision must be given the option of giving that decision and the normal planning laws will not apply to applications from the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>It is so difficult to follow Deputy Cunningham sometimes that I am sure I can be excused if I misquote him.  The Opposition spokesman on Local Government, Deputy Faulkner, told us today about the things he did in that field when he was Minister for the Gaeltacht&mdash;about factories and so on&mdash;which he found no difficulty in doing under the existing law.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cunningham said it should be allowed if it would give employment.  He said that, while any Minister might allow it, the planning <Col N="2058" /> board might not allow it because it might not be good planning.  He wants this written in because in some peculiar way it would ensure that the planning board would do that.  If that factory were proposed to be built somewhere else where there was a lot of unemployment, and where it would not be good planning to allow it, would Deputy Cunningham say that because there was a lot of unemployment that area should be deprived of a factory?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does he make a special case that it would be done in one area and not in another?  We are right back to where we started.  It has been suggested that when Fianna Fáil were in office they were able to do wonderful things for the Gaeltacht although they were operating under the 1963 Planning Act.  We now have an improved Bill which allows the same things to be done.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht has been doing these things, as is evident to everybody, and he will continue to do them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner, Deputy Cunningham and Deputy Molloy want a section put into the Bill.  The wording is rather interesting: &ldquo;...regard may be had to the special interests of the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.&rdquo; This is to be put into a Planning Bill.  I still do not know what on earth they are talking about.  I believe the same planning laws must apply all over the country.  The local authority will make their decision and the planning board will make their decision on the evidence before them.  The same regulations should apply inside and outside the Gaeltacht. Whether the Gaeltacht is in Galway, Kerry, Donegal or Meath I believe the regulations should apply in the same way.</P>

The purpose of this amendment is to give effect to the proposal by enabling the Minister to incorporate suitable provisions in the permission regulations made under section 25 of the 1963 Act.</P>
      <P>The section leaves it to the Minister to decide when making regulations what development will be affected. An Taisce has suggested that those costing over £5 million should have to submit a study with the application for permission and the Minister might decide on a lower figure but still high enough to catch only major applications.  The proposal is to some extent experimental and the cost level can be altered in the light of experience, if necessary.  I think it is important that it should be included.</P>

      <P>In page 19, between lines 24 and 25, before paragraph (f) to insert the following paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f)  the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (1) of section 38:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1A)  A planning authority in entering into an agreement under this section may join with anybody which is a prescribed authority for the purposes of section 21 of this Act.&rsquo;;</P>
      <P>(g)  the substitution in section 38 (2) of &lsquo;the planning authority or any body joined with them&rsquo; for &lsquo;the planning authority&rsquo; where that expression firstly occurs and of &lsquo;the planning authority or such body, as may be appropriate,&rsquo; for &lsquo;the planning authority&rsquo; where the expression secondly occurs; and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 38 of the 1963 Act enables a planning authority to make an agreement with a landowner to restrict or regulate the development or use of land and they are empowered to enforce the agreement against his successors in title.  An Taisce have entered into agreements of a similar kind, for example, for preservation of open land on Howth Head, and have requested that certain prescribed authorities be given the same powers as planning authorities to enforce such agreements so that they will not lapse when the owner dies or sells the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, since it is the function of the planning authority to control the development and use of land, the amendment proposed is a compromise. A prescribed authority may negotiate an agreement with a landowner <Col N="2064" /> as at present or, if they want it to be enforceable under section 38, they may negotiate the agreement on the basis that the planning authority will become a party to it.  Alternatively, they may approach the planning authority first and secure joint negotiations with the landowner.  The effect of the new paragraph (g) will be that if the planning authority join with a prescribed authority in any agreement under the section, it may be enforced by either authority against persons deriving title under the landowner with whom it was concluded.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 90:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  the insertion of the following new section before section 42:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;41A (1)  It shall be the duty of the Minister to protect and preserve the natural environment of Ireland.</P>
      <P>(2)  To enable him to discharge his duty under this section the Minister shall have power to issue from time to time to a planning authority such directives as he considers necessary for this purpose and the planning authority shall comply with such directives.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
      <P>What I am seeking to do in this amendment should be clear from its wording.  I am concerned, and I know many other Deputies, members of the public and organisations are concerned, with the need to preserve our natural environment.  There will be fairly general agreement that in Ireland we are still lucky to have a comparatively unspoiled environment.  Relative to other European countries we are fortunate to a considerable degree, but I do not think we can be complacent about the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2065" /> It is clear that there are continual inroads being made on the natural beauty and fine environment which have been handed down to us as our heritage.  I suppose this is inevitable with the demands of economic development, industrialisation and the development of intensive methods of agriculture, and we cannot expect, unless we do something about it, that this will remain for any length of time.</P>
    <P>There is widespread recognition of the need for vigilance in this respect.  I am more concerned with the natural environment in the sense of the beauty of the countryside and the conservation of that beauty and the many scenic areas we have, the many recreational areas we have and the amenities in rural Ireland, because in so far as our architectural and archaeological heritage is concerned something is being done.  Certainly, the planning laws are there to ensure that in so far as urban areas and construction developments are concerned, there is control.  I am more concerned with the natural countryside and I believe that in our administrative set-up the situation is not as clear and concise as it should be.</P>
    <P>By now, there is a vague recognition that the Minister for Local Government is the appropriate Minister to protect our environment and to have responsibility for its protection.  I am not sure that this is at this stage anything more than an informal Government agreement.  From time to time there have been controversies between different Departments and, perhaps, different Ministers, as to who has particular responsibility for different matters in the field of conservation and preservation of the natural environment, and I want to make it clear that one Minister will have special responsibility for the very important task of preserving our natural beauty to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>I want to place central responsibility on the Minister for Local Government. I want it spelled out in statute that the Minister for Local Government is the Minister responsible, that he has this duty that it is not something he undertakes on the side, as it were&mdash;that in addition to his other responsibilities he <Col N="2066" /> has casual regard to the need for conservation and preservation.  I want it spelled out in statute, and this seems to be the most appropriate statute for doing so, that the Minister for Local Government has a special statutory duty or obligation placed on him by the Oireachtas to undertake this work.</P>
    <P>I feel there is a need to do this.  By now a situation has evolved, but it is no more than that, whereby the Minister for Local Government is generally regarded by the public, and perhaps by his colleagues, as being the Minister responsible, but this position should be defined by statute. I purport to do that in subsection (1) of my proposed amendment which states:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the Minister to protect and preserve the natural environment of Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is a straightforward expression of what his duty is.  In my proposed subsection (2) I go on to confer powers on him in discharge of that duty placed on him by subsection (1). I propose to give him the power from time to time to issue to a planning authority such directives as he considers necessary for this purpose. That is a necessary power to give to the Minister if he is to be enabled to discharge the responsibility subsection (1) places on him.</P>
    <P>Without purporting to have any unjustifiable pride of authorship, this is a commendable amendment because what it suggests is something which ought to be done.  The Minister should be charged specifically with this responsibility.  He should have this power in the interest of the protection of the environment, in addition to any other planning powers he has.  To some extent he is to be removed now from planning matters because of the handing over of planning appeal work to the new board. There is some anxiety for me in this because I like to think that whatever aberrations local authorities might engage in from time to time, there is a central figure, someone who would always have regard in planning matters to the need to preserve and conserve our environment.</P>
    <P>Because of the pressures on them, <Col N="2067" /> it is understandable that local authorities might not always have due regard to environmental considerations. Up to now at least the Minister was there as a person with overall responsibility who could to some extent be relied on to ensure that conservation matters were not overlooked entirely in the administration of planning laws.  Because he is being removed from this capacity it is all the more necessary that the Minister should have this specific power to direct planning authorities on environmental matters as he deems necessary.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in various indirect ways in the planning laws the Minister has some powers which would enable him in certain circumstances to take action in regard to the environment, but he could act only in that way in so far as these matters would arise on planning matters.  I wish him to have separate and distinct authority as the environment Minister to ensure that anything that needs to be done to preserve our natural environment in any part of the country will be done, and this specific power to give a directive, a directive which would have no justification other than being given in pursuance of his responsibility and his duty to preserve our natural environment.</P>
    <P>I see a great need for this amendment and I trust that the Minister will be prepared to consider it favourably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  As Deputy Haughey said, there has been always a considerable amount of controversy as to who was responsible for the protection of the environment.  Some years ago there was an <i>ad hoc</i> type of agreement in relation to this question. During my term of office as Minister for Lands I remember that Department being the centre of the question. There were always arguments as to who was responsible for an area above or below a certain line on a mountain.  This is a matter of great importance and it would be of considerable help in the protection of the <Col N="2068" /> environment if a Minister were responsible.  As Deputy Haughey has said, while we may have suffered in this country to some extent as a result of our industrial development, our environment is in a very much better state of preservation than is the case in the more highly developed industrialised countries.</P>
      <P>We are in a position to take the necessary steps to preserve our natural amenities.  We can learn much from the industrialised countries in relation to the various problems they had to cope with.  In some instances they were too late in attending to these problems to overcome them.  We can learn from them in that respect, too.</P>
      <P>The Minister is in the best possible position to acquire the necessary information and advice and to apply it where necessary.  This ought to be highlighted in the Bill so that not only will the Minister be the responsible authority in this respect but that he will have the power to put into effect the authority and responsibility he would have if this amendment were adopted.  I, too, ask the Minister to consider the amendment favourably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a planning Bill and I am grateful to Deputy Faulkner for highlighting something to which I wished to refer.  The Bill is for the purpose of amending the law in relation to physical planning which is an important means of protecting the natural environment, but the Minister for Local Government has no monopoly of responsibility in this regard. Deputy Faulkner brought out this point forcibly by indicating that other Ministers concerned included the Minister for Lands.  Section 11 of the Wildlife Bill now in the Seanad says that it shall be a function of the Minister&mdash;meaning the Minister for Lands&mdash;to secure the conservation of wildlife.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been difficult to do that without having heard Deputy Haughey's explanation of it because it did not read in the way he has explained it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the Minister for Lands the Minister for Finance would be involved also in these matters in so far as the Office of Public Works are responsible for national monuments, parks and waterways while the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has a responsibility in relation to the preservation of our fishery resources. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, for instance, is responsible for development programmes which call for various environmental constraints. The question of wetlands is affected by arterial drainage and, consequently, would come within the ambit of the Office of Public Works.  It can hardly be suggested that the Minister for Local Government should decide on such matters as arterial drainage.  If the Department were to deal with all these other matters we would need Liberty Hall as well as the Custom House to cater for the staff numbers that would be required.  It would not be appropriate to impose overall responsibility on the Minister for Local Government without having regard to the implications involved, and it is not right that an attempt should be made to do this in a planning Bill.  I can understand Deputy Haughey's point of view.  As a country man, I can see the necessity for dealing with these matters.  But the Ministers who have this responsibility must carry it out.  I do not think it would be practicable to have a particular Minister covering all of these things because it would impinge on various functions of other Departments and other Ministers.  I would not be prepared to agree that this amendment should be included in the Bill unless <Col N="2070" /> Deputy Haughey has further words of wisdom to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's reaction.  First of all, my amendment was down long before that Wildlife Bill saw the light of day. Indeed it was the delay in coming forward with that Wildlife Bill that was responsible, to some extent for my putting down this amendment because the Minister for Lands&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is satisfied now that it is down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not because the Wildlife Bill is very restrictive in its terms and refers merely to wildlife.  In this business of the environment we are concerned with very much more.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands will confirm that on a number of occasions I approached him informally to ask him when that Wildlife Bill would surface. From that point of view the fact that that particular section which the Minister quoted to me is in the Wildlife Bill does not in any way invalidate my arguments in favour of this amendment. Certainly from my time in Government I would have been justified in thinking that by now the Minister for Local Government was regarded throughout the Departments as the Minister with primary responsibility for environmental preservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Faulkner has mentioned already, in our time there was a considerable amount of inter-Departmental dispute about these matters.  I am not sure what degree of formality the decision had but I think there was a fairly positive type of decision then that the Minister for Local Government had overall and particular responsibility for the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was very informal, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it was very informal but, at the time, there was a clearcut dispute on some issue between the Departments of Local <Col N="2071" /> Government and Lands.  As far as we as a Government were concerned the matter was resolved, in that responsibility was placed on the Minister for Local Government for these matters, which was in Deputy Blaney's time as Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the things on which the Minister has elaborated support the case for my amendment?  The Minister has elaborated on all the different Departments and sections of Departments involved in this matter.  The fact that so many people are involved would indicate that what is everybody's business is nobody's business. I do not think we can expect anything in the nature of an overall approach and I believe that such is badly needed.  We have not any hope of getting anything like a composite overall approach when various Departments and sections of Departments have responsibilities in this matter which they may or may not take seriously.  I am quite certain most of them do not take them seriously.  In pursuance of their primary objectives they have very slight regard for environmental considerations. For instance, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, in its activities, would certainly impinge on environmental matters.  It is only natural, in the order of things, that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries be concerned primarily with increasing agricultural output and farmers' incomes.  If it is particularly enlightened it may from time to time have regard on the side to environmental considerations, but they will not occupy a central part in the thoughts or activities of that Department, and the same would apply to other Departments.  In fact the only Department of which I am aware with any great motivation in environmental matters is the Department of Lands.  The Forestry and Wildlife Section of the Department of Lands is excellent and in it I found wonderful enthusiasm for and great dedication to the cause of the environment. But, apart from that section of the Department of Lands&mdash;and, of course, excluding the Department of <Col N="2072" /> Local Government from what I am saying&mdash;there is not any great dedication or motivation in any of the other Departments, with perhaps the exception of elements in the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister enumerated so many people, organisations and Government units as having a function or being involved in this matter is a clear indication of the need for a central responsibility.  In fact what I am seeking is that the Minister for Local Government would become, in effect, our Minister for the Environment, because I feel that central responsibility and authority is needed.  If responsibility is diffused throughout different sections of different Departments who are allowed to proceed in their own way, without any regard to a central programme, then I would be very pessimistic about the future outlook.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that by putting down this amendment I was merely spelling out in a statute the <i>de facto</i> situation.  I thought it was generally understood that the Minister has this responsibility.  I merely wanted to put it beyond doubt: place on him the statutory responsibility, just as he has statutory responsibility in regard to housing; we do not leave the social need for housing at large, to be provided by any Department that feels it can make a contribution, because it is a serious social matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very wise decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We place specific responsibility in that area on one Minister.  We say it is his job; the statutes say it is his job to have responsibility for housing, to produce housing, and we will give him all the authority and finance necessary to do so.  The environment is not perhaps fundamentally as important as housing but will become increasingly a very important area of public administration. There is a national need for it.  It is not too late in the day yet.  But time is not on our side and developments are taking place daily which threaten the wonderful, beautiful, natural environment handed down to us.  Perhaps our <Col N="2073" /> generation has a more acute responsibility in this regard than any other&mdash;to act now, to make sure that any inroads that have or are being made are stopped and that henceforth we have a rational, sensible and enlightened approach to the whole problem of the environment.  We can do that only if we place the solemn, statutory obligation on one, central Minister and I believe the apropriate Minister to be the Minister for Local Government because of the way things have evolved.  Had things evolved differently it might have been the Minister for Lands but, at this stage, the rational, sensible thing to do is to make the Minister for Local Government the Minister for the Environment; give him the responsibility; place on him the duty; grant him the authority and power I have set out in subsection (2) to compel planning authorities throughout the country to comply with his overall central programme on environmental preservation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government has primary responsibility for certain environmental matters. There was an inter-departmental committee set up late last year on the environment on which practically all Departments are represented.  They do co-ordinate environmental matters as far as possible.  Environment policy is and must continue to be an overall policy, and no one Minister can ever be solely responsible for it.  If by legislation you made one Minister solely responsible for it, it would probably mean that every other Minister would disclaim responsibility.  Let Deputy Haughey think for a minute what would happen.  How would the Minister for Local Government be able to enter into the various things which would arise under other Departments? Take wildlife, for instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>They are not the way they used to be long ago.  There are good ones now.  The last state could be worse than the first and you could finish up, as the Deputy said, with everybody's business but nobody's business.  The Minister for Local Government would be responsible for other Departments where he could not possibly, except in the way he is now doing, be able to find out what would happen.  Ministers would rightly say that they do not have to have officials looking after that particular thing because that is the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government. The result is that the Minister for Local Government could find himself worrying about the Minister for Lands' Wildlife Bill, as one example.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I want to leave responsibility where it lies.  It is a very big item.  If this was a matter which could be dealt with like that I am quite sure it would have been dealt with long ago but it is a very big issue.  We are dealing with a Planning Bill and Deputy Haughey suggests in the middle of it a very major Government decision affecting a big number of Government Departments, even the Department of Foreign Affairs, because the EEC comes into this. They would have to be involved and all their responsibilities would be handed over to the Minister for Local Government who, in addition to everything else he has to do, would be responsible for that.  I do not think it is a reasonable suggestion and I do not think the amendment is reasonable. I do not think it is workable.  If it was I would, as Deputy Haughey knows, be glad to consider it.  I have looked at it and have had it examined. I do not see in what way it could <Col N="2075" /> improve the position and I do not want to have something which will do more harm than good included in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the attitude of the Minister in relation to this amendment.  He should know that unless some particular person is responsible for the protection and preservation of the natural environment nobody will be responsible for it. If you delegate responsibility to a number of Departments it is very difficult to pinpoint who is really responsible for failure in any one particular aspect of the protection of the environment.</P>
      <P>We have an opportunity in this Bill to provide that responsibility should lie with the Minister for Local Government. The Minister will recall that during the last few weeks I addressed a number of questions to him on many matters relating to the environment, particularly in relation to sanitary services, refuse collections and the environment in general.  In all cases the Minister told me these were the responsibility of local authorities and that his Department had no responsibility in those matters.</P>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that various local authorities could take different views and accept different attitudes in relation to these matters. Unless there are some guidelines set down and some principles arrived at I believe we will not have uniformity. We will also have local authorities who will not live up to their responsibilities. We should bear in mind that local authorities have not finance at their disposal and they have not got technical staff with time available to learn the expertise and to get ahead with work of protection and preservation of the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are different problems affecting local authorities and planning authorities.  If there are not guidelines laid down by some responsible person and some responsible Department, who have fully researched the matter, it will be virtually impossible to enforce uniformity among local authorities and planning authorities <Col N="2076" /> in relation to the prevention of pollution and other matters affecting the environment.  Now is the time to designate responsibility to some particular person in some particular Department.  The Minister for Local Government and his Department should accept responsibility for the implementation of an overall policy and for research guidelines.  We have a golden opportunity now to provide for this in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary is a little offbeat because he is talking about local government.  He is complaining about the fact that I have stated, in reply to questions by him, that the responsibility for certain things was left to the local authorities. They are under Local Government at the present time and they would not be affected in any way by Deputy Haughey's amendment, because local authorities are not responsible to any other Minister. They are responsible to the Minister for Local Government.  This has very little to do with the section but what I said in reply, and what I am repeating now, is that matters which are carried out by local authorities are their responsibility.  I would not be thanked by Deputy O'Leary or anybody else if I started giving directions to every local authority as to what they should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people in this country who believe that a dictator would be a great person and that he could give any directions he wanted. I am pledged to give more authority to local authorities and I am doing that.  I certainly will not take back from them the authority they already have and the control they have over refuse collection and things like this, which Deputy O'Leary spoke about. He did not think I would be spreading out to other Departments that this was the way it should be done. There is no question of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other Departments already have this responsibility.  I am saying that I do not propose in this Bill to take responsibility for environmental <Col N="2077" /> matters which are covered by other Ministers.  I would be very foolish to attempt to do it because I do not think it could be done effectively.  It certainly could not be done effectively in the Planning Bill.  In relation to planning matters, no matter what Department are covered, they are my responsibility.  It is already laid down in the Bill that I have that responsibility. Deputy Haughey wants to go further and to put a general clause in that the Minister for Local Government should be responsible for all environmental matters, and it does not matter what way they are affected.  I have instanced the Wildlife Bill.  He suggests I should be responsible for the way in which wildlife is protected. I do not think, if he reflects on it, that he will accept I should, because it would be a most unreasonable suggestion.  He believes the Minister for Local Government should be responsible for arterial drainage, which is carried out by the Office of Public Works, in so far as it affects wet lands and things like that.  One will find that in fact the Minister for Local Government would be expected to be able to go into the area covered by all Departments, with the exception of the Departments of Justice and Defence, and carry out functions which are at present the functions of other Ministers.  I do not see how I or any other Minister for Local Government could do it.  It would be foolish of me to accept responsibility for something which I believe cannot be done.</P>
    <P>We have an inter-departmental committee co-ordinating as far as possible matters which come under the general cover of the Department of Local Government but which impinge on other Departments.  I am sorry Deputy Haughey is under the impression&mdash;I know he is interested in having this tied up properly&mdash;that the position is otherwise.  I do not think a Planning Bill is the place to attempt this.  I do not think that what he suggests can be done anywhere or that a Minister for Local Government should be held responsible for all other Departmental environmental effects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2078" /> In reply to Deputy O'Leary, this is already a matter for Local Government, and when I say to him in this House that it is not my responsibility if Kerry County Council or Tralee Urban Council do not carry out their refuse collection correctly or, if they have a dump which is improperly handled, I mean it and I do not propose to tell them how they should do these things.  In the first instance that is a matter for the elected representatives there and in the second instance for the officials who are paid by that local authority to do the job properly.  That all comes under the umbrella of the Department of Local Government who must have overall control over it.  A few weeks ago I sent out circulars to local authorities advising them on the expert advice I have as to how they should ensure that these matters are looked after.  I do not propose to go to an individual local authority and tell them that a dump is not being run properly or that they should do it in a different way.  No one could reasonably expect me to do that.  Deputy O'Leary is completely off the beam when he refers to that in the context of this amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey feels that the question of environment should be the responsibility of one Minister, the Minister for Local Government, but I do not agree.  Therefore I would not be prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fundamental mistake in what the Minister is saying.  On a number of occasions he told me that different sections of different Government Departments have responsibility in this matter.  That is the fundamental mistake.  There are different Departments of State and different sections of different Departments whose activities impinge on the environment, whose activities and operations have an effect on our environment. However those Departments have no responsibility for the environment. Nobody is telling those Departments that in pursuance of their arterial drainage or some other activity which is a routine activity as far as they are concerned they must have regard to environmental considerations.  That is <Col N="2079" /> the flaw in the Minister's argument.  He is endeavouring to paint a picture where all sections in different Departments have responsibility for the environment and are all pursuing and discharging that responsibility.  That is not the position and it is for that reason that I tabled this amendment.</P>
      <P>Other Departments do things and have functions which affect the environment but as far as I know none of them has any responsibility for protecting the environment.  I want to place on the Minister for Local Government that central responsibility.  I want him to have a central observation responsibility over the activities of every Government Department and every private citizen whose activities affect the environment.  In so far as a Government Department are carrying out drainage work or anything else involving environmental implications the Minister for Local Government should be consulted about them.  There is nothing new in that and there is no innovation involved in Government Departments consulting another Government Department about responsibility in regard to work they are carrying out.  It happens daily; it is a regular process of Government.  If a Department decides to do something they study it to see if another Department is involved and then consult that Department before they go ahead.  That is the sort of situation I want to create in regard to the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the Minister's approach, because every other country in Europe has a Minister for the Environment.  Surely that Minister has overall responsibility of the sort I am trying to give to our Minister for Local Government.  In Great Britain the Minister who was responsible for Local Government matters is now the Minister for the Environment.  Housing is now under the Minister for the Environment in Great Britain.  That is the sort of situation I want to bring about here.  I want one Minister to have responsibility for the environment and have the power to do something about it.  In so far as any other Department, organisation, or individual is doing anything with environmental <Col N="2080" /> implications the Minister for Local Government should have an overall supervisory function in regard to that.  That can be spelt out later.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the Minister's rejection of assuming this duty because I believe he has it already by implication. People look to him and expect him to be discharging this responsibility in pollution matters which is an important element of environmental policy.  It is the Minister for Local Government who is regarded as the Minister in charge.  Why do people look to the Minister for Local Government about pollution?  Why do they not go to the Minister for Lands or to the Office of Public Works?  They do not because the Minister for Local Government is the natural person to have central responsibility for pollution matters and all the things which are now beginning to evolve into a new significance and importance. People look to the Minister for Local Government to have a function and a responsibility in regard to all these matters.  I want that spelt out in a clear cut fashion in a Statute and have the matter attended to in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Haughey's amendment. This question of pollution of the environment is not one of amenity.  It is a vitally important economic and social matter.  The question of preserving the environment and preserving the living capacity of our island to support life has already been spelt out.  It goes beyond amenity.  Unfortunately, many of the advocates of conservation fall into the trap of thinking of it as an amenity or as an aesthetic beauty. We must drive it home that this is a vital matter from the point of view of economics and of the social life of the community.  The price will be paid in the future.</P>
      <P>We have not yet controlled and we have not yet been required to pay the colossal cost of salvage and repair when the damage has been done.  This could be expanded on at length, but already our lakes, our rivers, even the sea around us, is polluted.  It is only this week I heard of the state of pollution in Dublin Bay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to support Deputy <Col N="2081" /> Haughey's amendment here with all the vehemence I can and with the greatest sincerity.  I think I can claim to have some little knowledge of one aspect of this, the conservation of energy, and certainly the physical aspects of this problem, and I would just make one comment which might put the matter into perspective.  It often arises that there is a conflict between an industrial activity or a developmental activity and the preservation of the environment.  These two things are not necessarily contradictory, but what is required is somebody who will co-ordinate and see that the maximum advantage for one is not achieved at the complete cost of the other and that by attention to both factors the maximum benefit for the community can be obtained.  I will not deal with the modern cases which are <i>sub judice</i> or already decided, but I would instance the case where we established a chemical factory down the country, and I elicited by questions in another place the information that the activities of the nitrogen factory were a factor in the agricultural people leaving Shelton Abbey. That was unnecessary.  I am chemist enough to know that with a little care and some little expense&mdash;it would have meant expense&mdash;the damage done by that chemical factory to the trees and to the area that was done at that time need not have been done. I pointed that out on another occasion.</P>
    <P>What is the relevance of that point in Deputy Haughey's amendment? The relevance is co-ordination.  Somebody, as Deputy Haughey has pointed out, must have the overall authority to co-ordinate, to decide and to prescribe. For these reasons I have pleasure in supporting Deputy Haughey very strongly in everything he has said on this amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 22 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 reads:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Let me get around to it in another way.  What Deputy Haughey is suggesting is:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2084" />&ldquo;(a)  the insertion of the following new section before section 42:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;41A (1)  It shall be the duty of the Minister to protect and preserve the natural environment of Ireland.</P>
    <P>(2)  To enable him to discharge his duty under this section the Minister shall have power to issue from time to time to a planning authority such directives as he considers necessary for this purpose and the planning authority shall comply with such directives.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 42 (1) says:</P>
    <P>Where it appears to the planning authority that by reason of its outstanding natural beauty, its special recreational value or a need for nature conservation...</P>
    <P>This is the same thing.  In fact, the local authorities and the Minister have that responsibility already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not indeed.  What I am arguing is that, having had the responsibility&mdash;and Deputy Haughey is perfectly correct, the Minister for Local Government has responsibility for environmental matters&mdash;it is not reasonable to say that he should take over, in addition to the powers he has, all the powers which other Ministers have in relation to the environment.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I include myself in that ignorance because the whole thing was quite new to us.  Ever since I have become increasingly convinced that what is now being sought by this amendment is vitally essential because, in the last analysis, it puts the onus on the Minister for Local Government, not because he is Minister for Local Government but because the onus should be on someone to ensure that other Departments' interests from an environmental point of view may be, as it were, fringe interests in relation to their other interests in any particular type of operation&mdash;I am thinking of the Board of Works and arterial drainage, of semi-State bodies like the ESB and Bord na Móna&mdash;and the danger is that those fringe interests may be submerged or ignored altogether.  A great deal of light has come since my time in Local Government as far as planning is concerned.</P>
      <P>In the different Departments with a fringe interest the vested interests are jealously guarded and they will not allow these vested interests to be, as it were, infringed by the Minister for Local Government in order the better to protect and preserve our environment. That is No. 1.  Secondly, and this is equally important, they have their own little pushcarts to push around and they like to get involved in this matter of preserving the environment with their own little pushcarts in their own little way without any regard at all to the overall background of physical planning or, as I think of it, the infrastructure around and upon which everything else must be built.</P>

    <P>This is a concept for which I fought in my day and I have no doubt Deputy Haughey will have many recollections of the battle waged and the battle was being won.  But now the victory is being thrown away by the Minister for Local Government, who does not see how necessary this is and who is not really pushing his little cart far enough and not putting his <Col N="2087" /> feet down flat enough to ensure physical planning is carried out properly, that we have the infrastructure on which all other development must take place.  If this is not done we are wasting not necessarily all our time but certainly a great deal of our effort.</P>
    <P>All we have to do is look around us, back over the years since 1963, to see the wasteful expenditure on unnecessary development and the total lack of expenditure on that which was socially desirable.  For some reason the infrastructure that should be there is not there, whether because of lack of money or lack of drive on the part of local authorities I do not really know. Socially desirable development has had to be passed over because the proper infrastructure industrially, socially and otherwise has been passed by, possibly because the money is not there to do all at the one time.</P>
    <P>The Minister is being too modest in his approach to this matter.  I do not say that in any carping fashion but out of my own belief, conviction and experience.  The Minister said he does not want to be a dictator but there has got to be somebody somewhere finally who can say to any Department: &ldquo;You may not do it that way, good though it may seem from your point of view, because it will spoil something that is irreplaceable.  This is how it should be done&rdquo;.  Unless that power and authority and responsibility are enshrined in this planning legislation tonight then this planning legislation will be no great improvement on what is already there.  And there are many gaps in what is there.</P>
    <P>The jealousies of Departments may not be known or appreciated and neither may the manner in which they can mobilise the brains within these Departments to advance what would appear to be unanswerable cases as to why the kinds of things we are talking about here should be done. There is within the Minister's Department sufficient expertise and knowhow to combat and refute all arguments advanced by these little tin gods in other Departments trying to insist things will be done in their way. It should be the job of the Minister <Col N="2088" /> for Local Government and his Department to decide.  Had the progression been as I think it should have been, then it is not only the Minister for the Environment we would be talking about here.  We would also be thinking in the much wider context of the concept of a Minister for Planning and Construction. If that were the position, he would be not only in at the beginning and the end of all the planning of the infrastructure but he would be in as the building agent for all of the other Departments, many of which are meddling and peddling in building, and not to the best advantage, economically, financially or, indeed, aesthetically.</P>
    <P>I would strongly advocate to the Minister despite his apparent conviction, and after due consideration, to have a very serious look at the concept suggested by the amendment but not necessarily in the words proposed. I abhor the fact that the Minister has opted out as the final arbiter on appeals from local authorities and that he is setting up a faceless body with an autonomy nobody will be able to challenge.  That is the greatest disaster that has happened.  The reason I decided to intervene in this debate is because this amendment is the only saving grace in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he disliked dictating to local authorities.  Might I suggest that he needs to retain the right and authority he has at present to dictate to local authorities, not only to tell them what to do, but to tell them how to do it and, as is enshrined in the 1966 Housing Act, if they are not doing it to do it for them and charge them.  This is what a Minister for Local Government should be doing, not that he should have to do it often.</P>
    <P>I am on record as saying that I have the greatest possible respect for our elected bodies whose opinion or calculated guess goes on the order refusing, granting, or giving, subject to conditions, planning permission through a local authority but by the manager.  Yet the Minister has decided that he, at the top of the tree, will discard his responsibility and give that job to this faceless body.  They <Col N="2089" /> will do a job all right, and if they do a bad job they will not have to face the people or this House.  They are answerable to nobody.  The responsibility for that lies on the people of this House who pass this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise.  I may well have strayed, but if I did it was because I believe that it is relevant to the argument that this amendment should be looked at again with the greatest possible care by the Minister because, in my mind, it is the last vestige, the last hope, we have that the Minister will retain the powers he already has, that is, having the last word on planning development and preservation of our environment. Now he is opting out of the appeals system.</P>
      <P>If the Minister had kept his power I would not be very concerned whether this amendment was considered or not.  But he has opted out and unless this amendment is further considered he may be out of the picture altogether.  The Minister for Lands may be responsible for wild life.  The Office of Public Works, in conjunction with, say, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will be responsible for arterial drainage. Those two departments may be at loggerheads because if one specific area is drained too well to meet agricultural needs the wild life will probably disappear.  Who will determine the balance?  What role does the Minister for Local Government play in this?  Who in the Government will arbitrate?  Why can we not revert to the system which was working, that is, if there was an objection to an exempted development by any department, there had to be consultation with the Minister for Local Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has that gone out the window or is there any provision in this Bill to reenact it and give it legal standing, to give it teeth and to give the Minister for Local Government a proper say? Are we dealing with a Minister for Local Government&mdash;and I do not say <Col N="2090" /> this in a derogatory fashion&mdash;who does not feel this way about this part of his job?  Does he feel that planning is a nuisance&mdash;and it is from the point of view of work&mdash;and the further he can push it away the better?  If that is his outlook it is regrettable, and may be responsible for the type of Bill we have here and the replacement of himself as the final arbiter by a board.  It is also understandable why he considers this amendment should not be considered. But I do not accept that.  If that is not his outlook I sincerely ask him to look at the intentions behind the amendment, rather than necessarily the wording of it, and to take into account that this is the one way in which there can be a figure within the Government who will carry on behalf of the Government the final responsibility of determining what is good and what is bad for the environment. This is worth doing and the Minister has nothing to lose by looking into not just the sections surrounding it, but the implications of the Minister's role on behalf of the Irish people of today and tomorrow for the conservation and preservation of the best in our environment.</P>
    <P>People have said that we are fortunate because we have a lot which is still unspoilt.  I said that in 1963 but a great deal has been spoiled since then. Much of this has been because there was not the thoroughness at the top that is required to tell local authorities where they are falling down on their job and how to do it properly. That is not being done.  The Minister prides himself on not dictating.  I do not believe in dictation but I do believe in being dictatorial when that is the only way to get the job done. The Minister must do that.  Otherwise we may throw our hat at the whole concept of planning and the years in between will have been wasted.  It will have been a waste of time, effort and money if we are to blow it all now.</P>

While we are amending it, and while we found a good many things to complain about in it, the good sense of Deputy Blaney who was then Minister for Local Government and all the Members of the House resulted in the production of an excellent Act of its kind.

      <P>What the Minister has introduced and what I abhor about this was attempted several times after I left the Department of Local Government but, because I was still in the Government, it was thrown out and if I were in the Minister's Government it would be thrown out as well.  It is a bloody disaster.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy's opinion and he is entitled to his opinion.  The battles he won must not have had anything to do with planning because, if they had to do with planning, some constructive effort would have been made to do something about it and nothing was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points on which this Government were elected was a proposal to introduce a system of planning appeals by means of a board. That is what we are now doing.  With the exception of Deputy Callanan and Deputy Blaney, all Members of the House consider that a planning board is the right idea.  There is no point in saying this is something I thought up. Whether or not it is my idea does not really matter.  It is a Government proposal and it is supported by about 99 per cent of the Members on all sides of the House.  No matter who the Minister <Col N="2092" /> for Local Government is, he will always be blamed for making a decision. It depends on which side of the fence you are on whether you agree with the decision or disagree with it.  A scapegoat has to be found and the scapegoat is blamed.  The person who makes up his mind whether the decision was right or wrong usually sees about four lines in a newspaper saying planning permission was given or refused.  He makes a decision and writes reams of correspondence on whether or not the decision was right without knowing a damn thing about it.  An Bord Pleanála will now make the decision and nobody can accuse them of being biased.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey's amendment suggests that it shall be the duty of the Minister to protect and preserve the natural environment of Ireland.  Does Deputy Haughey suggest that the Minister should be able to decide whether a planning decision on a matter does or does not affect the natural environment of Ireland?  Does he believe any Minister for Local Government should be in a position to say to the board that a decision they made adversely affects the environment?  If he does, does this mean they must reverse their decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey was sitting beside his colleagues when they were making <Col N="2094" /> the case that under no circumstances should any Minister for Local Government have the right to direct the board on individual matters.

      <P>When the case to which I assume the Deputy refers first came to the attention of our embassy to Belgium arrangements were made immediately for an officer of the embassy to visit the Irish citizen concerned in the prison where he was being detained.  Subsequently this officer paid another visit to the prisoner.  Special facilities were afforded by the Department for the rapid transmission from Ireland to Belgium of papers required in connection with the defence of the accused.  Our embassy has satisfied itself as to the welfare of this citizen who is being well treated and is not in solitary confinement.  The embassy considers that his legal interests are fully and adequately provided for and it is keeping in the closest touch with the case.  It will do everything appropriate to its functions and subject to the advice of the counsel for the defence, to be of whatever assistance it can possibly be to the accused man.  The embassy is in virtually daily contact with the Belgian counsel who has been retained for the defence of this Irish citizen.</P>
