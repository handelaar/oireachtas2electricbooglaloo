    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask one or two questions on this Estimate. On the last occasion the Estimate was before the House Deputies on this side put forward a case for a contribution by the State towards the purchase and acquisition of the lands at Fota Island. We pointed out that this was a matter in the national interest, that this was a public amenity which ought to be acquired in the national interest.  The <Col N="1057" /> response from the Minister at the time was that this was purely a local amenity and did not, therefore, warrant any contribution by the State for its acquisition and it should be acquired by the local authorities concerned.  Unfortunately the local authorities concerned&mdash;Cork Corporation and Cork County Council&mdash;did not find it within their financial ability to acquire this estate.  In the meantime it was stated publicly that the authorities of University College, Cork, were interested in its acquisition for their own purposes. If that were the case then the State would, willy-nilly, have to make a contribution and the property would be used exclusively for the purposes of University College, Cork, to the exclusion of the public at large.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to anticipate what plans UCC may have for the use of these lands in the event of acquisition. If the authorities of UCC do not acquire the property then, as far as is known, it is unlikely to be acquired by anybody because of the strictures on its use.  In the light of recent developments I want to ask the Minister, or his Parliamentary Secretary, to consider again the acquisition of Fota Island and make a contribution from the State to supplement the amounts the two local authorities&mdash;Cork County Council and Cork Corporation&mdash;are prepared to make available.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to raise is a matter I want to deal with as objectively as possible.  Two years ago, the Parliamentary Secretary will remember, in the course of the debate on the Estimate for the Office of Public Works I raised with him the possibility of the acquisition of an official residence for the Taoiseach.  No reference has been made to that since and I have not pursued the matter, for obvious reasons; I do not want to appear to be making a suitably comfortable habitat for myself in the next couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy's memory gone again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary might put a target <Col N="1058" /> date on the provision of such accommodation&mdash;say, in ten years time when neither the present Taoiseach nor I will expect to be the incumbent of the office.  I do not know what the present Taoiseach's experience is but I certainly found it difficult at times to live, as I said on the last occasion, on the side of a street in Dublin when pickets from different organisations were frequenting the space in front of my house.  The house was semi-detached and there were young children in the immediate locality and I could well imagine the parents of these young children being rather apprehensive, to say the least, of what action might be taken by certain groups.  There are a number of people coming regularly to the house of the head of Government on various missions.  I do not know what the position will be as regards law and order in 1985.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would give consideration to this matter.  It is desirable that there should be an official residence for the head of Government here as there is in almost every other country.  It is not merely for the sake of prestige.  There is a certain amount of security involved as well.</P>
      <P>These are the two points which I want to raise at this stage.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us whether there is any change of heart in relation to the contribution by the State for the acquisition of Fota Island.</P>

      <P>I was under the impression that I would be allowed to reply to the Deputy's contribution in the debate.  I did not realise that in a reply to an Estimate the time was limited.  Otherwise I would have answered the ex-Taoiseach's query.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an exTaoiseach. I am a former Taoiseach. There is a subtle distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tell the House and Deputy J. Lynch that Deputy Seán Brosnan raised that very question during his contribution to the debate.  It was one of the salient <Col N="1059" /> points in his arguments.  I have a note on this point which I will read:</P>
      <P>Deputy Brosnan again raised the question of Fota Island and suggested that the State should take over responsibility for the maintenance of the amenity area including the house and arboretum.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the UCC have an option on the purchase of the whole of Fota Island and I understand that it would be their intention to allow the public access to parts of it.  They have on their staff persons highly qualified in agriculture, botany, zoology, etc., competent to advise in all aspects of the management of Fota.  I cannot see any necessity or justification for the State to become involved in any way in the administration of the property.</P>
      <P>That gives an indication of the opinion of the Minister for Finance as regards his becoming involved in financing the purchase of Fota Island. Does that answer the Deputy's question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Not satisfactorily, but it is an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The only satisfactory answer to the Deputy would be that the Department of Finance would offer financial assistance for the purchase of Fota Island.  I understand UCC can well afford to buy this island and take the responsibility.  It would be their responsibility to allow the citizens of Cork to avail of the amenities there. As I understand it, this island is not a national amenity but rather a local one.  The people of Cork and UCC should be well able to look after their own amenity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I may raise the matter with the Minister for Education in regard to the ability of UCC to acquire the property without State assistance.  I do not believe they can afford it.  The Parliamentary Secretary was very glib in saying they could.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the second query by Deputy J. Lynch, there are a number of residences in the country which are under consideration for take-over by the Office of Public Works.  None has been designated as a residence for a Taoiseach.  There is a certain number of residences which might be suitable.  If one proved particularly suitable it would be taken over for whatever purpose it might be designated.  One of those purposes might be for use as a residence for a Taoiseach in the interests of security and for peace and tranquillity and quiet week-ends for him.  I will communicate with the Deputy if such a scheme comes to fruition point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the Parliamentary Secretary said in regard to the acquisition of Fota Island, may I ask if the Minister is not prepared to purchase the amenity area would he be prepared to supply the finance for the maintenance and upkeep of the amenity area only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply I stated that UCC have within their own staff men who are competent in every phase of ecology, zoology, and biology and they can look after this amenity area. I understand that it is their intention to allow the citizens of Cork to avail of the amenity.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £34,849,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry grants-in-aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a question about the harbour development plan at Cork.  The plan was prepared three years ago.  There have been some new developments in that one of the major users of the harbour area&mdash; one of the big industries&mdash;has had second thoughts about the establishment of the industry.  The Minister for Transport and Power has said that because of the unwillingness of this big firm to go ahead with their plans the review by his Department of the plans had to be delayed or revised.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach during his recent trip around the coast gave an assurance to the Cork Harbour Authority that the Government looked favourably on the plan.  The Minister for Transport and Power is not present but I presume somebody will reply on his behalf.  At what stage is the examination of that plan by the Department of Transport and Power?  What stage has been reached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cork Harbour Commissioners brought forward details of their plan during the course of the tour of the harbour a few weeks ago. The Minister for Transport and Power and I myself went on that tour.  The plans are now being examined by the technical personnel in the Department of Transport and Power and also by the Cork Harbour Commissioners.  I cannot give an up-to-date report of the stage of the discussions but they are proceeding in order to fix the actual timetable of the proposed plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>What has the Minister for Transport and Power in mind in regard to freight transport in the northern half of County Donegal where the Lough Swilly Railway Company, a Northern Ireland registered company, have abandoned the major part of the freight transport in that area and where CIE are taking up some part of that abandoned freight transport?  The users of the road transport for freight are falling between two stools, as are the employees of the former transport set-up.  They are not being made redundant by the existing company and are not being taken over by CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> In the absence of the Minister for Transport and Power, can any Minister on the Government benches tell me and the people of the northern half of Donegal what is to become of transport in that fairly remote area. It has no air transport.  It has many economic problems which will be aggravated by the mess in which freight transport is at the moment? I should like an assurance for myself and these people of what proposals there are, if any, for a satisfactory outcome to this mess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power is at an EEC meeting but I will convey Deputy Cunningham's query and arrange that a written reply will be sent to him on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach undertake to have the Minister meet a deputation to discuss this problem, that is, if he is not prepared to do something without meeting a deputation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Government any proposals to assist the ailing tourist industry?  We all know that this industry has been badly hit this year.  Many people will agree that we have priced ourselves out of the tourist market, due to inflation and the lack of price control.  I should like to know if the Government have any proposals to subsidise the colossal special service charges now being charged by the ESB and also the large capital contributions required by the ESB when they are connecting supplies to homes in rural areas? Finally, have the Government any proposals to subsidise the ever increasing CIE fares?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of these matters are of a wide-ranging nature. As the House is aware, the Minister for Finance will be announcing details of the Government's proposals <Col N="1063" /> next week.  Specific questions on the tourist industry are naturally more appropriate to a full discussion on the Estimate.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the overall proposals are designed to deal with the situation which was mainly due to external factors and not because of any internal situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a very important point on this Estimate, that is, the oil and gas exploration off the south coast, the setting up of the national gas board and its implications in our concerns, particularly in a county which will be the first to feel the effects and changes that may result from these developments. We have two major concerns, finance and the powers on the Cork County Council and its planning authority, that may be usurped by the national gas board.  I am looking for an assurance from somebody, on behalf of the absent Minister, to say that the county council need have no fears in this respect.  It is not enough to say that there will be co-operation and that no action will be taken without consultation with the planning authority.  In my view, consultation is not enough.</P>
      <P>The Cork County Council are in their present position because of the gas finds off our shore.  Hopefully, the same thing might apply to any of our maritime countries over the next few years.  Can we get a guarantee that, as a county council and a planning authority for the area, our responsibility will cover all aspects of development and that wayleave responsibility will be the planning authority's responsibility rather than that of the gas board, for obvious reasons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national gas board will apparently take the gas from the high water mark and the wayleave situation could, if not handled properly, cause problems in the sense that a precedent is then set that could cover water, sewerage, and so on.  We also believe that in that area&mdash;and this could apply to any other area at a later stage&mdash;the social and living conditions of the people will change dramatically, because we all hope there will <Col N="1064" /> be extensive development there.  With that development, there will be need for major infrastructural work by the provision of major services, such as roads, housing and other necessities. Can we be assured that some arrangements will be made to assist the local body, because it is obvious that the local body cannot bear that financial burden?  I am asking this question now because of its effect on a county which has about 250 miles of coast line.  This could be the concern and the problem of any other maritime county at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy appreciates, under the Planning Acts the local authority has responsibility for a number of these matters. Obviously, the possible finding of both oil and gas will create an entirely new situation.  The question of consultation between the new gas board and the local authority is one of the matters which will fall for discussion.  It is impossible at this stage to say how that will develop because of its completely new character, from our point of view.  It is obvious that the two public bodies, the local planning authority and the new gas board, must synchronise their arrangements in order to exploit the possibilities of a find, taking into account the needs of the people residing in the area and the general planning considerations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask two questions.  Have the Government made any decision on the question of a nuclear power station here and what exactly is the position at the moment?  Are the Department of Transport and Power providing any funds for the development of Rosslare Harbour?  That harbour is one of the most important ports of entry from Great Britain and Europe and there <Col N="1065" /> is a tremendous need for development of an additional berth there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A nuclear energy board has been established.  No recommendation has yet been made and until a recommendation is made the Government cannot come to any conclusion.  I will pass the Deputy's queries and recommendations about Rosslare Harbour to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago the Government asked An Foras Forbartha to carry out a survey of our ports.  I understand that when the report is finished it will not be published.</P>
      <P>Arising from Deputy Fitzgerald's question, the Taoiseach said that the developments he mentioned were largely a matter for the local authority.  This is only partly true because a lot will depend on the Minister for Transport and Power, on whether he will give the necessary order in relation to harbour works for development at the port.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House if he has received an application from any concern for a harbour works order in respect of Dublin port for the construction of an oil refinery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies' queries will have to await the Minister's presence.  These are detailed matters and I have not the information available.  However, I will arrange to have a reply sent to the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that our present refining capacity is approximately one-half of our requirements, have the Government made any decision in regard to whether we should positively increase our refining capacity or positively that we should not, or are the Government neutral in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are not neutral in the sense that some proposals are being examined.  However, the proposals have not reached a stage at which it is possible to make a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that is in <Col N="1066" /> regard to proposals put forward.  However, my question does not relate to individual proposals but to general policy.  Is it the policy of the Government to ensure, either through projects put forward or through an active approach on the part of the Government to promote them, that there should be at least sufficient refining capacity to meet our own requirements? This question is quite apart from the discovery of oil off our coast. Is it a question of waiting until a suitable project is put forward, in which event it might be accepted?  If that is so, is it related to an overall policy regarding refining facilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that steps were taken to increase the stocks position.  As the Deputy is aware, under EEC requirements the number of days' supply was increased.  Our supplies are being increased up to the relevant requirement, namely from 60 to 90 days.  The general question of the overall position is being considered in the light of proposals submitted as well as the prospects of possible oil finds off the coast.</P>

      <P>I should like to put it to the Minister that, as regards public service pensioners where parity was <Col N="1073" /> achieved some years ago, the consequences not only of the very high level of inflation but also of national pay agreements in the past year or two have resulted in a number of payments during one year, which was not the pattern in the past, and the net effect of this is that public service pensioners are much further back from parity than they were three years ago because of the arrangement whereby on 1st July every year, I think, pensions are brought into line with those which would be paid to somebody in the same grade retiring on that day.  In the meantime there have been, perhaps, three or four different increases and the position of public service pensioners in regard to parity is now worse than it was three years ago.  Would the Minister consider taking steps to ensure that, when there is an increase in civil service pay, at the same time the appropriate increase will take place in the pension rate for that grade?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter which I raised before on a similar occasion.  It is worth raising again, not that I think the Minister can here and now answer the question.  If he pursues it he might be able to assist in resolving the problem.  It is my experience, and that of a number of other people, that frequently there is an undue delay in the payment of pensions and lump sums to persons who retire from the public service.  I know there are problems in calculating what is due and that other administrative problems can arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have known people who were left <Col N="1074" /> for many months and sometimes for the best part of a year before they got a pension or a lump sum.  I do not think this should happen.  I do not think serving civil servants would accept the position if they were left without payment for the length of time pensioners have been left without payment. I am not saying this is due to malice, or anything like that.  A very special effort ought to be made in the case of persons who have retired to ensure that they are not given the impression that nobody cares about them, especially to the extent of not bothering to pay them.  I am urging the Minister on behalf of the Minister for Finance to do what he can to ensure that this kind of thing is cut down substantially.</P>

This is bad psychologically and, from the practical point of view, they want the money.  I am informed that, as recently as the 4th of this month, instructions were sent out by the Department of the Public Service to other Departments to see that such delays are eliminated.</P>

      <P>The item in this Estimate in regard to postal services is out of line with figures we have seen in other Estimates.  There is a reduction in the 1975 Estimate as against the nine-month period in 1974 from £48,000 to £35,000.  One of two things must have happened: either there was over use in the nine-month period of the postal services or there was some reason for an anticipated saving in the new year.  Would the Minister like to say, or to comment on, the reason for this Estimate being out of line with all the others we have considered up to now?

      <P>I want to raise the question of Garda accommodation along the Border areas.  In the last five years gardaí have been drafted from stations where they were more or less permanently posted.  Some of them are married members of the force and they are being put into barracks where there is no living accommodation. They have to find alternative accommodation in those areas. When they return from patrols they have to spend their time making out reports in stations which prior to this period catered for two or three gardaí in villages and rural areas.  We have a situation where as many as 20 to 40 members of the force are now using these stations, working under very difficult conditions of employment. The dedicated way in which they do it is something which deserves our commendation. They are obliged to do this work in cramped conditions.  I am not suggesting that anything could be done in regard to living accommodation but I am suggesting that the Minister for Justice should prevail on the Board of Works to provide temporary accommodation in prefabricated structures for a canteen, office accommodation and so on.

      <P>I want to raise a very important question about the payment of garda superintendents.  I understand that overtime payment in certain circumstances has been thrust on them and the superintendents have refused this form of payment.  They wanted something quite different.  Can the Minister say what is the present state of play with regard to that?  Have the superintendents withdrawn from the negotiating position?  They were perturbed that they were in charge of gardaí in a particular area and consequently it would be hardly conducive to good discipline if an inferior officer had to validate claims for overtime and so on.  What has the Minister to say on that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is a city dweller I thought he would know all about it and also because he has a concern for young people.  The JLO service was set up by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy O'Malley. I am not aware of the situation in any city outside Cork but I understood among the Garda authorities and the people concerned with this matter generally that this service was working very satisfactorily.  In reply to a question to the Minister for Justice some time ago I was informed by him that this service would be extended in the Cork area.  He said he was looking at the possible extension of this service to cater for growing built-up areas like Ballincollig, Blarney, Carrigaline, Douglas and other places on the verge of Cork city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I was pressing for this was to eliminate an injustice that might arise if the JLO service is confined to the young people within a city whereas the young person outside that area is faced with the consequences of a full court procedure.  It was a desirable development that that should be extended. <Col N="1093" /> Could the Minister tell me what the present plans are for the JLO service? Is there any reason why, rather than being expanded, it is being allowed to run down?  Is it a financial consideration or has recruitment slowed down?  Is it because personnel are not available or because the Minister has now decided that it is not a desirable service?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite untrue to suggest that there has been any running down in this service or that there is any failure on the part of the Minister or the Garda to recognise the importance of the service which, as the Deputy said, is of great value in urban areas.  To a great extent it has proved itself.  About 9,000 juveniles have come under the care and supervision of participating gardaí.  The Garda have now carried out a countrywide survey with a view, not to the running down, but to the expansion of the Juvenile Liaison Officer service.  In addition, an analytical study of the scheme has been completed.  The report of the study is at present under examination and it is anticipated that some of the recommendations of the report will be implemented in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's commitment to this service. It is an excellent one, one of the many excellent services initiated by Deputy O'Malley when he was Minister for Justice.  I am glad that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has committed the Minister for Justice to its development and expansion. I never referred to the gardaí being dissatisfied with the service.  I ask the Minister to convey my concern to his colleague who should be here this morning.  The sooner an effort is made to expand it and to encourage the existing personnel along those lines the better.  The personnel are concerned that there appears to be a reluctance within the Department, possibly because there is no money, to expand the service.  The Minister should advise his colleague to push this service, which is an excellent one.</P>

      <P>It arose, as Deputy Cunningham says, in 1972.  No doubt there has been a change in the attitude to parliamentary democracy in this country since then.  I would like to refer the Minister to the question of the situation that currently exists at Limerick Prison, which is highly unsatisfactory from everyone's point of view.  There are two prisoners being detained in Limerick Prison at the moment, which necessitates very strict conditions in the prison and which necessitates the use of a very large number of gardaí on duty inside and outside that prison.  I would ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to request the Minister for Justice to see if it would be possible to have the two prisoners in question removed from Limerick Prison, which was never a high security prison in any sense of the word, in order that Limerick Prison and the ordinary prisoners there might revert to the more normal way of life which existed there up to a year or so ago. It would also relieve the gardaí in Limerick city from the necessity of providing about 50 men on guard duty at that prison to the exclusion of all other work at a time when crime in Limerick city, as in so many other parts of the country, is rising at an alarming rate.  Could the Minister give me an assurance that the two prisoners in question will be removed to a more suitable institution in the immediate future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy no such assurance, but I can convey the point he makes to the Minister. The Deputy will appreciate perhaps better than most Deputies that wherever prisoners of this type are to be held, a certain amount of inconvenience <Col N="1099" /> will result both inside and outside the prison, and that there is no clear way of obviating that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that inconvenience, as the Minister described it, will certainly be caused in any prison where prisoners of this type are being held, but what I am endeavouring to suggest is that Limerick Prison is particularly unsuitable for that type of prisoner.  It is a prison for people serving short-term sentences.  There was never any great security or any need for any great security there.  The whole atmosphere of the prison is changed and the people who suffer in particular by that are the ordinary, non-subversive prisoners.  As well as that, it has had a most serious effect on the whole policing situation in Limerick city by virtue of the fact that 50 or possibly more gardaí are full time engaged in the protection of this prison now.</P>

I am sure if the Minister could have found some more suitable place for these prisoners he would have put them there.</P>

      <P>On the question of the courts, when I was in the Department of Justice a contract was, as far as I recall, signed for the purchase of a site at Smithfield for the erection of a complex of district courts on that site.  As well as that, we got temporary <Col N="1100" /> possession of vacant spaces close to the major site at Smithfield for the purpose of erecting temporary courts to alleviate the overcrowding in the district and circuit courts and in particular to provide two new temporary buildings for the Children's Court which, at the moment is in Dublin Castle and is a very seriously deficient court.  What progress has been made on that?  Has any building commenced in relation to the complex of, I think, 17 district courts which were to be built in Smithfield, and has any building commenced in relation to the Circuit Courts or the Children's Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall the setting up of the InterDepartmental Committee which sat on that.  In their first interim report the committee recommended the purchase of a 2½ acre site at Smithfield on which to build a new complex to house the whole of the Metropolitan District Court and, possibly, a new Garda station and Bridewell as well as a new headquarters for the welfare service.  They also reported that another smaller site in the same area might be available for renting on a short-term basis and that this would be large enough to accommodate a temporary Children's Court and at least one temporary Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>The committee's recommendations were accepted and negotiations for the purchase of the large site, at a cost of £365,000, were concluded in the spring of 1973.  Negotiations for the acquisition of the smaller site were commenced and the committee proceeded to draw up plans for the temporary courts.  They decided, with the Minister's approval, to plan for two Children's Courts and one Circuit Criminal Court.  When the outline plans had been completed it was estimated that the cost of the temporary building would be of the order of £250,000 and Finance sanction to proceed with the project was sought in August, 1973.  In view of the estimated high cost of the building it was decided that a long-term lease or outright purchase of the smaller site should be negotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, progress on all fronts was <Col N="1101" /> held up early in 1974 when the corporation received a report from consultants whom they had engaged to make recommendations for the relief of traffic congestion in the city.  The report recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> the construction of a fly-over bridge across the Liffey, and a new complex of roads fanning out from the northern end of the bridge, at a point which would, if proceeded with, have ruled out for our purposes the sites in question.</P>
    <P>In the latter half of 1974, the corporation decided not to accept the consultants' recommendations in relation to this particular development and the sites were &ldquo;freed&rdquo; for development subject to normal planning requirements.  However, the Office of Public Works have so far not succeeded in acquiring the smaller site because of a newly developed reluctance on the part of the owners to dispose of it.</P>

      <P>On the question of courts, the High Court has made orders in respect of two areas against the Minister for Justice in the last year where the local authorities have failed to carry out their statutory functions. What is the position in regard to these? I think Waterford was one and Drogheda or Dundalk was another. There are dozens and dozens of courthouses throughout the country in a similar state of disrepair in which both justices and judges are refusing to sit.  I could give several examples. I wonder does the Minister propose to compel local authorities to discharge their statutory functions or will he do the work instead on their behalf?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised the question of the position at Drogheda and Waterford.  In regard to Drogheda, in April, 1972, as a result of proceedings taken by representatives of the Drogheda Solicitor's Association, the President of the High Court made an absolute order of mandamus directing the Minister to exercise the statutory duties imposed on him by the Courthouses (Maintenance and Provision) Act, 1935, by directing the Commissioners of Public Works to carry out the necessary repair work on Drogheda Courthouse in view of the local authority's failure to do the work. The Commissioners of Public Works were directed accordingly in May, 1972, and sittings of the Circuit Court resumed in Drogheda in June, 1973, after an absence of 9 years.  The cost of the repair work which is estimated at £9,500 is recoverable from the local authority under the provisions of the above-mentioned Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Waterford is concerned, Waterford Corporation had refused <Col N="1103" /> to undertake the very costly task of restoring or replacing the Waterford Courthouse at Catherine Street, Waterford in the absence of assistance from central funds.  In 1971 sittings of the High, Circuit and District Courts were transferred out of Waterford city.  In January, 1972, in an effort to resolve the impasse, the Minister gave an undertaking to the corporation to the effect that, if any scheme of financial assistance was introduced following and consequent on the report of the interdepartmental committee established in 1968, any substantial work commenced in Waterford to provide permanent courthouse accommodation would benefit by the retrospective application of the scheme to the works in question. The corporation subsequently agreed to re-examine the economics of restoring the Catherine Street courthouse and to provide temporary accommodation for the District and Circuit Courts in alternative premises at O'Connell Street, Waterford.</P>
    <P>In July, 1973, the Waterford Law Society initiated mandamus proceedings against the Minister, in circumstances similar to the Drogheda case, with the object of compelling him to have Waterford courthouse repaired. A conditional order of mandamus was granted.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the initiation of these proceedings, Waterford Corporation revealed to the Department that they had agreed to proceed with the restoration of the courthouse at an estimated cost of £120,000.  As an earnest of the corporation's expressed intention to proceed with the work a sum of £25,000 was included in their capital budget for the financial year 1974 and sums of £50,000 and £45,000 respectively were included in their budget projections for 1975 and 1976.</P>
    <P>The O'Connell Street premises were adapted for sittings of the Circuit and District Courts and sittings of the District Court commenced there in October, 1973.  Sittings of the Circuit Court commenced there in July, 1974.</P>
    <P>Despite these developments the Waterford Law Society went ahead with their application to have the conditional <Col N="1104" /> order of mandamus made absolute.  The hearing of their application concluded on 27th January, 1975. In a judgment delivered on 30th May, 1975, Mr. Justice Doyle made absolute the conditional order of mandamus.</P>

Now a change of personnel does not change the law, and I would like to know if there is any way in which a <Col N="1105" /> uniform interpretation of the law could be ensured.  I will take this matter further.  The Minister for Justice probably knows all about this and it is unfortunate we have not got him here this morning.

Is any particular type of accommodation road specified?  Is the money to be used specifically for the improvement of bog roads?  There are hundreds in need of repair.  They are being used a great deal at the moment.  If the money is confined to turf-producing counties great progress could be made.  The Minister does not seem to have attached the importance he should to these roads in the light of the fuel crisis.  These roads are of paramount importance in counties like Donegal, Mayo and Kerry where a great deal of native fuel is being produced by private effort but access facilities to turbary plots are nonexistent. That is one of the main points which I wanted the Minister to answer.</P>

This is not being confined to turf-producing counties.  Practically every county has an area where turf is and can be produced. The grants are allocated.  The local authorities may do something about this matter.  I agree that it might be an idea to encourage people to cut their own turf at present.  They do not seem to need much encouragement this year.  I have an extra £500,000 for this this year and I would imagine that much will be done.</P>

I wish to impress on the Minister the need to suggest to local authorities that a considerable amount of this money might be used for the development of bog roads.  In my own constitutency efforts to obtain money for this purpose have proved fruitless.  In a year when we are being advised to conserve energy anything that can be done in this respect should be done. The Minister should advise the local authorities to use a reasonable percentage of any money available for such work.</P>

The council have in progress a very big water scheme estimated to cost about £600,000. Loan approval has been granted for £520,000.  In December, 1974, the council applied for a capital allocation of £390,000.  Last month Enniscorthy Urban Council were given a capital allocation of £164,000.  This is completely insufficient for the work in progress.  That amount of money has already been spent.  The urban council <Col N="1108" /> have asked for a further allocation of something over £200,000.  Will the Minister ensure that sufficient capital funds will be made available to Enniscorthy Urban Council to provide for the continuation of this scheme? Otherwise Enniscorthy Urban Council will have no funds at their disposal. If the capital allocation is not forthcoming immediately we must close down the scheme.  Will the Minister say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; and avoid deputations?</P>

This is an extraordinary case where the contractor estimated the speed he would go at and the money necessary was made available but he went much faster than he himself expected to go.  The result is that he requires a lot more money.  The matter is at present under consideration. Deputy S. Browne should not worry too much about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is much later than expected.  A number of points were being discussed.  This meant that it was not possible to have the meeting until June.  I told Deputy Faulkner a few weeks ago that the discussion was taking place.  We are trying to get up-to-date figures.  I hope to have the publication as soon as possible.  It is much later than I would like to have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this point recently.  The answer I was given at that time is the answer the Minister <Col N="1109" /> has just given me.  I understood then that the meetings took place in December or January and that there was an interim publication in February and a final publication in May.  This year the meeting does not seem to have taken place until six months later than usual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A normal discussion took place in February.  There was no question of the publication of the results then.  It was just a question of discussing matters which had to be decided on at a subsequent meeting.  I admit it would have been better if we could have had the final meeting earlier.  At present we are attempting to get up-to-date figures from the building societies but we have not got them.  This has held us up.  I assure Deputy Faulkner that the figures will be published as soon as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to have as much information as possible about any subject to be discussed.  The usual procedure was that Estimates were passed without discussion and if it was necessary to have a further discussion a token Estimate was passed and this allowed the matter to be raised again at a later date.  In many cases the matter never came up again.  On this occasion it was decided that we would have important questions on which somebody wanted information debated and that such questions would be answered by the Minister concerned. There is no question of the information which Deputy Faulkner wants being withheld.  He will get it as soon as it is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important matter.  The inference in the Minister's <Col N="1110" /> reply is that the matter was not important enough to be raised.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the figure of 10 per cent.  I have a few points to make about bog roads.  The grant given is preventing bog roads being repaired.  I have known of schemes to be turned down because the estimates for them were too high.  The cost of repairing a bog road is much higher than that of repairing an ordinary road.  I would like the Minister to have a look at that.  This is being used by the local authorities for turning down schemes because the estimates are too high. There is a maximum grant for ordinary roads and drains for farms. That has been increased but schemes are still not being done if the estimates are too high.  The same applies to bog development.</P>
      <P>I was very disappointed with the letter I got from the Minister dealing with the 10 per cent which said that where the council had difficulty in getting the valuation, it is 10 per cent when a large number of people were using a bog.  I remember the late Deputy Kitt thanking the Minister for making that change.  At that time we understood that where there was a bog at the end of the road the 10 per cent could be applied if it was less than the valuation.  In his letter the Minister stated that where there is difficulty in getting the valuation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>To meet Deputy Callanan's point I will look into that. There was no intention of tightening it. I was trying to widen it to cover Deputy Callanan's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question of interpretation.  I want the Minister to <Col N="1111" /> spell out that where there is a bog at the end of a road, if the 10 per cent is less than the valuation it should apply in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is purely a matter for the local authority.  They have to decide the costs and whether they can allow it to be done.  I could not possibly decide what bog roads should or should not be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that there is a definite maximum grant per farm which can be given under the LIS.  Those grants were increased last year.  The county manager will tell an applicant that it is laid down in the regulations that if it is above a certain figure it will have to be turned down.  I have seen various schemes turned down because the estimates were too high.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to explain his further letter dealing with the £100,000 for small schemes.  He sanctioned £30,000.  As a result, many small sanitary and water schemes will have to be abandoned.  Although the Minister mentioned this in his letter, he did not tell us why we did not get the £100,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had £100 million extra now I could allocate it for sanitary services around the country, and more could be spent in some counties than others.  There is a limited amount which is allocated and each local authority must get a fair allocation. If the Deputy looks at the list, he will find that Galway got a fair allocation.</P>

      <P>I got a written reply to two questions yesterday and I was very dissatisfied with the replies.  One of the questions was:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government the number of final instalments of new house grants paid in 1973-74 in respect of houses where building commenced in 1972, 1971, 1970, 1969, 1968, 1967, 1966 and 1965.</P>
      <P>and a similar question relating to 1974-75. The reply I got was:</P>
      <P>The information is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to explain that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It means simply that the information is not available in my Department.  Even if it was available, it would require a great deal of work to get it.  It is not available in the Department. Those figures for grant applications are not given.  There is no point saying they could be got&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not whitewash, it is the truth although it may not be palatable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I could accept that if the reply I got was that it would have taken an inordinate amount of time and money to get the information, but I am not satisfied that information of this type is not available in the Department If a question is put down about the number of starts and completions in any given year in relation to private housing that information is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for private enterprise houses.  It would mean going through about 100,000 files to see if the information was available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I could accept the reply that it would take an <Col N="1113" /> inordinate amount of time and money to get that information, but the reply I got was most unsatisfactory.  When grants are paid for private houses I cannot understand why the information is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that that information is not on file.  The inspector making the report would say that it was at a certain stage.  He would not give the information when it was started.  While people applying for grants may say when they propose to start building, it is well known that some may start within the normal time but others may not start for a further six or 12 months.  I would like to give the information but I just cannot do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still not happy. Where the inspector looks at these application forms, is there no information given as to when the House building will be started?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is, on the application form, an indication of when the builder of a single house proposes to start.  But where a person is building a scheme of houses, that information would not be available.  The inspector does not fill the date of start, because he would not know it.  He gives the stage at which he finds the house.  There would be no reason why this information should not be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not correct and is not giving the correct information to the House?  I agree with Deputy Faulkner when he say that if yesterday's reply had been that it would take too long or cost too much to get the information we could understand that and accept it.  If there is a change in the level of grants being paid, the criterion is the date on which the foundation has been laid.  This is available in respect of every private house.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the case of a large number of people applying for and receiving the higher rate of grants.  The level of rates has increased many times over the last five or six years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment of the grant in each case is dependent on the date and in the case of houses under the higher rate of grant system it is necessary to know the date of commencement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, because the means test is based on the date on which the foundations were laid. When the inspector goes out part of his instructions are to find out the date of commencement.  Otherwise the grant cannot be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not correct.  I am not saying that Deputy Cunningham is telling lies but he is talking about something the facts of which he does not know.  When there is a change in grant, it is necessary to get certain information, but there is no question whatever of the information for which Deputy Faulkner asked being <Col N="1115" /> made available in every case.  The information is not there.  I am giving the information as I got it from my officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Has there been any change in recent years in regard to the procedure in this matter, because I know personally that at one time it was necessary to have an inspection when the foundations were opened before the building went any further? There may have been a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the local authority bye-laws in some cases lay this down and they may do that.  That has nothing to do with us.  We do not know it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the income limit of a person, supposing a person applies for a grant and gets a State grant and maybe not until two or three years after will he know about the supplementary grant.  There must be a date of commencement, and I came across a case last week of a person who built a house in 1969 and who did not get the supplementary grant and he has now discovered that his earnings in 1969 were less than the figure required to qualify.  Surely there must be somebody who knows the date of commencement in cases like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases like that there would be time to find out when the house started but only in that case, and there is no way in which the matter can be proven.  The date on which the man proposed to do it&mdash;the county council files would have it because they were supposed to inspect the site, but this has nothing to do with us at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the situation in the Dublin region.  If a house is commenced when the foundations are dug and before the concrete is poured, the county council send out an inspector to examine it and it is recorded on the file&mdash;inspection of foundations on such a date.  In the same local authority, there is an appointed officer by the Department for the payment of such grants.  He <Col N="1116" /> signs them and sends them to the Department and then they give out the authorisation so that the figures are available of the date of commencement of every house within the local authority area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What the Deputy says is quite true.  An inspection is carried out but the report does not go on file in the Department of Local Government.  This is what I have been trying to say all along.  There are some areas where it does not happen.  If the local authority examine the foundation when poured, they will know, but they do not pass such information on to the Department, and every local authority does not do it.  There may be a crossing of lines here but what I am telling the House is the situation.  I am sorry, but that is the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department would have some information in relation to the number of final payments paid last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now saying something different.  He suggests that in relation to one year if 17,000 files were examined, it might be possible to hazard a guess as to when the houses were started, but that is not the information asked for.  He asked for information over a whole period and I do not think we would be entitled to hazard a guess in that regard.  He wants definite information and we cannot give it.  We could hazard a guess if we were prepared to go through 100,000 files.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister misunderstands the situation.  All that is involved in the 1973-74 year is the number of files in respect of which grants were paid, final payments were made.  They do not have to go through 1972, 1971 and 1970.  They simply take each of those files in respect of which grants were paid in the given year 1974 to find out how many of them were <Col N="1117" /> paid in respect of houses which commenced in the various years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not give the information the Deputy asked for. He asked for information in respect of a number of years, over a period of three years, and I am saying that if they are in relation to one year, it would show that some of these started in one of these years but that is not the information he asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  The Minister misunderstands.  Let us take it that in a given year there were 17,000 final grant payments.  All I am asking him is that those files be examined to see in what year each of these houses was commenced.  That is all that is involved and it is the question I asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking one year, there would be approximately 17,000 files. Secondly, it would only give the number but would not give the information which is not on the file, and all one could say is that there was at that stage on a certain date a number of houses and therefore these must have been started around a certain time.  That is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me ask one further question.  In going through these files, at least there would be some information as to when the individual concerned said he intended starting.  If he said in relation to a particular house that he proposed starting in March, 1970, at least we would be correct in assuming that he would start reasonably soon after that, so that while I accept that it would be difficult to give specific information, nevertheless the Minister possibly misunderstood, certainly in his earlier reply, the situation because he thought I was suggesting that he should go through the files for all these other years.

      <P>From the hazy information available in the Department, as we have now discovered from the Minister, it is fair comment to put a rather large question mark opposite the blaze of publicity about so many <Col N="1119" /> houses starting in any particular month.  As the figures are produced at present, they show nothing more than the fact that a number of inspectors were sent by the Department to pay grants on houses built some years ago. In this way the Minister will have good figures at the end of the year and will be able to boast at the Labour Party Conference about his achievements. There is more unemployment in the building industry now than ever before.  Those are figures we should be discussing today, not the number of starts and completions or the mythical figures thought up by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke is a very petty person.  In 1960 the then Government decided on how they would do certain things and on the method of compiling statistics and there has been no change during the years.  Whatever figures were produced in those years were done on the basis of decisions taken.  If they were right in 1960 and later, they are right now.  It is just a question of comparison.  Deputy Burke is being petty and mean in a discussion where pettiness and meanness have no place.  He would be well advised to stick to what we are discussing. This is a serious matter, where political points are not so hot. The public will not give credit to people like Deputy Burke for making statements like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no source from which it can definitely be obtained.  If we went to all the local authorities who have such bye-laws and asked them for information regarding the foundations they examined we could give that information but, since all local authorities do not do that, the information would not be complete.  If the Deputy wishes we could give him the date of application for grants. <Col N="1120" /> However, that would not be very much because in many cases applications are made but the jobs are not started. There is a particular instance of this where, before 1st February, 1973, a tremendous number of foundations were laid because my predecessor brought in a very good regulation with regard to the question of the valuation of houses on that date.  In order to avoid that regulation many people poured more foundations than they required. This is an admitted fact.  Therefore, even that source will not give Deputy Faulkner the information he requires.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it would be a good idea to have such a recording system? It does not seem such a complicated job, possibly with the aid of computers, to find out how many houses were started on a certain date and when they were completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a suggestion that the Department were quite hazy about these matters.  What has been used since 1960, which I consider quite good, is the figure of grants allocated. This is a fairly good base on which to compile figures.  I do not think the date on which a person starts a house matters very much.  Grant allocations give a fairly good idea of when the job started and that is sufficient.</P>

There was a recent report that this could involve a payment of £20 for units catering for 100 pigs?  Is that contrary to the 1960 Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know nothing about it. Nobody in my Department is involved. It would be a matter for the Valuation Office because they are the authority who would make a decision in such a case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was on a deputation to the Minister some time ago with regard to the scheme of house purchase. Will he bear in mind that a person who bought his house a year ago paid much more than he would pay if he were purchasing it now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the scheme introduced in 1973. That scheme is a final scheme for houses purchased up to 31st March last&mdash;the date was extended on a few occasions.  The Deputy is referring to those people who bought their houses under the previous scheme and who are now aggrieved about the price they paid.  This is an important matter which I am considering.  However, these people entered into a legal contract with their eyes open and, therefore, it is an intricate job to try to do something about it.  I am considering the matter but, as I mentioned in the House before, I cannot promise I will do anything about it until I study all the facts.  I know Deputy Moore is not involved in it, but certain people are attempting to organise others to protest.  This is the wrong way to go about it.  We all know what <Col N="1122" /> happened.  If they would leave it and let it be sorted out, if it can be sorted out, they would be better off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could tell the Deputy but quite honestly I cannot. As Deputy Moore understands, I am as interested in it as he is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was reported as saying in a speech in Dungarvan that he did not propose to make all of the money available to the local authorities for which they applied as they would not be able to use all they applied for.  Does the Minister still hold to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was pretty close to that.  When a number of local authorities were asked at the beginning of the year to give an estimate of the amount of money they required, they submitted an estimate which included many things which could not possibly be done this year, including building schemes for which they had not acquired the land, and for which no planning had been done.  I said the money they would get would be for work which could be carried out this year.  Deputy Faulkner would probably agree that it would be rather foolish for a local authority to tie up a lot of money which could be usefully spent by another local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically the point the Minister was making was that some of the local authorities have not got schemes prepared to enable them to use the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>

      <P>One local authority sent the Minister an application for £6 million for infrastructural work in County Dublin for this year.  They said they could spend the £6 million but the Minister sent them only £3 million.  As well as that, he owed Dublin County Council £1½ million on 3rd June and the money did not arrive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Burke raised that point.  I saw that he was holding forth in another place.  He <Col N="1123" /> used a phrase which I was very surprised to find him using.</P>

      <P>Local authorities were notified that they would be paid money for SDA loans and that they would get a percentage which would carry them on until 30th June and the balance would be allocated after that. They were also told that if they had any special case it would be examined by officials of the Department.  This was done.  The local authority Deputy Burke is talking about felt they could use £1½ million more.  They got £1 million more and they were quite happy.  They were able to carry on with that without any difficulty.  It is only fair to point out that that local authority got by far the largest amount of money of any local authority.  They got about three times what they were getting before I took office.  In the circumstances I thought even Deputy Burke would be prepared to agree they were being treated generously.  It was a little unfortunate that Deputy Burke should make that statement.  These statements seem to reflect back on the maker rather than on the people they are intended to damage.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that this year the allocation to Wicklow County Council for water and sewerage schemes is £25,000. Last year it was in the region of £32,000.  I believe the Department are aware that in Wicklow we have debts amounting to £16,500 in this section which would leave us with a balance of £8,500.  We in the county council were able to come up with an extra £2,000 which will leave us with a total of £10,500.  We have three schemes in hand at the moment which will be terminating pretty soon and which our engineers estimate will cost £10,700. We have no money.  We sent a request to the Department for a substantial amount of money for Wicklow because we have the work force and the technical force but we have not got the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have a look at what Deputy Murphy referred to.  We have allocated a certain amount of money and it was given in relation to the ongoing works.  I am a little confused about the problem Deputy Murphy mentioned but I will have a look at it.  I will agree that inflation has a certain effect on it, but it is only fair to say that we are now giving three times as much as was being given when I took over.  We are still not giving enough.  I mentioned the figure of £100 million.  One of my predecessors, Deputy Boland, said at one time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He discovered he needed far more than that.  I should like to see a lot more money being spent on water and sewerage schemes.  I have been giving very substantial sums of money to areas where there was great need and I will continue to do so within the available money.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will now realise why I would like the Minister for Education to be here.  With regard to Subhead A.5 &mdash;Expenses of the National Council for Educational Awards&mdash;£166,000&mdash; on 16th December last the Minister for Education arrived with a changeling baby.  His own proposals, apparently, were killed in the Cabinet.  He arrived with this changeling, that the NCEA was to be abolished.  He has changed his mind on that.  He has found it useful since then.  Is it true to say that when this Estimate was being prepared the Department of Education did not know of the Minister's intention to kill the NCEA?</P>

Preparatory works of some character were required last year but this year the amount of such works will not be as great and the amount required for work of that sort as distinct from current matters such as payment of staff would be a declining factor.</P>

The committee is chaired by an inspector of the Department. This committee is overseeing initiatives in relation to education services which include the establishment of exhibition centres in Castlebar, County Mayo, and Trim, County Meath.  But other matters in relation to the development of education services within the institutions themselves in Dublin and, perhaps, the matter referred to by the Deputy, which are of more general application than to counties in which exhibition centres are being established, are being considered by the committee. This money is being expended in a flexible way and it is a major and useful development in relation to the National Library and the National Museum in that it allows them to adopt a more public role coming into contact with adult education in a way not possible heretofore.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is linked with the review of child care services which is taking place within the task force set up by the Minister for Health. School attendance can be a first line of defence in relation to children who <Col N="1133" /> are liable to have difficulties.  The whole provision for the school attendance service and perhaps the legal basis also are being reviewed by the task force.  In fact, I asked myself that when this matter was being considered, the task force should take into account the provision regarding school attendance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Government found any remedy for the children thrown on the streets by the Children's Court when they are put on remand? Has any permanent or temporary home been found for these children? Are they to continue &ldquo;living rough&rdquo; in the city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are problems with certain children.  In many cases which originally caused concern solutions of some kind have subsequently been found in regard to accommodation. There are certain children who are still a problem.  I said in reply to a question by the Deputy some considerable time ago that this general question of accommodation for children who are either deliquent or maladjusted or deprived is being considered by the task force.  There are obvious problems as regards whether such an institution should be completely open or should be closed and as to whether particularly difficult children should be housed on the same campus as children less difficult.  If you have a home catering for children who are deliquent but not out of control and you introduce children who are really disturbed you can find that they will have a bad effect on the regime of the house.  There may be physical accommodation for such children but it must be considered whether on balance their using such accommodation as does exist could have deleterious effects on other children.  This creates a serious policy issue which involves the study of psychiatric or psychological evidence which is being examined by the task force on child care set up by the Minister for Health. I understand the question of accommodation will be the subject of an interim report by the task force.  I do not know when that report will be <Col N="1134" /> available, but it will not be in the too-distant future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that it is the height of hypocrisy for the Minister for Education to be talking of his concern for remedial education when he dropped the grant from £77,000 to £12,000 a year?  Why pick this matter for a drop like that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The special courses to which the Deputy refers cover a whole gamut of in-service courses.  Although he is perfectly entitled to pick on one aspect of them I think it would be wrong to attribute the whole drop to a drop in relation to remedial education. The present Government have <Col N="1135" /> recorded significant progress in regard to remedial education in that we quadrupled the number of courses up to this year in the period in which we are in office with a throughput of 25 teachers per annum for primary school teachers rising to 100 in the present academic year.  Those teachers are still in the schools and will continue to work in the schools during the coming year.  The contribution made in the form of courses last year will continue to have effect throughout the teaching career of that quadrupled number of teachers who availed of it.  I should point out that the Government have doubled the number of remedial teacher posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary has to make the best of his brief, but in all seriousness how can he maintain that anything can be done with £12,500?  How can he say there is any concern by the Minister for any of these courses when this ridiculous and insulting figure is estimated as against £77,000 for nine months last year?  The thing is ridiculous.  It would be better not to try to defend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a bad judge at all.  The position is that the teachers whom I mentioned will continue to serve in the schools.  It was necessary to make certain cuts in the Department of Education Vote.  They are cuts which can be and hopefully may be restored in the coming year. Nothing is permanently lost in the sense that all of these courses can be resumed next year and the teachers who availed of previous courses are still in the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My personal opinion is that we should not see remedial teaching developing as a substitute for normal class teaching and that children who have problems of some description <Col N="1136" /> should always have to have special remedial help.  The vast bulk of problems which arise in classrooms can and should be dealt with by the normal teachers, and it should only be where there are grave proven difficulties that recourse should be had to remedial teaching.  This is lost sight of because the idea of a remedial teacher can be so easily quantified that one may run the risk of diverting attention from what can be done in the normal classroom for children with difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is not aware that there are such large classes, for example in this city, that it is impossible to do remedial teaching in the normal run of events&mdash;the teacher is trying to cope with 45 to 50 pupils in a class.  I have a question about subhead C.5 which shows a drop from £223,600 to £67,000.  In order to get some idea of what that is about, would the Parliamentary Secretary tell me what &ldquo;miscellaneous grants&rdquo; covers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>These moneys have been reduced because under the new boards of management system a very substantial injection of funds is being given on a general basis to the managers of primary schools.  I suggest the Deputy looks at subhead C.6. There is a substantial increase there. &ldquo;Miscellaneous grants&rdquo; would cover such things as heating and lighting and so forth.  That is no longer necessary because such things are covered by the greatly augmented provision for capitation grants.  The provision this year for miscellaneous grants refers to money necessary to meet outstanding commitments last year when individual schemes for heating, lighting and so forth were in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the £67,000 refer to heating and lighting?  There is a note at the end of the Vote which refers to grants for heating, cleaning and painting schools, and then we are referred back to subhead C.6.  What did the £223,600 in last year's Estimate cover?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year's provision dealt with the matters I have referred to.  This year's references are in the tabulation.  There is a technical difficulty in regard to the reallocation of resources to cover subheads. I understand there is no real problem as far as money being made available is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education said he would pay in the first half of this year the old grant and pending and providing committees of management were set up, the rest would be paid up to £6 per head. What about this £67,000?  How does it relate to the £3.2 million in the Estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The £67,000 is for the matters mentioned&mdash;equipment, special education grants for Irish reading material and miscellaneous expenses and maintenance.  Provision for heating and lighting this year is coming out of capitation grants towards the operating costs of national schools for which provision is made under subhead C.6 for £3.2 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still very puzzled about this difference.  With regard to subhead C.6, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take the view to the Minister that many people think the £1.50 local contribution per head demand for the new committees of management is excessive.  If there is to be a local contribution it should be more on the lines of 50p, if there is to be any at all.</P>

I should like to make the point again, that having regard to the very high cost of sites nowadays in built-up areas&mdash;I have in mind particularly the area about which I asked the question, Sutton, where the cost of sites is so enormous &mdash;it is very important that the Government should face the prospect of having to pay for such sites or a substantial contribution towards them. This has not been the practice up to now, but things are getting out of hand.  Though I understand the Government's economic difficulties, this is not a matter that can be postponed until things improve, because there are many areas where the provision of sites will only result in the availability of a school many years hence.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the population is growing and the provision of primary education is, of course, a basic essential which comes, in the order of priorities, before any other activity of the Department.  I urge very strongly that further consideration be given to this problem.</P>

      <P>On subheads A.1 and A.2 I want to appeal to the Minister, through the Parliamentary Secretary, to pay the recently announced increases in this academic year, that is the academic year 1974-75 before the 31st July, that is the end of the school year in the secondary calendar. I told the Minister in the House that we have been bombarded with letters about this.  It is a very important issue. It was also suggested that the very high rates of interest which those schools are paying should be paid by the Department pending the first payment next October.  I appeal strongly to the Parliamentary Secretary to ask the Minister to do this.</P>
      <P>Is there a question of a 5 per cent increase in salary to secondary teachers in dispute at the moment?  If so, what is the present state of play on that?  On subhead F, the courses for secondary teachers, a sum of £90,000 was allocated from April to December, 1974 and £10,000 is allocated for 1975.  I know the type of course that is covered by this.  Senator Martin, in another place, made a plea for the restoration of this.  This kind of penny pinching in important matters deserves condemnation from this side of the House and will get it.  Is there an element of remedial training also involved in subhead F?  The details are given but there is no comment where there is a big drop in the grant.  The officials that composed it are ashamed of it and they do not comment at all.</P>

      <P>Taking the last question posed by the Deputy the answer is in the affirmative.  The situation in relation to the first matter raised by the Deputy, the capitation grants, is that the Minister introduced very substantial increases in the capitation grants of 50 per cent recently and in the grants in lieu of tuition from £35 per pupil to £50 per pupil.  The grant in lieu of tuition is the larger of the two and is being paid in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true but for the academic year 1974/75 it is being paid at the old rate, not the increased rate.  I am asking for the increased rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was announced. Very substantial increases were brought about in both these grants to secondary schools and looking back at the figures for increases since these grants were introduced in the case of tuition fees in 1968 the rate of increases have been far greater in the tenure of office of the present Minister than in the tenure of office of the previous Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

It is not a great deal to ask and when it carries the remedial element it is <Col N="1142" /> doubly important.  Senator Martin raised this matter in another place. The money spent was very well spent on the subject courses as well.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary promise me to ask the Minister to raise this amount?</P>

    <P>I also understand that sanction has been given in relation to County Kilkenny's initiative in the field of adult education.  It is wise in a situation of admitted financial stringency <Col N="1144" /> that we should approach these matters on a pilot basis and see whether we can draw conclusions from the practical applications of some of the schemes generalised in the Murphy Report on Adult Education.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The directive is due for revision next year, so there will be no immediate development.  In regard to including land which is let, I am prepared to go some of the way with Deputy Callanan, but I am not prepared to agree that all land which is let should have the benefit of the farmers' retirement scheme.  Some of that land might be in the hands of people who have given up farming many years ago and who are living outside the country or engaged in business in the country.  However, where land is let due to poverty or illness and where the owners are still resident on the land and living on the lettings, I will do all I can to have land of that type included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that most of the land that people are willing to surrender is land that is let because of people's inability to get workers or because due to illness or old age they were unable to continue actively in farming? Will he make an all-out effort to deal with these individual cases so that such people would be included in the farm retirement scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I do not agree with the proposition put forward by Deputy Leonard that most of the land that has been offered is owned by people who have it let. The contrary is the case, that by far the biggest portion of land being offered is qualified under the scheme and is being processed.  But I do agree with both Deputies that there are cases where land is let due to age, illness or poverty of the owners who want to surrender it under the scheme and that everything should be done to bring them within the scheme.  I said I will do that.  That is my view, <Col N="1149" /> and I do not want to become controversial. I have had to operate the directive as I found it.  When it comes up for revision I will do my best to have the type of farm that the Deputies have in mind included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <P>Could the Minister inform the House when the final decision will be made on the proposal to resettle the islanders of Irish Toirbirt off the coast of Clifden, Connemara, County Galway?  The Minister is aware that revised proposals have been presented by the officers of the Land Commission to his Department for decision.  There has been a long delay in this matter and the islanders had expected they would be resettled on the mainland before the coming winter.  Representations have been made continually by me over the past number of months since last September and no positive indication of any real progress has been given.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): The Deputy has a parliamentary question down about this matter and I will be answering it.  As the Deputy knows, a scheme was drawn up in <Col N="1150" /> respect of Inis Turk and Inish Toirbirt and, by and large, with one exception, the islanders of Inis Turk availed of it.  It transpired that the islanders of Inish Toirbirt could not avail of the scheme because they could not make any contribution themselves and it was necessary to review the whole matter.  The position has been reviewed and revised proposals are being considered at the moment and I hope to be in a position to give a decision on it without much further delay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistical information which I recently circulated to Deputies showed that the death rate from diseases of the heart for men aged 45 to 64 years increased between 1960 and 1973 from 424 to 550 per 100,000 men in that age group.</P>
      <P>The Medico-Social Research Board in co-operation with the World Health Organisation have carried out research in Dublin into the factors associated with morbidity and mortality of heart disease.  This research has confirmed the findings of similar research carried out in other countries, that heart disease appears to be closely related to elements of our modern way of life such as smoking, diet and lack of exercise.</P>
      <P>In dealing with this problem emphasis is being placed on the education of the public on the steps which can be taken to reduce the risk of heart disease.  My Department, in co-operation with the Irish Heart Foundation, have issued leaflets and have engaged in television and Press advertising aimed mainly at young people and designed to promote attitudes towards positive health early in life.</P>
      <P>A major step has been the recent establishment of the Health Education Bureau which is now responsible for promoting all health education campaigns. I expect that the prevention of heart disease will be high on their priority list.</P>

He was examined by the hospital's medical officer who advised that he be transferred to an acute general hospital.  Because he lived in Dublin it was recommended that he be sent to one of the Dublin hospitals. Arrangements were made to have him collected and brought to Dublin by private cardiac ambulance for which the man's relatives agreed to pay.  The health board's ambulance in Thurles was available to transport the patient to Dublin but the patient's relatives preferred to hire the private cardiac ambulance.</P>

Shortly after I became Minister, I met a deputation from Cork County Council and following the meeting put forward what I considered to be a very reasonable proposal aimed at meeting the legitimate points made to me by the deputation, while at the same time keeping the committee down to manageable size.  Unfortunately, the county council did not agree to my proposal.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree to their request to have all 21 county council members from the area appointed to the committee because this would give a committee, inclusive of Cork city and Cork county representatives of at least 65 persons.  I think that the proposal which I put forward in May, 1973, represented a considerable advance on the position taken by my predecessor and I would ask the county council to look again at the reasonableness of the arrangements I have suggested.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the effect of this regulation is to completely disenfranchise 21 members of the southern area of Cork County Council&mdash;these <Col N="1165" /> members come from the most prosperous and densely populated part of the county&mdash;and are the only councillors in the country so deprived? The Minister's suggestion is, therefore, neither satisfactory nor feasible.</P>

      <P>I am, indeed, aware of the annoyance to those councillors who are disenfranchised.  I am also aware that, as the Minister stated, a committee of 65 would be unwieldy.

While there has been a considerable improvement in recent years in the recruitment of whole-time dental staff for this service and while this improvement is continuing, the South Eastern Health Board, like the other health boards, is not yet in a position to provide a full range of dental treatment for all eligible classes.  Consequently, the boards are continuing the policy laid down by previous Ministers whereby they concentrate on providing services for children referred under the Child Health Services, expectant and nursing mothers and other adults with medical cards who require dental treatment for urgent medical reasons. In these circumstances, only a very restricted service is available to other medical card holders at present.</P>

      <P>The general question of care facilities for pre-school children, including creches and day-nurseries, is one of the matters being considered by the Task Force on Child Care Services which I set up last October.

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women contained recommendations regarding the special requirement that single women or widows applying for unemployment assistance must have at least one dependant or have at least 52 ordinaryrate contributions paid over a recent four-year period.</P>
      <P>As an immediate measure the commission recommended that women employed in agriculture and domestic service should have access to unemployment assistance when they had 52 employment contributions paid, irrespective of the rate of such contributions. This recommendation was given effect to by the Social Welfare Act, 1973 and came into operation on 1st October, 1973.</P>
      <P>The position of women has been further improved in recent years by the introduction of new schemes such as deserted wife's benefit, deserted wife's allowance, social assistance allowances for prisoners' wives, unmarried mothers and elderly single women and by the progressive reductions in the qualifying age for both types of old age pension.  In most instances these schemes make better provision for women than would the unemployment assistance scheme because of better rates of payment and less rigorous requirements regarding means and also because they free the recipient from the necessity of attending a local office to prove unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission in further recommending that the contribution condition for women applicants should be abolished recognised that this course would pose difficulties for my Department in ensuring that women who claim unemployment assistance are genuinely seeking employment, but suggested that these difficulties might be alleviated to a large extent by requiring from both male and female recipients of assistance a greater degree of mobility as between different jobs and different locations.  It will be appreciated, however, that in the present unemployment situation, it is difficult to envisage measures of this kind having any appreciable effect.  Moreover, <Col N="1178" /> complete abolition of the special conditions for women, including the requirement of having a dependant, would bring into question, for instance, the award to husbands of increases of assistance in respect of their wives and the desirability of attracting and having to process large numbers of claims from married women which undoubtedly would have to be disallowed eventually on the grounds of means.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, though it is my intention that the recommendations of the commission will be kept in view in relation to any future development of the unemployment assistance scheme, I am not in a position to give the Deputy any indication of a timetable regarding the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum rate of unemployment assistance is not payable to the person concerned as his weekly rate of means was assessed at £2 by a deciding officer and this assessment was confirmed on appeal by an appeals officer.  The maximum amount of unemployment assistance payable to a single man who lives in a rural area and has no means is now £7.35 a week.  The amount of assistance to which the applicant is entitled, subject to the usual conditions for receiving it, is £5.35 a week, that is £7.35 less £2 means.  An appeals officer's decision is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>

From the correspondence I have it appears the application was made on 13th March and an award was made on 10th May.  The period between those two dates is not accounted for in the payment because the applicant was unable to produce records of his contribution as the book was lodged with the Department <Col N="1180" /> and it took a long time to get back to him.</P>

      <P>I do not think that is the case.  My reply indicated this was mainly a matter for the local authority.  So far as the Department came into the matter, they appear to have acted quite promptly.  According to the information available to me, a letter was received by the Department from the insured person on 19th March, 1975.  He requested particulars of his insurance record and they were supplied to him on 20th March, 1975. I must add that if all Departments acted with that promptitude we would all be quite happy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Reciprocal agreements which existed between this country and the United Kingdom made no provision for treatment benefit.  The Social Welfare (Treatment Benefit) Regulations provide that contributions paid and credited under the United Kingdom national insurance scheme may be taken into account for the purpose of satisfying the contribution conditions if, following arrival in this country, the person has taken up employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts, or if United Kingdom insurance had already been taken into account for the purpose of disability or maternity benefits.  There has been no change in this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the implementation of the EEC regulations in April, 1973, a number of persons were, by virtue of reciprocal agreements between this country and the United Kingdom, being paid disability benefit by my Department.  From that date, however liability for continuing payment to those persons, whose last employment was in the United Kingdom, reverted to that country in accordance with <Col N="1182" /> the provisions of the EEC regulations. Before such persons could again satisfy the contribution conditions for treatment benefit under the Social Welfare Acts they would have to take up insurable employment in this country.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be too summary in my reply.  As the Deputy is aware, I am not fully familiar with all the circumstances and I might be guilty of over-simplification. I understand that the position is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Treatment benefits are available under the Social Welfare Acts to persons who satisfy the following contribution conditions: (a) that not less than 156 contributions have been paid on the person's behalf, and (b) that not less than 26 contributions be paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  Where the applicant is under 21 years of age the payment of 26 contributions under the Social Welfare Acts is sufficient to give title. <Col N="1183" /> The Social Welfare (Treatment Benefit) Regulations, 1954, as amended, provide that contributions paid and credited under the British scheme may be taken into account for the purpose of satisfying the above conditions if, following arrival in this country, the person has taken up employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts, or if the British insurance had already been taken into account for the purpose of disability or maternity benefits.</P>
    <P>It was by virtue of those regulations that, prior to April, 1973, the date of the coming into effect of the EEC regulations, persons with a history of employment in the United Kingdom who had insufficient contributions under the Irish Acts to qualify, were enabled to have their contributions under the British Acts taken into account.</P>
    <P>Prior to the implementation of EEC regulations in April, 1973, a number of persons were being paid disability benefit by this Department. From that date, however, liability for continuing payment to such of those persons whose last employment was in the United Kingdom, reverted to that country.  Person in that category who have not since taken up insurable employment in this country could not at present qualify for treatment benefit under the Social Welfare Acts as the condition requiring that not less than 26 contributions be paid or credited in the governing contribution year could not be satisfied.</P>
    <P>The EEC regulations provide that a worker residing in a member State other than the competent State is entitled to benefits in kind provided on behalf of the competent State by the institution of the place of residence in accordance with the legislation administered by that institution.  They also provide that the costs of these benefits shall be refunded by the competent State.</P>
    <P>Under the regulations the health boards are the institutions responsible for providing these benefits in Ireland. Those persons concerned may, <Col N="1184" /> accordingly, apply for dental and optical benefits to the health boards concerned.</P>

      <P>The only category of employees which can be identified as coming within the scope of the Deputy's question are mariners normally resident in this country but employed on United Kingdom registered ships engaged in regular trade between this country and the United Kingdom.  While the exact numbers are not known, they would, however, be comparatively few.</P>
      <P>As such persons are no longer insured under the Social Welfare Acts, they cannot satisfy the contribution conditions for optical and dental benefits under those Acts.</P>

      <P>On the information available to me I cannot agree with the picture presented by the Deputy.  No complaints have been received in the Department of undue delay in dealing with claimants in the Cork Employment Exchange.  I am sure such complaints would be coming in if the vast queues of which the Deputy speaks were there.  In order to avoid delays, there have been relaxations in the normal procedures and, no doubt, it is the effect of these measures which has led to a situation where complaints are not being received.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that British pensioners who are also in receipt of pensions here are asked by the Department of Social Welfare when the British pension is increased to return their books in order that adjustments may be made, which means a reduction in the Irish pension?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about the phrase used in subsection (ii), &ldquo;property situate in the State&rdquo; and pointing out that we have established with the Minister that property situate in the State means a great deal more than might appear on its face since it has the same meaning as is attached to those words in the estate duty code. It includes items which might not be very obvious on the face of it.  As one example, it includes a simple contract debt due by somebody resident in the State to somebody abroad&mdash; that is &ldquo;property situate in the State&rdquo;. There are other cases that are not obvious on the face of it being property situate in the State.  Its meaning has considerable significance in this section because it is only property situate in the State which is liable to wealth tax, in the case of persons or an individual not domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State on the valuation date.</P>
      <P>The Minister has argued on the section generally and on subsection (ii) in particular that there is no inhibition on investment from abroad in this country in industry or otherwise. I think he has now narrowed that statement to saying that there is no such inhibition in the case of an individual as referred to in subsection (ii).  Am I misrepresenting the Minister's position in saying that?  Is he now saying: &ldquo;That is so, in the case of an individual from abroad as distinct from any other taxable body or private non-trading company&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central</i>): I have very little to add to what was said yesterday except that we welcome the clarification the Minister has given us.  We now have a clear outline of the guideline to foreign investors and we have a clear definition of what &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; means.  People proposing to come in with capital will be able to satisfy their minds as to how long they can stay in the country.  Up to now that was ambiguous but the Minister's amendment has clarified the situation.</P>
      <P>There are still many people of Irish origin in America and in parts of Europe who would like to bring their wealth back here and settle down. They would still be discouraged from doing that.  Many of these people emigrated and accumulated wealth but they will not be exempt from this tax if they come back and buy land or go into business.  If they from companies abroad they will be exempt but there are many Irish people, particularly in America, who have done quite well but who will be discouraged because of this Bill.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I welcome that foreign investment will be exempt because the bigger the capital inflow we get the better we will be able to expand our industrial arm and the sooner we will be able to alleviate our unemployment situation.  As we know, there has been a big reduction in the employment content in agriculture all over the world.  Here it is 25 per cent; in many European countries it is 15 per cent.  Therefore, if we are to hope for full employment we must encourage by every means the import of foreign capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to another section, to which Deputy Colley has an amendment, <Col N="1199" /> we hope to be able to persuade the Minister again to show consideration for Irish investment in Ireland. The whole kernel of the problem we are facing in this Bill is that we are taxing productive assets at a time when we should be encouraging Irish people at home to expand their businesses. When we come to the relevant section we hope to be able to persuade the Minister along the lines I have been speaking.  With that reservation&mdash;it has been expressed by Deputy Colley&mdash;I welcome the Minister's attitude on this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As we have indicated, we welcome the clarification we got from the Minister on the reading of certain words and phrases.  Nevertheless, we must take the section as it stands.  It is still the position that there will be discrimination against Irish business people and we could not support that proposition.  Therefore, we cannot support the section.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): We had a very full debate on this section.  We went through it line by line and as Deputies opposite will <Col N="1200" /> agree, every possible explanation was given.  The House is entitled to that. I am glad Deputies conceded more or less that there is no disincentive to foreign trading companies coming here and that the bulk of foreign investment for industry has been coming through foreign companies.</P>
      <P>In regard to the point raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick that Irish people who spend some time in America and want to come home here to set up a business or an industry find they are liable to tax, that is so but their position, in my opinion, has improved substantially as compared with a month ago because death duties are gone.  There is no point in repeating again and again that there is any discrimination against Irish people in this Bill or that there is any innovation in it.  I spoke about the two companies, one engaging in exports, which is completely tax free and the other dealing with the home market which is subject to 50 per cent corporation tax.  We had a full discussion on this section and beyond repeating that I do not propose to say anything further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): If the Deputy wishes I shall do that. This section provides for the aggregation of the wealth of the husband, wife and minor children.  If this were not done it could lead to the avoidance, or mitigation, of tax by the splitting by parents of wealth among the individual members of the family.  This approach was foreshadowed in the White Paper.  A minor child is a child under 21 who has not married.  The married child is excluded because he forms his own separate unit and in the case of a married female minor, her property is included in the taxable wealth of her husband.  A widowed minor is a separate taxable individual.</P>
      <P>In relation to subsection (1), the previous section describes the taxable wealth of an individual as the property to which the individual is beneficially entitled in possession.  This subsection states that the property to which an individual is beneficially entitled shall include the property to which the wife and minor children, if any, are beneficially entitled in possession.  The proviso ensures that, in the case of a widow or widower, the property of the minor children is also added to that of the living parent.</P>
      <P>In the case of an estranged husband and wife, the property of a minor child is included in the taxable wealth of the parent who has custody of that child.  The proviso is drafted to cover this situation.  If neither parent has custody, each minor child will form a separate taxable unit. Subsection (2) of section 1 indicates the circumstances where husband and wife are not regarded as living together.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides that any one of the aggregated group may apply for an apportionment of the tax assessed on the aggregate wealth of the family.  The father, mother, widow or widower, as the case may be, who is the assessable person, nevertheless remains primarily liable for the tax charged on the aggregate taxable wealth but is entitled to reimbursement for the tax referable to the wealth which is aggregated with his.  It should be noted that in the five countries regarding which we have information relating to the aggregation of the wealth of a husband and wife&mdash;Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden&mdash; such wealth is aggregated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely satisfied as to why property should be aggregated.  The Minister has said that otherwise it would not be possible, by dividing the property up amongst the family&mdash;I presume he means as between husband and wife&mdash;to evade liability. This brings up the whole question of treatment of the husband and wife as one unit&mdash;I am leaving out minor children for the moment&mdash;versus the treatment of a separated husband and wife as two units with consequentially much higher thresholds.  We established that on an earlier section.</P>
      <P>Where a husband and wife are permanently separated each would be entitled to the same threshold as a single individual.  Am I correct in that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is considerably advantageous for them.  I am questioning the principle involved here.  Why are a husband and wife who are living normally together to be treated more disadvantageously than a husband and wife who are permanently separated? What is the Minister's justification for that approach?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): It is proposed to treat a husband and wife living together in normal married circumstances as one unit.  There are precedents for that.  They have been so treated for a great many years for income tax purposes, the only tax code with which we are familiar here.  If we were not to treat them as one unit we would be opening a way to avoidance of tax.  We would be leaving it open for one spouse who was possessed of the wealth to transfer it or a share of it to the other spouse in order to gain a bigger allowance or to avoid payment of tax.  The question which Deputy Colley really puts to me is: why should a husband and wife who are separated and living apart get preferential treatment?  The short answer to that is that for all practical purposes they are single people if the marriage has broken up.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Here in Ireland, where we propose to aggregate the wealth, a single person gets an allowance of £70,000 and the husband and wife £100,000.  In Denmark the wealth is aggregated and the single person gets an allowance of £31,500 and the married couple get only the same amount.  In Sweden, again the wealth is aggregated, and the single person gets an allowance of £19,000, and the married couple get the same allowance of £19,000.  In Germany the wealth is aggregated, and the single person gets £11,500, the married couple £23,000.  In the Netherlands the wealth is aggregated: the single person, £6,800, the married couple £9,300. In Norway it is aggregated: the single person, £5,700; the married couple £7,700.  In Finland it is aggregated: the single person £3,000; the married couple £3,600.  In Luxembourg it is aggregated: the single person gets £1,100 and the married couple get the same allowance.  It can be seen from these figures that not alone is wealth aggregated in all those countries but that our thresholds are very generous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I am not in a position to give the Deputy the dates on which those thresholds and arrangements were fixed, but I can tell him that the wealth tax was introduced in Denmark in 1904, in Sweden in 1910, in Germany in 1922, in the Netherlands in 1892, in Norway in 1911, and in Luxembourg in 1943.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I do not know when those thresholds were fixed.  Again it is not relevant for the purpose of this argument, but it is true that those countries got on very well with the wealth tax.  I am informed&mdash;but again I would have to check up on it&mdash;that most of the thresholds I have given have been laid down recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But I presume the principle the Minister is talking about was laid down at the beginning, that is, the relationship between the single and the married allowance.  That is one of the points I want to put to the Minister.  Apart from what has been happening in those other countries, the Minister is correct in saying that, substantially under our own income tax code, we have treated the husband and wife as one unit.  However, if we look at the allowance for a married couple versus the allowance <Col N="1206" /> for two single people, what we find is this: this code was drawn up a long time ago when the view taken of the role of the wife was, I hope, quite different from that which prevails today.  At that time it made sense to treat the husband and the wife as one unit.  I think the Minister will also agree that over the years efforts have been made by successive Ministers for Finance to try and close the gap to ensure that in the case of income tax allowances the combination of two single personal allowances would equal that of a married couple.  The difficulty is that to do anything like this costs a great deal of money, and so only steps towards this were possible, but the trend has been to try to achieve this.</P>
      <P>Here we have a new tax.  We can start off with a clean sheet without building up the kind of problems that built up in the income tax system. We can determine our approach on the basis of present-day thinking, not the thinking that prevailed when income tax was introduced, nor the thinking that prevailed when the various schemes of wealth tax in other countries were introduced, as the Minister has detailed.  We ought to approach it on the basis of current thinking on this matter.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of the Minister for Finance and the revenue involved in this, the total revenue expected from wealth tax is relatively so small that it will not make a great deal of difference one way or the other which way it is fixed.  But one thing is certain: it will be far easier to fix this matter now than it will ever be in the future.  If we pass this Bill with this kind of thinking in it any Minister for Finance in the future will have a great deal of difficulty if he wants to remedy the position, whereas now it is relatively easy to remedy it without any great financial difficulty for the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that more and more nowadays&mdash;I would hope to a very wide degree&mdash;it is accepted that a married woman is entitled to be treated as an individual in her own right, but the whole drafting of this section is based on a very antiquated approach.  I shall <Col N="1207" /> be dealing with this point later but, to reinforce what I am saying, I point out now to the Minister the reference in paragraph (a) to &ldquo;the wife&rdquo;&mdash;not to the spouse, the wife.  The whole concept is that the husband is the one who counts and the wife and minor children are appendages to be added in to create this unit.  I agree that this was certainly the approach in previous legislation.  It was the approach, as the Minister pointed out, in legislation introduced in other countries, but legislation in the main introduced a very long time ago, and I want to put it to the Minister now that Dáil Éireann, in 1975, should not be adopting that approach, remembering that the financial implications in particular for the Exchequer are not really great.</P>
    <P>I say that on the basis that my recollection is that the best estimate of the yield from wealth tax that the Minister for Finance could give us was £1,500,000.  In those circumstances what I am talking about here will not make any major difference to the Exchequer.  Is it not time we approached this on the basis of treating a married woman as an individual in her own right?  If we look at the consequences of not doing that we see the very strange anomalies that develop.  One of them I have already developed, namely, that two single people get an allowance under the wealth tax of £140,000 whereas a married couple get an allowance of £100,000.  That is a substantial difference operating against the married couple.  But we have the even stranger position that a separated married couple get an allowance between them of £140,000 whereas the married couple living together normally get an allowance of only £100,000.  These anomalies &mdash; I do not think they can be described as other than anomalies &mdash; arise because the approach to the whole question is taken from much older legislation which was drafted at a time when the general public attitude in regard to the role of the married woman was different&mdash;at least, I hope it was different&mdash;from what it is today.</P>
    <P>I would have expected that this <Col N="1208" /> Government, which likes to present itself as being forward thinking &mdash; I may have another view as to whether it is or not &mdash; would have taken the opportunity presented by this Bill to signify their acceptance of the role of the married woman as an individual in her own right, entitled to at least the same treatment as a single woman or a single man or, indeed, as her husband.  Effectively what we are doing here is saying that a woman who is single&mdash;she may be living with a man, but that is irrelevant&mdash;is entitled to an allowance of £70,000 under this Bill.  If, however, she is married she is not to be treated as the equal of a single woman or a single man and she is not to be treated as the equal of her husband because this section goes on to talk about &ldquo;the wife of the individual&rdquo;&mdash; not the spouse, the wife.  This is out of date.  It is an antiquated approach. It would be quite easy for the Minister to adopt a modern approach and I am urging him, appealing to him, to do just that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>As this Bill stands, it will pay a couple who are thinking of getting married not to get married because, if they do not get married, they will find themselves £400 a year better off from the point of view of wealth tax.  I asked the Minister for the European figures because it was interesting to see what other countries are doing.  Now there is a basic difference between what is proposed here and what European countries operating a wealth tax are doing.  In most cases, according to the assessments we have got, the rate of tax in the countries quoted by the Minister work out at considerably less, as much as one half to two-thirds less, when applied to the 1 per cent Irish rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument put forward by Deputy Colley is a valid argument.  It seems to me, taking into consideration the arguments of some Government Deputies about the very small number to whom, it is presumed, this tax will apply&mdash;I am inclined to doubt the number&mdash;the principle of equality which should be applied to women is not being applied.  It is <Col N="1209" /> ridiculous to think that if two young people happen to be well off enough each of them will have to pay approximately £200 per annum additional wealth tax if they get married. The comparisons the Minister gave with European countries are not valid in another area also because the high percentage level of taxation here is well above most European countries. The figures available to me indicate that in most countries, except Luxembourg, the annual top level of tax is not reached until the earned and unearned income is as much as twice and two-and-a-half times and, in the case of Germany, about four times the level you have here.  Comparisons, therefore, in relation to low thresholds of wealth tax and the small difference between the single person and the married person are not valid when one applies the criteria of what is the percentage level of tax of all taxes on people with earned and unearned income.</P>
    <P>The Irish level, even at the present time, is above most of these countries, that is, it reaches the top level sooner than most European countries. Therefore, the argument about the lower thresholds in relation to a wealth tax does not carry and, in most of these European countries, the percentage will work out at far less than the present 1 per cent to be applied here.</P>
    <P>In Germany the deductability of the wealth tax against income appears to reduce the effective rate to as low as 0.4 per cent against the 1 per cent here.  The position in Denmark is similar.  Contrary to what the Minister said, there is a good argument for the suggestion put forward by Deputy Colley that as we are only starting this tax, we should make the married couple equal, in terms of their own individual place in society, to a single person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central</i>): I would like to pursue the points made by Deputy Colley and Deputy Brugha.  Forty or fifty years ago there was a different concept of a wife to the one held today.  The working wife is established in this country.  There has been a great deal <Col N="1210" /> of agitation for relief from income tax for these working wives.  These women will have independence whether we like it or not.  Years ago it was thought that the woman's place was in the home but today she has her own place in society, her own circle of friends and quite often pursues her own pleasures within limits, she might play golf, drive her own car and so on.  This shows that wives are more independent today.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions in the past a man and a woman, each with their own property, married.  Often the wife kept her own property and worked it.  Sometimes she owned the greater amount of property.  Under this Bill if the wife is to claim independently, even if she owns her own property which will be aggregated with her husband's she, and her husband, will be entitled to £100,000.  As a result a wife who has spent a considerable amount of time in her business will only get £50,000 while her single friend who is operating a business next door is entitled to £70,000. I believe there is a grave injustice in this situation.  I can see that a married woman could be very aggrieved about this.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we have an opportunity to get a new concept of the status of women.  This is Women's Year.  The Minister can contribute in no small way towards enhancing the status of women under this section.  He could give them the same status as a single person.  I do not believe it would cost the State very much.  As Deputy Colley said if we want to amend this legislation in years to come it will be much more difficult.  As time goes on, and there is nothing surer, women all over the world will be claiming more independence.  We have to concede extra tax allowances to them in every budget.  That would not have been heard of 50 years ago in an income tax code.  In my opinion, if women knew about this Bill we would have heard their voices over the past five or six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is a weakness in this Bill and I would ask the Minister to look at the situation I have mentioned, because a woman who has <Col N="1211" /> run a business through the years may consider she has been victimised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): As I stated previously, there has been an established practice here of treating the husband and wife as a unit.  They are treated as a unit for many things, including taxation, and we have followed the practice that applies in the other countries I have mentioned.  The tax code in these countries is not static. It has been reviewed from year to year. reviewed frequently, and we find that the wealth of the husband and wife is aggregated in all these countries.  There is no doubt that a husband and wife living together have probably a greater taxable capacity than two private individuals living separately and apart.  It is true, too, and there is no use in denying it, that two people living as husband and wife can and do live cheaper than the cost to individuals living separately and apart.  It does strike me that if we were to accept Deputy Colley's suggestion that every married couple would not then be treated the same the allowance they would get would depend on whom the wealth was vested in.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a point at some length in regard to a single lady who has a flourishing business and gets married.  He thinks she should be treated as a single person.  I could see that leading to some arrangement that might afterwards be regretted.  I could see this married lady whom he talked about as having a good business getting married to a man who has no property but has a fairly good income, and for no better reason than to get a better allowance for wealth tax, she would&mdash;I will not say &ldquo;be forced&rdquo;&mdash;be economically coerced into transferring a slice of her property to her husband.  That <Col N="1213" /> could very well be done but very soon after the marriage, when the honeymoon was virtually still on, there might be regrets.  If that were done years after, it might be all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I think that if we here create a single allowance for a married person, we will be creating that sort of situation where property will be divided for no higher motive than the motive of securing a tax allowance.  I can see a husband who is in receipt of a good income&mdash;he might be a man of considerable expertise who knows a lot about the tax code&mdash;quite easily talking his wife into splitting the property in two and that might work out all right but it might have disastrous consequences.  It could be done anyway, but if it is done for, shall we say, love or if it is done because the wife wants to convey some property to her husband, well and good, and if it works out badly after it is too bad.  I do not think the legislature here should create a situation by which it virtually pressurises people into entering into these arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I would prefer to tell the Deputy that I am convinced that those who are <Col N="1214" /> separated should get a better allowance because I have sympathy for them because their marriage has broken down, because their marriage is on the rocks, and maybe there is at least one innocent party and there could be two innocent parties.  I think it is only right that if the marriage has broken down and these people are coerced into paddling their own canoe, they should be given the benefit of the single allowance.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Belton has said, we are not dealing with a very big percentage of people here.  Furthermore, there is a real worthwhile increase in the allowance for the married couple.  There is an allowance of £100,000 and there is the exemption for the family home and contents.  It is not likely that two single people would have two separate houses, but it would follow, if we were to adopt the suggestion of Deputy Colley and others, that we would either have to differentiate between the married couples or allow each to have a separate house.  We would either have to exempt the house in respect of each of them or say that where the married couple were concerned, they would only be allowed one house and that would be a differentiation in any event.</P>
      <P>I think the proposal here is reasonable and in keeping with tradition here.  It will get over a difficulty for the spouse who possesses the wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can be complimented on his ingenuity but he must feel he is on thin ice when he is forced to argue that there is a danger in what we have suggested, that a wife who is well off in the sense of property as compared with her husband for the purposes of a wealth tax advantage might transfer some of her property to her husband and regret it afterwards. I do not think the Minister can expect us to take that argument too seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton considers it a waste of time to talk about this matter and he said there were more urgent and serious matters in the Bill.  Certainly there are urgent and serious matters in it but I would question Deputy Belton's dismissal of this as of no importance.  I would do so even if only one person were involved but, of <Col N="1215" /> course, there are many more involved. Even if the number is small, it does not affect the issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a very cogent case with regard to working wives, women who own their own business either because they inherited it or because they have built it up themselves, who subsequently marry.  So far as I am concerned, a wife who is living at home and looking after her family is working just as hard and is worth just as much as a wife who goes out to work to earn a living and she is entitled to the same treatment under the law as the working wife.</P>
    <P>The basic point comes back to the individual.  The Minister spoke about what would arise if this suggestion were accepted.  I cannot remember his exact words but he spoke as though the unit of husband and wife was the concept we must cling to.  It is the one that is in the Bill.  The concept of the husband and wife being a unit for tax purposes is out of date.  Certainly they are a unit for very important and basic social purposes but they should not be penalised for that reason.  The right approach is to say that each individual will be treated in the same way.  I do not care what will be the consequences; if we treat each individual equally we accept the consequences.</P>
    <P>However, I am sufficiently realistic to accept that if this proposition were applied overnight to income tax it would be so expensive as to be prohibitive. I realise it is not possible for the State to do that but the principle is right and where it can be applied it should be done.  It can be applied in this case.  It may be that the Minister just omitted to say it but I think it is of some significance that he did not comment on my statement that financially it would not make an enormous difference to the Exchequer to accept this suggestion as against doing what is in the section.  Because I believe there is not any great difficulty for the Exchequer in accepting the suggestion, I am all the more anxious that the principle involved should be established and recognised where it can be done.  It can be done here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> It is not really in keeping with our professions about our concern regarding the status of women.  In particular it is not in keeping with the professions of concern by the Government and the Minister for Labour about the status of women to introduce a Bill, starting from scratch, without serious implications for the Exchequer, and to carry on the same, old approach that was incorporated in the early Income Tax Acts and in the Wealth Tax Acts of other countries which the Minister quoted.  Some of them dated back to the last century and most of them to the early part of this century.</P>

      <P>We know from our own experience with regard to income tax that once one starts on the wrong foot there are financial difficulties in trying to rectify the matter afterwards.  I am putting to the Minister that he can get it right now with no great difficulty and there will not be any problem afterwards.  I am quite sure my colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick, was right when he said that if we enact this measure as it is, as sure as night follows day there will be agitation on the lines we have set out.  It will be more difficult to meet the case as time goes on, when it becomes entrenched and when income is coming in.  Now it is possible to do it with very little difficulty. That is why I am urging the Minister, as strongly as I can, to rethink the whole proposition, to start on the basis that under the wealth tax all citizens will be treated equally, whether married or single, whether men or women.  If he does that he will not go wrong.</P>
      <P>He raised a problem about what might be done with regard to the allowance for the private residence.  I admit it may be a problem.  Logically one should say that two residences would be allowed for the husband and wife but I am sufficiently realistic to say I could contemplate a situation where only one would be allowed where the husband and wife are living together.  Where they are not living together we could allow two.</P>

One of the absurdities which might arise from Deputy Colley's suggestion is to be seen clearly when we come to the residence which he highlighted himself. We either say: &ldquo;You are married and you can only have one residence and, for the purposes of the residence, you have to be treated as one&rdquo; or: &ldquo;If you are living apart you can have two residences&rdquo;.  That could lead to their playing at having two houses or nominally having two houses.  That could lead to misunderstandings too.  The best way to deal with this is to leave it as it is.

As far as I can see, that definition is taken from section 196 (1) of the 1967 Income Tax Act. Subsection (2) of that Act has an effect which is not incorporated in this, and I am wondering if there is a reason for it.  Non-residence of one spouse for a year or years does not of itself involve separation under this Bill as it would under subsection (2) of section 196 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.

If it is obvious that the marriage has broken up and that the break-up is likely to be permanent, that could be apparent after a week if the break-up was of such a nature as to indicate that it was likely to be permanent.  On the other hand, the break-up might not appear to be permanent for some time.  A man could say he was going over to England to work and that he would be home for Christmas.  He might not come home for Christmas and he might not come home the following Christmas.  If he packed his bags and went off with another lady that would appear to be permanent.

      <P>Perhaps I did not make clear what was the query I was putting the Minister.  I am not questioning the part he is talking about.  It seems to me that the provision to <Col N="1220" /> which the Minister referred, which determines whether the wife is living with the husband, is taken from subsection (1) of section 196 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which provides that they are separated under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or by deed of separation, or they are in fact separated in such circumstances that the separation is likely to be permanent.  It is exactly the same wording.  The query I was putting to the Minister was this.  Subsection (2) of that section of the 1967 Act goes on to provide:</P>
      <P>Where a married woman is living with her husband and either&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  one of them is, and one of them is not, resident in the State for a year of assessment, or</P>
      <P>(b)  both of them are resident in the State for a year of assessment but one of them is, and one of them is not absent from the State throughout that year,</P>
      <P>the same consequences shall follow for income tax (including sur-tax) purposes as would have followed if, throughout that year of assessment, they had been in fact separated in such circumstances that the separation was likely to be permanent.</P>
      <P>Since the provisions of subsection (1) were included, is there a reason for omitting the provisions of subsection (2)?</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I understand that for income tax purposes it is relevant to have regard to residence for the entire year.  Here we are dealing with a situation as on 5th April in any year.  It is in ease of the taxpayer to draft the definition as we have drafted it.  A marriage could have broken up at Christmas or in February or in March and, on 5th April, they are regarded as single people.  It is not a hardship on the taxpayer to draft it as we have drafted it because it enables the Revenue Commissioners to look at the position as on 5th April.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that that is true provided that you adopt the approach he has adopted of treating the family as a unit for the purposes of wealth tax.  If the Minister were prepared to treat a husband and wife as individuals and give the <Col N="1230" /> allowance in respect of the minor children to the person who had custody or if there was no question of that and they both had custody, letting them opt as to who would get the allowance in respect of the minor children none of these problems would arise at all.  There would be an individual liable in respect of his or her own tax and he or she would be responsible to the Revenue Commissioners.  The other individual would have no responsibility which would seem to be the required position.  I wonder if I could come back to a point on which the Minister has not commented?  Perhaps I should not ask him to comment as it might not be to my advantage. Would the Minister comment on the statement I made earlier, that if the Minister were to treat the husband and wife as separate individuals, as we have urged, this would not be of major financial significance to the Exchequer?</P>

      <P>I am not so much concerned with the kind of case the Minister has mentioned, the wealthy wife and the no-good husband who, as he said, would probably throw the forms into the waste-paper basket.  He has to take the consequences of his inaction.  I am more concerned with the case where under this section the husband is liable, and he is in law living with his wife but they are not on very good terms.  He may be a reasonably conscientious man and wants to discharge his obligations under the section, but she is in no way going to let him know the details of her business and he would be liable to penalty if he did not make the return.  Such cases arises where the husband will be caught between the two millstones here, of the Revenue Commissioners on the one hand, and <Col N="1234" /> his successful and probably somewhat over-powering wife who is determined not to let him know the details of her business, on the other hand.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not.  I am satisfied that for tax purposes it is reasonable and that the allowances given for the married couple are generous, and when the house is thrown in the provision is quite generous.  I honestly believe that, far from taking away from the independence of the female spouse, it is leaving her independence with her.  If they were assessed as individuals, then without regard to the ultimate consequences, the wife, if she were wealthy-and it seems to be the wife that Deputy Colley is concerned about-would be forced or persuaded or encouraged to transfer her property to her husband for no better reason than to qualify for the maximum tax allowance.  I put that proposition to the House for serious consideration.  I do not want to prolong the discussion by saying that the Opposition are making two different cases: they are concerned about the wife not having her full allowance, and then they are concerned about the husband having to pay for the wife.</P>

      <P>The examples given relate to most European countries which have this form of tax, many of them for 40 or 50 years, but we are talking about this tax for the first time in this country in 1975 after the European Economic Community have made a considerable case about equal pay for women.  It would be a different situation if many of these European countries were now introducing a wealth tax, because then, as EEC members, they would have to have regard to the principle of equality which they are supporting and presumed to support.  The difference between the system of tax which the Government are introducing and that in other European countries is a difference in time; the idea of equality towards women has now become more a thing to be upheld than when the other countries introduced wealth tax. Reading through the Bill and particularly reading section 4, I gather the Minister for Finance is recognising the family situation but is not doing what perhaps should be done in a country like this, giving a better status to the family as distinct from individuals.  If an individual is entitled to a threshold of £70,000 one would imagine that not only should a family be entitled to that same allowance but that, because it was a family that would include children, the allowance should perhaps be a bit higher.</P>
      <P>My main argument is that we are introducing this Bill in 1975 when the European Economic Community have accepted, at least in theory if not entirely in practice, the idea that there should be equal pay, and that therefore women, because they get married, should not be in an unequal situation.</P>

      <P>Before I reported progress <Col N="1238" /> on 7th May last, the House had been discussing an amendment tabled by Deputy Molloy to amendment No. 48.  It is, I think, fair to say the House had accepted my amendment to look outside the area of the planning authority in question and have regard to the probable effect a particular decision by it would have on an area outside.  Deputy Molloy's point was that this approach should be adopted in all cases and I resisted his amendment because it would have the effect of replacing a flexible enabling power by an inflexible mandatory provision in all cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's proposal, but where he says &ldquo;they may, if they so think fit&rdquo; I think it would be better if we stated they shall always have regard to these matters and would always take into consideration the adjoining local authority area in deciding planning in their own particular area.  It should be a condition that they should always do so.  It could happen that they might ignore this and say they were not obliged to have regard under the Act. I think they should always take into consideration the adjoining area in planning for their own area and I believe this change would strengthen the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Deputy's point and I am sure he sees mine.  The Deputy wants to say that in every case they must take into consideration the adjoining area.  There could be cases where that would not be necessary and <Col N="1239" /> they should not, therefore, have to do it.  Deputy Molloy's amendment would make it mandatory on the planning authority to go through the motion in every case.  That would be a mistake.</P>

      <P>In subsection (8), page 12, between lines 32 and 33, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) the planning authority shall have power to charge the developer in respect of any costs incurred by it in respect of development.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Builders go in on sites and promise they will do this, that and the other. When the houses are finished they leave, and open spaces are left undeveloped and in a very unsightly condition. I believe the local authority should be able to move in quickly, clear up the open space and surcharge the builders.  This would ensure that the builder would live up to his responsibility. I have heard numerous complaints from residents' associations around Dublin about the state in which these estates are left when the builder has finished building the houses.  A surcharge on the builder would help to solve this problem though there might be difficulty sometimes in tracing the builder.  We should ensure that the builder at all times lives up to his obligations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure what Deputy O'Brien means.  The section is intended to ensure that where the builder has recovered the full cost, and more, of the land, whatever open space is there should be acquired by the local authority, without having to make any payment.  If the builder did not recover, for one reason or another, and the local authority wanted to acquire the land it would not be possible under our present Constitution to confiscate the land.  Perhaps I misunderstand Deputy O'Brien's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am saying is that where a builder leaves an open site undeveloped the local authority will take over the site and develop it.  The builder will be only too delighted because he will be relieved of the cost of developing the open space.  When the local authority move in and develop it, they should charge the builder for that development.  It is a question of making the builder live up to his responsibility. We are not taking anything from him.  He does not want that square of ground.  He had to provide it in the original plans.  He is not developing it.  He is leaving it to the local authorities to develop it at the expense of the ratepayer.  It is wrong that the builder should be allowed to get away with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what Deputy O'Brien is talking about now.  There is power in the 1963 Act to have this done.  The trouble is not so much that the builder is getting away with it, but that local authorities are not taking the necessary steps to ensure that their powers are being operated.  I suggest that is the way to deal with this.  Unfortunately, it would not be relevant to this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in favour of this section because it ensures that those who occupy new houses in a housing scheme will have the necessary amenities to which they are entitled. Where the developer could disappear without trace or where he is clearly unable to carry out the development of the open space, for financial or other reasons, it is understandable that provision should be made.  Where a developer neglects to carry out the work and the local authority takes over and develops the property, then the ratepayers suffer if there is no way in which the development money can be recouped by the local authority.  We have had harrowing experiences of schemes in which open spaces were left undeveloped after the developers had left the area.  Families suffer because of <Col N="1241" /> this particularly in large estates because there is a considerable need for this type of amenity, especially in present-day circumstances.</P>
      <P>Where the local authority takes over an open space about which the developer is not very concerned, is the developer relieved of his responsibility? Of course, to develop this space would cost him a certain amount of money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of the site I assume would be what he paid for it and what he got out of it in profit. Subsection (8) sets out the position in relation to the payment of compensation for lands vested under this section. In default of agreement as to compensation, the amount is to be determined by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  Subparagraph (a) provides that a nil award shall be made, unless it is shown by the owner that he did not, or will not, recover the value of the land at the time of application for planning permission as a result of carrying out the development, or semi-development of other parts of the land.  The total cost of the lands of the housing estate, including the portion reserved for open space, is recovered in the sale price of the houses or sites.  Subparagraph (b) provides, in the event of the value of the land being assessed for compensation purposes, that it shall be valued on the basis that it cannot be used for any other purpose than open space and that a deduction shall be made of the cost of carrying out the necessary works.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If a person buys a site for £30,000 and builds three houses which he sells for £10,000 each, and in the planning permission he stated that the houses were to be situated in such a place and an area of the land was for open space which he did not provide or properly develop and when the acquisition notice was served he claimed compensation, in such a situation would the Minister deem that he had recovered the cost of acquiring the site?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is giving a very unreal example.  Nobody would pay £30,000 for a site and build three <Col N="1243" /> houses for £10,000 each.  How would he recover the cost of building of the houses, which would have to be taken into account?</P>
      <P>Suppose somebody pays £100,000 for a site and builds a housing estate but when he has sold all his houses he has only recovered £90,000.  He would be £10,000 short of cost of the site.  If that happened, I assume he would be entitled to compensation.  If, however, he made the price of the site, plus a profit, I assume he would not be entitled to compensation, because the original planning permission contained a stipulation that this was an open space.  Therefore he knew before he started to build on that portion of the site that he could not recover any of his money and would have to recover on the portion which he got to build on.  I think it is right that we should operate section 21 to ensure that everybody will know what exactly his position is.</P>

      <P>No Bill of this kind is easy to operate but I do not see any difficulty which would prevent its operating.  The onus is on him to show the arbitrator that he has not recovered his money, so I believe it will work and that it is necessary to have it.

      <P>They are the very people who do not keep accounts in this highly organised fashion.  Many of the smaller builders produce the bulk of the houses built and they do not work on a very highly documented system.  They get the house <Col N="1245" /> up and to ask such a man to produce documents relating to timber, nails and cement from four years ago, what he paid the men and how many men were there and how many hours they worked, is just not on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about housing estates and to suggest that any builder does not know what it cost to build a house is not correct. It is amazing how they can produce them straight out of the hat without referring to books and refer back and say what it cost them to build a single house or a scheme of houses a good many years back.  There is a standard number of men and it is easy enough to assess that, and in relation to the nails, they will have a schedule of the materials used and that is not a problem.  As far as I can see, this is a section which can be operated and a section which it is essential to have in the Bill if it is to do the job for which it is intended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider it much simpler to insist that local authorities should operate the system of bond deposits with the local authority as a condition of planning permission, where the money is accessible to the local authority if the conditions of the permission are not complied with?  That facility is there under the existing Act, and that area should be strengthened rather than involving the local authority in having to acquire the land which was originally proposed as an open space in a development and subsequently was not developed&mdash;the local authority then having to buy that land from the developer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of whether Deputy Molloy is right or I am right.  If he is right, it is not possible to assess the cost of the scheme and if I am right, it is.  In so far as <Col N="1246" /> the question of the council having to acquire is concerned, the situation at the moment is that even though the 1963 Act allows them to do this, they have not done it and we have this unholy mess all over the city and areas around the city and in other cities and towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not need to strengthen it, if the local authorities would have the good sense to see that this is necessary.  What Deputy Molloy is overlooking is that the open space as such is of no value to the builder. If he gets planning permission, that open space is of no value to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain builders have found that lands which at the time could be deemed not to have any value, when a change in the Ministry and its personnel came about, permissions were granted subsequently where originally it was known that permission would not be allowed and land acquired value over-night with the change of Minister.  That has happened and land has been zoned as open space for the development of which you have granted permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I found was that land zoned for an open space in Galway was being switched, or an attempt was being made to switch it, to a school and this was not allowed.  I have not granted and will not grant permission for land which has been zoned for open space, but I will tell you what I did find happening, and Deputies sitting across from me may have found it also&mdash;builders claiming as an open space land which they did not own and having accepted as open space.  This is one thing which I have stopped, but it did happen.  In this case the open space is of no value to the builder and therefore what has been happening up to now is that where local authorities do not take the necessary steps to ensure that the 1963 Act provision is complied with, builders have left the areas in a shambles.  It did not matter a whole lot whether they had the provision <Col N="1247" /> made or not because many of them did not have the wherewithal to complete the job and many of them were just chasing from one place to another.  I know that a number of builders throughout the country took on jobs and guaranteed to do certain jobs but did not complete them, leaving everything in a mess.</P>
      <P>What I am trying to do here, and I cannot swear any more than anybody else can that it will work out exactly as I want it to work out, is to put into this Bill safeguards which will allow the local authority to be able to develop an open space and have it properly looked after rather than have the heaps of rubble about which Deputy O'Brien talked earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot allow the Minister's statement to pass without comment.  He has said he would never grant permission for development on land that was zoned to be kept as open space.  I would refer him to land zoned to be kept as open space in the Circular Road area in Galway.  Permission had been refused on a number of occasions until he came into office. Permission was granted by him for development in this area although the Galway city development plan stated quite specifically that no development was to take place.  The value of that land increased enormously because of the Minister's decision.  I cannot let pass the Minister's statement that he would not allow any development on open space when there has been such a case.  I could quote many others in the past two years.</P>
      <P>However, we have made our point about bonds.  We have accepted the section as it stands.  We agree with the intention of the section but I am querying its workability.  There may be problems later.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the area in Galway to which the Deputy has referred.  I cannot recollect the incident but the Deputy, perhaps unintentionally, is confusing the House with regard to open space.  We are talking about open space attached to a housing development.  There is open space which does not come into <Col N="1248" /> housing but which may be regarded as zoned for open space.  If the authority to change the zoning is wrong that should have been put into the Bill but it did not happen.  The Bill that Deputy Molloy, myself and others have operated gave authority to the Minister to change zoning.  I should hate anyone to get the impression that I gave permission to someone to build on an open space attached to a housing estate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The local residents did not enter into it.  It was not an open space.  It was zoned by Waterford Corporation at that time for industry or for shopping purposes.  It was subsequent to the decision given by me that the Waterford Corporation decided to rezone it.  Deputy Cunningham is aware of this; if he does not know the facts he should not talk about the case.  The facts are that it was not zoned for open space but was zoned for industry or for commercial purposes. After the decision was given an application was made to have it rezoned and it was carried by a majority of the corporation.  I have no complaint about the matter.  The decision I <Col N="1250" /> gave was quite in order.  There was no open space attached to the housing estate involved in this matter.  It is unfair that Deputies should tell half-truths in this House, although this is much nearer to a complete untruth.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 50:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 13, line 1, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, the purpose of the section is to discourage unauthorised development at an early stage.  It enables <Col N="1251" /> warning notices to be served to stop such unauthorised development, to protect trees and other features.  This is praiseworthy and there is no reason why any risk should be taken in relation to it.  If the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used in the section it is possible that in some instances the planning authority will not issue a warning notice and quite possibly damage may result from the fact that they have not issued the notice.  It would be better to ensure by legislation that the notice is issued. The extra work involved would not be great.  When the conditions are laid down relative to the section, and when the information is being sent to the person concerned, there would not be any great difficulty in sending a warning notice.  Therefore, I recommend that the Minister should favourably consider the change suggested in Deputy Haughey's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but the amendment is not acceptable.  It would make it mandatory on the planning authority to serve a warning notice in every case where it appears to them that the land is being or is about to be developed without permission. Is seems to be based on a misconception of the purpose of the section.  If Deputy Faulkner or Deputy Haughey wanted to increase the penalties for all unauthorised development, whether the development itself is objectionable or not, the more appropriate way to do this would be to amend section 24 of the 1963 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 22 of the Bill has been provided in response to requests from planning authorities for power to serve a notice to stop a developer from commencing or continuing development. Section 24 of the 1963 Act can continue to serve its original purpose, that is, to ensure compliance with the requirement that no development be commenced without permission. Where unauthorised development takes place and there is no serious objection to it, the position can usually be regularised by an application for permission.  To ensure that is done, it is necessary that some penalty should be provided.  Planning authorities have hesitated to use the enforcement <Col N="1252" /> power under section 31 of the Act to deal with unauthorised development which is seriously objectionable and would prefer in such cases to be able to discourage the person responsible from proceeding by serving a notice which would impose a liability for increased penalties.</P>
    <P>I think the amendment should be withdrawn.  It is well intentioned but it does not serve the purpose for which it was put down.  Its effect would be to impose the same liability for penalties in respect of all unauthorised development.  This, if desirable, could be better done by an amendment of section 24 of the Act.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to define what exactly he means by &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;, or alternatively will he state how a person could unknowingly fail to comply with the requirements of the warning notice if he had already got it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very good question.  I would imagine that anyone who was doing a job would know what he was doing.  I am assured by my advisers that it is necessary to put in &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;.  Subsection (4) provides that any person who knowingly fails to comply with the requirements of the warning notice shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of £100.  I assume that the person would have received the warning notice. That is where &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; would come in.  If he did not know about it I assume the liability would not arise. This is the advice I have got and there must be good reason for it.  The notice would be served on the owner of the land.</P>

It is always possible that some further person may be unaware of the notice and contravene it in some way.  That is why the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is a pre-condition to an offence.

      <P>If it was served on the owner of the land, the owner of the land would be the person who had get permission.  I am quite sure the lawyers will have fun with this one. This is the advice I have got and I feel the amendment should not be made.  The purpose of the amendment is probably to remove the difficulty in proving that there was a contravention knowingly.  It is not likely to arise in regard to construction works or continuous or unauthorised use.  The owner of the land will have been served with a notice.  Possibly it could arise where the preservation of a tree or other feature or thing is required.</P>

I do not think he could be referred to as anything other than the owner of the land.  Nobody would accept the argument that he only had it leased for 99 years.  Anybody involved in development would be served with notice and in particular the person responsible would be the person who was operating it as the owner.  In relation to land the owner means a person, other than a mortgagee not in possession, who, whether in his own right or as trustee or agent for any other person, is entitled to receive the rack rent of the land or, where the land is not let at rack rent, would be so entitled if it were so let.  That is provided in section 2 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>

    <P>Judging by today's standards a fine of £100 is ludicrous.  It might pay people to violate planning laws.  They might well make money on that basis, particularly if it is the demolition of a building that he would not have a right to demolish.  What would he be fined?  There is something further on than that.  Somebody moves in and demolishes a building which he has no permission to demolish.  Do you fine him £100?  It is an offence.  Particularly now in city areas where housing is involved, developers can move in to develop offices; they can well afford to pay at the rate of £100 a day on a continuing offence because at the end of the time in view of the cost of office accommodation they are still well within their profit margin.  It pays them to break the law.  Whether it is £500 or £1,000 the penalty must be seen to be a deterrent.  If people do <Col N="1256" /> not feel it, it is no longer a deterrent and this encourages people to break the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for putting down the amendment is something similar.  Where there are penalties in sections of the Bill they should be realistic.  These figures were put in in 1962 and 1963 when this Bill was being debated which finally became the 1963 Act and the figures then were somewhat similar to those the Minister proposes now in this new section bringing in a conviction under section 22 about warning notices.  We should try to ensure that the sums included in the Bill are not restricted to small amounts.  These matters have to be decided subsequently in the courts and I think the person making the judicial decision should have the option of imposing a severe fine in some cases or a mild fine in others. If he is confined to a maximum of £100, I do not see how, in many cases, the judge can impose a severe fine.  I should like to see the limits raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, section 22 enables higher penalties to be imposed for offences coming within section 24 of the 1963 Act, i.e., unauthorised development. The increases are from £20 to £100 for the basic offence and from £10 per day to £100 per day and/or six months' imprisonment for a continuing offence.  Amendments 53-56 seek to increase the penalties still further&mdash;£500 or £1,000 initially and £500 or £1,000 per day for a continuing offence.</P>
      <P>Article 38 of the Constitution authorises the trying of minor offences in a summary manner while all other criminal offences are required to be tried before a jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1960, there have been a number of court decisions on the meaning of the words &ldquo;minor offence&rdquo;.  In effect, the courts have held that in distinguishing &ldquo;minor&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-minor&rdquo; offences, the primary consideration is the punishment which the offence may attract.  In 1965, a penalty of up to £100 or up to six months' imprisonment, or both, was held not to take the offence out of <Col N="1257" /> the &ldquo;minor&rdquo; category.  Since that decision, the general practice has been to provide for maximum penalties of £100 where new summary offences are being created.  This practice was followed in drafting the present Bill.  I have, however, consulted the Attorney General's Office in the matter and I understand that a higher penalty would now be acceptable having regard to the fall in the value of money over the last ten years. A figure of the order of £250 could be considered.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I will be prepared, on Report Stage, to put down amendments providing for appropriate increases in the penalties for the more serious offences under the Bill and under the 1963 Act.  I presume that the proposers of amendments 53-56 will be prepared to withdraw their amendments in view of this undertaking.</P>
    <P>If very high penalties are fixed, offences will have to be tried on indictment and before a jury.  This could give rise to delays, extra costs and, perhaps, fewer convictions.  I do not consider, therefore, that we should specify penalties which would have the effect of taking the offences in question out of the &ldquo;minor&rdquo; category.  If it is acceptable we can have it still treated as a &ldquo;minor offence&rdquo; with a penalty of up to £250. I would suggest that we make the figure £250.  I am prepared to put that in on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>We did have a case not too far from here where developers moved in over the weekend and felled trees because the trees were obstructing a proposed development.  They had not got permission for the development but to make it easier for them to get permission they moved in.  It is the people who move in over the weekend that I am scared of in regard to a tree that would obstruct planning permission. The Minister should consider this. As regards demolishing a house or building when permission has not been granted, is that subject to a single fine? Suppose it is a case where a developer wants to demolish it so that he can develop a greater area&mdash;is there only a single fine for that or is there a continuing fine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There could only be a single fine if a number of trees were knocked at one fell swoop.  You could not have a continuing fine; you could not ask him to make the trees grow again and he would not be knocking any more trees.  I can see the point made by Deputy Faulkner and Deputy O'Brien.  If the trees were very important, a tree preservation order could be made.  That would bring them into a different category.  It does not seem that it will be possible to make this legislation perfect as we would wish.  Perfectly valid arguments have been made to show that there is a loophole where somebody comes in suddenly, provided he is prepared to pay £250 fine and/or six months' imprisonment.  If somebody can suggest another way I would consider it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 57:</P>
      <P>In subsection (5), page 13, line 51, after &ldquo;imprisonment&rdquo; to add:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and the irreversible destruction or removal or irreparable damage to any tree, other feature or thing shall be deemed to be equivalent to a continuing offence of not more than 12 months, and planning permission in respect of that site shall be refused to the offender or persons associated with him.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am gravely concerned about people who come in and knock down buildings, whether they are habitable houses or not.  They do it without permission and they are getting away with murder.  Their system is to let a habitable building run down or to have it vandalised and then the local authority will give permission to have it demolished.  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that planning permission will be delayed in respect of the redevelopment of such a site. We must take every means possible by legislation to prevent these cowboys coming in doing this.  In urban areas like Dublin there is a lot of money to be made by acting in this fashion by speculators who ignore the law.  We should ensure that they obey the law and that they will disregard it at their peril.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>There is a snag in the amendment.  Such an offence would have to be tried on indictment before a jury.  I am sure when Deputy O'Brien refers to a year he is talking about 365 days and if you multiply that by £250 you will get an enormous figure in respect of felling a tree, for instance.  If all of this amendment were accepted the last situation would be worse than the first.  I am all in favour of Deputy O'Brien's point that every effort should be made to prevent people getting away with this, but I do not understand the second part of his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be possible to prevent planning permission in a case such as that.  Even if they had broken the law and were sent to prison, if they were entitled to planning permission it could not be refused.  It would be the <Col N="1261" /> legal right even of a criminal to get planning permission.  I was hoping Deputy O'Brien would say he intended to withdraw the amendment because the first part of it would be inoperable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I had thought Deputy O'Brien was concerned about buildings other than houses.  If a house were in reasonably good repair the local authority could serve notice on the person and action could be taken under the 1969 Act.  It does not constitute an offence under our planning legislation, which is something entirely different.  If we are talking about a house it is one that is habitable or not habitable; it could be a house which was listed or which was not listed or habitable, and in that case there is no question of the Planning Act coming into force.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 59:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10)  Any use of land in breach of the conditions attached to the planning permission shall be deemed to be unauthorised use of the land.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>People get permission to make use of land for a certain purpose but then they use it for a different type of structure.  Sometimes they put a structure on the land in a way contrary to the conditions under which they were given planning permission. This is to deal with unauthorised use of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is so simple it fools me.  I am not clear what is the purpose of the amendment.  Section 2 (1) of the 1963 Act provides that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" />&ldquo;Unauthorised use&rdquo; means, in relation to land, use commenced on or after the appointment day (1/10/64), the change in use being a material change and being development other than development the subject of a permission granted under section 26 of this Act or exempted development.</P>
    <P>Whether any use of land is an &ldquo;unauthorised use&rdquo; is, therefore, a question of fact and dependent on whether there has been a material change and whether permission was obtained for it. The position is complicated further by the fact that certain uses of land, such as for agricultural purposes, are exempted.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Deputy might give me some examples of what he has in mind so that I could consider the matter.  If he is thinking, say, of the use of open space as a builder's yard while a housing scheme was being built, the amendment would hardly be acceptable.  On the other hand, if he is thinking of the use for further building of land required by a condition to be preserved as open space, the amendment would be inappropriate.  For technical reasons &ldquo;use&rdquo; in relation to land, does not include the use of the land by the carrying out of any works thereon.  The future building, in question, would itself be unauthorised development or else the subject of a separate permission. Maybe I am missing a point and perhaps Deputy O'Brien might be able to give me some further information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely on the basis of where land is designated and, like the open space situation, where there is development for something other than an open space.  We have seen this happen to quite an extent around Dublin.  It is the question of the unauthorised use of the land which causes concern.  People apparently get away with this quite a lot without any action being taken.  I believe there is always a temptation to encroach on an open space.  People who have got permission for development could very well decide, now that they have got permission to develop, that they could take some extra space nearby for further development.  We should do what <Col N="1265" /> we can to eliminate that type of encroachment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <P>Before section 23 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No lease, conveyance or building contract shall be valid unless it is in conformity with planning regulations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a simple amendment and it may not be in correct legal terminology. It was put down to try to bring in behind the planning regulations the force of law.  Not being a lawyer I am not aware of the complications that might be involved in the amendment but I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on it.  The object is clear, to try to introduce into the regulations a policing power to ensure that when the planning authority is not there, when the office has closed down in the evening, anything done contrary to the planning regulations should or could be deemed to be contrary to the lease or conveyance of the structure being erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is unacceptable. The immediate effect would be to introduce confusion and uncertainty in normal commercial transactions. The provision would be unworkable because planning authorities would be snowed under with requests for certificates or other verifications that thousands of transactions were in order.  They have enough to do already making development plans or touring development sites without an added burden which would involve the creation of a new system of verifications, plans and so on.  Many leases and conveyances relate to property where development was carried out prior to the introduction of planning or where no change of use or development is proposed.  The amendment is defective in its reference to planning regulations.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in the 1963 Act, or in the Bill, which imposes a requirement with which leases, conveyances and building contracts have to conform.  I presume the Deputy has in mind the purpose for which property is leased or conveyed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be desirable to have such an amendment in a case where the land is purchased and planning permission has been applied for?  As a result of the High Court decision in the Frascati case local authorities state that the person must own or have the consent of the owner to the getting of planning permission before he gets planning permission. They are writing in a clause which makes planning permission conditional on the consent of the owner being given.  This puts a lot of people in a difficult position where they have made an arrangement for the purchase of land or have completed the purchase.  There is something here that should be tidied up.</P>

The idea of the amendment appeared to be to make it more simple for planning authorities, and the information I have is that it would do the direct opposite because of complications.  Deputy Cunningham is talking about a different matter, but he must remember that planning permission is given to the person who owns the land.  I know of people who have applied for planning permission, out of malice, for land which they did not own.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has taken the view that the approach embodied in this section, which is to take the husband and wife and minor children as one unit for the purpose of taxation, is the best way to do it.  He said it will work, and we know it will work because, as the Minister says, it has been used in the past under the income tax code.  However, I do not think the Minister can say the approach we are advocating will not work.  He can point out that there are certain anomalies arising such as that if you treat husbands and wives as separate individuals in a case where the husband has all the property and the wife has none, they could be more heavily taxed than in the case of another husband and wife who have <Col N="1272" /> the same amount of wealth between them.  That is true, but at least it is based on the proposition that each individual is treated the same way, and if an individual has an amount of wealth which goes above the threshold, he or she is taxed accordingly irrespective of his or her marital status.</P>
      <P>I think this is a reasonable approach, and of course the consequence of what the Minister is doing is that you could have individuals, for instance, a single person versus a married person, with the same wealth but effectively being taxed differently. I think you should stand on the basis of treating each individual the same way.  It is very difficult to stand on the basis of treating each individual the same way.  It is very difficult to stand on the basis of treating a married couple as one unit with the consequences of treating more harshly for the purpose of wealth tax the married person and giving more favourable treatment to single persons or to people who are separated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Minister can see a great deal of logic in what we are saying but that his basic difficulty is that he feels&mdash;and he has referred to this obliquely&mdash;that the proposition of treating each individual separately would, as he said, lead to evasion by way of transfer of assets, say, from a husband to a wife so as to keep them both below the threshold.  I wonder if this is a realistic approach.  What he is saying is that if a husband transfers property to his wife or if a wife transfers property to her husband, this is a purely tax avoidance measure. But if you approach it on the basis that each individual should have the same threshold, say, as provided here in the Bill for a single person, £70,000, then is it really avoidance of tax for a husband who has property and the wife has not, to transfer some of his property to his wife so that they would both be below the £70,000?  I would suggest that if the Minister thinks a little bit more deeply about it he will appreciate that it is not tax avoidance and that there is nothing particularly reprehensible about that.  The overall impression <Col N="1273" /> given by the machinery involved in this section and by the specific wording of it&mdash;the reference to the wife instead of the spouse&mdash;is at least a Victorian approach, if not, as Deputy Brugha suggested, a feudal approach.</P>
    <P>I want to make a final appeal to the Minister&mdash;I say &ldquo;final&rdquo; because I am not going to drag this out&mdash;at least to think about this.  I believe we are throwing away here a very valuable opportunity of giving proper recognition to the status of women and, in particular, the status of married women and of recognising the fact that they are entitled to be treated as individuals in their own right and not merely as appendages to their husbands. If this opportunity is grasped, the consequences either for the Exchequer or for the administration of the wealth tax will not be such as to create any great difficulties for the Revenue Commissioners, whereas a considerable amount could be gained in our general approach to the status of women and, in particular, of married women.</P>
    <P>I would not expect the Minister to say across the floor of the House that he would adopt this approach, but he did indicate before that he had considered it and he could not see his way to accepting it.  I would hope that he would eventually be able to see his way to accepting it.  As the section stands it is an affront to all married women in the country in this day and age.  The reasons advanced for doing it in the way that is proposed in the section do not justify the treatment of a wife as a mere appendage to the husband and as somebody who is not entitled to equal rights with other women, be they single or separated, or with men who are either single or, indeed, married.  The whole thinking behind this is that the husband is the key to the whole problem; he is responsible in the first instance for the wife's tax liability.  The thinking is certainly antiquated.  We have an opportunity here now to strike a blow, not a very big blow, for the status of women.  I think we ought to grasp that opportunity especially in view of the fact that in doing so no major problem is created for the Exchequer.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The object of section 4 in so far as this part of it goes is to aggregate the wealth of the husband and wife and to treat the wealth as the wealth of the husband for the purposes of wealth tax.  It is significant that there is no amendment down to this section in the name of Deputy Colley.  We are simply discussing the section.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Colley considered the section as it stands and was obviously impressed by the logic of leaving it as it is.  When he made his argument here today I believe he did not realise the implications his proposal would have for married people.  I stand over the section as it is because, in order to make the wealth tax work properly, a married couple and their minor children must be treated as one unit.</P>
      <P>On purely social grounds, I can see many objections to Deputy Colley's proposal.  Women should be emancipated but this is not the way to emancipate them.  Under the proposal in the Bill a married couple have a threshold allowance of £100,000 with a family residence and its contents exempt.  What Deputy Colley wants to do is to reduce, in effect, that threshold to £70,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We have to be practical, and the practical politics of the situation is that in most marriages in this country the wealth is held by one side or the other.  In the greatest percentage of cases the wealth is held by the husband who, according to Irish tradition, usually inherits the family farm or the family business and marries a girl who may have no wealth at all or a comparatively small amount of wealth.  That is the general run.  What Deputy Colley wants to do is to say <Col N="1275" /> that the husband in that case will not enjoy a married threshold for wealth tax purposes of £100,000 but that he will have only a threshold of £70,000 and, if he is to improve his threshold, he can only do that by divesting himself of perhaps half his property by transferring it over to his wife for taxation purposes.  That is what Deputy Colley's argument would amount to.  That might or might not work.  The marriage might run smoothly or it might not.  If it does not there will be regrets.  If it does, and there are children of the marriage, and the husband dies, the wife has then half of the property.  Suppose she marries again, what will the situation be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are cases in which it is the wife who possesses the wealth.  In that case again, according to Deputy Colley's argument, the married threshold is in effect to be reduced from £100,000 to £70,000 and the married couple will only have the £70,000 threshold.  If the wife is to qualify for an improved threshold and better reliefs she will have to transfer a substantial portion of the property to the husband for taxation purposes.  I do <Col N="1276" /> not think that is desirable.  If property is to be transferred it should be transferred freely, without any pressure or economic coercion.  I do not believe that what Deputy Colley suggests is socially desirable.  By and large Irish society runs on the basis that the farm or the business is passed on from father to son.  If our taxation code were to pressurise the father so that the transferred earlier on half the property to his wife then the property might not be passed on to the son.</P>
    <P>These are the practical difficulties. I do not think Deputy Colley's suggestion would do anything to emancipate women.  As I said earlier, the opposite could be argued fairly strongly.  These are my views.  I have put them clearly and, if the House reflects on the position, it will, I believe, come to the conclusion that the section as it stands is properly drafted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3 (a):</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1) (a), line 23, after &ldquo;date&rdquo; to add &ldquo;other than property to which an individual or a company is beneficially entitled in possession on that date&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister is well aware of the three categories, not of people who are accountable or assessable but who are liable, individuals, discretionary trusts and private non-trading companies.  I think that only in the case of discretionary trusts is it true to say that they are to be assessed not only on property in possession but all property, and furthermore in the case of the discretionary trust dealt with in this section and in the case of the private non-trading company which is dealt with in a later section, there are no thresholds provided.  The Minister will also be aware that it was stated in the White Paper issued by the Government on 28th February, 1974 that persons affected by the capital taxation proposals should be given an opportunity to make alterations in their will and other arrangements in the light of the new taxation and because of the fact that the final form of the various Bills is not known and will not be known for some time, unless some such provision as is proposed in the amendment is made, no such opportunity will be given as promised by the Government in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to enable persons whose property is comprised in a discretionary trust to make other arrangements if they wish to do so by having that property transferred to an individual or to a company and to give them time to do so.  I wonder if I am proposing to correct amendment.</P>

      <P>May I intervene in regard to the business of the House?  I am told that shortly after I announced that there would be no sitting tomorrow, an Opposition Deputy, Deputy Molloy, alleged that the reason for that was that the Government had proposed an unacceptable bargain in regard to tomorrow's sitting. I want to repudiate that suggestion utterly.  It is an unworthy suggestion and in justice to the Deputy, I can only assume that he made it in total ignorance of the negotiations which have gone on for a good deal of the <Col N="1279" /> day between the Opposition Whips and myself.  One of the Opposition Deputies was present and no doubt will confirm that the absence of business tomorrow is in no sense due to any suggestion of that kind on the Government's part. I undertook that under no conditions would the reasons for the absence of business tomorrow be a point of contention across the floor.  It has been made so by Deputy Molloy and Deputy Cunningham and I have refrained from telling the entire story.  I expect the support of the responsible members of the Opposition in keeping it like that, rather than making it a point of opprobrium on the Government.</P>

The situation planned was that I promised the Opposition Whip I would not make it into a topic of debate across the floor of the House because it represents on their part or in my view represented a difficulty on their side which I did not wish to exploit.  I still do not wish to do so, and I intend to say no more, but I want to repudiate any suggestion that the departure from the order made last week is in any sense due to an unwillingness on the part of the Government to get on with the business.  If the business has been dislocated in any respect it is not the fault of the Government and I will not say any more about it than that.  If I am provoked into doing so I may have to.</P>

I do not want to make this into a mystery of seven seas or 40 boxes, but it is absolutely disgraceful that Deputies such as Deputy Cunningham and Deputy Molloy, who know nothing about these negotiations, come in here and make allegations which are very near to provoking me into telling the whole story.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the House and to the Minister.  I was proposing another amendment.  I was pointing out that under this section the charge in relation to a discretionary trust is defined in subsection (1) (a) as follows:</P>
      <P>The taxable wealth of a discretionary trust on a valuation date shall include all the property situate in the State which is comprised in the trust on the valuation date.</P>
      <P>Perhaps for reasons of drafting it does not refer to property to which the individual is beneficially entitled in possession on the valuation date. There is a danger of double taxation arising here because the trust can be taxed on property which is in possession or is not in possession.  If it is not in the possession of the trust it may be in the possession of an individual or a company who would be assessable. This amendment is designed to ensure that if the trust is taxed that it will be taxed only on property for which somebody else is not liable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I regret I do not follow what Deputy Colley has in mind in this amendment.  The section imposes wealth tax on the property of a discretionary trust which is defined in section 1 along the lines of what is generally understood as the meaning of that term.  One of the features of these trusts is that, as has been judicially <Col N="1283" /> held, the objects are not beneficially entitled to any share or interest in the trust property, either individually or as a class.  In view of this lack of beneficial entitlement in the case of the discretionary trust the exclusion sought appears to be somewhat in the nature of a contradiction in terms.  It might be that the Deputy has in mind a case where some individual or company has in interest in possession in a specific share of the income of capital of such a trust under an appointment while the balance of the trust funds are held on discretionary trusts and that he considers this would give rise to a double charge to tax, the specific share being liable to tax in the hands of the individual.  In these circumstances, only the balance of the property in the discretionary trust would be regarded as being comprised in the discretionary trust.  That is all that would be under the control of the trustees of the discretionary trust on such trusts and, therefore, liable as an entity.  No question of a double charge to tax arises.</P>
      <P>Nobody could have a beneficial interest in the property that is comprised in the discretionary trust because if they had it would not be a discretionary trust.  The essence of a discretionary trust is that the property is in a vacuum and is not owned by anyone beneficially. That is as I understand a discretionary trust.</P>

It seems clear to me that in practice cases can be covered by the provision in paragraph (c) in which the shares are not equal and, nevertheless, according to paragraph (c) they will be deemed to be held in <Col N="1285" /> equal shares, or the income payable in equal shares.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am having some difficulty in seeing the point in these amendments to section 5.  The purpose of the subsections as drafted is to provide a measure of relief in the case of certain discretionary trusts by treating the objects of such trusts as being beneficially entitled in possession to the trust funds, rather than treating the trusts themselves as entities.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) deals with discretionary trusts where (1) the sole objects are a child or children of a marriage either with or without his or their parent or parents and (2) a minor child is living on the valuation date. Subsection (2) (c), in the context of such a trust, deals with the situation where, on the valuation date, neither spouse is an object of the trust or both spouses are deceased.  In such a case, the trust funds are deemed to be taxable wealth of the minor children of the marriage in equal shares.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) deals with discretionary trusts which exist on a valuation date for the exclusive benefit of one or both parties to a marriage, or one or more named individuals for special reasons; age, incapacity, improvidence, and so on.  In such a case, the trust funds are deemed to be taxable wealth of such person, or persons if more than one person, in equal shares.  To exclude in equal shares, as suggested, in each of the amendments would render it impossible to pinpoint the beneficial entitlement in possession to the trust property.  Legally, neither the individual objects, as such, nor the class of objects as a whole, have any beneficial interest in the property comprised in the discretionary trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsections as drafted meet this difficulty by deeming the trust funds to be the taxable wealth of the relevant objects of the trust in equal shares.  The result is that a share of the trust funds is related to each individual and he then gets the benefit <Col N="1286" /> of the appropriate threshold to which as an individual he is entitled. It is arguable that the amendment would have the effect of treating each individual as being entitled to the entire trust fund and, presumably, that is not what is intended.</P>
    <P>There is a maxim in equity, equality is equity.  The subsections as drafted meet, I submit, this admirable concept in that they should in the majority of cases have the effect of mitigating the tax by dividing the taxable property between the individuals, thus lessening the possibility of any individual reaching the taxable thresholds.  If in the trust there is more than one object and no appointment is made, none of the objects have any beneficial interest in it.  The reasonable thing is to deem them entitled to it in equal shares.</P>

Nobody is entitled to the trust fund or its income until an appointment is made by the trustees.  If the trustees have not discretion, it is not a discretionary trust and we are not dealing with it.  If I leave my property to my wife until my eldest child is 21 and then to my eldest child, that is not a discretionary trust.  That is creating a <Col N="1288" /> limited interest.  But if I leave all my property to my trustees in trust to apply the income thereof to my wife and children during their lives in such way as they think fit and, on the death of my wife, to apply the capital to my children in such shares as they in their absolute discretion think fit, the trustees have complete discretion and that is a full-blown discretionary trust.</P>

The Minister may think that is a satisfactory position.  I do not think so.  I think you can find somebody who is a theoretical object of a discretionary trust being assessed and billed for wealth tax and, perhaps, forced to pay it without having the right to one penny capital in the trust and then being put to a great deal of trouble and difficulty in trying to recover the money.</P>

      <P>Why not do it as Deputy Colley suggested?  Why not go in bulk for the trust fund and having regard to the number of objects, correspondingly apply the reliefs jointly? There may be a perfectly good answer to that.  Supposing there are A, B and C, the objects of a discretionary trust. We have dealt with a case where the trust will fail as far as C is concerned, but if A, B and C, as the Minister has said, are to have the benefit of one-third and to have assessment on one-third each, of the trust fund, following on that there will be certain threshold reliefs, and why not add the thirds together to make one and add the reliefs that A, B and C would have and lump that too?  You would then have a mass subtraction instead of a local one.  The Minister may say there would be difficulty where there is artificial use of discretionary trusts, but it seems to be a very straightforward affair whereas the Minister spoke about cases of genuine family settlements.  The Minister may say I am leaving the road wide open for evasion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3 (c):</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (3) (b), line 21, to delete &ldquo;only&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is a relieving provision where the trust is for the benefit of one or more named individuals for the reason only that such individual, or all such individuals, is or are, because of age, incapacity or improvidence, incapable of managing his or their affairs.  The object of the amendment is to delete the word &ldquo;only&rdquo;.  The reason I am putting the amendment forward is that it seems to me, on a strict interpretation, the inclusion of this word could defeat the whole object of the paragraphs. The object here is to give relief where there is a trust for the benefit of people who, as it says, &ldquo;because of age, incapacity or improvidence are incapable of managing their affairs&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it is possible to say that the reason for the trust is age, when we are dealing with a child who cannot look after himself.  Another reason is that the settlor has natural love and affection for the child.  I am just taking one case.  The other cases mentioned make it perhaps more obvious.  In that simple case the father creates a discretionary trust in favour of his infant children.  He makes them objects of the trust.  One of the reasons he does it is because they are infant children and cannot look after themselves.  Another reason could be the natural love <Col N="1296" /> and affection he bears them or there could be a number of other reasons why he would do it.  A strict interpretation of this with the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; in it might preclude the benefit of the paragraph in the cases where it is intended to benefit.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that once that element comes into it those people qualify for the relief.  I do not believe the exclusion of the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; will do any harm to the subsection.  I feel it may clarify the position and I am, accordingly, prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (3) (b), line 24, after &ldquo;affairs&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or for any other analogous reason which, in the opinion of the Commissioners, is sufficient to justify the benefits conferred by this subsection&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a matter to which I referred at a previous stage.  I understood the Minister for Finance to indicate that he was sympathetic to the idea involved in it and would probably bring in an amendment but there does not seem to be one from him to this effect. It may be that the amendment I have drafted does not meet the Minister's requirements but I hope he will be able to agree with the objective.  I pointed out in the previous discussion to the Minister for Finance that this provision in paragraph (b) was excellent as far as it went but that there were other cases not covered by it which were equally deserving of consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave as one example, although by no means an exclusive one, of the <Col N="1297" /> kind of things that need to be covered, the situation in which parents made a daughter of theirs, who was a deserted wife, the object of a discretionary trust.  They did it that way deliberately so that the husband could not get his hands on the money.  I said that kind of situation did not appear to be covered in this paragraph.  There are a number of other possible ones I could develop but I do not want to delay the House doing that.  I suggested in this amendment that discretion should be given to the Revenue Commissioners to decide if it was a genuine case.  I have suggested to add to the subsection &ldquo;or for any other analogous reason&rdquo;.  That is designed, as far as possible, to try to tie it in with what the Minister is doing in the paragraph.  This is very wide but the kind of cases the subsection is trying to cover are very wide and it is hard to spell it out with any degree of clarity.  If anything is to be done about it it has to be a fairly wide provision. There may be objections to the actual wording from the Minister's point of view but I hope the aim of the amendment will commend itself to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Subsection (3) states:</P>
      <P>Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners that a discretionary trust exists on a valuation date for the exclusive benefit of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  one or both parties to a marriage, or</P>
      <P>(b)  one or more named individuals, for the reason only that such individual, or all such individiuals, is or are, because of age, incapacity or improvidence, incapable of managing his or their affairs,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that is wide enough for practically any situation I can think of. Deputy Colley, in putting forward the amendment, gives one example, that is the deserted wife.  The deserted wife is covered in paragraph (a) because even if she is deserted she is still one of the parties to a marriage.  I cannot <Col N="1298" /> think of any situation which would arise that is not covered by paragraph (b).</P>
    <P>I am not closing my mind completely to this and I do not want to prolong a discussion on it.  I believe the Deputy would have great difficulty in getting some type of case, which he says is analogous, but which is not covered by paragraph (b) if he accepts the deserted wife's situation is covered by paragraph (a).</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (3), line 27, to delete &ldquo;person&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;party or individual&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley expressed the opinion during the course of the Second Stage debate that the words &ldquo;person&rdquo; and &ldquo;persons&rdquo; in lines 27 and 28, respectively, of subsection (3) were ambiguous. While it is arguable that there is, in the general context of the subsection, no ambiguity, it is conceded that the drafting might be improved. The subsection allows property comprised in a discretionary trust which exists for the benefit of the parties to a marriage or of certain named individuals to be treated as property to which the parties or the named individuals are beneficially entitled in possession.  The property in this type of discretionary trust may thus get the benefit of the threshold reliefs to which the individual is entitled.  In order that the subsection may apply, no other person must have benefited from the trust.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; first occurs in the subsection in line 25.  It again occurs in lines 27 and 28.  Taken literally the &ldquo;person aforesaid&rdquo; in line 27 refers to &ldquo;person&rdquo; in line 25. This would make nonsense of the subsection as it would result, for example, in deeming the property in a discretionary trust which was set up for a named individual to be property to which &ldquo;no other person benefited from the trust&rdquo; was entitled.  The first amendment substitutes &ldquo;party or individual&rdquo; for &ldquo;person&rdquo; in line 27. The result is that the property comprised in the trust is deemed to be property to which &ldquo;the party or individual aforesaid&rdquo; is beneficially entitled in possession.  Both in context and literally &ldquo;the party or individual aforesaid&rdquo; is a party or individual referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the subsection.</P>

      <P>This is an improvement and I am glad the Minister accepted <Col N="1300" /> the suggestion I made.  It clarifies the meaning of the subsection.  It may be that by making the amendment suggested the Minister for Finance has been saved a great deal of trouble. One person's interpretation of the subsection as it stood was that if a discretionary trust was set up, the objects of which included the infant children of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Finance might find himself liable for their wealth tax. It is unlikely, but this amendment will ensure that it does not happen.</P>

    <P>In practice that means that in respect of property as comprised in a discretionary trust on valuation this year the persons concerned would have the option of having it transferred to individuals and if it is shown that it has been transferred that they would be assessed on that property, with the benefit of the thresholds.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The amendments therefore affect only those cases where the individuals interested in these entities would not themselves be liable to tax.  In such cases not all persons will be willing or in a position, for a variety of reasons, to wind up the trusts or companies. Those persons would be discriminated against by the amendments. Those persons for whom the amendments cater would suffer no great hardship by having to pay wealth tax on one occasion only at 1 per cent from 5th April, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1303" /> The majority of these entities were set up for fiscal reasons.  Their promoters could hardly have expected that tax laws would remain immutable and that, where any change arose that might affect them, they should be given time to reassess the position.  If that argument were conceded similar provisions would have to be included in many Finance Acts.</P>
    <P>Every time a gap was closed you would have to give a breathing space of 12 months to let the person out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that this is different in kind from closing a gap in a Finance Act.  This is a major change and it is not just contained in this Bill but in the other Bills.  From the point of view of the people who are involved in this, you have to look at the effect of the whole lot of the legislation.  While I have no innate sympathy for persons who so arrange their affairs through discretionary trusts or private non-trading companies that they would avoid liability for death duties, nevertheless, such persons have rights.  If they have acted in accordance with the law they should not be treated as criminals.</P>
      <P>There are a number of cases of discretionary trusts and private non-trading companies set up for perfectly good and valid reasons other than anti-avoidance, and no consideration has been given here to them.  The practical effect of what is being done is that all of these people become liable for wealth tax on the first £1 of wealth.  Therefore, when we are talking about 1 per cent we are talking about a great deal more money than in the case of people who may be much more wealthy than they are but who, as individuals or married couples, have a threshold laid down in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a wrong principle to say: &ldquo;These people acted in accordance with the law but we are going to catch them out.  We will give them no time to adjust their affairs in accordance with the new law&rdquo;&mdash;the new law about which nobody knows how the final package will come out.  There is an element of sharp practice involved in treatment of this kind, particularly <Col N="1304" /> in the case of either discretionary trust or private non-trading companies which were set up for reasons other than avoidance.</P>
    <P>I shall not run away from the situation of those which were set up for avoidance.  I might not applaud them and the Minister might not applaud them, but if they are lawful they are entitled to be treated as lawful operations and those involved are entitled to demand treatment at least as good as that given to criminals, and I do not think one could attempt to perpetrate this kind of thing on criminals and get away with it.  I do not think it is an unreasonable proposition that having determined that the law is going to be different, substantially different, in this way, the Minister should give people the option of arranging their affairs in accordance with that law and, as in cases where the property that is involved here is transferred to individuals and those individuals become liable to wealth tax but with the benefit of thresholds.  In particular where cases exist&mdash;and the Minister knows such cases exist&mdash;of the setting up of discretionary trusts and private non-trading companies for good reasons other than anti-avoidance, is it not unreasonable to treat them in this way, to tax them for wealth tax on the first £1 of their assets because you will not allow them the opportunity to change arrangements in accordance with the new law?</P>

      <P>Not necessarily.  There are discretionary powers set up in respect of which the whole income has been paid out year after year.  In such cases there is no saving at all as regards death duties.  Income tax would have been paid on the amounts paid out.  The fact that income is paid out renders them liable to death duties, so there is no anti-avoidance in it, but done for good reasons in relation to the circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite correct to say they are definitely liable for death duties because it would depend on who was paid income from the discretionary trust in the five years before the death of one of the beneficiaries. They still avoid death duties.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is agreed that most of these discretionary trusts are set up in order to deal with death duties, income tax, <i>et cetera.</i> Some of them may find it possible to unscramble or wind up; others may not and, if we were to allow in this Bill those who can wind up to do so, we would be discriminating against those who cannot.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley referred to the White Paper.  The White Paper was published in February of last year. It gave fair warning in regard to the treatment of discretionary trusts and private non-trading companies at page 45 where it says:</P>
      <P>In special circumstances it may be found essential to treat certain entities as taxable units, e.g., private non-trading companies and discretionary trusts with, perhaps, the elimination of any initial exclusion applicable to individuals.  The wealth of the family&mdash;that is, husband, wife, and minor children&mdash; would be added together to form one taxable unit.</P>
      <P>There was fair warning that, when the legislation was introduced, it would contain these provisions and the evidence is that the warning was heeded by quite a few people because private non-trading companies have been wound up, quite a few of them, in the last 12 months, and that has added to the number of liquidations: I know there were quite a few genuine liquidations but, when we get statistics, these are also thrown in.  It will not be any severe hardship on anyone to pay 1 per cent wealth tax for one year.  Those who can unscramble will have no option but to do so and to pay it for the duration of the discretionary trust.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it is reasonable to say that there was notice given in the White Paper having regard to the fact that such notice as was given in the White Paper related to an outline of approach, some of which has been changed?  In one particular instance there was a fundamental change.  Contrary to what was in the White Paper, there is now provision whereby certain transactions can be liable both to gift tax and capital gains tax, although the White Paper specifically said this would not happen.  I give this as an example to show that people really cannot know what is likely to occur until the law is enacted.  As a general proposition, would the Minister not accept that people should be entitled to know the law and, accordingly, could not and should not be expected to act on the basis of the White Paper, or even the published Bill, with all the possibilities of change involved? Is it not a bad principle to say that people should have to operate a kind of Russian roulette, which is, in fact, what the Minister is saying, and take their chance on how the legislation will turn out?  I particularly want to urge the Minister that some provision should be made in the kind of case <Col N="1308" /> I mentioned where there is clearly no effort at avoidance involved at all. I would suggest that, even in the case where there was avoidance, those involved were acting in accordance with the law and are entitled at least to know what the new law is going to be and arrange their affairs accordingly. I am particularly concerned about the kind of case I mentioned in which there was clearly no avoidance involved, the kind of case where there is a discretionary trust under which an income has been paid out year by year to the widow of the settlor.  There are many such trusts in existence.  In these cases there is no avoidance.  Income tax is paid and there is liability for death duties. There is no avoidance.  Why should such people be penalised in this way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, Deputy Colley's Finance Act made inroads in bringing discretionary trusts within the death duty code; this is on the basis of the average income taken over a period of years of any particular beneficiary.  It would be a bit naïve to take it that all the income was paid to the widow in circumstances like that.  What was done was that, by virtue of the fact there were other named beneficiaries, who were not likely to die, much younger people, it was paid to them and some was given over to the widow.  That was quite standard practice to get over the difficulty raised by the Deputy's Bill when he was Minister for Finance.  This is the <Col N="1309" /> way it was managed and one did avoid death duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably because the intention was, in general, that the widow would get the benefit of the total income and, after her death, there would be other objects but that it could be that at an early stage, perhaps after the husband's death, there might have been some of the children who might have been nearly grown up and there was a possibility that it might be necessary to pay money to them&mdash;presumably that was the reason but, in practice, the money was paid to the widow all the time.</P>

There have been such for reasons related to the particular cases.  Taking these cases, which were not avoiding death duties, how do you justify taxing them on the first £1 of the wealth?  How do you justify taxing them on the first £1 of wealth?  I am taking that as the best case I can put forward but I am not running away from the other cases.  I want to repeat it.  Even where it was done for the purpose of avoiding duty, I may <Col N="1310" /> not have sympathy for the people concerned, but they have rights.  Their basic right is to be able to arrange their affairs in accordance with law. The Minister, I suggest, is taking away that right in this Bill, unless he accepts something on the lines of this amendment.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes, a general kind of notice.  If Deputy Colley cast his mind back to 1965&mdash;I do not know who was Minister for Finance then&mdash;but the Finance Act of that year dealt with discretionary trusts and took away some of the benefits they had secured for themselves with regard to estate duties without any notice.  I know the Opposition are right to make these points, but it is my business to point <Col N="1311" /> out from this side of the House, that there are precedents for this, and that is the way our fiscal laws have operated.  We change them where we think they should be changed, and we do not feel it necessary to give advance warning, although in this case a general warning was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister agrees that the situation is somewhat different in this sense.  We are not merely changing, as was done in 1965, the conditions applicable for death duty purposes to discretionary trusts. We are changing the conditions in so far as we are imposing a wealth tax in certain circumstances but, at the same time, we are imposing a capital acquisitions tax, particularly relating to inheritance tax and to some extent gift tax, and this.  They are all being imposed on the property in lieu of death duties.  The imposition being made and the terms of the law under which it is being done is not clear to anybody and cannot be clear yet because the laws are not enacted.  Surely that is a different situation from the one in which existing forms of tax, such as death duties, are changed, as can happen under any tax from time to time.</P>
      <P>At the moment no taxpayer is in a position to know what the law is.  He is, at least, entitled to this.  He should be able so to arrange his affairs as to comply with the law and hopefully, from his point of view, to his best advantage.  He cannot do that now because the law is in a state of flux and he does not know what it will be.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not think any useful purpose will be served by discussing this all night. Deputy Colley makes the case that these discretionary trusts are entitled to an opportunity of changing their structure to avail of the new law.  In 1963-64 discretionary trusts were set up to deal with the law, as it then stood, for the purpose of death duties. If Deputy Colley's argument is correct, they are entitled to assume that they knew the law then and that law would remain that way indefinitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> One of Deputy Colley's predecessors introduced a provision in the 1965 Finance Act which brought into the estate duty net the wealth comprised in these discretionary trusts and took a rake-off of, maybe, 50 per cent.  All we are doing here is saying that all discretionary trusts and private non-trading companies affected, whether they can be unscrambled or not, will be liable to this tax for one year.  The ones that cannot unscramble are liable to wealth tax at 1 per cent.  Deputy Colley has plenty of courage to put forward his argument in view of the precedent established in 1965.  I am sure many other Finance Acts, besides that of 1965, caught people, without notice.</P>

I have already expressed that view and I just want to put it on the record again.  I want to put two questions to the Minister.  The first deals with discretionary trusts.  In a case where it can be shown that there was no avoidance of death duty, does he think it reasonable to treat that case in such a way as to apply 1 per cent wealth tax on the first £1 and every £1 above it?</P>

      <P>I do not want to pursue that here about treating them equally.  That is an inverted argument <Col N="1313" /> from the Revenue Commissioners.  My second question is this: in the case of discretionary trusts he has provided reasonable provision for dealing with genuine cases but, as far as I can see, he has not provided that in relation to a private non-trading company. How does he suggest that that case should be dealt with?  If it is entitled to consideration as a discretionary trust, why not as a private non-trading company?</P>

      <P>I find it very difficult to understand how a private non-trading company would come into the circumstances which the Deputy describes. It is usually in conjunction with a trust.  It is usual for the purpose of avoiding the succession.  It has very often been used for the purpose of avoiding surtax and income tax. Beyond that I do not see the relevance of it.</P>

If the shares are held for the benefit of minor children, as the simple example, unless something is done on the lines of what is done in the discretionary trust, is not the benefit sought to be conferred under this relief provision going to be denied in the case of the private non-trading company?</P>

      <P>All I can say is that I was always averse to using the non-trading company for tax avoidance schemes.  I was aware that it was used for those purposes, but it was mainly an accountant's invention, an easy method of managing a tax avoidance scheme.  I always used the discretionary trust, and I do not know of a non-trading company being used in the circumstances suggested <Col N="1314" /> by Deputy Colley, other than where there is a tax planning operation.</P>

      <P>Could one put it this way to Deputy Esmonde?  I do concede that both a discretionary trust and a non-trading company applied the device to avoid the succession, for the purpose of defeating the liability to tax, but even if that were the case, what case is there when you have a new tax like the capital gains tax for penalising people?  There is a little confusion in our thinking here.  I would go a lot of the way possibly with Deputy Esmonde if he were talking in terms of the capital acquisitions tax, if he were talking of capturing what was envisaged when the device was set up.  I am facing frankly the case where the device was used, and incidentally I am not quite sure that the Deputy is correct in blaming the accountants for the principal opertion of the device.  I think the principal progenitor of this scheme did not belong to that profession.</P>

      <P>That is an aside, however.  Personally I have never liked the non-trading company device.  It appeared to me to savour too much of a direct tax avoidance measure, but let us remember that it was the avoidance of succession taxation that was involved here, and I would not therefore cavil with the Minister on the corresponding provisions in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, but here you have a wealth tax and this is a new tax.  I think it savours of penalty for past performance in attaching the incidence to a non-trading company and not giving the reliefs given here to a discretionary trust.</P>
      <P>The thinking here is that there may be genuine discretionary trusts so we have made allowances for them in sections 2 and 3, but it seems to be assumed, and Deputy Esmonde has practically said so, that in the case of the non-trading company, there were no merits.  We are here on the double amendment and I think it confuses things to do a double amendment in a matter such as this, but we are doing it.  In the case of the non-trading companies it savours very much of a penalty.  As Deputy Colley says, it may not have been very laudable from the point of view of the community as a whole to think of such a device and I have no doubt that were I a member of the revenue gathering organisation I would go out to get my hands on the operator.  That is one thing, and by all means where the evaded tax in question can be captured, this is all right, but to make my net point to the Minister, this is a new tax.  To give the benefits given to the discretionary trust, whatever the reasons may be, and deny them to non-trading companies suggests very strongly that we are imposing a penalty for something that was perfectly lawful and on that ground I would ask the Minister if he would not treat them <i>pari passu.</i></P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes.  First of all, it is not likely that you will have the same type of beneficiary, for want of a better word, in the private non-trading company as in the discretionary trust.  The discretionary trust is much more of a family matter, where you are dealing with a wife and children and people who are improvident and for other analogous reasons.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> All that is at stake is 1 per cent for one year in the case of the private non-trading company.  In the case of the discretionary trust that could not be wound up, there might be payment of wealth tax involved for many years. I want to have uniformity as far as possible between all discretionary trusts and private non-trading companies. There is very little involved for the genuine private non-trading company and I understand they are more likely to be pure tax avoidance entities than the other.  When I put this to the opposite side earlier this evening I understood the vast majority of discretionary trusts and private non-trading companies were tax avoidance operations.  I do not want to go back to the 1965 Act because I do not think it will lead to an earlier disposal of this business.  I am satisfied there are precedents in many Finance Acts for what we are doing.  We gave <Col N="1317" /> a general warning in the White Paper and, to my knowledge, it has been availed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point about the possibility of winding up and I admit the cogency of his argument.  At the moment I cannot think how it could be defeated in the same way as coping with a discretionary trust might be.  Nevertheless, I do not go the whole way with the Minister in saying that the objects could not be the same.  Where there are minors or those who would be entitled to threshold benefits where a non-trading company is concerned I would urge the Minister to consider them.</P>
      <P>Most of the non-trading companies were formed for the avoidance of tax but I repeat this is a new tax and we should not impose a penalty.  There were at least one or two cases where there was a positive reason for adopting this device rather than a settlement or where the immediate reason was a settlement but the advantages of using the company device caused it to be used in a perfectly legal way. As a practitioner, the Minister will realise that if a case is referred to him which he refers to counsel and if the latter points out the alternatives and finally advises that one of the alternatives is chosen, that choice will be made.  That sequence of events was not altogether unknown to private non-trading companies.  I knew of one instance in a casual way where something like that happened.  The case I am thinking of was so long ago that there would not be any beneficiary but there would be a surviving spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may be right that the majority of cases were for the purpose of tax avoidance but he should provide equal provision unless that would mean facilitating future tax avoidance. No matter how bloody-minded we may feel that someone has got away with murder for many years in the past, it is not proper justice if we consider only such cases.  Unless there is a danger of tax avoidance in the future and considering that the object under a non-trading company may be a surviving spouse who would be entitled <Col N="1318" /> to threshold relief, I do not see why that should not be allowed to continue. The provisions will continue to operate to prevent tax avoidance in the future.  If there is an argument about this that is all right, but if it is merely to get our own back for what happened in the past that would be a very reprehensible approach for the House to adopt.  I am not saying it would be deliberate because many of these things are subconscious.  The reason I mentioned it is to bring these matters to the level of consciousness so that we may do the right thing.  The Minister has been very co-operative and helpful and we thank him for accepting amendments.  We wish to reciprocate.  I urge on the Minister to consider the point I have made, without putting him to the trouble of replying.  We can trust the Minister and his advisers to administer justice and equity.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) (a) captures all property in the State.  That does not cause any difficulty.  I wonder how parts of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) will be operated.  It is visualised that one could have a <i>corpus</i> that is completely extra-territorial, that is that the body of the trust is completely situated outside the State.  That is a possibility. There is no great difficulty if the settlor is ordinarily resident in the State on that date.  There is no more difficulty about that than there is in getting after any other person for his extra-territorial property.  It is somewhat similar where the living settlor has disposed of the trust.  One could get after it if the trust was created by will and the settlor was domiciled in the State.  Suppose a discretionary trust was established outside the State?</P>

    <Title>Wealth Tax Bill, 1975: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 5, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussing a section of this nature can be an anticlimax but I think we have common case that discretionary trusts and the objects of the next section, private non-trading companies, unfortunately, became over-used as tax avoidance devices.  In all fairness, in neither case should we adopt the attitude that because somebody got away with it in the past, we will get them now.  It may be all right so to apply it in future but not in such a way that it would be a penalty for what has happened in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discretionary trusts are almost a social necessity with our system or property.  There is the question of parties to a marriage and all that is involved in the harmony or disharmony of marriage; the question of minor children; the question of provision for dependants and in all these cases the device of discretionary trusts is most valuable in the hands of the lawyer for seeking equity.  I do not accuse the Minister, the Revenue Commissioners or their advisers of being deficient in understanding in this regard but it is well for the House to be aware that you cannot take a tidy, accountant's point of view of this matter.  Cases will vary: you are dealing with humanity and its variations.  It is <Col N="1323" /> simple enough to see it where you have marriage problems but even in the equality or inequality of minor children, a parent or a settlor may decide that child A will be all right, that child B has some physical or other defect and probably will need particular provision; that child C is utterly no good.  The balances may be such as to appear to be variable in the future and the device of a discretionary trust, properly applied with good legal advice can meet these human problems.</P>
    <P>I see what the Minister has in mind in those laudable sections 2 and 3 and I see he has to be severe as he is because this device has been used for avoidance.  I want to ask the Minister this question&mdash;I have a concrete case in both the instance of trading companies and discretionary trusts but, particularly under discretionary trusts &mdash;is this not a case where maximum discretion should be allowed to the Revenue Commissioners as to whether they apply the provisions of this section or section 3?  The Minister does this in specific cases and he has accepted amendments for which we are grateful in which that discretion is extended.  I suggest that the principal might be capable of further extension with the added advantage that tax evasion is more surely detected and that no device which is technically correct in law&mdash;such as the non-trading company before the provisions to prevent it defeating succession duty were brought in&mdash;will succeed.  Where you have a definite provision with everything spelled out, it is fine as far as it goes.  The Minister might say that an Opposition can be very inconsistent and argue for certainty of the law on one hand and for something else on the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is one of the luxuries to which an Opposition is entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to commit this sin.  The Minister will appreciate the spirit in which I make the point.  If you define, you get certainty of the law, perhaps, and that is desirable, but the statute will be construed strictly in favour of the taxpayer <Col N="1324" /> and if there is a loophole it is there to be taken whereas if you define sufficiently to give certainty of intention and can then give discretion to the Revenue Commissioners, two great advantages accrue.  I have said this before without any real contradiction; in every genuine case there will be a sympathetic hearing and from all I have ever come across in law or in this House I would subscribe to that statement but where a technicality is being used to escape, if you go on with exhaustive definition, the authority is powerless and if somebody is perverting an intention in a provision for a non-laudable end but doing so perfectly legally and legitimately, he can escape.</P>
      <P>On those grounds and in this area particularly where settlement is concerned and where there are understandable considerations and where the Revenue Commissioners are not asked to decide difficult commercial questions or something like that, where the principles are clear and where the exercise of discretion will not impose an undue burden, I would be all in favour of enlarging that discretion with the consequent advantages that relief can automatically be given where deserved where technicality might preclude it and, on the other hand, sanction will be immediately available in the proper case where technicality equally might exclude it.  There is sympathetic, laudable treatment envisaged in sections 2 and 3 and the Minister has accepted an amendment in that direction also. In the same spirit, I suggest that the House would be prepared to accept an even greater enlargement of discretion for the purposes of this section. We will come to the question of non-trading companies later.  I appreciate the distinction made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are my general comments on the section.  The Minister said he would look at section 14 in this context when we come to it, but one can see immediately that if one does not introduce some such provision, then the problems I have been suggesting will not evaporate.  The Revenue Commissioners will quickly ask themselves: &ldquo;Is it or is it not?&rdquo; and <Col N="1325" /> then the famous third question will be asked that used to be asked in cases of negligence: &ldquo;Can we get after it and if we cannot, <i>tant pis?&rdquo;</i> Then everybody is in the clear.  The great difficulty in matters of this kind is that if you have complete rigidity some cases will be caught but others will not, and such a situation might have repercussions as far as the credit of the Revenue Commissioners is concerned: there might be suggestions in one case that they were partial and in another that they were impartial, the reality being that they were able to act in one case and were not in the other.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons I would urge on the Minister to consider this matter either somewhere else in the Bill or in relation to the line of country I have been speaking about, generally that area which brought the agitation in regard to death duties, and where in the Capital Acquisitions Bill the Minister is to bring in a number of desirable reliefs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have little to say.  The Deputy will agree that the Bill is drafted in such a way as to confer over a very wide field a discretion on the Revenue Commissioners.  The definition section is wide, many things are loosely defined, giving the Revenue Commissioners a discretion in many areas. There are such things as &ldquo;market value&rdquo;&mdash;which means ordinary value &mdash;&ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; and many other things.  In the section we have been dealing with, we have gone out of our way, as the Deputy will concede, to give authority to the Revenue Commissioners to meet hardship cases. I have accepted an amendment from Deputy Colley which gives even further discretion to the Revenue Commissioners if hardship cases, which quite genuinely cannot be foreseen now, turn up in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing here with discretionary trusts.  It is my belief that the machinery in the section is wide enough to permit the creation of discretionary trusts in the future which would cover all hardship cases.  It may be that some small percentage of existing <Col N="1326" /> discretionary trusts will be caught &mdash;some genuine cases will be caught for one year&mdash;but if it will enable the Opposition to give me this section tonight and finish up the week's work on a tidy basis, I could give them yet another undertaking.  Indeed, I will give them the undertaking anyway, even if they do not give me the section tonight.</P>
    <P>It will be the intention of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;I am authorised to say this&mdash;in the first year or more of the operation of this Act to monitor, so to speak, existing discretionary trusts with a view to ascertaining if there are any such trusts that have been created with genuine objects in view but have been caught by this Bill and cannot unscramble themselves sufficiently to get out of it. I am telling the Deputies that these cases will be monitored by the Revenue Commissioners and if any of these hard luck cases or hardship cases are unearthed in that process, amending legislation will be brought in to deal with them.  I think that is going very far in a genuine effort to meet the Opposition.  I would then expect to get the section tonight.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would bear with me for a moment, there is a question I should like to put to the Minister.  I have appreciated listening to the discussion on equal shares in relation to which Deputy Colley tabled two amendments.  The object of this is to allow the individual within the discretionary trust to have equality.  Supposing you have the case of a discretionary trust where there is not one but two beneficiaries and one of them, for one particular reason or another, due to different circumstances, is receiving two-thirds or perhaps more of the trust and the other, therefore, is receiving the lesser share, in each case the figure of £70,000 would apply but in the one case the value of the trust could considerably exceed £70,000 and the other could be considerably less.  What would the <Col N="1327" /> Revenue Commissioners do in cases like that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not it.  I have a few genuine points.  One of them is in the definition in section 5 which refers to &ldquo;a body of persons&rdquo;. That makes an interesting comparison with section 1 of the Income Tax Act of 1967.  It is interesting to see the word &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; being imported into this Bill.  Could the Minister give the reason why it has been done?  In the section I referred to of the Income Tax Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was looking at it in terms of the 1967 Income Tax Act.  Of course the VAT Act is another taxation Act and that, to some extent, answers my question.  I was about to return to my point about the danger to the Revenue Commissioners, not the taxpayers, out of that argument.  Subsection (3) of the section states:</P>
      <P>Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners that the discretionary trust exists on a valuation date for the exclusive benefit of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) one or both parties to a marriage,</P>
      <P>It is for the exclusive benefit of one of the parties to the marriage.  In such circumstances, surely it would hardly be a discretionary trust?  Perhaps I am misreading the subsection?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I understand there is a decision of the High Court which holds that where there is only one beneficiary under the discretionary trust it can still be a discretionary trust because the trustees may have an option to pay or not to pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not considered that decision.  So it is discretionary in the sense that you have discretion to pay or not to pay&mdash; that is where the discretion comes in, and not in regard to the object of the trust?</P>
