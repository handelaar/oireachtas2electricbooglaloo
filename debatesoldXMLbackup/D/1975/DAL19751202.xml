      <P>The most recent census was taken in April, 1971.  The only information available on population changes since that date relates to births and deaths.  In the four years ended March, 1975, the natural increase&mdash;births less deaths&mdash;in County Donegal was 3,119.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give details of the percentage of the work force unemployed in each of the member countries of the EEC; and if he will state in each case whether unemployed school leavers are included in the percentage figure given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The systems under which short-term unemployment statistics are compiled, and the definitions and concepts involved, vary considerably from country to country and it is not possible to quote comparable unemployment totals, or unemployment rates, for the different EEC countries.  The figures for unemployed persons are derived from the various national administrative <Col N="517" /> sources which differ substantially depending on the coverage of the relevant employment office systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding these shortcomings in relation to international comparability, the Social Affairs Directorate of the EEC Commission publishes a monthly statement on the current unemployment situation in each of the nine countries based on national figures.  This statement includes information on unemployment <Col N="518" /> rates.  With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving this information.</P>
    <P>The extent to which unemployed school leavers are covered in the unemployment statistics in the different member states varies and this is in fact one of the reasons why it is difficult to make comparisons.</P>

    <P>The Irish figure for the total number of unemployed persons is the live register <i>less</i> the number of short-time workers registered; this reduction has been made in order to improve comparability as the other figures relate to the <i>wholly</i> unemployed.  The unemployment rate of 9.1% for Ireland has been derived by dividing the figure for the number of persons unemployed as shown in the table by the 1974 estimate of the total Irish labour force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask whether the reply given by the Parliamentary Secretary in written form indicates the countries which include to a full or a lesser degree unemployed school leavers?  Is there any indication in the reply of where that happens?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got anything specific in relation to Britain. My information is that in most of the EEC countries their unemployment figures take school leavers into account but on somewhat varying criteria.  It is true that they tend to take them into account, in a way, more easily than our figures do.  I have not got individual figures for Britain.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance when applications for grants in respect of the year 1976 under the EEC Regional Fund scheme will be considered; the latest date for receipt of such applications; and whether these grants will be allocated on a regional or county basis for 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration by the Commission of the European Communities of applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund is an on-going process. There are, therefore, no specified dates for the receipt of applications from member States in any one year.  Decisions on applications are taken by the Commission at quarterly intervals following consultation with the fund management committee.  In general, the Commission require two to three months at least to process an application <Col N="523" /> for fund assistance.  Indeed, I may say for the information of the Deputy that work is already in hands on the identification of projects for submission to the Commission against our 1976 fund commitment allocation of £13.46 million.</P>
      <P>The fund supplements the resources at the disposal of the Government for regional development investment.  Any proposals for assistance for projects out of these resources should be submitted to the appropriate Government Department or agency directly concerned with the project.  In this connection, I must remind Deputies that the fund as it is presently constituted represents little more than a marginal addition to the resources which the Government have at their disposal for development purposes.  The fund's impact on our needs will, for the present, be extremely limited but we hope to see it rapidly increasing in significance in future years.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to an earlier question tabled by him on 9th April, 1975&mdash;Official Report, Volume 279, columns 1215-7&mdash;in which I indicated that the regional fund was not being administered on a regional or county basis.  The fund will, however, be used to increase development investment particularly in the less-developed areas of the country.</P>

That is the only reason why industrial concerns have been invited in the past to allow their names to be listed in connection with regional projects applications to the European Commission. It is in the interests of this country that such firms would allow their names to be used in order that we, as we must, would ultimately be in a position to prove that money has been expended in Ireland for the purposes <Col N="525" /> in respect of which the European Commission makes payments.</P>

He commended once again the Government's handling of the whole regional fund and he expressed the wish as he has publicly on several occasions in the past, that other countries would handle it as well as the Irish Government.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for not understanding the position, but one cannot excuse Deputy Colley, who knows well that Brussels does not make specific payments to particular operations in Ireland, in Italy, in Germany, in France or anywhere else.  All it does is to pay out money to the national government in question which amounts to a supplement on what that government would otherwise spend on regional projects in its own country.  It can only pay out such money when it receives proof to its satisfaction that the money has already been spent by the national government.  Whatever about Deputy Colley or the begrudging Opposition here, the important thing is that the EEC who pay out the money and do not pay it out unless they are satisfied the money has been spent, are paying the money to Ireland, are paying the money to Ireland before anybody else and have urged the other eight member countries of the EEC to follow the example of Ireland so that the regional fund may be got off the ground and operated properly.</P>

      <P>The extent to which PAYE would increase tax liabilities of public servants is a measure of the advantage which they have had over other PAYE payers until now.  It must also be remembered that if an increased tax liability arises next year, then the largest part of that increase will arise because of increases in income received in the meanwhile.</P>

      <P>The 1975 memorandum was proposing the phasing out of the MCA directive at the end of the transitional period.  In their stocktaking document earlier this year the Commission somewhat modified this. It was intimated that they would not accept the applications in so far as they constituted factors disrupting the unity of the agricultural market. They modified the line they were originally on and as long as exchange rates continue to fluctuate we have no hope of phasing out MCAs.  We can hope to try to get reductions in representative rates.  I tried to get agreement that there would be some built-in adjustment so that when MCAs were above a certain figure this would automatically go, but I failed to get that agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended to change the present arrangements for control of petroleum prices.  This arrangement was introduced on the advice of the National Prices Commission on 5th December, 1973 and the commission have since had the arrangements examined by consultants appointed by them.  A summary of the consultants report was published in the commission's monthly report for May, 1975.  The commission accepted the conclusion of the consultants that linking wholesale oil product prices to those in the UK outer zone is, in present circumstances, the most appropriate method of price control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that under the outer <Col N="552" /> UK system all that is required of the oil majors is to give seven days' notice of price increases and that the Minister or the Prices Commission exercise no control over these increases? Is he further aware that the price increases now mentioned would cost the Irish consumer £50 million in one year?  Is this not sufficient reason to revert to the old system operating prior to 12th December, 1973?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the National Prices Commission themselves who recommended the present procedure. They applied these procedures on three successive occasions and consultants appointed by them confirmed that these were the correct procedures. I would also point out that applications for increases in the UK outer zone are vigorously examined by the UK Prices Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary further aware that the Minister for Transport and Power informed this House at that time that it was a panic decision because they were not assured of oil supplies?  That was in December, 1973.  This is two years afterwards and surely under present circumstances, when we are talking of £50 million that is involved for the Irish consumers, he would need to get further consultants to examine whether we should revert or not regardless of whose advice it was at that time?  Surely £50 million is sufficient reason to examine the structure of the outer UK zone system?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has admitted in the past that he has no control over price increases under the outer UK zone system&mdash;it is a matter of giving notification.  That is a further <Col N="553" /> reason in addition to the £50 million. Will the Minister ensure that the manner in which any increases are now applied will not facilitate the multinational refineries outside Ireland to make further vast profits at the expense of Irish consumers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I said that our position in relation to this legislation was that we were asking the House to compare the alternative we proposed with the proposal of the Minister.  I should now outline in broad detail at least, some of the advantages of this alternative over the proposals introduced by the Minister in this legislation.  Taking the broad principle of what is hoped to be achieved here I should reiterate what the Leader of the Opposition has said so clearly: that we are in agreement on the purpose and intention, indeed the hopes behind this legislation, that the Government, not only in effecting that could expect our full support, but indeed our encouragement in pursuing proposals in that area very vigorously and constantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first instance we must look at what will be the consequences of this proposal.  The function of any court, the function of the police in relation to the punishment of offenders, can never be seen in isolation from that court's function to uphold fundamental human rights.  If one looks at the normal position of an offender who is charged with a criminal offence before the court, if he is to see that court, <Col N="558" /> or the courts of our land, as being only instruments and agents of punishment against him without having the consequent guarantee from that court that they will be equally zealous and determined in upholding fundamental human rights&mdash;which are the only guarantee of acceptance by the community of the institutions of the State &mdash;then it can be clearly seen that a court which does not have those dual functions cannot enjoy dual respect.</P>
    <P>All of us deplore and abhor the terrible things that have happened and been perpetrated, more particularly those that have been perpetrated in the name of Irish patriotism or republicanism. Here I do not think one can make a distinction between murder and assassination from whatever source it comes.  It is not sufficient for us in this House to consider setting up provisions&mdash;and I shall point out as I go along how inadequate these will be&mdash;to deal with those who will be charged with these terrible offences without looking much further and into the background of these terrible problems; trying to arouse, if such is possible &mdash; I believe in all of these things one must be always an optimist; one must always strive to be&mdash;an awareness within those who, unfortunately and constantly, engage in this pell-mell campaign of bitterness and, one might say, madness.  Sometime, somehow, this will all stop.  Our hope is that by the time it does not too many more lives will have been lost, not too much more destruction will have been caused and, above all, not too much more bitterness will have been aroused.</P>
    <P>In the meantime we must examine this legislation and ascertain exactly what effect it will have not merely on those who will be charged but on those who may have a certain attitude to the institutions of the State, North or South; whether or not, apart from guaranteeing punishment against them &mdash;and, of course, that is perfectly proper and must be done&mdash;there is some way in which, however hopefully one expresses this sentiment, they can be brought around to seeing that these courts will guarantee, in so <Col N="559" /> far as they can, justice and fair play in the proper administration of the law; some way in which those who are being charged will be able to feel at least that the court is not there merely to punish them but exists also to ensure that those who bring them before the courts will be properly directed, controlled and limited in their actions as will be found in the exercise of any proper judicial function in any country.  Our ordinary criminal courts here are effective only because the citizen knows that they are his guarantee against, may I say, even the institutions of the State. They have been used as such on many occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I made some reference to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on the last occasion.  I do not want to be diverted from what I am saying now by making any further references.</P>
      <P>Equally the civil courts are part of the overall court function.  The police are there to ensure not merely that offenders will be punished but, as can be seen from the respect they enjoy in this part of Ireland, also that the rights of citizens will be protected. Surely this is the idea one must get across in suggesting legislation of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has no function, makes no attempt, no pretence whatsoever to imply that the jurisdiction which is being imposed on the courts, North and South, by way of this reciprocal arrangement will guarantee also that the citizen who will claim that his rights have been offended or breached &mdash;as he can do now in the south&mdash;can go through this type of procedure to make complaints here of, possibly infringement of his rights in the North or, equally, to make complaints in the North about infringement of his normal rights in the South.  If one proposes on the one hand that people can be tried here for offences committed there and <i>vice versa,</i> then one must, in the whole nature of what the <Col N="560" /> judicial and legal function means, equally guarantee that those rights will be seen to be implemented North and South in the same way as the offence is punished North and South.</P>
    <P>The alternative is that this is a Bill only to punish.  There are many occasions in the experience of man when punishment is necessary.  Equally there are many occasions, and criminal lawyers particularly will recognise this, when it is even more important &mdash;this was demonstrated even within our own jurisdiction and administration recently&mdash;that all concerned groups in society, young people, all of them, look more at the causes of criminality rather than at the punishment of the delinquent.  The whole cry within our society at present is to eradicate the causes.  Where, if anywhere, in this legislation is there any attempt to eradicate the causes?  I know we are told that by presenting this Bill we will win some support, some tolerance and some understanding from those who might not understand us as well as they should.  That may be, but it does not get at the fact that the very people at whom this Bill is being directed certainly will be, unless human experience changes radically, if anything more determined as a result of this legislation.</P>
    <P>They will not see it in any agency to ensure that their rights are not infringed. Their rights can be infringed on occasion.  The rights of convicted criminals can be infringed and the rights of people charged with criminal offences before the court pending trial can and have been infringed.  Before passing this legislation, we have an obligation to ensure that those who will be charged and those who will be convicted under legislation of this nature will have the same guarantee as they have under any other legislation. That is totally lacking in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may reject this but that is his personal opinion.  While we share a common aim, I regret to say that this Bill will not succeed in doing what all of us on each side of the House want to see achieved, the apprehension of those engaged in crimes of violence <Col N="561" /> and, more important, the creation of conditions in which those people will see the folly and the utter madness of what they are now engaged in.</P>
    <P>We are a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights. We are not a signatory just for idle reasons and for window dressing.  We have proved this on more than one occasion.  When the occasion arose for this State to be tested as to its right under the Offences Against the State legislation, we were one of the very first to come before the court on Human Rights to be tested on the famous Lawless affair, to be tested and to be vindicated.  At no stage during the course of that famous affair did we suggest they had no right of jurisdiction over us.  Far from it.  We relied on the fact that the legislation under which we operated was in accordance with the terms of the convention which we recognised to be binding.  The outcome was that it was so held.  This was our attitude then as it must be now.</P>
    <P>Is the United Kingdom bound by the Convention on Human Rights, and, if not, why not?  Is not the United Kingdom a signatory to that convention?  At the moment we have a complaint against Britain arising from internment, detention and treatment. What guarantee is there under this legislation that such will not continue?  What guarantee is there that this legislation will be subject to the conditions of that convention? Have we accepted that this legislation will incorporate the rights of the individual citizen under the Convention on Human Rights?  If not why not? Is there any guarantee for the individual citizen that this legislation will not infringe those rights North or South?  If there is no such guarantee, why is there not?</P>
    <P>It is rather anomalous that, while we still have a complaint pending at Strasbourg before the Court of Human Rights based on brutality, torture and inhuman treatment of prisoners&mdash;it is still there and has not yet been resolved&mdash;the Government have asked this Parliament to implement procedures under which we will co-operate fully with the very <Col N="562" /> structures against which we are complaining, without any guarantee under this convention, or any commitment, that these complaints will not arise again.  None of us can wash our hands and say how pure we are as against any other Administration.  The important point is that this guarantee must be there.</P>
    <P>I would go so far as to say that if we at this end were to incorporate the Convention on Human Rights into our law and have it binding on us internally and equally at the other end they were bound and involved in the same way, perhaps we could begin to make some progress.  That is why I see our party's proposal as being very much more effective, more desirable and, in the final analysis, much more likely to bring about what all of us want to see, the termination of this terrible and continuing violence, and an awareness and a development of understanding among those who are engaged in it that their deeds are bringing nothing but death and destruction and shame on all and guaranteeing that they will continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Our court proposal, in comparison with the Government's proposal, would envisage two things for the all-Ireland court.  It would incorporate a guarantee of the rights of individual citizens under the Convention on Human Rights.  It would be a new court and, as our own courts now are, it would be amenable to the Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg and, instead of just confining itself to the punishment of offences, it would also guarantee that the rights of individual citizens would be protected.</P>
    <P>Let me say in passing in this connection that as late as last week I represented an individual who complained that he had been falsely imprisoned by the Garda.  Because of the respect in which the Garda are held, the complaint assumed a more important dimension than it normally would.  In fact, that individual was vindicated in his complaint.  If that can happen as late as last week in our society, where we have such respect for the Garda, where we recognise what they have achieved for <Col N="563" /> us, surely we must at least acknowledge that it can happen in a society where, to say the least of it, the police force are not as acceptable or as widely respected as they are here. Surely that is a very important consideration in legislation of this sort.</P>
    <P>We are not just concerned with giving impressions of our willingness or conveying a notion of our concern. We must go beyond impressions and notions and ensure by our actions that they will be effective and consistent with our hopes.  This Bill, in so far as it does not guarantee that, is a pale shadow of what otherwise could be achieved.  It has been said that the all-Ireland court procedure is probably the more acceptable and better procedure but what is the point, in fact, because it is not on, to use the Minister's own expression.  I should like to know from the Minister to what extent it is not on, and who precisely has indicated to the Minister that it is not on.</P>
    <P>We go back to Sunningdale.  Much has passed since Sunningdale.  How much persuasion and negotiation have our Government engaged in with those who say it is not on?  Have they tried to get through to them that together we can achieve this peace and harmony which is meant to be the ultimate intention behind this Bill, and the eradication of violence, only through the all Ireland court procedure? What response have they got, if they ever said that, from those who apparently acknowledge that this is what they wish to do.  Have they said: &ldquo;Oh, yes.  We know it is the best way but we just will not have it because we do not wish to co-operate with you?&rdquo; Have we evidence of that? Have we evidence that they said: &ldquo;This is the best way but we will not have any structure which involves all Ireland co-operation.&rdquo; I doubt very much that they said it in that form. Have they said it?</P>
    <P>We are not now talking in terms of a united Ireland or bringing pressure to bear on any section of the community. We are talking about the termination of this terrible chain of violence, particularly in the North, <Col N="564" /> but also in the South as we witnessed vividly recently.  If we are involved together in the causes and in the destruction, surely we cannot settle for less than the ideal because a section of the community say it is not on. It has not been on, apparently, for the past two years.  There is no point in relying on the commission.  The commission said quite clearly that they found this proposal very attractive. Equally, they said quite clearly that the only reason they were not proposing it was the delay involved and the delay would involve a referendum.  We on both sides of the House could guarantee that the outcome of that referendum would be absolutely and positively so.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the reality.  Are we to allow ourselves to be the hostages of a group, whatever that group may be and whoever represent them, who say,&ldquo;Right.  That may be the ideal, what you are proposing&rdquo;&mdash;and the Minister seems to accept it in his speech&mdash;&ldquo;but even if it is the ideal to achieve even the short-term of apprehending and punishing offenders we will not have it because we do not like to have any formal and unified association with you&rdquo;?  If that is the case it is certainly not something we can accept and it is not something that we should not make our views known on. I do not believe in imposing views on others.  We can all try to vindicate ourselves at the expense of others. But, if the view is that what we propose and what the Government apparently believe is the better proposal then surely we have an obligation to persuade that limited number of those concerned that this is the way to do it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Minister has not tried.  That is what I say.  I have no evidence.  I would like any Minister to tell us before the debate concludes to what extent they have tried, whom they have asked, with whom they have consulted and what the responses have been.  Or, have they just rather worked on the airy fairy understanding that they will <Col N="565" /> not have it and it is not on?  It is a sad day that we work on assumptions that we know will operate to our total and almost constant disadvantage North and South.</P>
      <P>Even the practical aspects of this are important.  I come back again to the attitude of the person in court. Surely, we must try to get at him now. We have not succeeded over the last four or five years.  I do not mean get at him for the sake of punishing him. That has to be done.  We must try to ensure that we will develop in him an awareness he has not had up to the moment that the law and the instruments of the law are there for his protection as much as for his punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection we come immediately to the police.  The police do not operate in isolation.  They cannot operate in isolation.  They are there to guarantee the peace.  They are in the real sense the Garda Síochána. They are there to do this and they do it effectively in this end of the country. Far be it from me to imply that there are not within the Royal Ulster Constabulary people who have the very same view.  I have noted with interest and encouragement the views expressed by Basil Stanny, Chairman of the Federation of the RUC, that he wants to see his force being transformed into a civilian police force. The beginnings of hope are there because, in fact, ours is a civilian police force and surely before we can have any association through legislation of this sort we must at least guarantee that similar procedures, similar disciplines and similar attitudes apply to our police force as apply in the RUC.  At the moment&mdash; I am not making any big issue of this &mdash;we have no such guarantee if for no other reason than that we have seen, for instance, the very searching debate that the SDLP have had on this very issue over the weekend.  I do not think anyone can accuse the SDLP of not being concerned to bring about peace and as much as possible to gain the acceptance in the community of what the police are doing. They cannot give their full support to the RUC, for reasons best known <Col N="566" /> to them, whether or not because of the present activities of the RUC or the traditional attitude of the minority towards the RUC.</P>
    <P>We are being asked in this legislation not only to associate with them but to accept the procedures they apply and even those of the British Army, without having any control whatsoever over these procedures and, indeed, in the knowledge of the attitude which so many of the population there have to these organs as at present constituted. I do not think we would introduce that kind of legislation in this House for this limited jurisdiction alone if we felt at this moment, at the time of introducing such legislation, there was not a properly constituted police force here operating under proper judicial supervision.  We would not even do it here and we are being asked to do it in this Bill.  For what purpose?&mdash;to apprehend and punish terrorists in the full knowledge that, in fact, the probable ultimate outcome would be worse than the first.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not going to be accused of suggesting or encouraging that that would be the case.  Far from it.  I hope that if and when this Bill goes through the House, if it is to be effective, it will be at least in a limited way more effective than the present position.  I do not believe it will be.</P>
    <P>I mentioned on the last occasion that when the Offences Against the Person 1861 Order was introduced here almost two years ago we were told that it was a matter of great urgency, a matter of great need and that it was important for a number of reasons.  In fact, since that time not one single person has been charged under that order.  Was that window-dressing then? Did we believe it then?  Is this window-dressing now?  Do we believe it now? Window-dressing is not enough, particularly if those who look in the window do not like what they see there. You do not just make it a little more attractive for them.  You may have to reconstruct the entire shop premises and ask them to take a different view of the whole business.</P>
    <P>Some practical aspects: surely if our police and our courts are to be asked to accept evidence by police over which <Col N="567" /> we have no control&mdash;the corollory applies in the North in relation to our police&mdash;there is an immediate gap there.  What guarantee have we of the procedures under which that evidence or the statements have been taken? Our courts will be asked to hear these charges here relating to offences committed above.  What guarantee have we that proper police procedures that we are so jealous of have been followed? Is there any guarantee to ensure that that would be so?  There is not.  In the meantime we continue on with just a hope and a prayer.  It may be a fine gesture to show that we trust everyone so much that we are prepared to do all this.  This is not a time for just fine gestures, particularly when individual rights are so fundamentally involved in this.</P>
    <P>I come to some practical aspects. These are only some illustrations of what may arise and could arise on many occasions.  I presume that the fact that a person is being charged here for an offence committed in the North will mean almost <i>ipso facto</i> that he has escaped from the North to the South.  If he has been witnessed in one form or another in the commission of setting explosives here or doing something else there for which he has been charged and has not been apprehended, as can happen, and has escaped to the South then I would take it as a matter of immediate consequence that the opportunity of identifying that particular person would, to say the least of it, have been limited.  He will have been seen running away from the scene of some explosion or something of that sort.  I cannot imagine what other opportunity there would have been in some cases.  I know you also have provision for a person being tried who has escaped from custody.  But take the case of a person who is charged on the basis &ldquo;We saw him on that occasion there and he seems to have got away&rdquo;.  He does not choose to put himself back in police custody in the North so that he can watch the evidence being given against him. That is his right.  He may have reason and good reason for not wishing to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs agrees with me on this.  I am glad there is some consensus emerging between us.  If he does not do so, the person who is giving evidence against him will give evidence of identification of a person that he saw running away from the scene of some explosion, or whatever else it may be, without that person being in court. It is a fundamental principle of identification in any court.  The questioning would be like this: You saw AB on such an occasion doing such a thing? &mdash;That is right.  Do you know AB?&mdash;I do.  Do you see him here in court today?&mdash;I do.  Would you point him out?  The witness points to AB. Counsel says: &ldquo;Is that the man you saw on that occasion?&rdquo; And the answer is, &ldquo;Yes it is&rdquo;, and he identifies the person being charged before the court as the person that he saw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can this witness in the North who will not come to the South to give evidence say, &ldquo;There is AB whom I saw running away&rdquo; when AB will not be there?  What kind of evidence is that?  Our judges will be sitting up there as observers and will not be allowed to question them. They will not be able to see the demeanour of the accused person when the crucial question comes; neither will they be able to observe the confidence of the witness in relation to his evidence in the presence of that accused person, all of which is very important.  That is one practical example where in relation to an offence of this nature the whole basis of the criminal law of identification falls apart completely.  What guarantee have we in this legislation that those procedures will be properly implemented and that these fundamental rights will be protected? What procedure is there to guarantee that witnesses for the defence will travel South or North, as the case might be, with due immunity?  I presume that the witnesses for the defence in each case will be normally resident in the other jurisdiction.  If they are to be witnesses to an offence which has been committed elsewhere, <Col N="569" /> they will probably be from the North if they are being charged here, and from the South if they are charged above.  What guarantee is there that these witnesses, who may be so necessary to ensure a proper defence for the accused person, will travel to give evidence for the defence?  Will their evidence be taken on deposition or on commission?  I am not aware of any provision in this legislation to guarantee that.</P>
    <P>I am going to the root of this legislation. I want to point out one fundamental thing that has been over-looked: the proposals relating to witnesses and the taking of evidence generally.  What is the position in relation to a witness for the defence who may not want to travel North to give evidence of where so and so was on such a date and whether or not he was at the place at the date he was said to be?  Are we to apply the principle of universal criminality by association, so that if an individual person who has a certain &ldquo;republican&rdquo; background is going to be a witness for the defence, his evidence should not be accepted <i>ipso facto?</i> I do not believe we will ever see our criminal law get to that point.  I certainly hope not.</P>
    <P>There is an objection to witnesses coming South.  There may be objections on the part of the RUC or British Army coming South, as there may be on the part of witnesses here going North, but while they may be entitled to their views, this apparently does not apply to the judges of our courts who will be asked to travel North.  How often?  If this Bill is to be successful, as the Government suggest it will be, it could be every second day that Special Criminal Court judges would be travelling to Belfast or wherever.</P>
    <P>What do we think of our Judiciary being asked to travel to sit just as observers, a function they have never had in our system, hearing a witness giving evidence and only being able to pass notes to the presiding judge in the North?  We have respect for our courts and for the men who at the <Col N="570" /> moment have that responsibility, but I do not think that will be increased by seeing judges of our High Court, the Circuit Court and the Special Criminal Court to-ing and fro-ing to observe people giving evidence and having their hands tied behind their backs in relation to questioning them.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask if the judges of the Special Criminal Court, the High Court or the Central Criminal Court have been asked if they have any objection to this proposal before the legislation is passed.  I have no reason for asking this question beyond my concern that it should be asked.  I do not know what their views would be, but if the views of the British Army and others are to be taken into account in regard to their reluctance to come South, we should at least have some respect for our judges and their attitude and some regard for their safety. If not, then this is really turning the law on its head.  The law has been called an ass, but this is putting the cart before the ass.</P>
    <P>In regard to the overall position, I would like to see our Government reach out to the people who want peace and the apprehension of terrorists and who want to see peace even more than the Government do, because they suffer more from terrorism. As regards the all-Ireland court, the Minister had suggested it might suffer from the same problem in regard to the attendance of witnesses as the proposals here.  That is not so.  One of the obvious practical advantages of the all-Ireland court procedure is that the all-Ireland court can sit anywhere in the whole of Ireland.  In other words, it can go to where the offence has been committed, if necessary, rather than have to sit in Dublin or Belfast and transfer witnesses to and fro as under the present proposals.  The all-Ireland court proposal would, as distinct from what is being proposed in this Bill, guarantee that the witnesses would be there to give their evidence before the court under all the normal procedures that most of us know and respect so much.</P>
    <P>I would have thought this proposal would have commended itself to those who want to see the elimination of <Col N="571" /> violence and the frustration of the activities of those engaged in violent deeds.  I would ask the Government again to consider seriously the practical advantage of the proposal.  We should be able to persuade those who suffer from violence at the moment that it is in their interest as well as ours to accept this system and that it is not a system by which they would be forced into a united Ireland or any other kind of federal united Ireland but rather an agency by which we can work together to achieve our common goal of peace.  It does not seem to me to be an insidious suggestion or one that any group in any community could conscientiously object to.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to some remarks made by the Minister&mdash;it is not because the Minister has just left that I am doing this&mdash;in relation to the need to reassure the Unionists in their fears, attitudes and suspicions towards us and the charge the Minister made in relation to the Fianna Fáil document on Northern Ireland. The Minister cast us into the same net as the Provisional IRA for whom I have nothing but rejection and a certain degree of sadness.  My sadness arises when I think that people can bring themselves to such a base level of humanity. I know that somewhere there must be some goodness which can respond as well as the wickedness.</P>
    <P>I am not just concerned to eradicate violence by high sounding law and order principles; I want to get at the causes.  That is what our policy document was intended to do.  I should like to give an outline of how we hope to do this.  Those who have been misled North or South, will see that far from being an instrument of support for any violent group the document is the opposite; it is an instrument of confidence that asks for co-operation in the knowledge of what the realities are.  In the first paragraph of that document we state that the central aim of our policy is to secure by peaceful means&mdash;that means what it says&mdash;the unity and independence of Ireland as a democratic republic.</P>
    <P>When the Front Bench of our Parliamentary Party were framing this document we wondered if it was necessary <Col N="572" /> to make that statement because we thought it would have been taken as read.  In the document we state that we totally reject the use of force as a means of achieving this aim.  We thought our position on this would be taken as read but that statement should be seen as it is, a rejection of the use of violence, as a means towards that end.  We totally reject violence.  What more could any party say?  We have been consistent in our rejection of violence in the legislation we brought before the House when in Government.  It is not my intention to go back over that and imply that we were the law and order people when the parties now in Government were not but the reality is that that was the position they took at that time when everything from the Forcible Entry measure to the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill were before this House.</P>
    <P>They said they would repeal it, would oppose it and that it was inconsistent. Who is being inconsistent? They are operating it now.  We introduced it in spite of the opposition in this House and we will introduce similar measures, if necessary.  It should be remembered that a Labour Deputy said that 80 per cent of the people support the Provisional IRA but does that entitle me to accuse the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the Leader of the Labour Party, or anybody else of consorting with the Provisionals? Does a casual word expressed in the Upper House not measuring up to that entitle the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to suggest that this party which has a consistent record in relation to the protection of the individual's rights against any unlawful organisation now or in the future could not be relied upon to face such circumstances? We can and those who suggest we cannot are ignoring the history of our party; are ignoring the present determination of the party and our future determination.</P>
    <P>The preparation of this document was part of the policy updating undertaken by the Fianna Fáil Front Bench at the request, some nine to 12 months previously, of the Leader of our party. Consultations were held with the <Col N="573" /> Leader of our party and let nobody suggest, newspaper commentators or others, otherwise.  I am not saying the suggestions were made for insidious reasons but the Leader of our party has expressed his philosophy during his term as Taoiseach and he has reiterated it in Opposition.  It is a philosophy we do not so clearly understand from the Taoiseach.  We know his attitude to law and order but we do not know his concept of Irishness; we do not know whether he is concerned to eradicate; we do not see his tolerance or his human concern.  I say that in the sense that it has always been a characteristic of the Leader of the Opposition.</P>

That is central to this.  If it was there, we would not have had the silence we have had for so long and the isolation expressed by the Minister for Defence that we want to ensure that we stay comfortable here come hell or high water in the North of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What right have we to isolate ourselves from their suffering?  What right have we to say that we want to sleep peacefully in our beds in the South no matter what happens in the North?  It is because we believe that we do not have that right that Fianna Fáil have presented this document. We have taken the response and in our determination and confidence we will get over that response.  We called on the British Government because they have a responsibility like us and our northern fellow Irishmen.  Our first interest is in them because this is the first step to the encouraging of the unity of Ireland by agreement.  That <Col N="574" /> was stated by our Leader in his speech at the Garden of Remembrance.</P>
    <P>We have been accused of Britknocking, so to speak, but where responsibilities arise we will, as we did in Strasbourg, face our responsibilities. I wonder if this Government had been in office when the complaints were made in Strasbourg, would they have done what Fianna Fáil did or would they have been so concerned not to exacerbate relations with the British Government which has been their own commitment? They would not have done that.</P>

We will do everything possible to achieve harmonious relations between ourselves and Britain but not at the risk of compromise.  Our document states that to this end Britain should declare her commitment to <Col N="575" /> implement an ordered withdrawal from her involvement in the Six Counties of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Apparently they took that one line in isolation.  We said we wanted the unity of Ireland and encouraged an agreement between us, the British Government and the representatives of the North and, to this end, we wanted Britain to declare her commitment to implement an ordered withdrawal from her involvement in the Six Counties of Northern Ireland. If one is to be done by agreement, and the other is simply an agency of that agreement, that must also be done by agreement. We never suggested that the British Government should unilaterally withdraw without consultation with our Government and the Northern representatives.  Far from it, we wanted this done after consultation and agreement and then, with the full agreement and commitment of all concerned, they should make their statement of commitment to an ordered withdrawal.  We went on to say that we wanted to ensure that there could not be a precipitate withdrawal, which is a real fear in some people's minds.  This may not happen this year or next, but it could happen in, say, five years if this mountain of violence continues to grow.</P>
      <P>When presenting proposals we have to look to the future.  We wanted to guarantee that far from there being a precipitate withdrawal, which some people are accusing us of doing, there would be an agreement which would guarantee that such a thing would never happen.  We wanted to ensure that Britain could enter into an agreement guaranteeing appropriate financial support for specified periods to enable the transition to take place smoothly in stable and economic conditions, and recognising their obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into detail on the whole range of the Northern Ireland problem but one could fairly state that if the large amounts of money which have been wastefully spent by Britain had been spent on economic and social justice, they <Col N="576" /> would probably have eradicated, long before 1968 or 1969, much of the causes of the terrible violence we have witnessed since then.  We wanted to see both Governments fulfilling their obligations to this economic commitment. For that reason we are dissatisfied with the outcome of the recent cross-Border projects.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs on a number of occasions to do something about this as a matter of urgency, to let us be seen to be concerned.  What did we get?  We got a delay of two years, and at the end, we got what we could have got exactly two years ago.  Both Governments must show concern and urgency and that is what we want.</P>
    <P>Our off-shore resources are more significent than those in the North. We must be consistent and say that these resources do not belong only to the South, they belong to the people of this island, wherever they live.  This is the type of thing we should be saying to a people who are economically under seige.  We should reassure them that the 4,500,000 people living in the South are willing to enter into an agreement with them for use of our resources.  Where is our confidence in ourselves?  Where is the challenge? This document represents confidence, hope and challenge.  It was sad for us to see it being misrepresented.  We want to see these obligations being entered into.  We want to ensure that we do not just get at the symptoms, as this Bill proposes.  We believe that the causes must be tackled first.</P>
    <P>When the Government decided that Verolme Dockyard was not good enough and gave their order to Japan, did they consider the major shipyard in Belfast which is experiencing very real difficulties?  Did they make any inquiries from that shipyard to see if they could discharge that obligation? I gather that they would welcome any such opportunity at the moment.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (c) we asked the British Government to promote in the interim the development of political institutions which would ensure civil rights and equality for all the people. This has been the constant platform of the SDLP whose difficulties we recognise.  Perhaps they misunderstood <Col N="577" /> this document, if they did not have an opportunity of studying it.  We can resolve those differences knowing that they are in a very real sense the guarantors of civil rights and justice. I believe these differences are less than the differences which exist between them and some people who sit on the Government benches who do not appear to have shown concern.  I have no doubt that when the SDLP have fully studied this document they will realise that it represents the views they hold.</P>
    <P>This document is not concerned with only one section of the Northern community.  It ensures that security in the area operates impartially through acceptable structures.  Everyone wants to see that but this Bill is doing nothing to ensure that security will operate through acceptable structures. We have no control over the structures in the North with which we are being asked to co-operate.  This is a crucial area in relation to any security problem and security co-operation between North and South, and in the North itself.  People must have respect for these structures. There is no indication of what steps, if any, the Government have taken to support the stand taken by the SDLP with regard to the development of these acceptable structures.</P>
    <P>Later in the document we asked them to support the development of social, cultural and economic links between North and South through appropriate structures and institutions. We say: &ldquo;the development of social cultural and economic links&rdquo;.  We do not say, as some would imply: &ldquo;the imposition of social, cultural and economic links&rdquo;.  If there has been an encouraging characteristic in Irish society during the past five years, it has been the development of community organisations.  What has been done to channel the goodwill and common cause of those community organisations North and South?  It is not enough to talk in terms of law and order: surely we must look to the good as well as the evil and promote the good to guarantee the eradication of the evil?  Our young people, the youth organisations, have been shown a <Col N="578" /> strange attitude by the Government.</P>

      <P>Before I leave this matter, I should like to stress that community organisations and the channelling of community efforts are things that remain to be done, but this is a matter I can develop on some other occasion.  If we are concerned to eradicate violence we might look at the areas from whence violence emerges, whether it comes from the Bogside, Creggan, Sandy Row or Falls Road&mdash; to look at the causes and to see how we can through proper community structures relate ourselves to these causes.  In the presence of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I want to say that if this Bill is to achieve a common cause we must have awareness of the fact that it is our diversity that can be our great strength.  Anybody who suggests that we should impose our culture would be flying in the face of what we here want&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We know that this court cannot operate in isolation. Neither could an all-Ireland court. There must be social, cultural and economic structures, and political as well, of one form or another, which will ensure that this jurisdiction can be properly supervised.  To the extent that there are no such public structures&mdash; and I say this in relation to Sunningdale as well&mdash;I cannot see how this Bill could be effective.  Equally, our courts here could not operate without this Legislature.  Who would frame the laws under which the courts would operate if this Government and this Legislature were not here?  Therefore, to talk in terms of doing this in isolation is a contradiction in terms because you must have a total structure apart from the judicial and police structures.  You must have a level of political organisation which will support what the courts are doing.  The courts do not exist in isolation and this jurisdiction and an all-Ireland court could not exist&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection, we talk about the development of social, cultural and economic links between the North and South because we believe all of these must be a total package.  In our document, in paragraph 3, we went on to say that we recognise that in so far as it is suggested this Bill is necessary we must get away from the suspicions that exist, <Col N="580" /> lessen some of the tensions.  We recognise that if Britain were to state her position in the agreement we have asked for, then our constitutional position, which is vastly misunderstood, would then be seen in a different light. We have always stated that Articles 2 and 3 represented a claim by the South on the North.  We have no right to that.  We reject that Britain has a right to legislate for any part of this island and if Britain repudiates that right, then we can talk with our fellow Irishmen and say: &ldquo;Now Britain has rejected this, let us look at our constitutional and legal structures in a new light&rdquo;.  That has not been done.  If such a decision had been declared, we could have reached out in a way not open to us now to those who regard our constitutional position as being an irritant.  Legal, social and economic questions could be resolved.</P>
      <P>These sentiments were put in advisedly. To come back to goodwill and understanding, if we do not have goodwill towards each other this legislation will be totally hopeless and ineffective. If any legislation is even to begin to be effective there must be goodwill and understanding between the communities in each part of the island and between the communities North and South.  We are prepared to recognise the roots of the suspicions that are there.  One would imagine, listening to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, that we never rejected violence in this document of ours but that we were motivated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> We say in paragraph 3 (d) that in agreement between the Irish Government and the elected representatives of the North&mdash;note the &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; again; I do not know how often it comes into this document&mdash;the establishment of an all-Ireland court, which we are now discussing, with appropriate machinery to uphold the fundamental rights of all the people&mdash; this was written in advance of this Bill coming to this House&mdash;and to ensure the maintenance of peace and security.</P>
    <P>For many people that may mean the same as law and order but the manner in which the term &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; has been paraded recently seems to mean, to a certain extent, only the vindication of the Government who seem to regard it as being a special virtue in them to do what every Government must do.  A Government that is not in the business of law and order&mdash;if you wish to call it so&mdash;is not in the business at all and to parade their determination on law and order as a special virtue is, in my view, to indicate a total lack of appreciation of what their function is.

      <P>I shall stay on the Bill but would the Chair for his information, if not edification, please read the contribution made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in this debate? I think he will recognise that in everything I have said and done I remained much more relevant on this legislation than the Minister did but I accept the Chair's ruling.</P>
      <P>So, our court, we recognise must have appropriate machinery to guarantee its effectiveness.  We say that in our document.  That machinery if it would apply in the case of our court must equally apply in the case of this legislation.  It is not in this legislation; there is no sign of it; police supervision, police structures, acceptable structures and also above all else the machinery of the proper and recognised principles and procedures of criminal law.  How can they ask us at this stage two years afterwards to support this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that everything we say can be presented in a certain light and can be misinterpreted.  We serve common cause with all, of whatever background in this country, who feel that violence should be eradicated.  When we see some hopeful signs we should welcome them.  Yesterday the fact that an avowed member of the UDA, Glen Barr, could say what he said is, perhaps, a hopeful sign that he rejected what had been done here in Dublin in the name of the UDA.  We should recognise it as a hopeful sign. I do not want to read any more into it.  If on the &ldquo;Republican&rdquo; side we got someone equally courageous and concerned to say something similar we might have another hopeful sign. <Col N="583" /> We think these signs are what we should encourage.  Above all, we think that in any approach to legislation on this matter we should consider the consequences of what we are doing. We are not just opposing this Bill; we are proposing, as I have outlined and as our Leader has explained in greater detail, an alternative which we believe will achieve what we all want to achieve.  Let nobody henceforth, more particularly the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, ever suggest to any of us in this party&mdash;and I mean this&mdash;that we have common cause with violent men.

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined the Bill very carefully and in detail and I am convinced that the right thing for the Dáil to do is to oppose it completely in the national interest. At the same time I support the objectives the Government have in mind in introducing the Bill.  It is designed to punish crimes of violence and ensure that men who commit these crimes, whether in Northern Ireland, England or the Republic should have no refuge anywhere in Ireland.  I totally support these objectives but I believe this is the wrong way to go about achieving them.</P>
      <P>Every person in the country has a common interest in seeing that the bombers, gunmen and assassins who have killed and maimed people in England and in Northern Ireland and in this city, and who are trying to push the country towards civil war, are caught and punished.  I believe the Bill is the wrong way to tackle this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are quite a number of failures in this Bill and, in my opinion, quite a number of its provisions <Col N="585" /> are inoperable.  The public will be led to believe that, if passed, it will prove to be some sort of cure for all the ills prevailing in the country, that it will be a cure for violence, both North and South and will put an end, once and for all, to the men of violence.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I believe the Bill will certainly not have that effect.  There are suggestions that those people who honestly criticise the Bill will be represented as giving comfort to men of violence.  I disagree with that suggestion also.  It is in the national interest that those of us who are critical of the Bill should come out openly and give our reasons.  It is most unfair of people to say that we support people of violence by being critical of this Bill.  That is not correct.</P>
    <P>I oppose the Bill on numerous grounds.  I believe that, if enacted, it would be politically disastrous, in the sense that it would not help in bringing about peace to Northern Ireland, in promoting reconciliation between the communities in Northern Ireland, or between the communities in the North and South.</P>
    <P>I believe also that if enacted the Bill would violate the Constitution of the Republic.  I have discussed this matter with numerous lawyers, the vast majority of whom are so convinced.</P>
    <P>I am convinced also that the legislation would not be practicable in its operation.  Even if it were, it would bring the criminal law of this State into contempt.  I shall speak later about that.  I shall illustrate ways and means by which the Bill if enacted would bring our criminal law into contempt.  This legislation would compromise our judicial system and, of necessity, would play into the hands of the men of violence who wish to disrupt all institutions of Government in Ireland, North and South.  I believe firmly there is no surer or quicker way of getting into a civil war situation in this part of the country than by the implementation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is evident that violence, North and South, is part of the price we have to pay for the Partition <Col N="586" /> of Ireland.  In my opinion the only long-term solution to the problem, North and South, is to unite all our people, Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter, in mutual trust and understanding. That, I am firmly convinced, is the only solution to this grave national problem.  If I thought this Bill would help to reconcile the communities in Northern Ireland, or to promote goodwill and understanding between the people of Ireland, North and South, I would support it. I think it will have the reverse effect; that, by reason of its wording, of its impact, of the impact it will have on the minds of people in this country it will certainly spark off a civil war situation in the South.</P>
    <P>This legislation will not promote peace and understanding in Northern Ireland.  It will be divisive in the worst possible sense.  It will divide North from South; divide the minority in Northern Ireland from the people of the Republic and will divide the people of the Republic.  This Bill is a bad one and untimely.  I cannot see the necessity for it.  I cannot see it doing any good whatsoever in so far as people, North and South, Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter, are concerned. If enacted, it will be disastrous for this State, particularly if it is carried out to the letter.</P>
    <P>We must remember that this Bill is part of the Sunningdale package negotiated in 1973.  At that time we, in Fianna Fáil, gave our support in principle to the broad outlines of the Sunningdale Agreement with some obvious reservations relating, in particular, to the constitutionality of paragraph 5 of the same agreement. But, in so far as the Sunningdale Agreement established a power-sharing Executive and envisaged a Council of Ireland, it represented a link with existing Fianna Fáil policy.  That is why at the time we in Fianna Fáil saw it as offering a real chance of improving the situation.  The whole agreement was characterised by its understanding of the importance of the Irish dimension and of the aspiration for Irish unity.  If this legislation is enacted I believe it will be the only surviving remnant of Sunningdale, <Col N="587" /> that it will do everything but impress on the world at large the importance of the Irish dimension and of the aspiration for Irish unity.</P>
    <P>We should now face the facts and realise that the Sunningdale Agreement has failed, that the power-sharing Executive has gone, that it was blackmailed by the workers' strike.  I ask the Government to state: where was the Taoiseach and what was he doing, what was the Minister for Justice doing, indeed what was the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs doing at the time the power-sharing Executive in the North was wrecked and blackmailed by that strike?  We did not hear one word from the Government at that time.  I believe the Government should have expressed, through the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice or through the great liberal, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the disgust of the Irish nation that that strike in the North was able to bring down on their knees the power-sharing Executive there at that time.  It was a disgrace and an insult to Irish people that the Government of the day, and the Taoiseach of the day, did not stand up and speak out for all people, North and South, at that time, saying how disgusted we were at the fact that the British Government allowed a strike in the North to wreck a power-sharing Executive there.  It was a disgraceful situation that no one spoke out at that time on behalf of the Government.  Fianna Fáil were the only party to show any interest in what was happening in the North at that time.</P>

      <P>What did the Taoiseach do or say when the power-sharing Executive in the North were blackmailed and brought down by a strike?  There was not one murmur or one whisper from the Government. Since then we have seen a gradual restoration of the hardline Unionist stance which brought down the Executive and led to the total abandonment of power sharing.  Sunningdale offered partnership between the communities <Col N="588" /> of Northern Ireland and partnership between North and South, and guaranteed civil rights to every man and woman living on this island irrespective of political or religious convictions.</P>
      <P>Had these principles been realised in effective political institutions, I believe they would have laid the foundation for peace and prosperity of a kind which the people living in this island have not known in their tragic history.  I also believe the Sunningdale communique hoped to realise these principles by a power-sharing Executive in the North, by the establishment of a council of Ireland and by the creation of common law reform area.</P>

The only surviving remnant of Sunningdale, so far as I can see, is this Bill.</P>
      <P>Following the fall of the Executive, we had a continuing period of direct rule from Westminster.  In the meantime the Convention was elected to consider and recommend to Westminster what form of Government would be appropriate to Northern Ireland.

They demand a return to the old style Stormont system in which one party rules dominant for over 50 years.</P>

    <P>It is generally accepted, even by the <Col N="589" /> Unionists, that the British have no desire for a continuing involvement in Irish affairs, but they find themselves trapped by the negative guarantees contained in British legislation that there will be no change in the Northern Ireland situation unless and until the majority wish for a change.</P>

      <P>This Bill will comfort and assist the British.  At the moment they appear to have no intention of declaring their interest in Irish unity.</P>
      <P>I have examined this Bill very carefully. We should ask ourselves what are the reasons why this Bill was introduced.  When I use the word &ldquo;reasons&rdquo; I mean the true and real reasons and not the glib and rather peculiar reasons trotted out by the Minister and other Government spokesmen.  Not only should we examine and inquire into the reasons behind its introduction, but we should also probe and test the logic behind them.</P>
      <P>The matter cannot be allowed to rest there.  We should also consider very carefully the constitutionality of this proposed legislation.  I wish to make it clear that, when I use the word &ldquo;constitutionality&rdquo;, I am not referring to the possibility that certain sections may be held by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional, although that is extremely likely.  I am advocating the view that the entire Bill is contrary to and at variance with the concept and tradition of legal justice in this country and in practically every other democratic state in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To enlarge on that latter point, I should like to remind the Government, lest they may have forgotten it, that the Republic of Ireland is a sovereign independent State.  This Assembly is the legislative body for that State.  It is the duty of this House to promote laws for the welfare and protection of the inhabitants of this State within these boundaries.  It is the duty of this House to ensure that those laws are obeyed by those within <Col N="590" /> these boundaries.  Every other Government in every other democratic State, as far as I am aware, legislate on exactly the same principles.  Every other such Government confine, and are bound to confine, the application of their laws to within the boundaries of their own territories.</P>
    <P>The reasoning behind this is obvious.  An act which might very well have serious consequences in one State might pass unnoticed in another.  At the risk of being accused of being facetious, let us take the example of an unclothed young lady on O'Connell Bridge.  She would probably cause traffic chaos within minutes and she would find herself on trial in the District Court on half a dozen different charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On the banks of the Amazon, or in some other such area, her behaviour would be considered perfectly law abiding.  Far from being facetious that little example shows very simply, but very clearly to my mind, why each state must, of necessity, confine the effects of their legislation to within their own boundaries.  No one, not even the Minister for Justice, would suggest that an Irish girl who acted like that on the banks of the Amazon should be charged with an offence under Irish law on her return to this country.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the explanatory memorandum acknowledges this.  Section 2 quotes the general rule by which, with very few exceptions, things done outside the State which would be criminal within the State are not only outside the jurisdiction of its courts but are not offences against its laws. This rule of law is well known to lawyers throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many other basic freedoms which we enjoy, the ordinary man in the street never thinks about it and does not realise how important it is until he is deprived of it. Therefore, it is important that the ordinary man in the street and, for that matter, the ordinary man in the Government benches, should remember how this almost universal <Col N="591" /> concept of law has protected the citizens of the State in the past.</P>
    <P>The most recent example which springs to mind is Biafra.  Not so long ago, many Irish citizens engaged in activities there, for the highest and most honourable motives, which not only were against the law in that country but would also have been illegal here, yet I am sure that the Minister for Justice would admit that any attempt by an Irish Government to prosecute and charge these people on their return to this country would not have been tolerated for one moment by the Irish people.  This proposed law, the Criminal Jurisdiction Bill, could be put side by side with the examples I have quoted.  This is what this Bill is about.  It proposes to extend the criminal law of the State to acts committed outside the State.  It is singularly selective in its extension.  It will apply to offences committed in Northern Ireland only.</P>
    <P>If the Government proposed to extend our criminal law to acts committed in all other countries I would still oppose the change, but I could at least see the logic of it.  Why Northern Ireland only?  Why not include in this Bill offences committed in England?  The Minister will probably say that I am being naive in not realising that the greater violence is occurring in Northern Ireland.  Of course I realise this.  I shall deal with this point in detail later.  There has been violence in England, and it is strange that if the persons responsible seek refuge in this State they may not be charged in this State under the provisions of this Bill.  I would ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who is here now, to correct me if I am wrong in this assumption.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is passed, therefore, we shall have the ridiculous situation that if a person kills a British soldier in Northern Ireland he is guilty of an offence in the Republic, but if he kills a British soldier in England he is not guilty of any offence in this State. Lest someone should accuse me of advocating that this Bill should include crimes committed in England, I wish to make it clear that I am <Col N="592" /> opposing this Bill <i>in toto</i> but I am highlighting the position that will arise regarding crimes committed in England in order to show the complete lack of logic in the Bill.  This absence of logic may be the straw which shows the way the wind is blowing and which will give us the real reason why this Bill has been introduced. I am putting it very plainly and bluntly to the Government that they have introduced the Bill simply because they have been directed to do so by the British Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It may be asked why the British Government should wish to confine the scope of the Bill to Northern Ireland.  After all, it could be argued that extending the scope of the Bill to offences in England could only be of benefit to that country.  The reason, I submit, is very simple.  If the scope of the Bill were extended to cover crimes committed in England, the British Government should pass a similar Act making any crimes committed in the Republic of Ireland an offence in England.  This is something the British Government would not do.  There would be commotion in the British House of Commons if such a Bill were introduced, because it would be contrary to the concept of legal justice in England where, from time immemorial, the Commons have passed laws which apply to citizens within its own territory but never attempted, with a few well known exceptions which are <Col N="593" /> not relevant to this debate, to make crimes committed outside its territory offences against the law of England.</P>
      <P>I would suggest the reasoning behind this tradition is that it would be unfair and unjust to try a man under English law for an alleged offence committed in a foreign country where conditions might very well be entirely different, with perhaps a corrupt and dictatorial regime, where the accused was a member of a minority discriminated against because of his religious or political views, where the police force had been proved to be a sectarian force which had used inhuman methods of torture to obtain information and confessions, where internment without trial was carried out on a religious basis, or where the majority were allowed to organise themselves and assassinate members of the minority.</P>
      <P>To the British the existence of such a State is mere supposition, but to us it is a reality and comprises the Six Counties under British rule.  The Government of this country have on numerous occasions pointed out to the world the way in which the legal system there discriminates against the minority.  The Government have gone further and brought a case into the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg alleging the use of torture and inhuman treatment by the authorities in Northern Ireland.  There is no doubt about these allegations being proved, and yet if this Bill becomes law it can only work if our courts accept evidence obtained by members of the RUC and the British Army operating the same techniques which we are condemning in Strasbourg and in the Court of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>The Bill was drafted on the mis-taken premise that all the violence was caused by the minority in the North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the <Col N="594" /> decision of the Government to increase postal and telephone charges by up to 40 per cent, because of its serious adverse effects on inflation, on employment and on commercial and industrial activities and calls on the Government to rescind the decision pending a full examination and recommendation by the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs announced on 26th November that the Government had decided that the charges for postal services should be increased from 1st January next in order to meet rising costs. The Government said these increases would average 30 per cent for postal and 35 per cent for telephone communication services and were designed to yield sufficient revenue to put expenditure and revenue in balance for 1976.  I do not have to tell the Minister the reception this announcement received from all sections of the community: everybody has condemned him for this unjustified increase.</P>
    <P>In recent times Ministers have exhorted the people to do certain things in an effort to curb inflation.  The Taoiseach also made such a plea and the Tánaiste, at the Labour Party Conference, asked the public to show restraint during 1976.  This was accepted as genuine advice from the Government and people thought the Government were genuine in their plea.  We are aware that the biggest disadvantage to our industrial expansion, to the creation of new jobs, has been inflation.  Many companies have gone out of business, and during the coming year many more will find themselves in difficulty.  It is the duty of the Government to lead and show good example in this regard.  If no example is given at the top it is hard to expect other sections of the community to show much concern.</P>
    <P>This will have an adverse effect on commercial firms.  Many companies are in deep financial trouble and many more will not be able to survive the coming year.  The Minister must be aware that charges of this magnitude will put many more firms in serious difficulties.  How can the <Col N="595" /> Government justify an increase of 35 per cent as and from next January? The Minister for Finance told us that the cost of living would be reduced during 1975 and other Ministers stated that the increase in the cost of living would be in the region of 20 per cent, but how can a Department increase prices by 30 to 35 per cent? A positive step will have to be taken within that Department, and as regards public expenditure generally, if we are to survive economically.</P>
    <P>I expect the Minister will say that the increase is necessary because of the high labour content and will argue that something in the region of 80 per cent of the Department's expenditure is on wages and salaries.  I am not disputing this and I do not believe there should be massive redundancies in that Department.  The employees of that Department are entitled to the same standard of living as their comparable partners in other industries and in the public sector.  However, the Minister will have to find ways to economise and increase productivity.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs are one Department which can boast of increase in sales and output.  We all know of the number of new telephones installed and the increase in the number of letters delivered annually.  It is an expanding Department but we will reach a situation where there will be a reduction in returns if the Minister persists in his attitude.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to ensure that the functioning of the Department is streamlined.  The telephone and telex system is of vital importance to industry. It is of vital importance that we have an efficient and reasonable telephone service.  If we put this service outside the scope of companies who require to make contact with European countries daily we will be putting such concerns out of business.  We all know that returns on the average investment in business was never at a lower ebb and that these increases will have an effect on the unit cost which is of vital importance if industries are to retain their export market.</P>
    <P>Many of our firms some years ago <Col N="596" /> were at a disadvantage with regard to unit cost on the export market but the majority of them have lost their competitiveness on that market because of increases in cost.  It is the duty of a Government to keep people in employment. A charge like this will affect people in the private sector.  I am talking now about the average householder who has a phone and old age pensioner whose only means of communication is by letter to their friends and relations.  This 40 per cent rise is bound to present difficulties for them. The Minister does not seem to have presented any formula for the future development of the Post Office and the telephone service.  He merely comes into this House and states that he requires a certain figure to put his accounts in balance for 1976.</P>
    <P>This principle could not apply to any business concern.  If a manufacturing company today was granted that latitude, they would have no problem staying in business.  A private company would have to submit their accounts to the Prices Commission before they could increase their prices.  They also must ask themselves if their product is competitive, because they do not enjoy a monopoly similar to that enjoyed by the telephone service and the Post Office.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there would be a deficit of roughly £24 million for 1976 if he did not increase his prices.  I cannot understand how estimates are arrived at by any Department. Twelve months ago the Minister increased telephone charges.  He said then that those increases would cover the deficit for 1975.  After allowing for the increases for last year, we now find that for the current year there will be a deficit of £13 million. If any accountant in a business concern were asked by his directors to give a projection for a given year as to what the deficit would be if prices were not adjusted and if, with a turnover of £75 million there was an error of £13 million, I would not give much chance for his job.  The Minister must not have taken all factors into consideration last year because we have a deficit of £13 million this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> The Minister stated that for 1976 there would be a deficit of £24.6 million. How did he arrive at that figure, if postal charges are not increased? On what did he base his overhead expenses?  On what wage structure did he base that decision?  Was it based on existing wages for 1975 or did he estimate what wages would be in 1976?  I do not believe any professional accountant would stake his career on giving the Minister advice without first telling him that certain expenses were not taken into account.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister using the same criteria this year as that used last year when there was a £13 million deficit?  In October, 1976, will he again come to this House and say that his projections for 1976 were wrong? He probably will because he has given no indication of how he arrived at this estimate.  He merely made a broad statement that if these increases did not take place from January there would be a deficit of £24 million.  The Minister should explain to this House how these errors were made and he should also tell us if we can expect a repetition next year.</P>
    <P>This is not the only Supplementary Estimate to come before this House. Various Departments have put Supplementary Estimates before this House during the past fortnight and this is not good enough for any Government or any private business.  I treat the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as a commercial concern.  It has always been treated as such and their accounts should be projected in fairly accurate figures.  I expect that from the accountancy system within the Department.  I think their instructions were to give projections on present overheads, without taking into consideration wage rates in 1976.  I do not believe the Minister could give an accurate idea of what wages will be next year but he could say that the deficit would take place on present outgoings and that he was not taking into consideration, for example, any increases in wages in 1976.  That would be a very fair way of presenting this case.  We would then know that if increases had to take place in 1976 there would be a further deficit.  The Minister did not make that statement. <Col N="598" /> He merely gave us the facts as he saw them and told us the deficit which he expected.</P>
    <P>The majority of people outside this House, including business concerns, have expressed their condemnation because the Minister did not put his case before the Prices Commission. He should show a lead in this matter if he wants other sectors to follow him and subject their prices to the Prices Commission.  It should be his duty to present his accounts to the commission for examination, as all manufacturing concerns in the private sector have to do.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister's statement, it was decided in October that proposals for increasing Post Office charges from 1st January, 1976, which sought to offset the estimated deficit for 1976, should be referred to the National Prices Commission for their views.  The commission intimated that the urgency of the proposals and the very limited time available precluded a detailed examination by them of the proposals.</P>
    <P>They are fair comments.  The Minister and the officials in the Department must have known last April what the likely cost would be and the revenue.  I am sure a look was taken at the situation every three or four months and that the Minister must have realised that there was no hope of balancing accounts and that there would be a £13 million deficit in the current year.  He must have known what the position would be in 1976, and if he were sincere he would have put these accounts before the Prices Commission last June, and they would have been given plenty of time to examine it.  He failed to do what every other business concern in the country must do.</P>
    <P>This sets a bad example and it is bad for the morale of the public who are now price-conscious and who face a 35 per cent to 40 per cent increase. If this had been examined by the prices body and if it had been explained that this could not have been avoided and if this had been published in the prices body's monthly report, at least the public would have been satisfied that an examination had <Col N="599" /> taken place.  It is only fair that the public should have this knowledge. They are entitled to say: &ldquo;You are asking us for restraint, you have been preaching to us in the last month, you are telling us what 1976 will be like, but what can we expect when the leaders of the country set us such an example.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the present system is to continue, the morale of the people will deteriorate further.  I realise that progress has been made in regard to the telephone system, that last year a record number of telephones were installed, and I congratulate the Minister on it. However, this huge capital investment must be made to pay.  We cannot hope to continue if we have a capital investment of an estimated £175 million in five or six years and if the service is still a liability.  This will bring a terrible impost if it has to be subsidised, The country could be rendered bankrupt.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> We may not be but we should run it efficiently the same as any business concern would do who would invest at this level.  If we are to have 40,000 additional telephones next year we will have to encourage people to use them, but it is no good installing telephones if prices are to increase as they have been.  People must be encouraged to use the telephone as often as possible.  In that way the system would pay for itself eventually, but if we continue the practice of increasing prices we will make it very difficult to get any return on capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the whole infrastructure of a telephone service is costly and we know how necessary it is, particularly for rural Ireland, that we should have better communications. Many sub-post offices and telephone exchanges are in a deplorable state and they need injections of capital. Now that we are in Europe, if our industrial expansion is to continue we must insure that our infrastructures, let them be associated with roads, <Col N="600" /> sewerage or telephones, must be improved. However, by comparison with the UK and Europe in general we are in a very poor situation.  If we continue at this rate we will reach a situation where our capital borrowing will have reached such a level that we will not be able to expand further.  Our capital borrowing by comparison with GNP is twice the size of Britain's and four times higher than in Europe.</P>
    <P>I do not have to tell the Minister the appalling position of the telephone service in Dublin.  Though we have provided numerous exchanges, they are not sufficient because of growing demands for telephones, at the rate of 40,000 per annum.  I ask the Minister to speed up installations and if we are to continue to instal 40,000 a year we must bring down unit costings.  I do not suppose that if you instal 40,000 more telephones your expenditure in wages will rise proportionately.  I hope the Minister will carry out a thorough examination to see if we are expanding our telephone service properly.  If, in three or four years' time, we have 200,000 more telephones than we have today and we can hold our expenditure on wages and salaries reasonably stable, in that way we will get a return on capital, on the £175 million. If you allow expenses to rise in line with installation of telephones you will be in a serious situation as regards servicing the capital.  The Minister should spell out the future development plan for telephone services or get some experts to work on it.  The majority of business people, since we joined the Common Market, have been exhorted to review the running of their concerns.</P>
    <P>There are experts who can advise the Minister on how efficiency can be improved and if efficiency is improved not only will he maintain the present staff but he will be able to boost their morale.  Nobody working in any concern likes to have it criticised.  People like it to be praised if it is playing an important part in our economic development.  If we can say in this House that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are making a major contribution to our expansion I think that is what the majority of the employees <Col N="601" /> would like.</P>
    <P>I think this can be done within the present structure and the present staff of the Department.  Some 24,000 people are employed by the Department and they can be retained if the business expands.  Any concern with expansion potential such as the Department have, has plenty of room to expand.  There is plenty of scope to expand the telephone service.  Thousands of applicants are awaiting telephones and as our development proceeds there will be thousands more.  We should have a proper plan for the development of the service over the next eight or nine years and we should know what profit it can make.  Generally, the telephone service has given a return on capital except possibly in the past two or three years. Even when a small number of telephones were installed the service was profitable.  The telephone system is a comparatively new amenity in this country.  Up to six or seven years ago there was no great demand from the private sector for telephones but today the telephone is accepted as an essential amenity like radio and television which the private sector require.  Even back in 1964 when we had a comparatively small number of telephones there was a return on capital and the telephone service made a profit.  If a business can expand and has the capacity to expand, as is the case with the telephone service, and if you keep a close eye on expenditure I have no doubt that in seven or eight years there can be a substantial return on investment.  But future progress should be planned in a business-like way and I hope the Minister will try to evolve some such plan. If we reach a situation, after massive capital expenditure&mdash;last year it was in the region of £24 million&mdash;and find ourselves with colossal losses it will not be an encouragement to any Government to expand telephone services.</P>
    <P>Some time ago a Post Office Users Council was established and I should like to know what their terms of reference are.  What purpose do they serve as regards the Department?  Are they entitled to information not available to the public?  Have they access to information on matters normally reserved for the Minister and some others?  I am <Col N="602" /> sure the Minister did not consult them in regard to these increases of 35 to 40 per cent.  How often do this council meet?  Is it regularly?  What is their function?  I have seen no indication that they are playing an important part but I think they should be able to play a very important part.  They could channel information to the Minister. The majority of them come from outside concerns and should have a general knowledge of the complaints received from telephone and post office users.  Probably this service should be expanded and brought more into the day-to-day running of the Department. At least they should be supplied with as much information as possible to see what suggestions they could make.</P>
    <P>I understand that a survey was made of management procedure and telecommunication organisation in 1972.  It would be interesting to hear from the Minister what suggestions resulted.  I think the public are generally dissatisfied with the huge impositions at present on private people and business concerns when they are struggling for survival.  The Department and the Government have shown complete disregard for their problems in overcoming inflation.  If the present practices of Government and semi-State bodies are continued and if we are to expect the same type of increases in public transport, in ESB charges and so on, I presume these are all increases which the Minister for Finance and the Government expect to have inflicted on the public before the Minister introduces his proper budget in January, 1976.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;takes note of the decision of the Government to increase postal and telecommunication charges from 1st January, 1976, so that consistently with the principle accepted by successive Governments the services will be self-supporting and the burden of making good a deficit on the operation of the services will not have to be borne by the taxpayer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister will speak later on in the debate.</P>
      <P>We understand the disappointment which people who use the postal services feel at the request that they pay higher charges.  We can understand also that disappointment might find expression in emotional expletives. But everybody knows that emotional expletives are no substitute for reason. We want, on this side of the House, to speak quietly to the nation and explain the reason for these increases.</P>
      <P>The Post Office employs some 25,000 workers, that is, 53 per cent of the civil service.  In fact they employ more than that indirectly because they also engage the services of 2,100 postmasters on a contractural basis.  The current bill for Post Office staff is £73 million.  Stripped of its political manoeuvring the proposal of the Opposition is that the Government should dismiss about 7,500 to 10,000 postmen and technicians in the postal services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Anybody who wants to examine the bill may look at the published volume of the Estimates of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs; it is Vote No. 43, for those who have not yet bothered to look at the book.  There they will find that 80 per cent of the Post Office bill is in respect of pay, pay for those 25,000 workers who make up 53 per cent of the total civil service.  Let me say that a large proportion of that huge workforce is amongst the lowest paid of the civil service.  While there is natural disappointment that the costs have increased, the reality behind the demand for a reduction and the chastisement of the Government in not giving &ldquo;good example&rdquo; is a call for the dismissal of 7,500 to 10,000 comparatively poorly paid people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the reality because it is only by dismissal of such a large number of people that one could effect the savings necessary to compensate for the increased cost.</P>
      <P>What has happened in relation to the Post Office is what has happened in relation to all personal services in this and other countries.  As wage levels increase, the cost of personal services increases correspondingly.  Either one pays the going rate for labour or else one says to the labour force: &ldquo;No, you may not get what everybody else is getting,&rdquo; or else you say to them: &ldquo;You have to go&rdquo;, or one-fifth, one-third, or whatever percentage one thinks necessary must go to effect the saving.  The consequence of that would not merely be to throw on the unemployment register 7,500 to 10,000 people who would then have to be maintained by society in unemployment benefit and assistance, with no added value whatsoever to the community, but one would also curtail telephone and postal services that many people will agree are already unsatisfactory and below the level they should be at for a reasonably developed society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Postal charges were last increased in October, 1974.  Telephone charges were increased with effect from <Col N="605" /> January, 1975.  Between October, 1974 and now there have been five increases in wage rates by virtue of the operation of the national wage agreements. That has added 37 per cent to the pay cost in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, which represents 80 per cent of the total cost, and costs £21 million.  In addition, further special increases for some sectors of the postal services have added another £1.14 million.  Therefore, standard and special increases in pay alone since the charges were last increased represents a rise of some 38 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Government have asked again and again for constraint in the incomes spiral, not because of any killjoy disposition, not because of any displeasure that people will get higher reward for their services but because of the necessity to maintain the overall competitiveness of the economy and to curtail inflation.  The Government's appeals have not been responded to in the manner in which the Government wish.  But, for right or wrong, the trade union movement and organised employers have volutarily agreed certain increases, and the standard increases of 37 per cent I have mentioned have been negotiated by those people.  One may say, rightly, that the Government have been a party to the national wage Agreements.  That is true but the Government are a minority party to the national wage agreement.  This Government, as indeed our predecessors, have found themselves in the situation that they signed national wage agreements and brought industrial peace or else they stayed out of them and brought industrial unrest.</P>
    <P>The consequences for our community are very clearly spelled out in this Bill.  This Bill is overwhelmingly, on the figures I have quoted&mdash;which I am sure nobody will dispute&mdash;one for wage increases; no more and no less.  Therefore, we are paying now for the increases given.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick queried whether or not the deficit of £24 million on the Post Office next year included any provision in 1976 for additonal income. <Col N="606" /> It makes provision for the 1975 national agreement including the last quarter payable on 1st March, 1976. It does not make any provision for anything that may come after that.</P>

      <P>It is being spelled out now, is being spelled out bluntly. It has never been denied, never been concealed.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Government in every statement they have made have said it is based upon existing information. The Government have made their appeal for income restraint in 1976.  We believe it is necessary to achieve economic salvation, to maintain existing employment and not create any further unemployment. But that is widening the debate.  I do not want to do that now, there will be another occasion for that.  But it is relevant to this whole issue as to whether or not these increases in charges the Government are proposing are justified.</P>
      <P>As I say, the postal service is 80 per cent paying.  If the increased cost of running the service is not to be paid by the people who use the service&mdash;that means people who use the telephone or people who use stamps for letters&mdash;by whom is it to be paid? I put that question very directly and quitely and fairly to the Opposition. By whom is the increased cost to be paid?  By those who use the service, or by the rest of the community, or by the whole community?</P>
      <P>What is the consequence of not putting the charge on the postal service? I think it is proper to say that if you want to make a telephone call you should be charged the real cost of making that call.  In that way you can make your election as to whether you will make a call or not.  That is fair enough.  Whether you want to send a letter or walk down the road and call on your friend instead of writing a letter, you should know the real cost of the alternatives.</P>

The alternatives to increasing the cost of the postage stamp, to increasing the charge for making a telephone call, to increasing the rent for the telephone installation would be packages like this.  To meet money of the order of £23.4 million to £25 million, you would have to increase all rates of income tax by 3p in the £. That would be a way of providing the £24 million subsidy for the Post Office. Or you could impose 10p on a gallon of petrol, 4p on a glass of spirits, and 3.5p on 20 cigarettes to make up £25 million.</P>

      <P>The Opposition are really saying: &ldquo;Do not put this increase on the users of the Post Office&rdquo; who are, in the main, businesses and <Col N="608" /> local and central government.  About 75 per cent of the postal service is used by that sector of the community. The Opposition are saying: &ldquo;do not do that.  Impose instead, 3p on all rates of income tax, or 10p on petrol, 4p on a glass of spirits and 3.5p on 20 cigarettes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The interesting thing is that they talk in the motion about inflation.  The increased Post Office charges will add 0.25 per cent to the consumer price index.  The consequence of imposing a tax package like the alternatives I mentioned would be to add 1 per cent.  It would be four times more inflationary than the effect of increasing the charges themselves.  I want to be fair. I want to give another alternative.  Instead, you could increase the rate of VAT by 1 per cent and you could increase the price of a pint of beer by 2p to yield about £24 million.  I do not think that would be welcomed by Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick was heard without interruption and I suggest that he should extend a similar courtesy to the other side of the House. The effect of that tax package would be to add .75 per cent to the consumer price index.  One would be three times more inflationary and the other four times more inflationary than doing the honest to God, straightforward, business-like thing of charging those who want to use the service for the service when they use it.</P>
      <P>Those are the realities of the situation. The alternatives Fianna Fáil are really proposing are to sack 7,500 to 10,000 Post Office employees, throw them on the dole, and do not take into account the additional cost of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  Or, 3p on every rate of income tax, or these massive increases in taxation on petrol, spirits, beer, cigarettes and VAT, all of which would be more inflationary than the Government's very sensible proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick was heard in courteous silence and he should extend that to others.  The postal service has a very high labour content. It is made up of postmen, telephonists, technicians, engineers, supervisors and labourers, who get paid no more, and I am glad to say, no less than the going rate for similar employment.  The Post Office charges are such as meet the bill, again, no more than what is necessary to meet the bill but, as far as 1975 is concerned £13 million less.  We did not propose that the 1975 deficit be made good.  Those who say that we should wipe out entirely from the Post Office bill the £24 million for next year have not even been gracious enough to compliment us for not charging the £13 million deficit to the users of the postal services in 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the beginning of the year we did not know, and the Opposition did not know, what exactly the national wage agreement would be in 1975.  It has been higher than was estimated last <Col N="610" /> January and other costings have risen throughout the year.  This is regrettable. The Government have worked very hard against the rise.  This deficit would be even greater if it had not been for the steps taken in the June budget, to reduce the consumer price index which have at least kept 4 per cent off the wage bill which otherwise would have risen by 41 per cent instead of 37 per cent.  We have, in fact, gone a significant way along the road towards reducing the overall costs.  We have taken into account known expenditure and known revenue in 1976.  If the country has the wisdom to practice income moderation in 1976, we can be reasonably assured that we will not have a repetition of the immense increases which have to be sought at present.</P>
    <P>Among the additional charges which have been met by the Post Office in recent times and which have been of considerable significance are the additional charges arising out of capital investment.  The Opposition must be chastised for their gross and culpable failure to borrow money for investment in our telephone services when such money was available at home and abroad at rates of interest less than half of what is now available in the world.</P>
    <P>We are now in the situation that we have to borrow money in the name of the Government of Ireland at 14.6 per cent on the domestic market, where we get some of the interest back in tax or at 9½ per cent to 10 per cent on the international market. That money now has to be obtained at that high cost in order to make up for the disgraceful backlog which Fianna Fáil left behind them.  We have 40,000 applicants now seeking phone connection.  Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested here today&mdash;and on the radio a few days ago&mdash;that if 40,000 were to be given a connection over-night the problem would be wiped out.  He knows well that is not so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That 40,000 represents no more than one-eighth of the existing number of subscribers.  Even <Col N="611" /> if capital was immediately available for this purpose it would not be possible to wipe out the deficit.</P>
      <P>When we talk about capital investment, it is very important that we should look to the attitude of lenders. Some four hours ago, or less, in this House I was being queried and badgered by colleagues of Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Brennan because of the size of the Government's borrowing in both domestic and foreign markets.  We would not have to borrow so much today at such a high cost if borrowing had been done when it was a darn sight cheaper to borrow and easier to get the money.  The borrowing was not made when there were more people seeking telephones. The borrowing was not made when money was cheaper.  The borrowing was not made when labour costs were cheaper.  The borrowing was not made, because the Government of the day had little faith in the future of their country and less in the ability of the country to borrow.</P>
      <P>As we endeavour to connect those 40,000 subscribers we are faced with an immense capital bill, because the costs of connection have risen and the cost of money has multiplied. That has to be paid for by the users of telephones, not merely those seeking connection but also all users of telephones.  If the telephone service does not pay its way and we allow deficits to run up on the telephone service, which is a popular service in wide and growing demand, we will not be able to borrow money for investment in the telephone service. That is a simple truth.  I see Deputy Fitzpatrick nodding in agreement.  He as a businessman would know that it is absolutely necessary to convince the lender that you understand business practice and see the necessity to remunerate capital, just as you respect the obligation to pay labour a fair price.  Both the lender of money and the provider of labour deserve a fair reward, and the fair reward is the going rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These charge increases arise out of this Government's sense of obligation <Col N="612" /> to labour on the one hand, and to capital, on the other.  If we fail to respect those obligations the postal and telephone services, inadequate as they are, will become less efficient and we will generate ill will and disappointment and we could well generate a situation in which people would make arrangements, particularly in urban areas, for the delivery of their own correspondence which could be done by individuals who have a large necessity to distribute their own mail.  I know something in this regard. I know Deputy Fitzpatrick will take the point, which is a personal one, that probably in civvy street I issued more letters in any day than he does because of the different natures of our respective vocations, and that I realise the imposition which increased charges will be on business.  But I think Deputy Fitzpatrick in his heart of hearts, when he leaves aside the duty he has towards his party to make a case, will see the fairness of the case which the Government make and will also see the absolute necessity to meet this bill, which is not to denigrate his appeal or the appeal of the business community for greater efficiency in the postal service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned the Post Office Consumers' Council.  I am sure he will be generous enough to recognise that my colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien, established the Post Office Consumers' Council, and I shall leave him to reveal to the Dáil and the public the attitude of the council in relation to services.  At least we now have that council, which gives us the benefit of the opinions of a cross-section of our community about the postal services, their adequacy or inadequacy or the various ways in which the members of the public consider they could be improved.</P>
    <P>We have made the point, and I think it is a fair one, that inflation is a universal phenomenon and it is revealed particularly in relation to personal services here and abroad.  It is of significance that postal rates in several of our European partners are higher than what is now proposed <Col N="613" /> here or as high in many others, and those that are not as high have much higher charges for the last couple of years than we have had.  In Britain, for instance they have had two increases in postal charges this year, and I am prepared to bet that there will be increases again in Britain during the operation of the charges which are now proposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>Apart from the difficulty of getting capital for telephone investment, if we did not ensure that the telephone service paid for itself and was seen to be paying for itself, I want to mention another relevant aspect of borrowing. Financing the deficit from borrowing, which would be the only alternative if we did not tax to finance it, would mean that we would divert capital resources from other forms of capital investment in order to meet the current deficit.  I do not think that could be justified by any canon of good business that Deputy Fitzpatrick considers to be so vital to the salvation of our economy.  I do not believe it is desirable to borrow for current expenditure at all.</P>

      <P>I have said it again and again and if the Deputy looks back on my previous budget statements and on my many public utterances he will see I have said that again and again: if you must borrow it is desirable to borrow for capital investment.  The effect of borrowing for current deficits in the Post Office would be that you would have to divert money which could be put to useful capital investment.  That would reduce our capacity to provide productive jobs, substainable jobs.  If you believe productive investment is not a fall test and you consider that social investment is a justifiable reason for borrowing abroad&mdash;if you could do it, and there is a considerable question mark behind that&mdash;the cost of doing it as far as social investment is concerned, if you were to divert money from, say, housing, to meeting the deficit on the Post Office, would mean <Col N="614" /> 3,000 fewer houses would be built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House, and the country, will take the point I am making, that where capital resources are scarce and costly the proper thing to do is to devote such resources for productive, sustainable capital investment and not to meet operational deficits.  I spoke about Deputy Fitzpatrick's embarrassment in speaking to a brief which contradicted all that his colleagues said when they were Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs. One was the absolute necessity to ensure that the Post Office met its deficits out of current revenue and the second was that Fianna Fáil, when in Government, totally resisted any proposal that charges for Government services should be submitted to the National Prices Commission for adjudication.  We at least referred this to the National Prices Commission The commission looked at the problem, saw it was enormous and said they wanted more time to think about it.  Fair enough, but they said that in the meantime they respected the urgency for the increases and considered that they should go ahead.</P>
      <P>We have nothing to hide.  There is nothing that we know that we have failed to reveal.  The facts are plain but like many other facts they may hurt, they may disappoint.  We feel confident that when the National Prices Commission investigates the proposal in detail they will find that there is no fat in these charges.  The Government are not showing bad example; they are doing no more than asking that those who want the service should pay for the cost of operating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister, one would feel that it was a pity that the charge was not raised more because it was conferring such a benefit on the public.  The Minister is in a dilemma of his own making and the public will not let him out so easily with any excuse or however brazen he may be in coming into the House.  For some time we have been told that inflation <Col N="615" /> was something outside our control and that there was nothing the Government could do about it, even the present Government which claim to be superhuman.  Recently the Minister for Finance told the people that if wage restraint was practised in the coming year inflation could be brought down by half.  At the end of two-and-a-half years there is a sordid admission that the Government have been neglecting their duty and they are now doing what they should have done in their many budgets.</P>
      <P>Everybody has to exercise restraint in some demands and if we do not producers will be priced out of the market. Competitiveness is being eroded as charges mount on those involved in production.  The Minister told us that we cannot continue to increase the charges of those producing and that we must reverse the trend of inflation to enable our exporters, the life blood of our economy, to expand.  The Government have belatedly been made aware of their duty in regard to the economy and at the eleventh hour are making an effort to improve the position.  They are making that effort now because borrowing is out of the question and further taxation is unthinkable. It is in that climate that we have Ministers glibly&mdash;not in the House &mdash;announcing at any old time that we can face other severe increases in costs.  Those increases will drive up the unit costs of production and further endanger our competitiveness on the export market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most stupid excuses are being put forward and we are expected to believe them.  They are made with that ring of sincerity that gives one the impression that the Minister believes them himself.  These increases will affect the cost of production, have a serious effect on unit cost, something the Minister did not refer to, and will throw decent business firms into difficulties. Any decent firm prepares a budget at the beginning of the year and on the basis of that budget gives prices to their customers in advance.  Any increase in production costs during the year throws them out of gear.  The result is a loss in business and a dislocation <Col N="616" /> of employment.  I question if the budget is any longer a relevant vehicle for the charting of the financial course for the year because we have budgets brought in <i>ad lib</i> at any time. The budget is no longer relevant as a financial adjustment for the year's working.</P>
    <P>What about the national wage agreement? Is it a good example to tell everybody to practise restraint when the Government, without apology, plunges into direct increases which affect everybody.  The Minister said they affect only those who pay but a man who loses his job in a factory, even though he may never have written a letter, because the competitiveness of his boss has been eroded by these increases is affected also.  To say that the increases will affect only those who pay was a stupid statement; they affect everybody.  It has been alleged that this motion means that the Department should lay off some employees but it does not mean any such thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Minister in a moment.  The Minister told us of the reforms he intended carrying out in his Department and if he had attempted some of them we might not be debating this motion tonight.  What about the people who will be laid off as a result of this adding to the spiral that we have been told was being brought under control?  It is a serious allegation to say that we mean by the motion that the Department should lay off some workers.  Is there no regard for the effects on the economy generally? Is there no regard for the fact that this sort of nonsense over the last two-and-a-half years has resulted in 107,000 people being unemployed today?  Is the Minister not concerned about adding to this line, and is he not concerned about the effect this is bound to have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister makes the glib statement that good business practice requires that a service pays its way.  Of course it does.  That sentiment will be re-echoed by every business concern in Ireland when each firm is presented with a bill for several thousand pounds more than they budgeted for.  They will <Col N="617" /> then find that they have little choice but to reduce their staff numbers and thus add further to the list of unemployed.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition were to let this increase pass unnoticed it would mean that they were not doing their duty.  I do not know how the members of the Government feel about this, but I have had numerous letters accusing the Opposition of doing nothing about the Government's madness.  The Minister may smile because arrogance and cynicism permeates his Government's attitude at present.  This is not fun and one of these days that will be obvious even to the Government.</P>
    <P>The practice of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has always been to try to pay their way.  They used the phrase which I am sure the Minister heard a thousand times, that is, that one year with another, they should pay their way.  There were many years they did not pay their way but in other years they showed a surplus. That is one Department with an income and for that reason they are supposed to pay their way.  The extent to which they do this is influenced largely by the way in which the Department is run.  There are not many people who are satisfied with the way in which this Department is run.  That is why these extra charges will have an annoying effect on the business and private communities.  The efforts of the Minister for Finance to explain the reasons why the benefits be conferred on the community by increasing the cost were magnificent.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long this trend can continue before somebody cries halt.  The country was led to expect something more.  In recent times the people believed that a serious effort would be made to bring inflation under control.  Everybody was prepared to co-operate in this.  If inflation is to be brought under control a strict eye must be kept on the consumer price index.  If the index is pushed up deliberately by Government action because they say that it must be done if they are not to let some of their employees go, is there not another obvious message in this?  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs are the only Department with an income <Col N="618" /> capable of trying to pay their way.  It was said that this increase in charges is necessary to keep up with the unforeseen increases in the cost of wages.  That makes it evident that the remaining sections of the public service have to get their increases from somewhere else because they were not provided for in the budget.  While the Department of Posts and Telegraphs can recoup their mistakes, in not budgeting on the last occasion by raising their costs half way through the term, the rest of the civil service have to get their increases, which also were not budgeted for.  Where will the money come from?  Will there be more borrowing and taxation?  We were being frightened tonight about the horror of imposing taxation to pay the Post Office, but taxes will be increased to pay for the increases in the other Departments.</P>
    <P>Everybody knew there would be a national wage agreement and nobody better than the Government knew what it was likely to be.  They threatened, and we expected them, to stop this leap-frogging and to bring inflation under control.  They could have budgeted for what was a reasonable expectation as to what the national wage agreement would cost. This has not been done.  The budget is not relevant any more.  It is an exercise for the time being and several other budgets are brought in under different pretexts during the year. That malaise has become endemic in the Government.  It has become a feature of Government who are supposed to be giving a headline to the business and commercial communities at a time when we are undergoing the most serious financial and economic crisis the country has ever experienced.</P>
    <P>If we increase postal charges by 1p in normal times that is understandable, and could be explained as good housekeeping.  If that were announced in the budget provision could be made for it.  This happened before and it will happen again but in the present climate when the Minister for Finance has made it clear to the country that serious action must be taken to curb inflation, that everybody must be prepared to accept restraints, <Col N="619" /> this increase in postal and telephone charges will seriously affect every business concern in the country. We come along and increase one of the most sensitive areas in which business people are struck&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill now be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill are, first, increase from £200 million to £400 million the aggregate amount of Exchequer moneys which may be advanced to the Industrial Development Authority and expended by them by way of grants and certain other payments <Col N="620" /> of a capital nature, other than payments against guarantees and, second, to make separate provision that the aggregate amount of moneys guaranteed by the IDA in respect of principal and still outstanding, and of payments made by the IDA on foot of guarantees shall not exceed £100 million.</P>
    <P>There is a further provision that the IDA may not, without the prior approval of the Government, give a guarantee of repayment of principal exceeding £500,000 in respect of any undertaking.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969, set a limit of £100 million on the aggregate of Exchequer moneys which might be paid to and expended by the IDA on their various grant schemes and other capital expenditures. The limit was increased to its present level of £200 million by the Industrial Development Act, 1972, and issues to the authority of the relevant capital have now reached this limit.</P>
    <P>It is necessary therefore that the limit be increased, as a matter of urgency, to enable the authority to continue to discharge their duties.  The present Bill proposes a new limit of £400 million.  It is the practice to fix such limits at levels which will facilitate review at reasonably regular intervals and thus afford the House an opportunity for periodic debates on the industrial development programme.  I consider that the limit now proposed takes reasonable account of this practice. In the current year the capital allocation to the authority is £42.5 million and, as the need for intensifying the industrial development campaign is very great, it is likely that the level of capital payments associated with the industrialisation programme will render it necessary to review the limit again within a few years.</P>
    <P>An indication of the degree of success achieved by the IDA is that between 1952 and 1970 68,000 new jobs were approved, while in the period 1970 to 1974, inclusive, 78,500 jobs were approved.  In the period from April, 1970, to the end of 1974, the IDA entered into financial commitments of over £225 million, which are related to that figure of 78,500 <Col N="621" /> new jobs at full production, and to a fixed asset investment exceeding £880 million.</P>
    <P>What will be of special interest in this is that the fixed asset investment by domestic industry has been very substantial.  For example, from April, 1972, to December, 1974&mdash;a period for which sectoral data are available&mdash;the planned domestic IDA aided investment was £268 million, as against £432 million for the new overseas investment. The domestic investment components is therefore more than 35 per cent of total planned investment in recent years.</P>
    <P>Up to now the aggregate expenditure limits imposed under the legislation have included payments by the IDA on foot of guarantees which they are empowered to give in respect of loans raised for the fixed assets of an industrial undertaking.  Recently reservations have been expressed about the value of the authority's guarantees in circumstances where they are approaching or have virtually exhausted their statutory capital expenditure limit.  In such circumstances the authority would be unable without an amendment of the legislation to meet the liabilities they had undertaken under guarantee should it be necessary to do so. It is necessary therefore that a provision be made which will clearly substantiate the capacity of the authority to honour liabilities arising under guarantees.  Towards this end the present Bill makes separate provision in regard to the aggregate of loan principal which may be guaranteed by the authority and of payments in respect of principal under such guarantees.  The aggregate fixed for this purpose is £100 million.</P>
    <P>The IDA have used their power of guarantee sparingly up to now and will continue to do so.  Only cases of large investments have been involved, where the provision of a guarantee was the deciding factor in a firm's decision to establish here.  These are mainly capital-intensive projects and in these cases the percentage grant given by the IDA is not large, as it takes account of the level of employment to be created.  At present guarantees either given or approved in principle by the <Col N="622" /> IDA amount to about £40 million. These guarantees will not be lightly given as will be seen from section 3 of the Bill, which prevents the IDA from giving a guarantee of principal in excess of £500,000 for a project without the prior approval of the Government.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the previous short Industrial Development Bill, which I brought before the House towards the end of the last session, I indicated that I proposed to introduce a further Bill dealing with more comprehensive legislation in connection with industrial development activities. Work has reached an advanced stage on this more comprehensive legislation, but it recently became clear however that certain measures it was proposed to include were going to delay the preparation of the Bill. Accordingly I had no choice but to prepare the present short Bill now before the House dealing only with urgent matters of a financial nature which are necessary at this time.  I would therefore ask the House to facilitate the passage of the present Bill in the light of the knowledge that the further Bill, which I am endeavouring to have finalised as quickly as possible, will afford an opportunity for a further debate on the industrial development programme.</P>
    <P>I accordingly recommend the present Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second minor Bill of this kind we have had this year, simply increasing certain limits under sections of the 1969 Act, in particular, in this instance, the total amount of grants which can be made and the total amounts which can be guaranteed by the IDA.  Even though the Bill is very short and not likely to give rise to any great controversy, on its provisions there are many comments one might make about what is not in it as much as what is in it.  The Minister seeks to justify the shortness of the Bill and his failure to deal at all with the industrial and commercial problems that face the country by simply saying at the end of the third page of his three pages and a few <Col N="623" /> lines script that there will be another Bill of a more comprehensive nature on which he would like to have a full debate at a later stage.</P>
      <P>This Bill discloses that no effort is being made on the part of the Minister or the IDA to change policy in regard to job creation and to industrial and commercial problems generally. No change of policy is indicated in the Bill or in the previous Bill discussed here in July but 107,760 people were out of work last Friday week&mdash; probably 110,000 by now; we get the figures about ten days later.  These are the people officially returned as out of work. In fact, there are 10,000 or 15,000 school leavers in particular, in addition to that who are not on the live register but who are equally, or, perhaps, even more painfully out of work.</P>
      <P>In the present year the figures made available to us from various statistical sources show that industrial output is dropping.  This tendency has continued through all of 1975.  The economic statistics relating to trade which we received a couple of weeks ago relate to the first ten months of this year, January to October and they show a disturbing drop in nearly all forms of export other than food and live animals.  There is a huge increase there, from £323 million to £534 million purely due to a very considerable increase in the past year in the price of cattle, and nothing else because cattle numbers are not increasing and will not increase in the future when we consider that so far this year 500,000 cows have been slaughtered.  The industrial side of the economy particularly was never more static than it is today.  Inflation is running at 20 per cent or more and our exports of manufactured goods, classified by material from January to October, 1975 are about £300,000 more than the same classification for January to October, 1974, an increase from £165,722,000 to £166,023,000, virtually a static figure in terms of cash, disclosing a 20 per cent drop in volume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter is not sufficiently highlighted; it is extremely serious.  Almost <Col N="624" /> the entirety of the cash value increase of our exports in the ten months January to October this year is due to the increases in exports of live animals.  There is a volume drop in virtually everything else.  That is the most eloquent comment that I or anybody can make on the state of our industry today.  If we go to output figures, leaving exports out and just taking output generally from manufacturing industries into account, looking at the most recent figures issued today in the Economic Series 1974-75, on page 4, under the heading &ldquo;Number 18: Volume of Production Index; Industries Producing Transportable Goods&rdquo; with a base in 1953 of 100, we see that in the first quarter of last year the index figure was 291.4.  In the corresponding quarter this year it was 264.7; in the second quarter last year it was 313.6; this year in the corresponding quarter it is 292. The third quarter is not given and I cannot quote it but there is no reason to believe that the same trend is not continuing.</P>
    <P>In simple language the effect of that is that there is a decrease of anything up to 5 per cent in the production of manufactured transportable goods as against last year. Last year was not great but this year is even worse.  The Government are able to get away with this, and have consistently attempted to do so by referring to the value of exports and the value of output because the average man fails to take account of the fact that when making comparison between this year and last year you must deduct 20 per cent from this year's figures in order to arrive at a true comparison with last year's.</P>
    <P>Naturally, the Government do not point out these matters to the public and many newspaper commentators fail to take up these points and we are left with a situation in which it can truthfully be said that the economy today is in a greater decline, particularly out industrial economy, than it ever was before.  The Minister will not cure that decline by bringing in a small Bill with big figures in it <Col N="625" /> such as £400 million instead of £200 million and £100 million instead of £50 million for guarantees.  It is perfectly clear from what the Minister said that while there may be an attempt some time in the future on his part to have a reappraisal of our existing aids and incentives to industry, he is not prepared to undertake it now despite the 107,000 at the very minimum who are out of work and despite the fact that our output is dropping and that the value of our manufactured exports is also dropping very seriously.  Apart from animals and animal products, almost all our other exports are becoming more and more uncompetitive with every day that passes.  If one wanted a current and topical example of the reasons why they are uncompetitive one need only listen to the debate immediately preceding this one. That was a good example of why our industrialists are forced into the position of being uncompetitive against their counterparts in all parts of the world.  Brutal increases of 30 per cent and 40 per cent in postal and telephone charges can only make already hard-pressed industrialists even less competitive than they have been up to now.</P>
    <P>With the industrial and employment situation as bad as it is and even though the Minister had no words to say about it, nevertheless it behoves us, for the sake of the country, to examine the situation and see what can be done about it.  I do not propose to examine further the situation as it is.  I have given some facts and figures that paint the precise picture and it does not need a further half-hour to remind us of what a bad state our nation is in today as regards industry and commerce.  What I do want to examine, even if only tentatively, is some of the things that might be done to ease the situation.  I regret that the Minister failed to do this.  It is his duty to do it in this kind of debate. It is not good enough to fob off the House with the statement that he is having a more comprehensive Bill drafted and that he will discuss it all then.</P>
    <P>Could he not tell us the general lines on which such a Bill would proceed? Could he not tell us the kinds <Col N="626" /> of things he hopes to do, the kinds of things which, if various difficulties are overcome, might be contained in such a Bill, the general lines of policy he might pursue in such a Bill?  Surely statutory authority is not needed for everything he might wish to do to improve the wretched state of our economy and industry today?  Surely a great deal can be done without statutory authority?  Why is it not being done?  Why did we not hear this evening what the Minister wants to do or intends to do?  Is the position that he does not know and that that is why the House is not told what plans the Government have, on the basis that the House cannot be told if the Government have not any plans? Surely to goodness, with 107,000 people out of work, our exports and output dropping and even our imports of raw materials dropping, which is fairly shattering also, if the Minister had any plans he would disclose them to the House this evening, but he fails to do so.</P>
    <P>The industrial development of this country falls broadly within two periods of time.  The first one commenced with the election of the first Fianna Fáil Government in 1932 and continued roughly to the outbreak of World War II in 1939.  At that time an industrial policy was pursued by the Fianna Fáil Government which was quite at variance with the rather half-hearted efforts at industrialisation which had gone on before that and, in effect, was a putting into practice of many aspects of the old Sinn Féin economic policy of Arthur Griffith, which had first been mooted by him in the early years of this century but which had never been put into practice by the Government in this country between 1922 and 1932.  There was an extremely strong effort made by the Government of the day to establish native industries, run by Irishmen, financed, so far as was possible, out of Irish capital and heavily protected against foreign competition.  That policy was successful.  The policy of heavy protection against outside competition was one that was suitable for that time when Irish industry scarcely existed and when it had literally to be built up from the ground.  There was <Col N="627" /> no other way in which it could be done without heavy protection.  It succeeded admirably in its time.</P>
    <P>The second phase of Irish industrial expansion commenced with the passing in 1958 of the Industrial Development (Encouragement of External Investment) Act.  That was a very different policy to the Fianna Fáil one of 1932.  In fact, when analysed, in many respects it was almost the direct opposite of the 1932 policy.  By 1958 the world was beginning to move towards freer trade.  Europe, in particular, was seeing the establishment of a Common Market and of the European Free Trade Area.  There were wider efforts made in the world as a whole at achieving reductions in tariffs, quotas and so on.  It became clear that in a very small country with a population of only 3,000,000 the domestic market was so small there was no great hope for any intensive future expansion of industry unless we got out of protection and began to take our place in the world of freer trade.  To enable us to do so it was necessary that external investment in industry in this country be encouraged. That Act gave legislative effect to the policy put forward at the time by the late Seán Lemass.  We are well aware of how in the late 1950s, throughout the 1960s and into the early 1970s that policy worked extremely well.  It created an enormous number of jobs that would not otherwise have been created.  It started an industrial tradition here, in particular in many of the more remote parts where there would have been no hope of industry had that policy not been pursued.</P>
    <P>I believe that, just as the old policy of the 1930s became outdated by changing circumstances, we have to ask ourselves now the question whether or not the policy so successfully pursued from 1958 to the beginning of 1973 is not itself in need of reappraisal and that some new thinking will have to be brought into play in endeavouring to work out what will be the best policy henceforth.  This country has gone backwards industrially since 1973.  It has done so at a <Col N="628" /> much faster rate than any other country in Europe apart from Britain.  Our unemployment has risen at an alarming rate in the last year.  Our creation of new jobs is way below what it needs to be at present.  Therefore we must ask ourselves&mdash;and it is the Minister who should be asking himself&mdash; this question: is the sort of policy that began in the late 1950s and succeeded so well into the 1970s now appropriate? Or will we have to make changes, as Lemass made the great change in the 1950s from the successful industrial policy of the 1930s?  Will we not have to think again in the mid-1970s, see where the future lies and what will be most useful for out people and country over the next ten or 15 years?</P>
    <P>Apart from the encouragement of external investment itself the most significant part of the general package of incentives to industrialists, and in particular to foreign industrialists, in the post-1958 policy of industrialisation was the tax concessions and grants.  I would put them in that order because in the last resort the tax concessions were more important.  We should look at what have been some of the side effects of those tax concessions. It is time to do so now.  The main tax concession was freedom from income tax on export profits. One effect of that has been to encourage large international companies to import into this country partially-produced raw materials for finishing here. Their practice has been for their foreign subsidiary companies to charge out the raw material being exported to Ireland at the lowest possible figure, a figure which in itself would create a loss for their own foreign subsidiaries, and sell back the finished product from Ireland to their marketing countries, whether it be the country of origin or any other, at the highest possible figure in order to maximise the profit shown on paper in Ireland in the accounts and balance sheet of the Irish subsidiary.</P>
    <P>One effect of this has been that it is important from the point of view of the foreign company to try to have the final process carried out in Ireland. This has often meant that the <Col N="629" /> degree of skill needed was less than might have been so in the country where more extensive work and more actual value was added to the product. What has been important from the point of view of foreign companies under this policy has been to maximise the profit in Ireland, even though the degree of production may have been quite small.  What would be important for us, if we are to continue to deal with that kind of industry, is to maximise the actual value added to the product here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is suggested in a paper prepared recently for the National Science Council that we should now begin to think in terms of tying our export tax reliefs to the degree of value added here.  By that I mean the degree of value actually added, and not the degree of value added on paper for the purpose of not paying income tax.  An example of the converse of this particular instance will make it clear for many people.  There are four celebrated companies trading here who operate the converse.  They are the four major oil multinationals.  They are not exporters from here and, therefore, there is no tax relief for them.  Nonetheless, they have a turnover of £400 million to £500 million a year.  One can safely assume they make a profit, considering that between them they have a monopoly, of, perhaps, £15 million or £20 million a year.</P>
    <P>If you examine the accounts of each of those Irish subsidiaries of multinationals, you will find they either show a loss or a minute profit, something like £50,000 or £100,000 a year, and they pay very little in Irish income tax.  The reason for this is that there is no relief on that tax.  The multinationals abroad charge into Ireland the petrol or oil products at the maximum possible price, and the Irish subsidiaries simply act as distributing agents and, because of the high prices on paper they have had to pay for the product, are not in a position to make any profit, or any worthwhile profit. In my opinion, the Irish Exchequer, and indirectly therefore the Irish taxpayer, is done out of millions of pounds which should be paid by the <Col N="630" /> multinational oil companies in income tax every year, but which is not paid because of the method of accountancy used.</P>
    <P>We have the direct opposite to that in relation to foreign industries established here.  I am afraid this is something we have not thought about.  In those cases it suits them to maximise their profit here because it is free of tax.  The very fact that it suits them to maximise their profit here means frequently that the part of the operation carried out is the one which is of least value from our point of view. I am talking here of multinational or international companies who are sending in goods to be further produced or further worked on here. That is something which most of the grant-aided industries which have been established here over the past 15 years have in common.</P>
    <P>Very few of them are indigenous in the sense that they use native products, or that there is any local input of material into them.  Nearly all of them are bringing in a partly processed article, doing some work on it, and sending it out again at a huge paper profit.  In that way, they are suiting not alone their Irish operation, but their German, French, British or American operation as well, because they are minimising the otherwise taxable profits that would arise in the other countries.</P>
    <P>This has had its side effects, some of which I indicated.  The National Science Council is of the opinion that one of the effects is that Irish technologists do not get the full scope for their talents they might get, because the technology of the whole operation is done abroad: the Irish technologists get very little opportunity because frequently there is only a semi-skilled operation to be done at this end, the technology having already been designed.</P>

      <P>I had not got that. It is not on what I wrote out.  It is a recent publication of the National Science Council.  Another side effect of this policy has been to place tremendous emphasis on the capital side of Irish industry.  Our grant policy has tended to attract capital intensive industry rather than labour intensive or skill intensive industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister may be familiar with the fact that there is a very interesting article by Dr. Ciaran Kennedy in the Autumn, 1975, issue of the <i>Central Bank Report</i>.  This article is on the Danish economy and why it has worked so well at the very time the Irish economy is working so badly.  Dr. Kennedy went to Denmark to see why they were succeeding when clearly we are not succeeding at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read that article but I do not think it bears the gloss which the Deputy puts on it.  It relates to the success of Denmark over decades and is not a comparison of our two economies at this moment. However, forgive me for interjecting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the important things Dr. Kennedy found as a result of his short study of the Danish economy was, that the failure of the Danes to provide the sort of incentives we have provided, has not caused them to fail so far as their industry and employment are concerned. I think that is a fair summary on paraphrase of one of his major findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason he comes to the conclusion that the incentives we have been giving are not necessarily the best, even though, like everyone else, he freely accepts that they were highly successful for about 15 years after they were brought in and only seemed to fail in the changing circumstances of the past two years.  We can deduce from this that it is time for us to question whether the capital intensive nature of the industry we have been attracting over the past 15 years is the best type of industry to <Col N="632" /> attract in the circumstances in which we now find ourselves with 107,000 people out of work.</P>
    <P>In particular, it is noteworthy that in recent years the sort of industries that a high proportion of IDA grants have been spent on consist of industries such as chemicals and plastics, and other industries of that kind, in which there is a high import content. They are largely grant-aided but they have a very restricted impact on the Irish economy as a whole and the secondary investment which they create is, to say the least of it, very limited.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have seen examples of some of these industries. I am not anxious to name individual industries.  For example, there are chemical industries and allied industries of a highly capital-intensive nature in which millions of pounds have been invested which are employing only 60 or 70 people and are never likely to employ many more.  Admittedly the 60 or 70 people have very good jobs, they are very well paid, their jobs are pleasant and, hopefully, reasonably secure.  Nevertheless the dividend in terms of jobs which the IDA are getting from this kind of investment is very poor indeed.</P>
    <P>It is well worth considering now whether we should continue to spend a lot of money on attracting that kind of industry or change our approach in order to encourage industry in which the need for capital is less but in which the amount of employment given is greater in relation to the capital employed.  As well as the possibility of changing from capital-intensive to labour-intensive industry, we should consider what is described in Denmark as skill-intensive industry, where the amount of employment given and the value added can be very great, notwithstanding the fact that the amount of capital involved can be comparatively small.  I think it is fair to say that one of the conclusions that Dr. Kennedy reaches in relation to Denmark is that the high degree of skill, in particular the high standard of design, had a great deal to do with the success of many Danish industries which, due to the economic strain, <Col N="633" /> might otherwise have gone to the wall. The great bulk of Danish industry, as reported by Dr. Kennedy, was not the large type of foreign industry brought into Denmark by what would be the equivalent of the IDA, if they had one.  Instead it was skilled Danish technicians and craftsmen who, in the course of their own employment in factories or workshops in Denmark, thought of a good idea, saw a way in which a particular process could be carried out more easily, profitably and efficiently than was being done in the factory in which they had been working hitherto, and set themselves up as a very small company to carry out that process.</P>
    <P>It was from that that a tremendous base was given to Danish industry, a base which was able to withstand domestic and world problems of inflation and foreign demand in a way that the sort of industry we have encouraged in this country since 1958 in many cases would find difficult.  This is not to say, happily, that the great majority of our industries are not thriving, as indeed I believe they are, but one of the reasons I think that comparatively few of them have gone to the wall, even though many of them are not expanding in a way that one would like, is that the IDA were extremely careful down the vears to whom they gave grants.  They have required a proven track record from the particular industry someone proposed to establish, and it has been difficult for Irish citizens to get a grant from the IDA and to avail of the other incentives for industry and particularly exporting industries, for the reason that because they are Irish businessmen, because we have not the industrial tradition here that one would wish, they have no proven track record and cannot have.</P>
    <P>If the IDA are to continue to insist on that <i>sine aua non</i> for giving grants and assistance then we are going to depend to a continuing high degree on foreign investments.  I would suggest that the time has come to think twice about this.  Do we wish to continue the foreign dominance of our industrial scene or would it not be preferable for us now, when we have seen a certain number of foreign companies <Col N="634" /> depart this country very quickly in recent years, to have a reappraisal of the fundamental IDA approach to this sort of problem and get them to weigh the potential benefits and risks of helping, by way of capital and otherwise, small Irish businessmen who are prepared to take that chance?</P>
    <P>It may well be that 50 per cent of such Irish industrialists or businessmen will fail, but at the moment it is very difficult, unless you have proved yourself in a particular industry, to get started in any industry at all here.  Is it not worth taking a chance on giving grants to Irish businessmen who have not a proven track record in the particular industries they are trying to establish? Even if only 50 per cent of them succeed, is it not very much in the national interest to encourage them and enable them to succeed?</P>
    <P>As I have said, the general characteristic of the sort of industries we have been encouraging into this country since 1958 has been industry of an international character in which frequently the full manufacturing process is not carried out in this country but is partially carried out in conjunction with partially processed raw material imported from a parent company abroad.  One of the things we have lacked and have failed to attract to the extent that one would wish are industries that are prepared to use Irish products, local raw materials, and to carry out the entire manufacturing process in this country from almost the recovery of the raw material to the final placing of the finished article on the retailer's shelf.</P>
    <P>The Minister may reply to that, that we have not that much raw material of various kinds that we can avail of.  But even if we cannot avail of it as extensively as we would wish and if a great deal of raw material does have to be imported, at least let it be imported as raw as possible and as unprocessed as possible rather than in the comparatively highly processed form in which we have been importing it.</P>
    <P>There are certain raw materials which, happily for us as a nation, are available to us today or are <Col N="635" /> about to become available to us which were not available all down through the centuries and which, in particular, were not available ten, 20 or 30 years ago.  I am talking, for example, about the product of the Tara mines at Navan, the lead and zinc concentrates which hopefully will become available in 12 months or thereabouts.</P>
    <P>We have had no indication from the Government in recent times that there is any proposal to utilise the product of that mine or the other much smaller mines in the country right through to the finished product.  In fact, all the indications are that the lead and zinc concentrates, when they leave the mine after the rough initial processing which they get at the mine or at the minehead, are going to be exported.</P>
    <P>There is a big row going on about whether they should be exported through Mornington, near Drogheda, through Dublin, or through anywhere else.  In my view, it matters very little, if they are to be exported, from where they are to be exported.  The tragedy is that they will be exported and the Government have not told us otherwise.</P>
    <P>Last February the Minister made an announcement that it was hoped to establish a smelter at a future time. We were given no details about it then and we have not got any since. The fact that the company concerned are making active preparations for the export of their concentrates indicates that there is no prospect in the short term of a smelter.  If we fail to establish and operate a smelter here, we will lose a large proportion of the value of those minerals which this country was so fortunate to find near Navan.  I do not think there is any country in the world, apart from the most undeveloped countries of Africa or Asia, who if they had the huge deposits of lead and zinc we are fortunate to have at Navan would not insist, as a condition of any licence for the extraction of those minerals, on the establishment of a smelter either by the mining interests concerned <Col N="636" /> or some people in co-operation with them.  Nevertheless, we have no smelter, or an announcement that we are likely to get one, and at the moment active efforts are being pursued to facilitate the export of lead and zinc concentrates.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that as long ago as 1970, on an appeal to the Minister for Local Government, planning permission was granted for a smelter, subject to many conditions, in respect of a site at Cork Harbour, which, as far as I recall, was on Little Island.  At that time the principal objective of those who sought to establish the smelter was perhaps the smelting of concentrates or ore from abroad because we were not aware of the extensive nature of the deposits in Navan and the deposits in Tynagh; the Silvermines and Gortdrum are comparatively limited by world or Navan standards.  That proposed smelter in Cork Harbour was not proceeded with.  Nevertheless, the permission remains.  Presumably some preliminary planning or design work has been done and the possibility is there.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that there is now a glorious opportunity for two of our great natural resources to be utilised very profitably for the maximum benefit of the Irish people by building a smelter somewhere on Cork Harbour and powering it by natural gas from the Kinsale Head gas field rather than have the bulk of the natural gas converted into electricity, as is proposed by the ESB for their new power station at Marina in Cork at a cost of £50 million.</P>
    <P>I know this smelter was, like most smelters, originally designed to be powered by electricity.  The quantity of power used by a smelter is so great that if one were to be established anywhere in this country it would be necessary to build a new oil fuelled power station beside it.  We now have a glorious opportunity to utilise to the full two natural resources, lead and zinc and our natural gas, together for the benefit of the Irish people.  As is well known, the conversion of natural gas into electricity leads to a loss in the thermal or calorific value of natural gas amounting to about 66 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> That can be avoided by its direct use in the blast furnaces of a smelter.  The smelter has of course to be redesigned, and it may mean slightly heavier expenditure as a result.  But the saving that would come about by the more profitable use of the natural gas would be enormous.  In the next year or two if we fail to start building a smelter we will have thrown away the great bulk of the value which we could have got from the discovery of lead and zinc at Navan.  We will also have failed to utilise in an economic and profitable way the natural gas which will become available in a couple of years from Kinsale Head.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I should like to make, particularly about the development of industry in the Cork Harbour region.  Over the next few years this is likely to be our most important site of new industry, due to the fortunate fact that natural gas has been found in close proximity to it. One of the very useful ways in which it is proposed to use some of this natural gas is in the building of a urea plant for Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta, which comes under the aegis of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The only sad thing about that is that unfortunately Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta will be able to use only a small proportion of the natural gas which becomes available, and the bulk of it will go to the ESB and, comparatively speaking, will be wasted by conversion into electricity.</P>
    <P>The planning of the NET plant for the manufacture of urea direct from natural gas is proceeding.  Unfortunately, foreign consultants were appointed to supervise the operation generally, as happened in relation to other aspects of our natural gas, and in particular the pipeline, where the British Gas Corporation were appointed.  In the case of the NET plant the consultants appointed were Messrs. Kelloggs, an American firm having a large office in Britain, from which they operate in this part of the world.  An important part of the sub-contract for the building of this plant consisted of steel fabrication.  The value of the steel fabrication sub-contract is in excess of £500,000.  It was tendered for by an <Col N="638" /> Irish firm who were looked over by Kelloggs before they were asked to tender and were found to be a firm capable of carrying out the necessary work at the necessary high standard within the time stipulated.  They duly tendered.  Long negotiations took place in the course of which they were informed by a director of NET that they had been successful and that their tender would be accepted.</P>
    <P>A week or so after they were informed of that they found, to their horror, that their tender had been refused and that a British sub-contractor, Farmer &amp; Sons, was awarded this valuable sub-contract instead.  The view of Messrs Kelloggs was that Irish firms had not sufficient experience in this type of work and that there was no guarantee that they would carry it out within the time limit.</P>
    <P>This is only one example in relation to the difficulties facing Irish contractors, sub-contractors and industrialists generally in relation to tendering for work arising out of big developments in Cork Harbour.  There are numerous other examples; the bringing in of the British Gas Corporation being one of them.  I know that Deputies Tunney and Gene Fitzgerald have more examples they wish to put to the House in respect of these matters.  It is highly regrettable that Irish firms are constantly not obtaining these contracts.  It comes back to the old IDA mentality: &ldquo;Because you have never done exactly this before, therefore we cannot be 100 per cent certain you are capable of doing it.&rdquo;  Nobody, it appears, is prepared to take even 1 per cent of a chance with an Irish businessman or an Irish industrialist.  That is an appalling outlook and it will strangle our industrialists and our industrial development.</P>
    <P>If contracts such as this, the fabricating of £600,000 worth of steel for NET, is being refused to a highly competent Irish firm in Dublin&mdash;the only Irish firm found worthy of being asked to tender and agreed by all and sundry who saw it as being absolutely competent in every way is turned down, not on the grounds of price but on grounds of inexperience, what hope have they of getting <Col N="639" /> contracts worth millions, perhaps tens of millions, in the building of oil rigs which no Irish firm up to now has been able to do?  How will firms gain experience in order that Ireland will obtain its full benefit of the entire spin-offs of the discovery of natural gas and, hopefully, oil?  They will not be able to do it if all the time they are shot down on the grounds that they never did exactly this before.</P>
    <P>The firm I am talking about has done work close to this, not quite as big or as complex but they were perfectly competent to do it and could bring in advisers from consultancies to ensure that they could do it to the highest standard and within the time specified in the contract.  Yet, they were refused.  I do not want to make any point of this, but I understand that an appeal was made to the Minister personally in respect of this and his attitude was that while he would like to see contracts such as this going to an Irish firm he had been given expert advice and he did not want to over-rule it.</P>
    <P>Irish industry is not going to make any progress, so far as benefiting from gas and oil finds is concerned, unless the Minister is prepared to over-rule expert advice.  Clearly our firms have not got the experience but they will never get the experience, even ones like this which have experience of 90 per cent of this type of work, unless somebody orders the firms concerned to award the sub-contracts to Irish firms.  In the cases we have been talking about in relation to Cork Harbour it is not private firms that are making the decisions.  One is NET which is a semi-State body and another is An Bord Gás, an entirely State-owned operation, that was allowed to bring in the British Gas Corporation.  If State and semi-State bodies are going to do this, one can hardly expect private firms, particularly foreign privately-owned firms, to do anything else.  The outlook for our industrialists and technologists in regard to benefits from the development of gas and oil must, accordingly, look very bleak.</P>
    <P>As an alternative to the capital intensive nature of the grants which we <Col N="640" /> have been giving up to now and of the side effects of the tax exemptions one can suggest fairly glibly and readily labour subsidies of some kind rather than the capital subsidies which, in effect, the present grants amount to. The type of labour subsidy I have in mind is something on the lines of the premium employment programme introduced as a result of the second official budget in June last.  It is easy to say that was a failure and that we should, therefore, forget about schemes of that kind.  Unfortunately, it was a failure because it seemed to be the only enlightened piece of thinking in relation to our economy and industrial and employment problems I have seen from the Government over the last two years.  From the figures given by the Minister for Labour some weeks ago the number of people who obtained employment under the scheme, but not necessarily as a result of the scheme in all cases, was 2,467. One would have hoped that by now we might have 15,000 or 20,000 employed under the scheme, the great majority of whom would have been employed as a result of the scheme, but instead the figure is distressingly small.</P>
    <P>The premium employment programme which is a form of labour subsidy does not work in its present form but that is not to say that it would not work if it were in a more attractive or useful form.  The Government should look hard at the various restrictions on that scheme and try to remove as many of them as possible.  In particular, they should remove the necessity that a person had to sign for four weeks and be in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance for that period before they could come in under the scheme.  At present a large number of school leavers are unemployed&mdash;it is variously estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 and it might be greater&mdash;but none of these people can avail of the scheme.  It is not really a scheme for job creation; It is a scheme for getting recipients of unemployment benefit or assistance out of that category.  One of the other major drawbacks about it is that if a firm has declined in its employment figure since 20th June last, <Col N="641" /> it has to get back up to its figure of that date before it can start to bring in people under the scheme.  The scheme does not apply to the industry to which it could most profitably and usefully be employed, the construction industry.  People could be brought in overnight in the construction industry, the most flexible of all our industries if this scheme applied to it.</P>
    <P>It is worth the Minister's while to reflect on the fact that on 15th September, which is the last date for which we have figures for individuals, there were 21,950 unemployed in the building industry.  A vast number could be put back to work almost overnight if some simple steps advocated in this House by this party were taken by the Government.  Unfortunately, those steps have not been taken; but even if the Government were adamant in not increasing the loan level of £4,500 and the ridiculously low income limit for SDA loans, a lot more building could be got under way and many of the 21,950 could be got back to work if the premium employment programme were applied to them.  It should be extended out of all proportion to the very limited way in which it was introduced in June last.  It should be looked at as a positive programme for the creation of jobs, and all those provisos and conditions should no longer be expected to apply to it.</P>
    <P>This form of labour subsidy applies in other countries and Dr. Ciaran Kennedy refers to it as applying in certain regions of Germany.  There the method by which it operates is that a worker who is brought into employment finds that his employer is paid by the State an amount equal to the social welfare payment that would have been made to the worker if he had not been taken into that job.  Therefore the employer is only called on to pay the difference between the social welfare benefit the worker would have got and the full wage.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is a much higher incentive than the £12.50, or whatever the figure is, under the premium employment scheme here.  What is important is not that it is only £12. What has damaged it is that it is <Col N="642" /> available to such a very limited number of people and industries that it has unhappily, I regret to say, proved to be very much less successful than one would have hoped.  It covered only 1,207 people between June and November at a time when unemployment continued at a fantastic rate.</P>
    <P>Mention of the system that applies as a labour subsidy in some of the regions of Germany brings me to the point that clearly something of that kind is an incentive to work and we will seriously have to ask ourselves whether the social welfare system as it has operated here in the last year or two is not a serious disincentive to work in certain circumstances.  I can quote examples constantly being given to me every day of the week where it would pay A, B, C or D not to work.</P>
    <P>I do not want it to be taken from this that I am critical of a good general social welfare system and in particular I do not want to be taken as being critical of the dole system, which this party first introduced more than 40 years ago; but I am critical of the ways in which it has been abused in the last two years, not necessarily by recipients, though there have been and always will be individual abuses of it.  I am critical of what I would regard as the abuse by the Government of that system generally, and I believe that in certain instances and circumstances this has created a serious disincentive to work, particularly in regard to those who are in the higher level of receipt of social welfare benefits of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>If this were not so I do not think men would be talking today about what they call their right to redundancy. It is a right I would never have thought existed.  I have had people approach me with the complaint that they had been seven years in a factory and that they had to continue to work at a time when men with only three years service were redundant, and I was asked did I not consider it to be fair that those with longer service should have the first right to become redundant.  I had hoped that redundancy was the kind of thing the average <Col N="643" /> worker would like to avoid, but I wonder from what one hears is that so: does the average worker want to avoid redundancy in all circumstances? I am not clear that all do.</P>
    <P>I think there have been arguments in this House on Estimates and Bills for social welfare about whether in any circumstances the income of a particular worker would be higher if he were not at work rather than when he was, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare became fairly annoyed about this being suggested and he produced an elaborate table in which he showed that only in one minor instance at one particular point of the scale, did the income on paper of a person who was out of work exceed that of somebody who was in work, assuming that originally they both had the same wage.</P>
    <P>That is true on paper but not in practice.  This is what an increasing number of workers are beginning to find.  It is in this that the difficulties for Irish industry in the future may well lie just as much as any failure of the IDA or the Minister to adapt policies or incentives.  I have people coming to me and rather plaintively saying: &ldquo;I am earning £35 a week. I am paying differential rent, income tax and social welfare contributions. I have £X net left when I have everything paid and I have a wife and two children to support.  I see John Smith down the road who was in the same job earning the same wages and he is now getting social welfare benefit of £Y.  He is paying no income tax or social welfare contributions and because of the differential rents system his rent has dropped from £5 to £2. When he has his various weekly payments made he has so much in his pocket.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I doubt if there is a Deputy in the House to whom the same examples have not been given, but all of us are afraid to talk about it.  We are told that recent happenings in the western area arise directly out of these kinds of payments.  Because the topic has not been discussed does not mean it is not one that may have a bearing on the size of our unemployment <Col N="644" /> figures today.  The wheel has turned a full circle from the marches of other years when people today talk of their right to redundancy, their right to be unemployed.</P>
    <P>If we are seriously interested in our industrial development and in increasing productive employment we must fully consider what I have been saying in regard to the relationship between social welfare benefits and the net available income by comparison with the net available income of those who are employed.  Every day of the week I hear in increasing volume from people working: &ldquo;Here am I paying high income tax, high social welfare and so on.  Am I not part of a diminishing group now supporting an ever-increasing group of those without work?  How long can this go on?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He is only partly right.  Those who are working, paying social welfare and other contributions, are only partially supporting those who are not working. The remainder of the support for those out of work, the majority of whom are idle through no wish of their own, comes from foreign borrowing.  We are rapidly nearing the situation when the desire of the Government to borrow abroad does not seem to be diminishing but perhaps the willingness of the lenders abroad will decline when they see the money lent spent on non-capital purposes, on current Government expenditure.  Paradoxically the very thing that would save the country from what must be economic ruin if present policies continue to be pursued, would be the unwillingness of our lenders to lend because when they stop lending for current purposes and insist that borrowed money be used for capital investment then we might see a little reality in the economic management of the country.  We might see unemployment figures begin to go down for the first time in three years; we might see industrial output beginning to go up; we might see the volume of exports begin to rise and we might even see what I should like to see, the volume of our imports of raw materials begin to rise again because that would be a sign that recovery was beginning to operate.  Unfortunately that day has not yet come <Col N="645" /> but for every hour it is put off the difficulties will increase.</P>
    <P>I have tried as fairly and as objectively as I can to put before the House numerous points and aspects of industrial and economic policy that should at least be considered even if, on examination, all of them were found not to be fully warranted.  At least I have endeavoured to make suggestions and outline roughly certain avenues that might be explored, certain policy reappraisals that are necessary in respect of policies that we have accepted as almost sacrosanct for the past 15 or 16 years.  The Minister failed to make such a reappraisal at a time when it was never more necessary. I hope that in his reply to the debate he will expand reasonably the views of the Government on how an unemployment figure of over 107,000 can be countered; how our industrial grants and tax incentive policies can be altered in order to improve employment. I hope if he deals with these matters he will not confine himself to criticism of the shortcomings or alleged shortcomings of what I have said but that he will give the positive views of the Government on these matters and a positive and definite indication of what this new Bill, about which he spoke in his introductory statement, will contain and when we may expect to see it.</P>
    <P>Many things are alleged in this House from time to time for political reasons to be urgent but if this country is to survive in anything like the way we have known it in the past and if it is to be able to hold its own in the EEC in the future and in the world generally no Bill is more urgent, more badly needed than a Bill which would bring about a reappraisal of our industrial policy and a drastic reduction in the shortest possible time in the incredibly high figure for unemployment that we have today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity of speaking on this Bill. I listened with a certain amount of interest to the speech of Deputy O'Malley.  To me it seemed there was not much grey area about it; it was <Col N="646" /> largely black or white, that the solution of the problem of the Irish economy at present was merely that the Government of the country should be changed.  This was simplistic and getting away from a fact that needs to be restated that we are living in extremely difficult times here and in Europe and in every part of the world.  I read yesterday of one or two south American states with resources which have this year halved their inflation rate to 300 per cent.  I know countries where there is mass terrorism, countries on a war footing, where 70 per cent of the budget goes into defence.</P>
      <P>About six or seven weeks ago in Germany I called on a German manufacturing concern which about two or three years ago were interested in investing in Westport where I live and did not make any firm decision then. I called to see the principal of that company to find out the present position. In speaking of Germany we are speaking of a solid and strong country in financial terms, strong in investment, in personnel and technology. This industrialist's customers were, to a large extent, in the machine tooling industry in Western Germany.  He was able to tell me that in his particular circumstance in his factory his sales were down.  He had serious problems and the major reason for this was that most of his customers were on a two-day or three-day week. If we are attempting to isolate the position within this country and suggest that there are peculiar and unique circumstances here that do not exist elsewhere, that is an over-simplification. If, presumably, by extension, an alternative Government in this country could put the show on the road in Ireland, presumably, by definition, it is taking on the world and a mere change of Government will lead to brighter times in Britian, Western Europe, Japan and in the United States of America.  There is no point in attempting to paint it in this sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a debate like this, tracing the industrial development of a country is of certain value in putting matters into perspective.  It seems to me that if the tracing of the <Col N="647" /> history of such industrial development in again painted in a black and white sense, if, tracing the development of this country since the foundation of the State, no reference whatever is made to the contributions made by the first Government of the State, or other Government which contained representation of the parties which presently constitute the Government, it is a rather polarised type of development.</P>
    <P>For example, no reference whatever is made to the establishment of the Shannon scheme; no reference whatever to the fact that the Industrial Development Authority was established by an inter-Party Government. It had not been my intention to dwell in this debate on such an historical background but it is necessary in the light of what has been said.  Indeed, through the 1950s while there was substantial industrial development in the country, it was during an era of expansion in the world and in Europe and the incentives we were offering, and continue to offer, were infinitely more attractive than those that existed anywhere else at that time.  It was an era of mass United States investment in manufacturing industry in Europe.  Despite all that, the level of investment that accrued to this country from the United States, through much of that era, was a fraction of what it might have been had the policies been as expansionist as they might have been by the Government of that era. This is an attempt to put matters into a relative sense because, throughout much of that era of massive United States investment in manufacturing industry in Europe, there was a single office of the industrial agency of the then Government in New York and was inadequately staffed.</P>
    <P>There was absolutely no presence by that industrial arm of the then Government elsewhere on that huge continent during that era of massive United States investment in Europe and I was personally a witness to that.  There was involvement in the <Col N="648" /> mid-east, mid-west later and on the west coast at an even later stage.  But sadly, throughout much of that period, US companies had made decisions on European locations. Many of those American companies had established their European headquarters in Britain, which meant that attempting to go to these companies past this point and to suggest to them that Ireland should be the location for their base in Europe was extremely difficult.  In many circumstances such companies did not take up options in this country they might have done had we been on the ball a little sooner.  Therefore, if we want to speak of the industrial development of Ireland, we must speak in a relative sense.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have problems at present.  There is an extremely high level of unemployment which saddens us all.  I am certain there is nobody in this country it saddens more deeply than the present Minister.  The problems we have are partly for historical reasons due to the nature of this country, due to the policy of protection necessary throughout a certain stage of our development.  It is due also to an amount of feather-bedding carried on for a number of years that led in some sectors of industry to an inherently weak Irish sector.  If we look to the movement of free trade, which is supported by the Opposition, if we look to the start of this since the development of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, which was negotiated by a Fianna Fáil Government, which was the start of the breaking-down of these tariffs&mdash;which we supported because it was necessary in a world of free trade&mdash;we can see the root of the problem we have at present.</P>
    <P>In the context of the world economy at present the Industrial Development Authority are doing a very good job. I am particularly pleased that in the light of the gloom through which we are living, in the light of the economic disadvantage particularly in this country, if we talk about the broad political security of the country and if we speak of the terrorism to which we are a witness, it seems to be a remarkable <Col N="649" /> compliment to the Government fundamentally that the type of stability exists here which encourages such investment, and to the Industrial Development Authority, through these extremely difficult times, to manage to attract the level of superior investment in industrial employment and in industry in general which they are doing.</P>
    <P>Sadly, of course in the past year the net effect has not been good because there have been redundancies at a slightly higher level than new jobs have been created but we are beginning to get to the stage where we are over the worst of this.  I said this previously, and it needs to be reiterated, that the present level of redundancies do not, to the degree that many people might imagine accrue from the present state of the world economic order or from the economic problems that exist here. To a certain extent they relate to that. But, I have said this previously and will say it again, if we were experiencing boom conditions in the world today, in Western Europe and in this country due to the opening up of free trade, due to the inherently weak sectors in some aspects of Irish industry with tariffs being reduced to a much greater level than had been previously, we were still going to run through a phase in which we were going to experience an extremely high level of redundancy.  It is important that that be noted.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy O'Malley referred to the fact that the average man fails to take into account inflation figures when he reads figures of increasing trade or investment levels.  I do not think so.  I think Deputy O'Malley underestimates the average man in the street.  He is not that foolish.  Indeed, I was interested, it had nothing whatever to do with industry but he introduced the topic at the West Mayo byelection, to hear him express an opinion reflecting that of others when he stated that the results apparently were because of excessive payments in the social welfare sector.  It was an unfortunate statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which he then withdrew and it is on the record.  He said: The results, a lot of people say, are because of excessive payments. He then withdrew the remark but went on to say the results were because of disproportionate benefits or something relating to income.  I represent those people.  It happens to be my constituency.  If they are the type of people who now, apparently, can be bought in this type of manner, they are less than the people I hope I am representing.  Indeed, the trend in that part of the country had started even before we were in Government to be in a position to even increase social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised questions about the chemical industry and the capital intensive nature of much of the chemical industrial investment in this country.  The suggestion that this type of investment should be discouraged is a point of view.  But can we choose? Is there a limitless pool of industry in the world from which we can take our pick?  Is it so limitless that we can say that we are going to have this sector, we are not going to have that sector, we want industry that is strong in labour; we do not want capital-intensive industry?  Might I say that the hypocrisy of this attitude is typified by the very fact that the same speakers and the same party came into the House last week to suggest an infinitely greater level of State subsidy per job in the shipbuilding industry.</P>

      <P>I want to take up Deputy Wilson on the point he mentioned. Of course, the shipbuilding industry is, to a degree, labour-intensive but only to a degree because it is an industry in which there is massive investment.  I want to compare the level of subsidy that was suggested not on a labour-intensive or capital-intensive basis but to the extent to which it relates <i>per capita</i>, in other words, per worker.  The Deputy came into this House and complained about the capital-intensive nature of the chemical industry and suggested it should be discouraged, and a week after that he comes in and seeks massive subsidies in a different area.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is on the record that the Deputy said something approaching discouragement.  I believe that is the word he used.  We do not have these options in the world today.  If we could have the luxury of suddenly emerging from a country of very recent industrial origin, a country which the industrial revolution by-passed, and transforming this country into a Switzerland where we had a very high level of sophisticated industries and full employment and labour-intensive industries, this would be excellent.  But we do not have that luxury in our present state of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Deputy in approaching industrial development <Col N="652" /> suggested that we should take a fresh look at certain aspects of policy, but he did not develop these points to the degree he might have done.  He suggested that grants tend to produce industry of a capital-intensive nature and there were complaints about foreign companies starting with partly-produced raw materials adding value in this country only to a small extent and maximising profits here for profit motives.  I accept the point that Deputy O'Malley made that the tax is the main incentive.  If we are in business and attracting industry from abroad to Ireland, if there are limits to our success and if we are not getting the level of investment that can create conditions of full employment here, while those of us who are concerned about Irish industry, an Irish arm of industry and lesser incentives for people coming from outside the country, one of the problems one has is of reconciling this viewpoint with the reality in the market place.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that one of the problems in pursuing the lines suggested by Deputy O'Malley is that in the market place it will lessen the attractiveness of the country for foreign investment, because if we make it tougher for manufacturing industry from western Europe, the USA and Japan to come in here, where these companies have other options in the world, it will make it more difficult to attract that level of investment.  We will, instead of the stabilisation which we are trying to produce, get disincentives which will substantially reduce the level of investment and the level of employment which Deputy O'Malley said he wanted to seek. There is a weakness in this.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Deputy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the position of Irish people in so far as grants for industrial development are concerned.  I have experience of this, both in public and private life.  The Industrial Development Authority look favourably on proposals which are put to them by Irish people.  There is an inherent problem because we are not a country of industrial skills <Col N="653" /> or industrial background.  This explains the reason why we have a lesser level of industrial development in the country than there is from foreign sources.  However, there is a welcome increase in the domestic level in industrial activity.  The Minister said this evening that the IDA domestic aided investment in industry from April, 1972 to December, 1974 was £26 million at a time when the level from overseas was £432 million.  This, to date, is the highest proportion of domestic industrial development the country has achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In cash terms, of course.  What about jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the statistics for job terms but they should, on average, relate to the investment level.  It has been my experience that Irish applications are judged on their merits.  I do not accept that the approach of the IDA to get a higher level of Irish involvement is one in which they will have a situation where 50 per cent of the applications will fail. In other words, Deputy O'Malley would accept a risk level of Irish applications, in contrast to those from people outside the country, in which one might have an end result of 50 per cent failure on the basis that people are learning through experience.  I suppose, to a certain degree, we have to pay a price but it is a lot of nonsense to suggest that people judging these applications will encourage risk to the level of an end result of a 50 per cent failure rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other ways we can tackle this problem.  I believe it needs to be tackled because we need a stronger Irish involvement which we have not had to date.  Sufficient study has not been given to the fact that in commerce we have a very astute business community.  If you go through the country you will find that the vast proportion of experience in the commercial world is in commerce rather than in industry.  We have great commercial skills, astuteness, merchandising skills, capital, tradition, and intellect but we lack, to a large extent, <Col N="654" /> an appreciation of what industry is about.</P>
    <P>Industry is very different to merchandising. It is a different world.  We do not fully appreciate this.  Something should be done to involve, to a greater extent, the Irish commercial population in the work being done by the IDA.  Some of us had an idea some time ago that the country development teams, which are doing excellent work in the western counties and which largely consist of the senior executives of the particular counties, might be extended to include in their membership representatives of groups such as the chambers of commerce, the trade unions and the farming organisations. One of the problems at present is that these teams sit in judgment on grant applications.  If the development I suggest took place they would not be on the teams for this purpose, judging grants at local level, but in a development sense in considering policy and the future.  I see a great deal of merit in involvement of people such as that in these deliberations. The IDA could possibly do a bit more to involve Irish businessmen in a more integrated sense in industrial policy, in attempting to get them involved to a greater degree in the regions in their planning, and in their programming abroad and encouraging properly selected people who will work through the system and supplement what is being done at national level to get outside the country occasionally in order to learn more about promotion and what industry is about.  That is the approach we should aim at rather than automatically accepting proposals from Irishmen and looking for a very high risk level.</P>
    <P>The IDA are to be complimented for going after Irish businessmen during the past two years and encouraging, through seminars and meetings, the development of proposals from Irishmen to build industry in the country. I am delighted the Minister is here to listen to me because I would like him to take note of what I am about to say. Between the stage from which a thought is conceived regarding industrial development and the point at which that comes to fruition in the form of an industry is a fairly long <Col N="655" /> span.  We are talking about the Irish businessman especially.  This is a much more important factor where the Irish businessman is concerned.  It is more important than it is in so far as foreign operations, especially by multinationals, are concerned because they have vast resources in R and D, research and development.</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting is bringing research and development to its simplest level which means that the single businessman or the two partners have got to find out something about this idea and that will necessitate travelling around this country, travelling to Britain, to the Federal German Republic and even further afield to investigate types of machinery that might possibly be necessary to produce a particular product, and to look at the operations of other industries in the particular field in which they are interested and take an overall look at the marketing situation in the sector in which they are interested.  There could be a very worthwhile development under which the Industrial Development Authority working on their own or through the county development teams would encourage, not applications to establish industry from Irish sources but, rather, would encourage applications seeking a level of grant to conduct the very simple affairs of which I speak.  In other words, if there is a summary of costs related to a particular project which might amount, for example, to £1,000 I would like to see instituted some type of programme under which a proportion of the cost of this type of fundamental research and development is funded by the national agents or by the county development system, thereby encouraging people to do the very basics and fundamentals and in this way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are restrictions on the employment premium.  They are minor restrictions.  The four weeks signing is a very minor restriction designed to avoid certain abuses of the system. Restrictions other than that are merely simple restrictions confining the employment premium to what is defined as industry within the country and expanding it beyond that point could make for many difficulties.  I do not think the vast extension of a scheme such as that might bear the advantages which Deputy O'Malley suggested should accrue.  For a start, I think he is going to tamper with the tax incentive or the grant incentive which he suggests should be looked at and, in turn, reducing the employment premium could lead to money being spent from State sources which might not altogether result in the competitive position.  It is not as simple as all that.  The British introduced it some years ago and they have since ceased to offer that particular incentive. There is very little experience throughout the world in that particular field.</P>

    <P>With regard to Mayo, I am glad the Industrial Development Authority are going ahead with the advance factory in Westport.

      <P>It would make it easier for me if I were allowed to speak without interruption.  The Asahi development is a tremendous boon for North Mayo but it is 40 or 50 miles from the part of the constituency of West Mayo in which I live and that means it is beyond the acceptable commuting distance.  It is very necessary, therefore, that there should be equal concentration by the Government on industrial development in the southwestern part of the county.  There is an American company in Castlebar employing 600 or 700 people, mostly girls, and while this is welcome there is great need for substantial male employment there.  I hope the success in north Mayo does not lead to a feeling in certain circles that the Mayo situation is a happy one.  We want to see continuing progress in that area.</P>
      <P>There is another particular area which to a degree pertains to the IDA. It relates to fish processing.  A large proportion of the Donegal catch is caught off the north Mayo coast.  Some is landed on the north Mayo coast. There are two fish processing factories but both these are now closed.  One was processing crab and the other was processing other kinds of fish.  Both these factories are privately owned.  The Minister cannot afford the luxury of walking in over-night but it is a matter which should be examined to see if there is some possibility of sorting out the problems of these companies or having them taken over.  There are vast fish resources off the coast of Mayo and both the Industrial Development Authority and BIM might be receptive to applications from others who might want to take up this option.  The product is indigenous and this could be a viable proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think one can begin to compare industrial development here with the Danish situation merely because <Col N="659" /> someone has written an article comparing Ireland with Denmark.  The Danish experience is very different. Their traditions in industry are somewhat longer than ours.  If we look at the present DE position in the world of 1975, Denmark is very vulnerable from what we hear.  The Danes are very concerned about the problems which are worldwide today.  It seems to me that holding up Denmark as the classic example of what the Irish should do is a little simplistic.</P>
    <P>We certainly seek the Irish content in construction and in the giving of contracts, in so far as it is feasible, to Irish companies.  We have to strive after this.  There are problems when you talk about a competitive world where companies have options to do whatever they want to do in an era of free trade. When we come to sectors where we have, in a sense, a monoploy situation, where we are talking about basic resources which people want to develop, the Department should adopt as strict a line as possible, judging the situation by the degree to which we have control.</P>
    <P>In sectors of industry or of basic resources such as oil or mineral resources, where we see ourselves being in a bargaining position, and in a sufficiently strong position to do so, in so far as it is possible we should make certain that Irish consulting companies and Irish construction companies get a fair crack of the whip.  This is very necessary.  Should we not do so, it will lead to very undesirable situations in the future.</P>
    <P>We had from the spokesman for the Opposition a tirade about the dole and about unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  The suggestion was in the same vein as the west Mayo thing, that the dole was abused. Deputy O'Malley hastened to add that it was not abused by the recipients. He went further and said the Government abused the dole without defining, in any sense, in what way the Government abused the dole.  We would like to have this point developed if spokesmen on the opposite side wish to speak to it.  In what sense is it suggested that the Government abused <Col N="660" /> the dole?  A Deputy who spoke before me wondered if an average or a fair proportion of the people want this redundancy payment today instead of work.</P>
    <P>My experience is that the vast proportion of the people I meet and mix with, given an option in the morning, regardless of the levels of unemployment, or unemployment assistance, or redundancy payments, or pay-related benefit, want to work.  To suggest, as the Deputy did, that an average number&mdash;and then it was amended to a fair proportion&mdash;of the people would prefer this redundancy payment to work is not an indictment of the Government. That is an indictment of that portion of the people of whom he spoke, not the Government.</P>
    <P>I come now to the issue of foreign borrowing.  Of course it is undesirable to borrow more than one needs.  It is even more undesirable to borrow more abroad than one needs.  This country ran into a hurricane due to the oil crisis.  Fundamentally that is what happened.  Overnight that raised colossally the imbalance in payments.  This meant that if the Government were in an ultra conservative mould they could have pursued a certain policy. They could have said: &ldquo;We will not borrow.  We are damned if we are going to borrow.  It is much safer to balance the books.&rdquo;  The Government could have done that.</P>
    <P>If you contrast the hurricane through which we went, and the problems concerned with this foreign borrowing which kept the show on the road and allowed a certain level of expansion and a certain human approach in the critical situation in which many unemployed people found themselves, with the results which would have accrued had the Government been less expansionist, and had they cut out this borrowing, and had they retrenched instead of going forward in this difficult era, I would hate to think of the results which might have accrued, and what the mood of the people might be at present.  It is not a happy position but, in the circumstances, the Government did not have options.</P>
    <P>We must take into account the resources we are led to believe we may <Col N="661" /> have, especially the newly discovered resources, and the resources which are on the point of being discovered, we hope, offshore.  Until they start digging it out, none of us really knows the extent to which the geologists are right or wrong.  If we are to listen to the geologists and draw certain conclusions from what they are saying, and what has been happening in other countries on the western fringe of Europe, we only need to discover about one-fifth of the proportion of oil the Norwegians discovered for an equal input into our economy. Through the discoveries off their coast, the Norwegians have made themselves into one of the richest nations in the world.</P>
    <P>When you go to borrow money you think of your collateral and your assets, and you balance one against the other.  In a broad sense the expansionist policy was the right policy to adopt in the extraordinarily difficult circumstances in which we live. I wish the Minister well in the difficult times in which we are living.  I hope we will ultimately come through with the increased levels of employment and investment which we want to see in the industrial sector.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of my contribution on this Industrial Development Bill is inspired by the same contribution to the <Col N="662" /> Central Bank Quarterly from which Deputy O'Malley quoted.  The head of the ESRI who wrote that article put in all the caveats that a scientific economist and writer on social affairs would put in.  In other words, you cannot say what suits Denmark will suit Ireland.  You cannot make direct comparisons.  What he did say, and what I believe is true, is that you can get insights by examining the industrial or agricultural problems of a small country.  You can get these insights when dealing with problems of a country of similar size and one which, broadly speaking, has a similarly constructed economy.</P>
    <P>Dr. Kennedy said the Danes&mdash;and Deputy Staunton made a good point there in saying that they were in the industrial field before we were&mdash;developed their economy not by export subsidies or capital grants to industry, not through capital intensive industrial development, but through labour intensive and skill intensive industrial development.  The important point is that it is not done by postponing social services.  There is a very high level of social services in Denmark. Very important from our point of view, if only to make us think, or rethink, it was not done by foreign enterprise.</P>
    <P>In this country we get a good deal of ignorant knocking of foreigners and loose talk by people of limited sophistication and the more limited their sophistication the more ready they are to offer solutions to all our industrial problems.  You do get this kind of criticism: &ldquo;He flew in from Germany and got this that and the other and a local man cannot get anything.&rdquo; I am not going to contribute to that kind of xenophobia.  I am just saying that that country developed its economy not by attracting foreign enterprise and not by State sponsored bodies, which is also interesting as apparently there are very few of them in that country.</P>
    <P>He points out there was protection in Denmark the same as we had protection in the thirties, when mainly through the exertions of the late Seán Lemass, the industrial wing of our economy was being established and developed. He said, in effect, that protection <Col N="663" /> in that era was worldwide and in fact has been blamed by economists since for the horrible slump that took place in world trade at that time.</P>
    <P>Dr. Kennedy talks in his article about the change that took place in Denmark and this country when there was more free trade perforce, when things had changed, and the effect this had on both Denmark and Ireland. He has one particularly interesting point when he says that at the end of the 1950s there seemed to be a kind of awakening of our industry to its true potential even before the free trade agreement was worked out, but at that time there was an awakening of our Irish-based industry before foreign capital was attracted which gave promise, although the promise did not flower, that this native-based industry would develop.  I am going over this because there may be lessons in it for us.  Nobody could say that conditions which are ideal in one country, with its distinct social structure, history and so on, may be ideal in another country, but there may be some insights which we can get from a study of the position.</P>
    <P>Dr. Kennedy makes the point that only 10 per cent of the total work force is now engaged in agriculture but there is a very good agricultural base.  I was brought up in an area where people always referred to the Danes as being models for the dairying industry and the development of farming. Our agriculture has a technologically sophisticated base and marketing is sophisticated.  It is important for the country that it should be there, but at the moment we are dealing with industrial development. I think it could be said that we have a fairly solid agricultural base developing at the moment as a background for industrial development. What particularly interested me is the emphasis the paper laid on individual enterprise and initiative, that it was for the most part from private individuals&mdash;I think Deputy O'Malley made the point&mdash;not from the State that the initiative was coming, and that we should learn from this.  The people concerned, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out, were not people who <Col N="664" /> started with a lot of money.  They started with the skill or with the refinement of a skill which they themselves had in the industry in which they were involved, and they worked up from that, a small skill to start with.  One opinion often heard when we were going into the EEC was that the small-time venture was doomed.  I remember at the time reading a very encouraging article by Nora Beloff which pointed out three or four small-scale industries which developed into rather large ones but which started, one in north Italy, in a back garage and another, again in a small back-of-the-house garage.</P>
    <P>What I am particularly interested in is the kind of education that will spark off this kind of enterprise, this kind of spirit, innovation, creativity, and that is what the whole thing is about.  It is about enlivening minds in such a way that they will probe, that they will invent, that they will branch out in new fields, that they will be in a sphere of ideas.  Dr. Kennedy makes the point that many of the people in Danish industrial development movements had not a great deal of what we call formal education but they had a great knowledge of design and were prepared to experiment, take a chance and start in a small way.  Many of them had very little capital when starting.  Many of our industrialists felt that the managing director ought to have the swivel chair first and several colours of telephones, and that this was the important place to begin.  Whereas most of the industries that developed into large ones started the way these Danish ones started that are described by Dr. Kennedy in his paper&mdash;the Henry Morris type of thing, fixing bicycles in Oxford.</P>
    <P>I do not want to overemphasise this, but the point I want to make is that it is not necessary to have large amounts of capital if you have a spirit of enterprise, if you have innovative minds dealing with incipient industry.  For the most part, there was very little money coming from the Government for people like that.  We want to examine ourselves, particularly educationally, <Col N="665" /> in this matter.  I have my own views on this.  I believe it does not really matter what the material taught is.  I believe it is how it is taught and how it is made to affect the minds of the recipients.  If we can bias people towards the creative rather than the system of the instillation of knowledge, this will be of considerable advantage in the industrial field.  I shall come back to that in a moment.</P>
    <P>From what I have said already it seems there can be a labour intensive bias, and the Industrial Development Authority could think along those lines at least.  I did not see the script of Dr. Kennedy's article; I intended to contact him to get the script from him.  I know Mr. Donal Nevin of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions challenged some of his criticisms of the way our industrial development has been handled or some of his views on it.  However, it is important that we do a certain amount of rethinking on the whole matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley mentioned the subject of social welfare payments. Politics are crude at the best of times and when one raises a fundamental question one is liable to be misinterpreted, even without being culpably misinterpreted, but Deputy Staunton deliberately, and for a cheap political reason, misinterpreted what Deputy O'Malley said in this regard.  I was thinking of the position of an industry in the west of Ireland which is so short of its raw material, potatoes, that they must import potatoes from Britain.  Farmers in Britain grew less potatoes this year than last year&mdash;30,000 acres less or thereabouts&mdash;and I do not know where the raw material for this industry will come from.  While in the west it struck me that recipients of small farm assistance could improve this situation.  I am a great believer in that assistance, provided the money is used for the development of the small farm, the clothing of children and the improvement of houses, but I would not be averse to suggesting, depending on the valuation of the farm, that the <Col N="666" /> recipient would have to grow a certain amount of potatoes before being entitled to the assistance.</P>
    <P>In this way the raw material for this industry which gives good employment could be provided.  There should be some kind of tie up to ensure that in a labour intensive industry like that the raw material would be available.  The present system of capital intensive produces fairly comfortable circumstances for the worker but there are fewer of them and this is not suitable, particularly in the areas referred to by Deputy Staunton, those in which county development teams are working.  High wages for a few is not as good as having a high number of jobs even if the wages are not quite as high.  In this regard I am dealing with rural Ireland and the small provincial towns.</P>
    <P>Industries which are bled by taxation are not in a position to reinvest money in the industry.  I gather that in Denmark there is a system which encourages the retention of money for reinvestment.  It is important that money should be reinvested.  There is a tendency here to believe that the industrialist is a bloated capitalist that must be debloated by severe taxation. I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not agree with that; it is one of these simplicities one hears bandied around in the name of an ideology.  This should be discouraged. The industrialist may often have two ulcers where the worker may only have an incipient ulcer.  The worry is not all on the side of the worker.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in the paper by Dr. Kennedy was on the importance of industrial design.  I disagree with his major premise, and with the major premise of the Danes in this regard. The implication is that if the education is of a certain kind&mdash;he was talking of academics and second level education&mdash;the recipient of that type of education will not be very useful for the development of industry.  I am aware that I am out on a limb in this regard but I do not believe it is true because the material taught is not as important as the way it is taught, as the kind of mind it produces, as its ability or inability to promote creativity <Col N="667" /> in the recipient to promote a bold entrepreneurial spirit in the person. I admit that when the terminal of that stage has been reached that on top of that the skill in industrial design has to be imparted.</P>
    <P>It is important that some element in what has gone before will lead to that but what has damned us is the belief that when the leaving certificate has been achieved the person has the qualifications necessary for something. That is the time when the particular skill must be super-imposed.  I was glad to see that AnCO, in their report on the new apprenticeship which will come into effect in 1976, have made provision for apprenticeship for people who have already obtained the leaving certificate.  That is in line with my thoughts on the importance of a basic education upon which certain skills can be built.  I maintain that the skill will be better received and if it becomes obsolete the person with that background will be able to acquire another skill better than the person who has been trained only in one skill without such a background.</P>
    <P>I read an interesting article by Doctor Hession in the Autumn Studies on this point.  He pointed out that in Germany for a while the technological training was imparted and it was found that if the general education was not good enough before that if retraining had to take place the object of that retraining was not in a good position to absorb it.  The emphasis on creativity, on entrepreneurial spirit, on the importance of the qualifications in things like industrial design were emphasised by Doctor Kennedy.  He referred to the Scandinavian design team's report in which they emphasised that some of our products were badly designed and the most successful designs were those based on our traditions.  I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have a special interest in this.  It was debated at the NUI Convocation at the time when some people had their various hobby horses to ride but that came out prominently in the discussion.</P>
    <P>The disincentive element in social <Col N="668" /> welfare payments referred to by Deputy O'Malley and which was misinterpreted, deliberately or not, by Deputy Staunton, did not weigh very heavily with many of the Danish economists.  A footnote to the article points out that one economist feared that there would be an element of disincentive where the actual payments were approaching the level of wages in a particular industry.  In fact the reverse of the coin was referred to: if they were too low something he called the &ldquo;culture of poverty, a breaking of spirit&rdquo; might occur which would leave people unemployable altogether if they were dependent on social welfare payments for a long time.</P>
    <P>Some of our young economists some time ago came out very firmly in favour of Ireland breaking the link with sterling and attaching itself to the snake.  Denmark did this and it had some effect on the economy.  This is not the time to debate this point but any consideration of the implications of any move like this can be creative in its own way and help to break some of the moulds and make us look afresh at the position in industrial development. There may be an argument that the United Kingdom have had too great an influence on our thinking in more ways than one, that we are trying to enter the industrial development building on the second floor in some instances without having gone up the stairway.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to the position in my own area.  Deputy Staunton beat the Westport drum for a while before he left.  We have a particular problem in the Cavan-Monaghan area, which is in the north-eastern regional development grouping. Louth is heavily industrialised and unfortunately is very badly hit by unemployment.  Monaghan and Cavan are in a special position in that it is difficult to attract industrialists, especially foreign industrialists, because even people in Dublin, for example, think it is dangerous to enter either of those counties.  I would appeal to the Minister to pay special attention to those two counties when it comes to dispensing industrial grants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> If a local man has an idea, I am asking the IDA through the Minister, to take a risk with him because he is the best person to do the job.  He knows the counties are peacable, the people are industrious and the chances of success are good.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister referred on more than one occasion to the subject of jobs approved.  Jobs approved and jobs actually created, realised and held, are not necessarily the same thing.  There is, to use a cliché in American politics, a big credibility gap between jobs approved and jobs realised.  When people speak about jobs approved they may say there will be 80 jobs but very often fewer jobs in new industries are delivered.</P>
    <P>I would like the IDA to take a very close look at the legal hold it has on buildings which they have helped.  I am not talking now about advance factories but about buildings for factories in which the IDA have reasonably heavy investment.  If the industry goes wrong there is always the possibility that the IDA will find themselves in legal difficulties about their rights.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the problem of Irish firms in a particular line of manufacturing who have not done certain things because they had not the opportunity and are therefore refused a contract.  That is very strange.  It is similar to the young school leaver or graduate looking for a job&mdash;when there were jobs available&mdash;who was often frustrated by advertisements which read &ldquo;experience essential&rdquo;.  If they cannot get a job they cannot get experience and that can be very frustrating.  If there was a certain amount of entrepreneurial spirit or a bias towards taking a risk, such firms could get the contracts and I am sure the Minister and the IDA would, if the occasional business went wrong, get the backing of the House when a <i>bona fide</i> risk was taken.</P>
    <P>Sometimes firms that have been aided by the IDA move out.  In my own constituency one firm simply moved out.  They gave a splendid accolade to the workers, patted them <Col N="670" /> on the head and told them how wonderful they were, but &ldquo;Goodbye, Charlie, I am closing up&rdquo; and offering the excuse that more sophisticated computerisation demanded that the firm concentrate elsewhere.  Every time this happens it should be hammered, especially if public money is spent and an industry pulls out soon afterwards.  They should be subjected to close scrutiny and severe criticism of this behaviour.</P>
    <P>Deputy Staunton made the point that we had a great degree of sophistication in commerce but not such a great degree in industry.  That is a good point.  He was illogical when he suggested that the IDA should subsidise trips for people who had expertise in commerce in order to develop industry.</P>

      <P>He spoke about the chambers of commerce getting a place on the county development teams.  To my mind, a member of a chamber of commerce is someone who has expertise in commerce and it was that type of man he was advocating as a student of industrial development.  My remarks have been offered not in any spirit of cavilling about what is going on.  I believe in the type of economy which I know well, the economy of my own area.  It is important that the IDA get the finances and the opportunity to develop new industry.  It is as well also to remind ourselves that it seems manufacturing industry alone will not be enough to take up the number of people who will be looking for work.  It would be foolish to believe that we must rely on manufacturing industry alone to cope with the young people coming on the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Staunton asked if we could choose between capital-intensive and labour-intensive industries.  I suppose there is a limit to our choice but in <Col N="671" /> certain instances we can choose, and we submit from this side that we should so choose.  Obviously, some countries can and do choose and if we choose we will be helping to solve the very serious unemployment problem that exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to Deputy Wilson's contribution which I found very instructive.  It will commend itself to every Deputy when dealing with a Bill such as we now have before us.  I should like to take him up on one point, a matter of ethnical difference.  He referred to capital-intensive industry not being suitable to the west of Ireland and the general inference was that there is agreement that capital-intensive industry is not the best solution for the country.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree.  We are in a technological era and even in this country technical progress has become evident. We have our expectations of mineral and oil wealth not only here but in England and the North Sea generally. The trend has been towards capital-intensive industry and we must face up to this.  Capital-intensive industries themselves generate employment in other industries as suppliers of industrial equipment and it is, perhaps, here that we miss out somewhat because although we can have capital-intensive industries, far too often the machinery and equipment has to be imported.  It is at this level that we are lacking, especially in the matter of our mineral resources&mdash;our lack of a major steel industry.  I do not know what it would take to establish in Ireland a heavy industry which would supply this type of equipment.  It is a very complex problem which I am not qualified to discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must face up to the need to encourage capital-intensive industries.  It will mean huge resources in the form of grants being committed to the establishment of these industries, but in the long run it may be our best chance to provide permanent employment which is, of course, the ultimate objective of the whole exercise.  It may be a difficult thing to do because patterns change, industries change, but <Col N="672" /> at least we should try to ensure that the industries we attract into the country will be ones that will prosper and be export orientated.</P>
    <P>I say this because in Waterford we have lost some industries during the last few years, traditional industries which had been built up on the basis of protection.  I mention the Messrs. Goodbody factory which was giving very good employment but was developed on a policy of protection. Denny's bacon factory was another traditional industry which did not continue to prosper in a competitive atmosphere. Neither did the footwear and the carpet industries.</P>
    <P>We cannot continue to rely on a low level of investment in capital goods to see us through to a stage where we will have sufficient industries to give us the level of employment we are looking for.  We have gone through a bad period in relation to employment, the level of unemployment reaching 103,000.  Experience in other west European countries and in America has been similar and we all hope this stage will pass and that we will have learned something from our experience.</P>
    <P>It is as well to point out here that Europe has resisted the attraction of protection.  There were instances where fiscal action was taken but, by and large, Europe has resisted protection as a course to be taken to protect levels of employment.</P>
    <P>The present recession was caused by two major factors.  One was an unjustifiably high rate of inflation&mdash;unjustifiable in so far as, with the rate, of inflation appearing in the economy over the past two years especially, investment was not sustainable because the possibility of (a)  operating profitably and (b)  of getting a reasonable income for the investment did not seem to be there and there was a drastic cutback in investment which was a fairly obvious result of the high rate of inflation.  The inflation itself was caused by the second component of the cause of our recession, the oil crisis.  I believe that the four&mdash;or, as I suppose it is now&mdash;five-fold increase in the price of oil caused a major collapse of confidence throughout the west European economy, including <Col N="673" /> Ireland.  There was a fear among businessmen and even governments of the consequences for the economy of such a major disturbance caused by such a rapid increase in the cost of oil.</P>
    <P>The result of the increase in oil prices has not even yet been fully felt because normally only the direct effect of the increased cost is felt in the transport industry and in transportable goods industries but the by-products of oil have risen to such a high price level that many industries have been affected in a number of ways.  The plastic industry is an industry that was very hard hit by the oil crisis.  The rapid increase in the price of oil and the very high rate of inflation were the two basic contributing factors to the recession.  I think we are coming to grips with it but if we are to return to a high level of investment we must bring the rate of inflation down to an acceptable level of less than 10 per cent.  This is vital to our economy because ours is a developing economy.</P>
    <P>We have lost a certain amount of competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> other foreign suppliers and this has damaged our economy and our potential competitiveness throughout Europe and in America for the coming years.  By restraint, by fiscal and monetary measures we must reduce the rate of inflation to less than 10 per cent.  If this means reducing the level of Government expenditure, we must face the long term desirability of doing so. We will not have a return to confidence on the part of investors and industry throughout Europe unless they can be assured their investment will be a real one in the technical sense of the word &ldquo;real&rdquo; and will not be eroded by the high level of inflation. They must be guaranteed that and if we want our industry to expand we must take steps to guarantee that their investment will give them a real return and will be protected against erosion by inflation.</P>
    <P>The oil search has not yet been concluded in that we still do not know what will happen next year or the year after.  The oil finds in the North Sea are real; the Norwegians are benefiting; Britain will benefit and we hope <Col N="674" /> that with the passage of time we will also benefit from them but that cannot happen in the short-term future. I doubt very much if we will benefit from them for the next four or five years because it will take that time to carry out prospecting and, if successful, to harvest the crude oil.  The potential is excellent; if we have oil off our coasts the potential for our economy is unlimited.  The potential wealth and employment which it would generate are very badly needed in our developing nation.  I hope we will be successful as we have been successful in harvesting our mineral wealth.  It is proper to pay tribute to the Minister and the Government for the policy they have laid down in regard to the development of mineral and oil industries.  It has been recognised abroad that a good job has been done from the point of view of the Government.  I would condemn any Member or any political authority that would take a narrow view of this for a purely party political advantage.  The development of our resources should not be the subject of party bickering. The experts have recognised that our policy is a sound, constructive one and will attract foreign investment at a level necessary for the development of our resources.</P>
    <P>The question of competition interests me because we are a private enterprise economy for the most part.  Our people have shown themselves to be very enterprising and shrewd in investment where they see a possibility of profit. I believe the challenges of the EEC will be regarded as promising for us with the passage of time.  The potential of our country to benefit from the EEC is, perhaps, the most promising development, politically and industrially, we have seen since the establishment of the State.  It is imperative that our goods, especially our agricultural goods, should have full and free access to EEC markets because only in that way can we really benefit from our membership of the EEC.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the existing source for the Ballymacward/Castleblakeney group water supply scheme would not be adequate to serve the extensions referred to by the Deputy. I understand that tests have been carried out on a proposed additional source.  The results of these tests were received in my Department on 1st Dcember and are being examined.  In the light of the results of the examination of the problems relating to the source, it will be necessary to investigate the economics of the scheme before grants may be allocated.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person referred to by the Deputy was disallowed from 3rd November, 1975 following examination by a medical referee of my Department who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He has appealed against the disallowance and in connection with his appeal another examination by a different medical referee is being arranged as soon as possible.  His claim for benefit will be reviewed in the light of the medical referee's report on this further examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change in my Department's attitude to this scheme. The advice given in August, 1975 regarding acquisition and development of the pumphouse site had regard to delays experienced by other groups in obtaining extensions of power cables from the ESB.  No other work was approved nor were grants allocated. The scheme as designed covered 230 houses in the area but by the end of <Col N="550" /> October only 140 grant eligible participants had signed application forms. This would mean a high cost per house on the basis of the quotations and tenders received by the group.  The implications were conveyed to the group on 12th November with the suggestion that an effort be made to bring more houses into the scheme.  The allocation of grants will be made when the viability of the scheme has been established.</P>
