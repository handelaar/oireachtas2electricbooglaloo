      <P>Last night I was explaining that sections 500 and 501 which are mentioned in the second subparagraph to the paragraph are incorporated in the table on page 73 because those sections are in Part XXXV of the Act. Part XXXV is mentioned there and therefore incorporates the sections to which the Deputies refer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister comment on the fact that subparagraph (5) appears to import section 70 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, while it is specifically imported in the table?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is mentioned in the table to the extent that it exists in the Income Tax Act, but subparagraph (5) adds to the provisions in the Income Tax Acts.  It must in order to bring in assets, because the Income Tax Act does not involve return of assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But we must provide in subparagraph (5) the necessary element which would require a return of partnership assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct, but there is a general importation of the relevant portions of the Income Tax Act, which includes section 70.  I am getting back to the point Deputy de Valera and I made earlier about specifically mentioning some of the provisions in the tables, while purporting to include them all and then, without prejudice to the generality of those, listing specific ones.  In this case the schedule sets out, amongst other things, section 70, and then subparagraph (5) brings in section 70 plus, as the Minister says, the necessary additions in view of the requirements of capital gains tax.  But is this not highlighting the point we were making, that it is unnecessary and, indeed, as we both said, probably unwise to single out specific references of this kind when, as happens in subparagraph (5), there has to be a specific reference to section 70?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can doubt but that we must apply provisions similar to those contained in the existing section 70 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has quite got the point we are making.  I do not wish to start the morning in a controversial way by saying the thing is decidedly untidy, but subparagraph (1) of paragraph 3&mdash; the provision of income tax relating <Col N="1757" /> to the making and delivery of any returns&mdash;which I recorded last night in detail applies the relevant portions of the Income Tax Code <i>in toto</i> to the question of returns and information. The sections quoted in the table are covered by that, and we have already raised the interesting question as to why a very relevant section, section 176, was specifically excluded by the Minister by positive amendment.  No satisfactory answer has been offered by the Minister.  Therefore when a Deputy on this side of the House&mdash;I cannot remember whether it was Deputy O'Malley or Deputy Colley&mdash; said the circumstance was suspicious, I think he was right and that that is neither a provocative nor an unreasonable statement.</P>
      <P>If you exclude section 176, if you positively include sections 94 and 70 in the way they are in this Schedule, and you include sections 501 and 503 and indeed the whole of Part 35 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 in the way it is done in paragraphs 3 and 18, I find it hard to see why if it was necessary explicitly to include section 172 and section 174&mdash;which I do not think is necessary in the Table&mdash;these have to be put under the heading &ldquo;Further Income Tax Provisions Applied to Capital Gains Tax&rdquo;.  There is very little logic to it; it is untidy; a court assumes that when the Legislature enacts an enactment the form has something to do with reading intention. If the Minister wishes me to substantiate that statement I can do so but I do not want to delay the House with a long legal argument.  I cannot see why this type of thing is done.  Having deleted section 176, having provided for the two sections I have mentioned you are left with just a few more that could be included in a section and not under the guise of a table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to another point. The fact that the Minister last night said that this was for information and suggested that the Schedule was not very much more than an explanatory or administrative table in the Bill is something that does not quite stand up.  The Schedule to an Act is substantively part of the Act although I <Col N="1758" /> am a little puzzled by section 51 in relation to the Schedule.  Section 51 explicitly refers to the Schedule.  It says that the Schedule along with the other Schedules will have effect for the purposes of this Act.  All Schedules are in that position.  If the Minister had said &ldquo;shall have effect for the purposes of this Act only and no further force and effect&rdquo; I could understand the import of section 51 but as it stands it is merely a provision to ensure that what is in the Schedule is a substantive law as anywhere else but actually it was quite unnecessary.  I quote from Beale's &ldquo;Cardinal Rules of Legal Interpretation&rdquo; which says under the heading &ldquo;Schedules&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Schedule in a statute is as much part of a statute and as much an enactment as any other part.  If the enacting part and the schedule cannot be made to correspond the latter must yield to the former&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not think this question arises here.  The Minister tried to make this point last night&mdash;that the Schedule only applies for the purposes of the Act&mdash;and therefore I think the actual legal position should be on record. My quotation is from the third edition of Beale's &ldquo;Cardinal Rules Of Legal Interpretation,&rdquo; page 305.  The matter is first dealt with as long ago as <i>re</i> Baines in 1840, quoted on the following page.  The point is that the Schedule must yield to the body of the Act, but there is nothing in the body of this Bill to contain the expansions that are in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>I should just mention a further point in that regard from the same source at page 307 quoting from Lord Watson in the case of the Trustees of the Clyde Navigation v Laird, 1883:</P>
    <P>Very little weight is, in my opinion, attachable in any case to the mere title of a Schedule as qualifying the enacting words of a statute.</P>
    <P>Let us get away from any smokescreen about what a Schedule is or is not: If there is a conflict, the Schedule is subordinate to the body of the Act. <Col N="1759" /> It is as much an element of a statute as anything else.  In this Schedule therefore we have a table applying certain statutes.  Without going into technicalities and forms of Acts this table is not quite an ordinary table. Normally, a table is either numerical, such as those we have had in an earlier Schedule, a computational table or a table for practical purposes or else it is a table incorporated by means of an enactment.  I mean by that a table incorporated by, and referred to either in a section of the Bill itself or in the Schedule itself. But here we have the peculiarity that it does say in regard to this table:</P>
    <P>(2)  In particular and without prejudice to the generality of subparagraph (1), the provisions of the said Acts specified in the Table to this paragraph shall subject to any necessary modifications, apply in relation to capital gains tax, and sections 500, 501 and 503 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, as applied by this paragraph, shall, for the purposes of this Act, be construed as if in Schedule 15 to the Income Tax Act, 1967, there were included&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>So far this complies with the necessity for incorporating the table, but as we pointed out last night that subparagraph is, in the light of the arguments we made on paragraph 3, actually superfluous.  There are only four left and there are two other titles to be in it and instead of doing this in tabular form like that I should like the Minister to incorporate them. I could come back to the first table but in this case there is something more than mere drafting convenience. This whole part of the paragraph is presented in an illogical and confused way.  I ask the Minister to take the table into account when he is reconsidering this paragraph.  I accept that he cannot do now what I requested of him regarding all of the provisions of the two codes, but he might redraft this whole paragraph in such a way as to include what is left of this table.</P>
    <P>To make a comparison&mdash;paragraph <Col N="1760" /> 2, which we did not object to, except to point out that the table was incomplete, is what I might call &ldquo;clean&rdquo;. It says simply that without prejudice to the generality of subparagraph (1), the provisions of the said Acts specified in the table to this paragraph shall, with all necessary modifications, apply to capital gains.  We are told that income tax provisions apply to capital gains.  There is no qualification or adjustment of any of these sections or of any section of the income tax code in paragraph 2.  Apart from the objection we have raised on subparagraphs (1), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of paragraph 3, the inclusion of the table makes the situation more confused, and one wonders why there must be duplication, especially when one finds that section 94 is mentioned first in the table.  It is applied first in the table subject to necessary modifications.</P>
    <P>What are we doing with section 94 of the Income Tax Act?  We are including without prejudice to the generality of the first paragraph the provisions of section 94 but when we come to paragraph 18 there is a modification of section 94 by the reference to its application with specific reference to paragraph 3.</P>
    <P>This is the type of drafting that leads to much controversy and which could result in a good deal of cost to the State in litigation.  The fact that a legal argument has developed here in relation to it should be a warning as to what can happen.  My only purpose in pressing the Minister on this is to endeavour to have the whole paragraph tidied up and to have dealt with those points which last night the Minister undertook to deal with.  An essential part of the tidy-up would be to abandon the idea of a table, to incorporate all the relevant sections of the Income Tax Acts by way of suitable subparagraphs of paragraph 3 so as to make the paragraph easier in its administration, for advisers and for its interpretation in court.  I urge this strongly on the Minister as a practical measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this paragraph in particular which I <Col N="1761" /> should like the Minister to expand on. I understood him to say that his reading of subparagraph (2) of paragraph 3 was that it imported with necessary modifications the various provisions of the Income Tax Acts relating to returns of information and applied them to capital gains tax and that strictly speaking, therefore, it was not necessary to specify anything in the Bill, that particular items were specified in the table merely as a matter of convenience and of assistance to those perusing the Bill.  If that is so why did the Minister delete section 176 from the table?  If it was there merely as a help and convenience it would seem to follow that its deletion was unhelpful and inconvenient.  Consequently, I am mystified as to the exact purpose of setting out particular sections in the table when on the face of it subparagraph (2) imports all of these provisions and others besides those listed in the table.  What was achieved by the deletion of section 176 if the interpretation of subparagraph (2) is as given by the Minister and if the table is not necessary but is there merely for convenience?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot take this any further.  We have been debating this paragraph of the Schedule for hours and I cannot see how I can add anything to what I said last night. One would think from listening to the Deputy that for the first time in the history of parliament we were producing a Bill with schedules whereas this is common practice.  The 1967 Income Tax Act had no fewer than 19 schedules and I do not know how many tables it contained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is objecting to the inclusion of schedules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every other Finance Bill contains schedules.  It is not uncommon for the annual Finance Bill to contain from three to five schedules. This is a practice that has been followed for decades in this House.  It is useful for practitioners to have Bills set out in this way.  The schedules are set out in different compartments, each compartment dealing with a different aspect of the law.  The one in question <Col N="1762" /> here is dealing with returns and information and all matters relating to these aspects as they exist under the income tax code.  All returns and information which are relevant and necessary for the operation of the capital gains tax code have been introduced with the necessary modifications.  Anything not necessary for that purpose is not mentioned. All this is without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of the Income Tax Acts.  I cannot think of any more satisfactory way of doing this.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that this <i>modus operandi</i> was adopted in Britain in 1965 and, to my knowledge, it has not caused any confusion, furore or any of the horrendous circumstances which were painted here last night in the most extravagant form.  I have given certain assurances and have indicated my willingness to make amendments to the sections which appear to be causing the most aggravation. Beyond that I cannot see how I can bring debate any further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I would add is that the application of the Schedules to the 1967 Act is done in a different way.  I was only answering the Minister's point last night when he suggested that the Schedule was only for the purposes of the Act.  That was the purpose of my defining the position in the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister comment on the point I raised, which is, if subparagraph (2) imports all the relevant parts of the income tax code and therefore that table is merely for help and convenience, what was the point of deleting section 176 from it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this when we were dealing with amendment No. 53.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but a good deal more has emerged since then, as the Minister will appreciate.  We have learned a good deal more about the import of subparagraph (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said and I can repeat that the inclusion of section 176 in the table was not considered to be necessary in view of the many provisions <Col N="1763" /> relating to the supply of information contained in the remainder of the paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Did not the Minister say that the only purpose of the table was to be helpful and convenient and that in fact these things were imported anyway under subparagraph (2), without the table at all?  I think the Minister said that.  I am not misrepresenting what he said.  That being so, what is the point of taking out section 176 from the table?  Would it not still be helpful and convenient to leave it in?</P>
      <P>The Minister is not unaware of why I am asking this question.  What has emerged as the effect of subparagraph (3) in conjunction with the deletion of section 176 does raise certain questions in one's mind.  If the Minister explained the removal of section 176 in one context and that does not stand up in the light of his explanation as to why there is a table there at all, one is entitled to ask him to reconcile what he said, that is, that the provisions of the table are merely for assistance and convenience and would, in fact, be imported without the table.  That being so, what is achieved by deleting section 176 from the table?  It is imported in any case, according to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have said is that it is not considered to be necessary. There are sufficient provisions in the Bill.  In fact, strong objection has been taken to the provisions for the supply of information because it is represented that they are too rigorous and may require more information to be furnished than people would be disposed to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister would agree that the effect of subparagraph (2) is to import section 176 with any necessary modifications to capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Paragraph 3 (1) would automatically import section 176 with the necessary modifications. That being so, what is achieved by deleting it from the table?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that it will not be imported, subject to any necessary modifications, in the capital gains tax code?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of the Income Tax Acts relating to the making of returns provided for in section 3 (1) shall, subject to the necessary modifications, apply in relation to capital gains tax as they apply in relation to income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That would presumably include section 176.  Section 176, with any necessary modifications would be imported into the capital gains tax code.  That is my understanding of the position.  Would the Minister agree that that is so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers set out in the Schedule are so extensive that there is no need specifically to refer to section 176, which is not so extensive as some of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is going a little further than I had gone.  I was asking if the Minister agreed that section 176, with any necessary modifications, was being imported into the capital gains tax code by virtue of paragraph 3 (1) and (2).  Would the Minister agree that that is so, apart from any additional provisions of the Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All the provisions of the income tax code in relation to the delivery and return of information are brought in by section 3 (1), that is true.  The purpose of these tables is, as has been the practice, to identify sections that may have some very specific purpose and to direct people's attention to them.  It is considered to be necessary to direct attention to the section that deals simply with returns and to the sections set out in page 72 but it is not considered that section 176 need be specifically referred to.</P>

      <P>Could I refer the Minister now to paragraph 4 (3) on page 73 which refers to &ldquo;a person not carrying on such a business&rdquo;, that is, the business affecting public shares or securities&mdash;&ldquo;may be required to make a return&rdquo;, <i>et cetera.</i> Would the Minister indicate what kind of person he has in mind in this subparagraph?</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> As I read the provisions in this legislation the powers of the Revenue Commissioners are being extended into the private affairs of the banks.  There has been a long-established <Col N="1767" /> relationship between the banks and their customers, particularly in rural Ireland.  During the years there has been a particularly close relationship between the banks and the farming community.  Extending the powers of the Revenue Commissioners in this area will undermine the confidence of small business people and farmers who have put more trust in their bank managers than any other group.  When this provision goes through the same trust will not be placed in the banks. I know what is the Minister's intention but it will not be desirable from the economic point of view and I would ask him to reconsider this matter.  At this time, more than any other time in our history, we need to restore confidence in the economy. The Minister is doing the reverse by proposing this type of legislation. Banks will be obliged to divulge private information given by their customers.  If a person cannot confide in his legal adviser or in his bank manager, to whom can he turn?</P>

The Revenue Commissioners can seek information, irrespective of whether it is relevant.  If they have any doubt they can go to any bank and demand information.  There has been too much of this kind of legislation in the last few years and today we see the result&mdash;confidence has been undermined and business people are leaving the country.

Is the purpose to require issuing houses, stockbrokers and auctioneers to make returns of all the transactions they may have, or is the purpose to empower the Revenue <Col N="1768" /> Commissioners to get particulars by notice in writing of transactions in which they may be interested?  Are we dealing with a new situation, where all houses dealing with property and share transactions will be required to make returns, or is it specifically where the Revenue Commissioners are of the opinion that someone may be evading liability to capital gains?

It is still the greatest centre of finance in the world, notwithstanding the fact that these provisions exist.</P>
      <P>If a country is to have a capital gains system there must be a system of collecting information.  As I pointed out last night, the Government will not ask the Houses of the Oireachtas to produce capital gains tax legislation without providing the machinery necessary for its operation.  It will be a matter ultimately for the Revenue Commissioners to use the powers given to them.  Obviously if people give full disclosure of their transactions the Revenue Commissioners will not bother getting information from a third party, but if they have reason to believe they are not being given adequate information obviously they must have the means of checking.

Does this provision mean that all the agents engaged in business of this kind&mdash;issuing houses, stockbrokers, auctioneers and so on&mdash;will be required to make returns to the Revenue Commissioners because, if it does, two questions are raised.  First, the Revenue Commissioners will require a massive staff to deal with returns from all over the country and, secondly, ordinary small people encouraged to invest for the good of the economy may feel that what they are doing is going straight to the Revenue Commissioners and they will cease to invest.  I can see the validity in what Deputy Fitzpatrick says.  I agree the Revenue Commissioners should have the power to follow up individuals who may be trying to evade tax on capital gains but I am concerned about how broad this is.

      <P>Under subparagraph (4) reference is made to any person carrying on a trade or dealing in any kind of tangible moveable property.  Would that mean that a cattle dealer, a pig dealer, a tangler, as he used to be called in days gone by, will be affected by this?  Would it affect an auctioneer on the disposal of the contents of a farm or a house if the combined sum exceeds £2,000 or is it per item?  I would like to know that.  Suppose a cattle dealer comes along and buys cattle today and sells them tomorrow has he to make a return?  Will wholesalers be involved?  Will hawkers, such as the people selling electrical equipment and so forth by the roadside be involved? Will it be on one item only or on a combination of items?  Will an auctioneer be called on by the Revenue Commissioners to disclose the affairs of his clients?  That could put him in a very awkward position if he were requested to make returns of his clients' affairs.  Will all dealers and traders be affected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is £2,000 per item. Cattle will not be chargeable because, even though they are tangible moveable property, they are a wasting asset.  All that will be affected are items of tangible moveable property exceeding £2,000 in value.  I doubt if roadside traders are disposing of <Col N="1771" /> tangible moveable property at more than £2,000 per item.  The number of such items would be comparatively few and it is not extraordinary that such information should come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners. They come to notice at present through the ordinary system of stamp duty and registration; land properties are already affected.  The number of returns an auctioneer might have to make would probably be comparatively few.  An auctioneer might specialise in very valuable and rare items which might occasionally command prices in excess of £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Antiques would come under this.  I have known antique silverware recently going well over £2,000.  There is a big demand for this kind of silverware.  The auctioneer will now be in the position that he will have to make a return of these items.  Will it not be open to the Revenue Commissioners to write to an auctioneer seeking information if they are not sure whether or not any item at public auction did or did not exceed £2,000?  They will have that right under this Bill.  This will probably mean extra staff being employed by the Revenue Commissioners to deal with these returns. Would the Minister omit silverware antiques?</P>

      <P>I could not accede to the Deputy's request to delete the very items which it is intended to catch.  If persons are making significant capital gains by investing in and disposing of items of considerable value we consider it appropriate that they should pay capital gains tax on such transactions.  That is the whole purpose of the Bill and it would defeat the purpose of it if such items were exempt.  The fact that they are exempt for all such items under £2,000 is a very generous exemption. It has been faulted because the area of exemption is so generous.  It is extremely generous by comparison with the levels of exemption in other countries.  I consider it would not be a responsible thing to grant any further exemptions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>According to it they would not be excluded because they are moveable items.  The subparagraph does not define if those items would come under it.  Equipment, such as land reclamation equipment, equipment, involved in building schemes and farming equipment such as mowers, combine harvesters and silage making equipment come on the market very often.  Silage making equipment changes hands nearly every two years. Some of this equipment now costs up to £20,000.  If such equipment came on the secondhand market it would surely realise 50 per cent of its actual value, that is about £10,000.  As that would exceed £2,000 would the balance of £8,000 be subject to capital gains?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the points the Deputy is making.  Any items which are called wasting assets are exempt except where such assets are solely for the purpose of a trade or profession.  Farming could be a trade or profession so some of the items described by the Deputy would not be exempted by virtue of section 18 (2). The probability of capital gains on the disposal of many of these items is not great.  Their value would diminish rather than increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Subparagraph (6) does not appear to exclude any item whether or not it forms the basis for chargeable gains.  It is merely whether it is a tangible, moveable property exceeding £2,000.  On the face of it that is what it seems to say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it says but I suppose the question was whether an auctioneer would be required to give the information and the answer is yes.  If it is used in the course of a trade or profession the probability is that it will come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners because it will appear in the ordinary business accounts for such purchases and sales.</P>

      <P>As far as I know Deputy Connolly was trying to point out what were the transactions in respect of which returns would have to be made under subparagraph (6). Would the Minister confirm that the position is that returns would have to be made under subparagraph (6) in respect of any tangible moveable property, the amount or value of which in the hands of the recipient exceeds £2,000, whether it is a wasting asset or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners will only know this on a new transaction.  If those items come up in a clearance sale will they come under capital gains, because this will not come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners unless they see any advertisement or some of them are at the particular sale to know that one of those items has been disposed of for over £2,000?  I do not know what item of farm machinery one could buy today for £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those engaged in farming are going through a very difficult period and there are very high costs involved. Most farm machinery is purchased through HP or the banks.  The interest rates on HP range from 18 per cent to 22 per cent.  A farmer or a builder purchasing machinery will then be liable for high costs, such as bank interest on a loan.  Will such a person be caught for capital gains tax?  I would like the Minister to put something into this paragraph excluding certain items such as farm machinery and building equipment of all types.  I feel it can be done but as <Col N="1774" /> I see the wording it can mean any item or article.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to generalise about this situation because many of the people to whom Deputy Connolly referred will be making returns for income tax purposes and the machinery which he is concerned with here will be passing through their income tax accounts any way. They cannot be getting allowances on machinery for income tax purposes and then be given concessions also in relation to the same machinery for capital gains tax purposes.  The number of cases where any difficulty will be caused will be few and far between. The reality is that any piece of such machinery, if kept for a period, is unlikely to produce a gain at the time it is ultimately sold because it is a wasting asset and its sale value is declining because of its declining age and the fact that it has been used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that these people will be making a return for income tax but I should like to point out that as far as the farming community are concerned it will only apply to those with a valuation in excess of £100.  The farmer with a valuation less than that will not be making a return unless he has other employment.  I am not happy with the wording.  As far as the farmers and rural business people are concerned this provision gives the Revenue Commissioners great scope. The Minister, apparently, is unable to say whether these people will have to pay capital gains tax; he said they may and they may not.  I should like to see this spelt out in greater detail so that we will know who has to pay capital gains tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The liability is dealt with in other parts of the Bill.  All we are dealing with here is the information which an auctioneer may be required to furnish: the question of liability has to be determined separately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Subparagraph (6) of paragraph 4 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An auctioneer, and any person <Col N="1775" /> carrying on a trade of dealing in any description of tangible movable property, or of acting as an agent or intermediary in dealings in any description of tangible movable property, may be required to make a return giving particulars of any transactions effected by or through him in which any asset which is tangible movable property is disposed of for a consideration the amount or value of which, in the hands of the recipient, exceeds two thousand pounds.</P>
    <P>In my view it is this paragraph that really counts because the Revenue Commissioners can quote it.  This gives them great power.  They can decide for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that the only people who can decide liability to tax are the Revenue Commissioners.  We could not have a situation in which the individual auctioneer would be left to determine whether a gain made on disposal of an asset was taxable or not.  That would be putting the auctioneer and his customers in an invidious situation. The mere disclosure of information does not mean that a person becomes liable to tax.  That is a matter that has to be separately assessed looking at each individual taxpayer's position. The only thing the auctioneer can know is whether or not the consideration for a particular asset exceeded £2,000.</P>

On a JCB, which costs in the region of £8,000, the depreciation after one year is around £2,000.  Most of these are purchased through the banks or through hire purchase companies.  Can the Minister give me an assurance, in view of the depreciation, that such items would not be liable to capital gains tax?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is reopening a discussion on many sections of the Bill that have already been passed.  All we are dealing with now is <Col N="1776" /> the question of the information to be furnished by an auctioneer.  The only information which an auctioneer can have and which we could reasonably expect him to give would be particulars of transactions involving items with a value in excess of £2,000.  The question of liability of individual people has to be separately looked at, taking many matters into consideration.  All of these are outside the knowledge of an auctioneer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 4, which relates to returns, is a further provision enabling the Revenue Commissioners to get the information which they require.  That paragraph cannot be read alone; it has to be taken in conjunction with subparagraph (3) of paragraph 3 which we have already discussed.  The effect of that is to make the powers conferred by paragraph 4 more extensive than appears on the face of that paragraph.  To prove that I would have to repeat all the arguments put forward on paragraph 3.  I refer the Minister to those arguments. That is a very important qualification because there is very little in paragraph 4 that is not covered by a general extension of the income tax procedures and methods to capital gains contained in paragraph 176 of the Income Tax Act which the Minister deliberately excluded by amendment.</P>

    <P>Therefore by means of subparagraph (3) the powers conveyed in paragraph 4 are wider than they appear on the face of it.  As I say, it is difficult to see why the mere extension of paragraph 176 of the Income Tax Act would not affect practically everything that is in the paragraph.  However, as <Col N="1777" /> I pointed out last night, paragraph 176 is very carefully restricted as to the class of persons from whom information can be demanded by notice and the type of person liable to respond to that notice, and it is also much more limited in respect of the subject matter of the notice, that is, the property that is involved.  The Minister, unless I misunderstood him, said earlier this morning that this paragraph had nothing to do with banks or information supplied by banks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said bank accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, bank accounts or banks.  On the face of it, the Minister is right.  There is not a word about banks, but if you take the particular provisions of the paragraph you will see it captures the banks at nearly every point.  Take, for instance, subparagraph (1) of paragraph 4 which reads:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of obtaining particulars of chargeable gains, an inspector may by notice in writing require a return under any of the provisions of this paragraph.</P>
      <P>Subparagraph (2) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>An issuing house or other person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Then it goes on:</P>
      <P>. . . notice requiring the return, giving particulars of the persons to or with whom the shares or securities are issued, allotted or placed, and the number or amount of the shares or securities so obtained by them respectively.</P>
      <P>Banks are very often involved in these transactions.  Therefore, in so far as this subparagraph (2) (a) requires the furnishing of information, the phrase &ldquo;other person&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Carrying on a business of effecting public issues of shares and securities&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but if the Minister makes this point, I immediately move to subparagraph (3) which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) A person not carrying on such a business may be required to make a return as regards any such issue or placing effected by that person <Col N="1778" /> and specified in the notice, giving particulars of the persons to or with whom the shares or securities are issued, allotted, or placed and the number or amount of the shares or securities so obtained by them respectively.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is going to stand on the point that &ldquo;other person&rdquo; in paragraph (2) (a) is qualified by the phrase &ldquo;carrying on a business of effecting public issues of shares,&rdquo; then he cannot escape the consequences of subparagraph (3) which especially captures a person not carrying on such a business.  Subparagraph (4) deals with the stock exchange, but paragraph (5) reads:</P>
    <P>A person (other than a member of a stock exchange in the State) who acts as an agent in the State in transactions in shares or securities may be required to make a return giving particulars of any such transactions effected by him in the period specified in the notice and giving particulars of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the parties to the transactions,</P>
    <P>(b)  the number or amount of the shares or securities dealt with in the respective transactions, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the amount or value of the consideration.</P>
    <P>If that does not apply to a bank I should like to be explicitly referred to where it says it does not.  Subparagraph (6) reads:</P>
    <P>An auctioneer, and any person carrying on a trade of dealing in any description of tangible moveable property, or of acting as an agent or intermediary in dealings in any description of tangible moveable property, may be required to make a return giving particulars of any transactions effected by or through him.</P>
    <P>Surely the type of transaction that Deputy Connolly was talking about is often effected by or through a bank. Therefore it is very hard to escape the conclusion that subparagraph (6) captures a bank also.  On the face of it, in spite of what the Minister has said, this paragraph is wide enough <Col N="1779" /> to require a bank to give particulars in regard to any client of the matter specified here in this paragraph. Taking that paragraph standing on its own as a positive enactment, that power is certainly conveyed.  It is arguable in a sense that it is not&mdash; and I concede this&mdash;as sweeping or as objectionable as subparagraph (3).  It is on all fours with paragraph 176 of the Income Tax Act that was excluded. It would seem, on the face of it, to qualify the subject matter, but it is definitely an extension to any other person.  Not only does it capture banks but it captures any other person in not quite as general a class as in subparagraph (3).  Here again I would point to what is another case of an extension of power in the Schedule and it is objectionable from a legal point of view.</P>
    <P>My final comment on interpretation is that while paragraph 3 stands as it is, with its impact on paragraph 4, it must leave banks or any person or institution wide open to any enquiry from the Revenue Commissioners about their accounts or affairs.  I think no other legal conclusion can be drawn from this.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that we should realise what we are doing; I am not arguing merits at this stage, but what I am trying to emphasise&mdash;as I had been last night and leaving other arguments to my colleagues, because this aspect of the matter is vitally important&mdash;is that in contemplation of law and in the enactment of it, this is what we are doing.  I am asking that we realise what we are doing.  I am not expressing views on merits as to the intention but I am, when I use the word &ldquo;objectionable&rdquo;, expressing comments on the form in which we are making these provisions.  I am dealing with the matter purely on a legal interpretation basis and I want the House to realise what we are doing in the combination of these two paragraphs and I want to keep that as a separate issue from the merits. Let us have no smokescreens about the nature of schedules or the desirability of what we are doing.  These <Col N="1780" /> are separate matters that can be debated; let us focus on what we are doing whatever may be the reason or the social or economic consequences.</P>
    <P>My submission is that as this schedule stands the confidentiality of advisers, bankers or brokers is now a matter for the arbitrary discretion of the Revenue Commissioners if we pass this Bill.  I am stating that as a matter of law.  I repeat it because I mean it to be a responsible statement: as the schedule stands with particular reference to paragraphs 3 and 4, the confidentiality of bankers, brokers, lawyers or other agents&mdash;indeed, I could even go further on subparagraph (3)&mdash;is a matter for the arbitrary discretion of the Revenue Commissioners as between&mdash;let me qualify it clearly&mdash;the Revenue Commissioners and the banker, broker, lawyer&mdash;or other agent or person, if we fall back on subparagraph (3) of paragraph 3.</P>
    <P>I want to advert to that legal fact and not to any smokescreens as to why the Revenue Commissioners must have this power in the nature of a schedule.  We are dealing with what is in the Bill and in the schedule as it stands.  My objection is that it should be done in this way.  I leave over the question of what power should be given and how it should be given for another argument.</P>
    <P>Having said that and, I hope, made the point clear, let me come to the merits as a totally distinct argument. I am much more in agreement with the Minister here.  First, one of my big objections to the form in which this is done is that it attracts opprobrium and unfair comment and suspicion where the Revenue Commissioners are concerned.  That is a pity. As I have often said I am prepared, perhaps more than others in the House, to grant the Revenue Commissioners powers and discretion to deal with the problems of evasion and generally to carry out their functions. I am pretty certain their will be no abuse in that regard.  We should realise that the Revenue Commissioners are somewhat analogous to the custodians of law and order in the community.  It is not desirable <Col N="1781" /> that their every action should be scrutinised in detail provided there are general limitations and general procedures are observed.</P>
    <P>I recognise with the Minister the need for giving powers to the Revenue Commissioners and I do not wish to withhold them.  Further, I am confident they will not be abused in the ordinary way.  Therefore, I invite the Minister to effect them in a more frank way than is attempted in this schedule.  If it has to be done, why should we be afraid of saying what we are doing?  If we are&mdash;as we are&mdash; giving these powers we should concentrate on the counterbalances that may be necessary rather than on spancelling the Revenue Commissioners in granting these powers.</P>
    <P>One thing that disturbs me in this connection is that without legislation of this nature you will develop a large administration, a large body of people dealing with this matter and to maintain confidentiality of individuals will become a mechanical problem.  This is not specific to the Revenue Commissioners; it is happening all over our economy.  Fifty years ago when trading was very competitive the affairs of individuals and firms were fairly strictly confidential and that confidentiality was exploited for the purposes of competition.  Now, whether it is under the Companies Acts or under procedures which relate to groups of companies and so on, there are very large staffs dealing with confidential information.</P>
    <P>Most people have come to the conclusion that confidentiality in the old sense is something of the past. All businessmen and, in particular, every big enterprise, must accept that details of their affairs cannot be kept totally secret.  This is to the detriment of competition and to the securing of efficiency but it is part of the social scene.  Therefore, I see no reason for singling out the Revenue Commissioners as ogres in this but one must realise that in regard to expanding legislation of this nature, the Revenue organisation will expand and that in proportion to that expansion the difficulty of maintaining security of confidential information will become greater.  In saying that I am not casting <Col N="1782" /> aspersions on anyone.  The problem is the same for any bank or any big firm. It is a general feature of our modern life.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try to get a general provision, a provision which, on the face of it, may be shocking, but which, if it is necessary must be included.  I find the method applied in this Schedule to be very disturbing. It would be well for people to realise what is the legal content of this legislation and how much further we are going than in previous legislation.  On the other hand, I agree with the Minister that section 176 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 which was the cause of a great furore and in respect of which I understand representations have been made to the Minister, has not produced any scandals.  It is a pity that our social development is such that the individual or legitimate groups of individuals can no longer have personal security in regard to intimate and confidential information.  That is the best I can say by way of trying to put this paragraph into perspective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that no information could be collected as a result of the operation of these paragraphs which should not be furnished by taxpayers in any event.  The mere fact of creating a liability may require further disclosure.  Assets will have to be declared as well as income but it is a checking process that information furnished is correct.</P>

      <P>It is very important also that nobody should misunderstand this paragraph.  It is confined to obtaining information from people who issue shares.  Subparagraph (2) (a) refers to an issuing house or other person carrying on a business of effecting public issues and who may be required to make a return of all such public issues.</P>

      <P>Subparagraph (3) says that a person not carrying on such a business may be required to <Col N="1783" /> make a return as regards any such issue or placing effected by that person. Subparagraph (4) says that a member of a stock exchange in the State may be required to make a return giving particulars of any transaction effected by him while subparagraph (5) refers to a person who acts as an agent in the State in transactions in shares or securities being required to return the particulars of any such transactions. It is related to what the person is engaged in and is concerned with the issue of shares.  Subparagraph (6) imposes an obligation on auctioneers or any person dealing in tangible moveable property exceeding £2,000 in value to return the particulars of any such dealings.  It does not in any way affect bank accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not refer to bank accounts.  I said that in the context of paragraph 3 it goes that far.  It covers banks.  If the Minister wishes to make a nice distinction between information from a bank about one's account and about one's transactions he may do so but this does not alter the fact that under this paragraph a bank is liable to make certain returns for likely transactions with which it would be associated.  To extend it to bank accounts would mean having to rely on subparagraph (3) of paragraph 3. I shall not pursue it too deeply as a legal argument but the Minister should not try to gloss over it.  All of this may be very necessary but I do not like the way in which it is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to paragraph 6.  That is another matter and we will come to it in a moment.  On the whole question of requiring information the point has now been reached where there is practically no limit placed on the Revenue Commissioners as to the inquiries they can make from any person in regard to any financial transaction and to which any person may be liable legally to respond.  The desirability or necessity of such a sweeping conferring of powers is another matter.  From experience and having regard to the problem of tax avoidance I would be prepared to trust <Col N="1784" /> the Revenue Commissioners but what I am cavilling at is the manner in which the powers are being given, a way which seems to have a double disadvantage and also a certain furtiveness that is highly undesirable and most unfair to the Revenue Commissioners in particular and to the whole of the State administration generally.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is a necessary provision regarding liability for capital gains but has the Minister not covered that in the substantive part of the Bill?  In other words, is this paragraph really necessary?</P>
      <P>Elsewhere in the Bill the Minister has covered the question of the avoidance of the incidence of capital gains tax by the device of trusts and trustees.  If he has done that and if he has the general powers for obtaining information which he has otherwise in the Bill, is that paragraph altogether necessary?</P>

Is this paragraph necessary having regard to the sweeping powers of obtaining information already provided in the earlier part of the Schedule and also having regard to the substantive provisions in the body of the Bill where both agents and trustees are amply covered for cases where the agency or the trusteeship could be used as an avoidance or an evasion mechanism?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to paragraph 6 there are two points I want to put to the Minister.  In the second line there is a reference to a party to a settlement:</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners may by notice in writing require any person being a party to a settlement . . .</P>
      <P>I take it that the word &ldquo;party&rdquo; in relation to a settlement does not include a beneficiary under a settlement who may not be an actual party, say, signing the document which produces the settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be my understanding of it.  A beneficiary need not be a party.  It would be the settlor or the trustee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&mdash;to furnish them within such time as they may direct not being less than 28 days with such particulars as they think necessary for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is somewhat reminiscent of other matters I have disputed with the Minister on other Bills and I want to suggest to him that he might consider deleting the words &ldquo;as they think necessary&rdquo; and replacing them with something like &ldquo;such particulars relating to the settlement as are reasonably required for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;.  First, the particulars should clearly be related to the settlement <Col N="1786" /> and secondly &ldquo;as are reasonably required&rdquo; is not unreasonable.  I know the Minister will argue that, although not explicitly stated, the Revenue Commissioners are obliged to act reasonably but I suggest that the insertion of the words &ldquo;as are reasonably required&rdquo; connotes a slightly more strict interpretation than would be implied by any general obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to act reasonably.  Therefore, I suggest that the Minister should delete the words &ldquo;as they think necessary&rdquo; and substitute something on the lines of &ldquo;relating to the settlement as are reasonably required&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Colley on this but for a slightly different reason.  Deputy Colley's suggested amendment would get over the objection I see in this and which I am sure the Minister does not intend but which is an accident of drafting.  The Revenue Commissioners may by notice require any person being a party to a settlement to furnish information.  The mere fact of being a party to a settlement brings him within the terms of this paragraph.  Suppose that Deputy Fitzpatrick is a party to a settlement, the Revenue Commissioners can under this section require him to furnish within 28 days such particulars as they think necessary for the purposes of the Act.  The particulars that they might be interested in and think necessary for the purposes of the Act might be a transaction by somebody who had nothing to do with the settlement, somebody who had sold Deputy Connolly a combine harvester. The Revenue Commissioners could require Deputy Fitzpatrick merely from the fact of his being a party to a settlement to supply the information about the combine harvester.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We argued on this year's Finance Bill the meaning of the words &ldquo;think necessary&rdquo;.  I quoted several judgments which showed that the courts interpret these words &ldquo;think necessary&rdquo; as conferring on the Revenue Commissioners a power to come to a decision that something which they require to be done is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the Act and it is not necessary to put in the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; in order to impose on the Revenue Commissioners the obligation to act reasonably. The courts consider that that obligation is there and they have held in several cases that where the Revenue Commissioners are given power to make a judgment they must be reasonable in making that judgment and if they seek information which they consider to be necessary it must be on the face of it and substantially be reasonable and they may not obtain any information which is unreasonable.</P>
      <P>Quite clearly the particulars sought here are particulars of a settlement and nothing else, but in order not to allow even the debating point to be made I will be disposed to bring in an amendment on Report Stage to provide that the particulars sought will be particulars of or related to the settlement.</P>

I would ask the Minister if it would not be more appropriate to provide there for a person &ldquo;who is interested beneficially in settled property&rdquo; because it seems to me that the word &ldquo;interested&rdquo; on its own is open to a very wide interpretation and could bring in people who would really have no knowledge or virtually no knowledge of the particular property.  It is so wide as to lead to argument as to what is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to reopen this argument but I want to reiterate my belief that the degree of reasonableness imposed on the Revenue Commissioners under this general edict of the courts, if I might put it that way, is not as great as is imposed by the use of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; or &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; specifically in each provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to refer the Minister to paragraph 9 which provides that the Revenue Commissioners may make regulations for quite a number of items which are set out here.  The first question I want to put to the Minister is <Col N="1790" /> this: are the various matters which are provided for here in respect of which regulations may be made not laid down, for instance in some time limit which is actually in the Bill earlier, or in the case of the other items are such matters not laid down in regulations already made in regard to income tax? If so, why not apply them with necessary modifications instead of setting out all of this in paragraph 9?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One could not confidently say that all the provisions of the income tax code are adequate to cover all the situations which will arise in the administration of the capital gains code.  There are a number of different factors.  Under income tax an assessment usually affects only one person who is the person in receipt of an income but under the capital gains code an assessment may affect two people, the person disposing and the person acquiring.  Clearly there has to be a different system in operation under the capital gains code.  Again, if the holdings of unquoted shares have to be valued, the valuation fixed on appeal will affect other holders of shares of the same class so that a multitude of complexities would arise which we would not be able to solve by a simple application of the income tax code no matter how much we modified the code.</P>
      <P>The paragraph requires that any regulations made by the Revenue Commissioners must be laid before Dáil Éireann.  I think that is sufficient protection to ensure that any regulations which are made by the Revenue Commissioners will be scrutinised by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a comment on paragraph 9 (1) (e).  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e) authorising an inspector or other officer of the Revenue Commissioners, notwithstanding the obligation as to secrecy imposed by the Income Tax Acts or any other Act, to disclose to a person entitled to appear on such an appeal the market value of an asset as determined by an assessment or decision on a claim, or to disclose <Col N="1791" /> to a person whose liability to tax may be affected by the determination of the market value of an asset on a particular date, or an apportionment or any other matter, any decision on the matter made by an inspector or other officer of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is a corresponding provision in the Income Tax Acts?  Is there a corresponding provision in the Income Tax Acts enabling the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations which, in effect, can overcome the obligation as to secrecy imposed by the Income Tax Act or any other Act?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. As I mentioned earlier, under the Income Tax Acts one person is concerned, the person whose income is being charged, but the difference here is that more than one person is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Here again is, if I may say, buried in a Schedule&mdash; again I am objecting to the way things are being done, not so much what is being done, or the necessity for it, but the way it is being done&mdash;under a power to make regulations, a provision that in effect completely nullifies potentially the provisions in the Income Tax Acts or any other Act in regard to obligations as to secrecy. Under this paragraph a mere regulation made by the Revenue Commissioners can over-ride the obligation to secrecy imposed by the Income Tax Acts or any other Act; in other words, it can be construed as conveying to an agency outside this House power to over-ride provisions which this House specifically made to safeguard what I might call rights of privacy.  That in cold legal fact is what this does.</P>
      <P>Again, let me bring home the point: I am making this as a point of what the legal content of the Bill is, quite apart from intention, from desirability, from necessity or from any justification or, indeed, objection to what is being done.  I merely want to expose what is being done and this is precisely what is being done in paragraph 1 (e) of this Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1792" /> This means, in effect, that <i>pro tanto</i> the Revenue Commissioners, an inspector of taxes or any Revenue officials may disclose to any person either the market value of an asset&mdash;remember, an asset under section 7 includes a very wide class of property, practically all property&mdash;as determined by an assessment or decision on a claim, or disclose to another person the market value of an asset on a particular date, or an apportionment, or any other matter, any decision on the matter, made by an inspector of taxes or an official of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>May I pose a question to the Deputy?  Suppose the Deputy and I were joint owners of a property and the inspector had dealt with the Deputy's case and my case is up on appeal, the same inspector could, without that section, claim privilege to my cross-examination to find out how he assessed the value of the property and I could not get him because that section was not there.  That is the protection of the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>One moment, if the Deputy will bear with me.  I take the Deputy's point and he is anticipating me.  I want to separate two things here.  What is the complete legal content of this provision?  The merits, the reasons, the necessity is a different matter with which I shall deal in a moment.  It may be necessary, but I do not like the idea of delegating to any agency the power to abrogate a statutory provision of such importance which could conceivably&mdash;although in the case of the Revenue Commissioners most improbably&mdash;be used and construed as an invasion of privacy.  I shall come back to the Deputy's point in a moment.  I do not want to be distracted from the point I am making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is objectionable in principle to delegate power, by making a regulation, to any agency outside this House, even the Government themselves, to abrogate and over-ride a statutory provision of this sort.  That is the point I want to make.  In other words, the content of that provision is as wide as I have said it is.  It is objectionable from the point of view of this House <Col N="1793" /> to enact a provision of this nature which so over-rides an enactment of this House.  It is undesirable to delegate in this way.  If this particular provision is necessary, it should have been included as a section in the Bill; it is so wide, it should have been substantively in the Bill.  Quite apart from the Revenue Commissioners, on a general principle I object to the delegation.</P>
    <P>I now wish to deal with Deputy Esmonde's and the Minister's point.  Of course, I understand the dilemma of the Minister and of the Revenue Commissioners here and we shall have to provide for it.  I shall take a very simple case.  I do not have to go as far as Deputy Esmonde went.  Let us suppose the matter had to be an appeal before a judge, the Revenue Commissioners would have to brief their counsel and solicitor with the facts. Something like this might be required for that very simple case itself.  It might be required to enable evidence to be given, or it might be required for them to check on evidence.  Supossing that I were to give a valuation and there was any question of the valuation, I take the Deputy's point on that as to the desirability or the necessity for some such provision.  However, that does not take away from the point I am making here and I should like the Minister to look at it from that point of view.</P>
    <P>The Bill as a whole is a peculiar mixture of handing over everything, all discretion and all power, to the Revenue Commissioners on the one hand and on the other of providing very specific limitations of powers, duties and responsibilities.  It is natural enough when it is approached this way. Apart from the objections I have raised on the paragraph I want it to be understood what it is actually doing.  The merits of what is intended to be done are a different matter from which I do not dissent.  I cannot put the matter much more clearly than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are arguing once again about the most suitable location for these provisions.  I would rely on what Deputy de Valera argued here this morning, that is that the Schedules are an essential part of the Act itself, so it <Col N="1794" /> is a matter of indifference, from the point of view of their strength, their impact and their authority, whether they are in the Act or in the Schedule.  It is necessary to provide that the Revenue Commissioners should have what Deputy de Valera has on many occasions argued in favour of, some flexibility.  If we tried to cover every possible situation which may arise in capital gains tax in the statutes instead of dealing with it by regulation we could be here until the year 1980 and we would not have a workable code at the end of it.</P>
      <P>It is much better to leave these to regulation-making machinery and then, of course, to the scrutiny which Dáil Éireann will be entitled to apply to any regulations which the Commissioners may make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Income Tax Acts impose very solemn obligations of secrecy on people who operate the Acts on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners.  This relieving section is very confined, because the information may only be given to a person whose liability to tax may be affected by the determination of the market value of an asset on a particular date, an apportionment on any other matter.  If we did not get that power then many people would be jeopardised by hearings before Commissioners, from which they would be excluded, although they would be bound by the findings of those tribunals.  It is clearly in the interests of all people who have a common interest in particular assets that they should be given an opportunity of expressing their points of view on assessments and determinations. Regulations which will confer authority on inspectors within that very confined area will ensure that the people who have such a vital interest are given opportunity to protect that interest.  If Deputy de Valera or any other Deputies can suggest some other way in which they can communicate this information without this modification of the secrecy obligation I would like to know it.  I do not think it can be done, but it is a modification which is being made in such a way as to ensure that persons with a common interest are given a full hearing before <Col N="1795" /> they are bound by decisions affecting any one of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the intention and as I have said I am not opposing it.  I see the necessity for what the Minister intends to do but I am objecting to the way that it is being done.  I am objecting in principle to the delegation of power to do this in a general way, as is done here under the simple power to give out regulations.  Earlier I made a general suggestion that would meet this but it will not be practicable for this Bill to enact this as a substantive provision in the Bill.  At this stage it would be just to introduce a purple patch in an already very variegated garment.  I nevertheless, think that we should appreciate what we are doing.  I want, if only for future purposes, to record an objection to approaching such a matter that way on the principles that I have tried to outline.  I will leave the matter with this.</P>
      <P>The way the whole Bill and as far as we have got in it now is drafted either the provision would have to be dropped or such a drastic readjustment would have to be made, like the other suggestion I made last night, that it might not be practicable at this stage.  If the Revenue Commissioners and their officers were not the responsible and trustworthy organisation they are and have been, I would strenuously, and as strongly as I possibly could, oppose this paragraph in the schedule.  The Minister attempted to turn my arguments about the schedule back on me.  That only reinforces my point.  It is a substantive enactment and it fully delegates the powers of the Oireachtas to the extent of overriding, in the case mentioned, the obligations of secrecy.  As I have said it is a matter of the hard case making bad law.</P>

      <P>Regulations under this paragraph may contain supplemental and incidental provisions as appear to the Revenue Commissioners to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> I imagine the Minister is not surprised to hear I am not entirely happy with that wording.  I would suggest something on the lines instead of &ldquo;as appear to the Revenue Commissioners to be necessary&rdquo;, as may be necessary for the implementation of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is, as I mentioned earlier this year to the Deputy, that if one were to start introducing words of that kind into this legislation the argument would probably be made some time <i>in futuro</i> that their absence from other legislation meant that people did not have to act reasonably because the word reasonable did not appear.  That would be the position and I would not like to have to undertake the task of bringing in a Bill to cover all cases where the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; appeared in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not even use the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; on this occasion. I will repeat what I said.  It should read:</P>
      <P>Regulations under this paragraph may contain such supplemental and incidental provisions as may be necessary for the implementation of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Supplemental and incidental provisions as appear to the Revenue Commissioners to be necessary&rdquo; seems to me, no matter how restricted the courts may interpret it, to mean something different from &ldquo;as may be necessary for the implementation of this Act&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though it is not part of the Act paragraph 9 is one of those things which creates an impression which prompts people to make some of the remarks made about the Act.  &ldquo;Regulation with respect to appeals&rdquo;, is the heading of paragraph 9.  Paragraph (e) of subparagraph (1) of paragraph 9 does not seem to be restricted to appeals. Paragraph 2 does not confine itself to appeals. Therefore, the power to make regulations is not confined to regulations with respect to appeals. Why has that to be inserted?  It seems the same as the device that was used in the Finance Act of labelling a section, Abolition of Death Duties, the wording of which had no legal effect; it was a marginal note, but it conveyed an impression.  If the words &ldquo;<i>et cetera</i>&rdquo; are inserted after &ldquo;appeals&rdquo; it will appear more honest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>At this point of the Schedule we leave the question of returns and a general comment which I wish to make would appear to be appropriate at this point.  This legislation will entail a lot of form-filling, making of returns and paper communications.  As a result of this we will have a substantial operation <Col N="1799" /> in bureaucratic machinery.  This will place a heavy burden on the Revenue Commissioners in their assessments and their collection.  The opportunities for mistakes and inadvertent breaches of secrecy will be multiplied.  The Revenue Commissioners cannot be blamed if a confidential document, with secret information pertaining to somebody, arrives at somebody else's address through a mistake of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. This is not an uncommon occurrence nowadays.  The effect is that the practical opportunities for the inadvertent disclosure of confidential information relating to individual persons or bodies corporate, will be multiplied extensively here.</P>
      <P>The Minister should look quickly at the organisation of this work.  It will be totally unfair to throw this at the Revenue Commissioners and say: &ldquo;swim&rdquo;.  They are already overburdened in certain areas.  Their collecting mechanisms for income tax are overburdened.  There is also the question of arrears of procedures, which I have had occasion to have information about while a member of a committee of this House.  I may not be popular, and as a citizen and in certain other capacities I would not welcome the development at all, when I say it may be a necessity.  The same type of situation developed rather rapidly under the Income Tax Acts some years ago. A situation was developing where it became impossible for the Revenue Commissioners to deal with this.  The problem was solved by the PAYE scheme.  The PAYE scheme is a method by which, onerous as the duties are&mdash;and the Minister should take it into account when taxing these people who are doing the work for him but it is necessary that they should&mdash;the individual employer acts as an agent or officer for the Revenue Commissioners and the Collector as well, and the Revenue Commissioners' own individual task is confined to manageable proportions and to supervision. This scheme is effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me this capital gains Bill is so wide in scope and the returns that will be needed to implement it <Col N="1800" /> equitably as provided for in this Schedule will be such that it may be necessary to mobilise the appropriate agencies in a co-operative spirit with the Revenue Commissioners.  I may appear to some extent to be contradicting what I said on paragraph 4, but as I pointed out, I was primarily interested in what that paragraph was actually doing, and rather anxious to draw the veil aside for people who were too modest about what they were doing in the Bill, but it may be necessary for the Minister to consider this.</P>
    <P>Therefore before we leave this I would like the Minister to say, perhaps on the Fifth Stage, what the prospects for administration are and what provision is being made, on the one hand, to enable the Revenue Commissioners effectively to administer this Act, and, on the other hand, how the rights and particularly the privacy of the taxpayer can be safeguarded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated already in relation to certain amendments which the Minister moved to paragraph 11, not only considerable misgivings but, subject to what the Minister may have to say, total opposition to the provisions of paragraph 11, which basically provides that in the case of a sale of certain assets by a non-resident, the purchaser is, under this paragraph, obliged to deduct from the purchase money and pay to the Revenue Commissioners capital gains tax on one half of the purchase money.  The object of this, of course, is clear and I think in many senses wrong.  That is not what I am opposed to.  What I am opposed to is the imposition which is involved in this paragraph on citizens here, an imposition which is totally impossible of discharge in a number of circumstances, and would render the whole paragraph unworkable.</P>
      <P>However, before I develop that, there is one matter I would like to be clear on&mdash;the assets referred to are those mentioned in subsections (2) and (6) of section 4.  There is a proviso to section 4, in subsection (2), which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1801" /> Provided that this subsection shall not apply to a person who, by virtue of the provisions of Part XXII of the Income Tax Act, 1967 (double taxation agreement) is exempt from income tax chargeable for the year of assessment.</P>
    <P>That seems to mean that a person who is not liable for income tax under that provision is not liable for capital gains tax either in respect of the assets specified in the subsection. What I want to know from the Minister is, in the event of a sale of assets, as mentioned in this paragraph, by a person coming under that proviso, does the obligation to make the deduction apply or does it not?</P>

      <P>Nobody is riding roughshod, least of all the Minister for Finance.  All I am ensuring is that persons who are non-residents will pay the same amount as persons who are resident.  We have to ensure that consideration for an asset does not pass out of the country beyond our control in such a way as would make it very easy for non-residents to avoid paying their fair share of tax.  What are we doing?  We are providing that a purchaser will deduct 26 per cent from half of the consideration and pay it over to the Revenue Commissioners, in the absence of a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners produced by <Col N="1802" /> the vendor to the purchaser to show that the vendor has paid his tax and that therefore the purchaser is freed from the obligation to make the deduction from the purchase money towards the tax.  I would like to give a few examples to illustrate that there is no unfairness in what we are proposing. Before I give the example I would like to point out that it is under existing law.  Estate duty had to be paid on all property left by a deceased person before even a grant of probate issues and before the assets could be handled by the next-of-kin.</P>

      <P>I will give some examples now to show how this section will operate.  Let us visualise a sale with a consideration of £200,000.  A consideration of that size would represent a majority of sales.  Take £200,000 and 50 per cent of that is £100,000. Therefore the tax to be retained by the purchaser pending evidence that the vendor's capital gains tax has been paid would be £26,000.</P>
      <P>If the vendor had bought the asset for £50,000 he would have a gain of £150,000; the tax payable by the vendor on such a gain would be £39,000.  Therefore, if the purchaser deducts only £26,000 as provided for in the paragraph, the Revenue would still be at risk for another £13,000. So, even this precaution we have provided here, does not fully guarantee that the full tax will be paid.</P>

The tax on such a case payable by the vendor would be £26,000 which would be the amount of the deduction the purchaser is required to make.</P>
      <P>Let us take a third example where the sale is for £200,000 and the original cost £150,000.  There would be a gain of £50,000 which would carry a tax liability of £13,000.  In such a case the purchaser had deducted the £26,000 and paid it over to the Revenue Commissioners; the vendor on application would obtain a refund of the £13,000 from the Revenue Commissioners.  If the vendor does not wish to await receipt of the money from the Revenue Commissioners but wants it direct from the purchaser, all he has to do, when he has negotiated his sale of property, is to notify the Revenue Commissioners giving them the relevant information whereupon the Revenue Commissioners will immediately assess the liability and, if tax is payable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The argument was advanced that the person might then have to advance tax before benefits were received.  I should like to preface my remarks by pointing out what happened under the old estate duty code.  Massive sums had to be put forward from banks in order to pay estate duty before people could even begin to handle the assets and they had to realise them later in order to pay off the banks.  The sums involved were very much greater than anything which is likely to arise under the capital gains tax code.  We are simply providing the minimum insurance for the State.  We must do this if we have any sense of equity; we must ensure that non-residents cannot escape a liability which is imposed on residents.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated, the objection that I have to this paragraph has nothing to do with what the Minister has been talking about. It has to do with the obligation being imposed on the Irish citizen who is dealing with a non-resident.  If one considers the implications of this paragraph a most extraordinary thing is being provided because, effectively, it is saying that in the case of the sale of land, minerals and certain rights on the Continental Shelf by persons who are non-resident in the State and where the consideration exceeds £50,000, the purchaser is obliged to make this deduction which the Minister has been talking about.</P>
      <P>It is worth looking at the provision which deals with this.  It says in subparagraph (2):</P>
      <P>Upon payment of the consideration by or on behalf of a person acquiring an asset on a disposal falling within subparagraph (1), being a payment, directly or indirectly, to a person who is not ordinarily resident in the State, the person by or through whom any such payment is made shall deduct thereout a sum representing an amount of capital gains tax on one-half of the said payment at the rate of such tax in force at the time the payment is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot read this provision as doing anything other than imposing an obligation, not only on the purchaser, but on his solicitor or, indeed, on a bank or any agent of the purchaser <Col N="1806" /> to whom the moneys might be paid; an obligation to make this deduction even though the bank, the agent or whoever is concerned might have no knowledge whatever as to the source of the funds or the destination of the funds; or, indeed, no knowledge as to the fact that the transaction was in any way connected with someone who was not a resident in the State.</P>
    <P>This obligation which is imposed here in this way is an absolutely enormous extension of the obligations of solicitors or, indeed, any other agents.  It is likely to create substantial dangers to these people because, in many cases, it will be quite impossible to know whether or not the money will ultimately be received, directly or indirectly, as the subparagraph says, by a person who is not ordinarily resident in the State.  This use of the word &ldquo;indirectly&rdquo; makes it totally impossible to know whether any payment would ultimately wind up with a person not ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that the object he has in mind is, as I said earlier, quite commendable; the method by which it is proposed to do it, as far as the person who is liable for the capital gains tax is concerned, may have considerable justification but none of that is of any use at all if, first of all, it is imposing impossible obligations on Irish citizens, and I would seriously suggest unworkable obligations and, secondly, any examination of what is proposed here in the light of what really is going to happen shows that this is a totally unworkable proposition.  As such to put it forward and maintain that it is going to work in order to collect capital gains tax from non-residents is just bringing the law into disrepute when it is so clearly unworkable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Members are aware, the Minister <Col N="1807" /> for Finance when announcing increased betting charges in his budget speech in January last explained that this would entail an amendment of the Racing Board and Racecourses Act, 1945.  The present Bill will enable the Racing Board to charge a maximum levy of 10 per cent on course bets with bookmakers: the actual levy chargeable will as up to now be subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance.  I understand that it is the Racing Board's intention only to increase the levy by 1 per cent.  This information is being conveyed to representatives of the bookmakers' organisations.  The Bill also provides for an appeal committee to which bookmakers may appeal from decisions of the Racing Board to refuse, suspend or revoke course betting permits. It contains a number of other amendments which I will discuss later.</P>
    <P>At the outset I should like to refer briefly to the bloodstock industry, an industry which according to recent estimates represents a total investment of more than £75 million in this country.  Ireland has the soil, climate and other natural resources perfectly suited to bloodstock.  I am glad to say that by using these resources to the full, by selective breeding and the dedicated management and enthusiastic interest of the many people associated with the industry we have gained a well-deserved and world-wide reputation for top-quality stock.</P>
    <P>The total number of bloodstock in the country at present is estimated at 20,000, the number of horses in training is 4,600 and the annual attendance at race meetings is almost one million. Total sums staked with bookmakers at horse races increased from £11.8 million in 1970 to £18.4 million or slightly more in 1974.  In the same period the amount staked on the totalisator increased from £4.4 million to £5.8 million.  Total prize money at Irish races was £1.4 million in 1974. In the coming year it is likely to increase to £1.75 million.</P>
    <P>The bloodstock industry is making a significant contribution to the economy, giving valuable employment, enhancing our export trade, promoting <Col N="1808" /> tourism and giving us a justifiable pride in the reputation of the Irish horse throughout the world.  At the same time one cannot be complacent. We must exploit the great potential of the industry and ensure that it can compete with growing competition from other countries.  Hence the constant need to provide high quality stock and management, attractive racing with better prizes and better amenities for patrons.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the Racing Board which down through the years has played a useful and progressive part in Irish racing.  As many Deputies are aware, the board was set up in 1945 as a State agency to promote horse breeding and horse racing. Indeed, when it was being discussed in this House at the time there were many reservations expressed not only by some Members of the House but by representatives of the bookmakers and other interests who were apprehensive about the proposals in the Bill. I am glad to say that those of us who supported the Bill and advocated its enactment at the time from both sides of the House have had our views confirmed by the success which has attended the efforts of the board in the meantime and, indeed, in discussions with representatives of the Bookmakers' Association, they acknowledge that it has made a significant contribution to the industry. In co-operation with other racing bodies the board were charged with the task of identifying the needs of the industry and, at the same time, to impose betting charges on the racegoing public and redistribute the proceeds for the general benefit of the industry.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware the board have 11 members appointed by the Minister for Finance in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  Members have to be associated with bloodstock breeding, racing or bookmaking and six of the 11 members must be members of the Irish Turf Club and/or the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.</P>
    <P>The 1945 Act gave the board power to own and operate racecourses and <Col N="1809" /> to regulate the management of private courses.  At present they own Leopardstown Race Course and they have a controlling interest in Limerick Junction.  The other 24 courses are privately owned.  The board may grant, refuse, suspend or revoke course betting permits for bookmakers.  They get their funds, as I have said, from levies on course bets with bookmakers and from bets on the totalisator.  The income of the board in 1974 was £1.39 million consisting mainly of £896,000 from a 5 per cent levy on course bets with bookmakers and £420,000 from a 20 per cent levy on losing bets on the tote.  They reallocated £1.22 million to racing, the main elements being £770,000 for stakes, £160,000 for carriage of horses, that is to races, and £120,000 to the Turf Club.  Since 1969-70 the board have got a capital grant of £100,000 each year from the Exchequer.  This, together with part of their current surplus, is reallocated to racecourses as capital grants or loans for buildings, equipment and other amenities. Total capital expenditure at racecourses since 1969 is estimated at £2.1 million towards which the board contributed £1.9 million in loans and grants.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate the board on their excellent work down through the years and to thank them and their staff for their very generous services.</P>
    <P>May I refer also to other State bodies associated with bloodstock? There is the National Stud Company which helps bloodstock breeding by maintaining a corps of high quality stallions for service to breeders at reasonable fees.  The company also co-operate with research workers in equine research and they conduct training courses in stud management. The company's share capital, which is held by the Minister for Finance, is used to buy stallions and to provide buildings, yards and other facilities at the studs.</P>
    <P>I should like to remark that very considerable capital has recently been expended over a period in reconstructing and developing the buildings, yards and other facilities at the stud.  The present investment in share capital is <Col N="1810" /> £1.5 million.  The allocation of capital for the stud in 1975 was £300,000.</P>
    <P>The other State body dealing with the horse industry, Bord na gCapall, is mainly concerned with equitation. At the beginning of this year they took over incentive schemes for horse-breeding formerly operated by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The board promotes sales of horses, gives grants to show societies and teams competing in international competitions. They conduct training courses and register riding establishments. They hope later to establish a national equitation centre.  The State grant to Bord na gCapall for 1975 was £650,000.  Its total contribution in 1975 to the horse industry and the three State bodies I have mentioned will be £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>I shall now turn to the sections of the Bill before the House.  Section 1 contains the usual definitions.  Section 2 provides that the consent of the Minister for the Public Service must be got before the Racing Board determines the remuneration of its chief officer. This is in line with a number of recent provisions in Acts dealing with State companies where the remuneration is fixed in consultation with the Department of the Public Service and the various national wage agreements applied to the staffs concerned.  Section 3 (a) provides that in case of on course winning bets bookmakers will charge the levy on total winnings and deduct that levy from the amount being paid to the punter.  This is the existing practice which is now being formalised.  Section 3 (b) increases the maximum levy chargeable on course bets from the present 5 per cent to a maximum&mdash;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&mdash;of 10 per cent. As I mentioned earlier, I understand that it is the intention of the Racing Board to increase it by only 1 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach said that it is at present 5 per cent and the Racing Board now intend to make it a 6 per cent charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  Sections 4 and 5 provide for an appeal committee and prescribe its constitution, <Col N="1811" /> powers and procedures.  The committee of three will hear appeals from bookmakers in cases where the Racing Board refuses, suspends or revokes course betting permits.</P>
      <P>This is a change from the original Act but it is in line with the terms of a similar provision in the Acts establishing Bord na gCon, where an appeal committee was provided for.</P>
      <P>Section 6 gives more authority to officers of the Racing Board for inspecting bookmakers' record in order to prevent evasion of levies.</P>
      <P>Section 8 prescribes bigger penalties for bookmakers for operating without permits, failing to pay levies, failing to keep or falsifying records, obstructing officers of the board when inspecting documents or failing to produce documents.</P>
      <P>Section 7 gives the board authority to operate staff superannuation schemes subject to the approval of the Minister for the Public Service. The board already have such a scheme but there is some doubt about its authority to operate such a scheme and this section provides formal authority for the superannuation scheme.  Section 9 is the usual provision for laying statutory regulations before each House of the Oireachtas. This again remedies an omission in the original Act.</P>
      <P>In brief, the Bill will enable the Racing Board to charge higher levies on course bets with bookmakers and thus acquire more funds for such purposes as prize money and racecourse amenities.  There is a general recognition that if racing is to maintain the position which it has, it is essential that the stakes here should keep pace with inflation and indeed, that the stakes should be of sufficient value to attract and maintain the number of horses and to provide a reasonable prospect of return to those who race horses.</P>

It also provides <Col N="1812" /> for the appeals committee to which bookmakers can appeal from decisions of the Racing Board to refuse, suspend or revoke course betting permits.  It provides for better control over bookmakers' records with higher penalties.  Again the penalties are being revised to take account of present day money values.  Finally, it provides for ministerial control over the remuneration of the board's chief officer and for the staff superannuation scheme.  I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, subject to certain reservations to which I shall refer later, we on this side of the House are prepared to support this Bill.</P>
      <P>We appreciate the fact that, in particular, prize money in this country for racing is extremely low.  I am not clear if the average figure is above or below that in Britain but it is very much below the figures in any other European country.  On the basis of the figures which the Taoiseach has just given, I have made a calculation in relation to prize money in 1974, when £1.4 million was devoted to prize money and when on the Taoiseach's figures there were 4,600 horses in training.  If you divide these figures into one another, you come out with a figure of £304 prize money in respect of each horse in training.  This is an abnormally low figure.  It would be a conservative estimate to say that today it costs £1,200 per annum to keep a horse in training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If you got it as low as that you would be doing well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be a lot more.  Even at my conservative figure the average owner is showing a loss straightway of £900 for each horse in training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the consequences of that situation is that owners and trainers find that they cannot keep horses in training unless they can from time to time make substantial coups in bets on their horses.  The consequences of some of these efforts to win large sums of money have not always been ideal from the point of view of the average <Col N="1813" /> punter and the general public interest. I would be very happy to support anything which would increase prize money and which would lessen the necessity that exists at the moment for people who own or train horses to win substantial sums of money in betting on them on occasion in order to keep going.</P>
    <P>Another factor which has subsidised owners of horses for quite a long time has been the fact that many of our owners are also breeders and up to 1973 the profits generally from breeding were pretty good.  In 1974 the breeding situation was a disaster and most breeders lost heavily that year. Only a few of them made any worthwhile profit and this, of course, inevitably will have a serious effect on racing in the Irish context for quite a short time.  The most important provision in this Bill is the proposal to allow the raising of the on-course levy payable to the Racing Board from 5 per cent to 10 per cent. The Taoiseach has stated here that it is proposed by the Racing Board at the moment to raise it only to 6 per cent.  This is the information they gave me also when I telephoned them about it.  I asked them if they could guarantee that the figure would stay at 6 per cent and they informed me that they could not give any guarantee beyond this year, which would appear to indicate that there is a likelihood of an increase beyond 6 per cent in 1976.</P>

      <P>The position is as the Taoiseach has stated, that this year it is proposed to raise the levy from 5 per cent to 6 per cent when this Bill has been passed but we have no guarantee as to what further increases up to a limit of 10 per cent may take place in the future.  In the circumstances in which racing generally <Col N="1814" /> finds itself at the moment we have no objection to the increase from 5 per cent to 6 per cent, but we think that any increase over and above that which might or might not become necessary in future years should not be effected simply by the Racing Board making a regulation with the consent of the Minister for Finance to raise the levy to some further figure between 6 and 10 per cent, possibly as high as 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>If the Racing Board can make a case for a further increase over and above the 6 per cent, they should come back to this House for further legislation to enable them to do that. For this reason we propose, while not opposing the Second Reading of this Bill, to put down an amendment on Committee Stage to limit the increase that is proposed in section 3 of the Bill to 6 per cent.  If it should happen that in future years the Racing Board feel that they need a greater percentage, let them make out their case and come back to the Oireachtas for authority to do that.  The 6 per cent figure, of course, is going to be a bit difficult in practice because the 5 per cent was the equivalent in old money of one shilling in the £ and the deduction was quite easily made.  With 6 per cent it is going to be less easy, particularly on the smaller bets.  It will entail much dealing in very small coins which normally do not feature on race courses.  I am not sure that these coins are going to be available.</P>
      <P>While that is the major proposal in the Bill, and the major proposal in section 3, it is by no means the only proposal there.  I want to refer to paragraph (a) of section 3 which was not really adverted to at all by the Taoiseach but which could be very significant.  That paragraph (a) proposes the addition of certain words to subsection (1) of section 27 of the 1945 Act.  The effect of the additional words which section 3 (a) proposes will allow a bookmaker, or indeed compel him, to deduct from the stake and winnings of a winning bet which he pays to a punter a levy at the prescribed rate which at the moment is 5 per cent, and presumably will be 6 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very significant that these words allowing a bookmaker to do this should have to be added in this Bill because if you go back to section 27 of the 1945 Act and read subsection (1) which is very brief, it seems clear from that that the entitlement to deduct the levy is confined to the bet or to the stake only and not to the total returnable to the punter.  The subsection is brief and I will quote it so that Deputies will be aware of what is in it:</P>
      <P>Every person who, as a licensed bookmaker, enters into a course bet on or after the commencement of this section shall pay to the Board a levy calculated at the rate of the prescribed percentage for the time being of the amount of such course bet.</P>
      <P>A course bet is the amount staked, it is not the amount returnable to the punter.  My interpretation of subsection (1) of section 27 of the 1945 Act is borne out by the fact that it is now proposed to add these words in paragraph (a) of section 3 of this Bill.  It is now proposed to add the words and if the subject of the bet is determined in favour of the person with whom the bookmaker enters into the bet, that is the punter, the bookmaker shall from the total amount which he would otherwise pay or credit to that person in respect of the bet make a deduction calculated at the rate of that percentage of that total amount, that is the stake and winnings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am drawing the attention of the Taoiseach and the House to the point that while it is the present practice and has been for many years, there appears to have been no statutory authority for it.  It may well be that on the one hand bookmakers have paid to the Racing Board considerably larger sums than they need have paid and, secondly and more importantly, a large number of punters throughout the country have had deductions made from their <Col N="1816" /> winnings by bookmakers, in respect of which the bookmakers did not have any statutory authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear before I am interrupted again that the bookmakers did not benefit by the improper deductions they made because, needless to say, they paid those deductions over to the Racing Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonetheless it would appear on a strict reading of subsection (1) of section 27, as proved by paragraph (a) of section 3, that up to now and even at the present time until the Bill is passed, there is no statutory authority to deduct a levy from anything other than the stake on the course bet.  If there was authority to deduct from the stake and winnings paragraph (a) here would not be necessary.  If it were only to remove a doubt or something of that nature, the normal drafting procedure would be to start off paragraph (a) here by some form of words such as &ldquo;For the purpose of the removal of doubts&rdquo; and add the words and say that it &ldquo;shall be presumed that these words always form part of section 27 of the 1945 Act&rdquo;. That is not done and on the face of it it appears that the proposal now is that as and from the passing of this Bill and not before that the stake and winnings of a punter's bet will be liable to deduction of levy on the total amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we are all aware, the practice has been to deduct on the total amount.  It appears clear now that there was no statutory authority for that practice and the fact that there was not may well give rise to difficulties, because it was the invariable practice.  I would suggest to the Taoiseach, in order to prevent a lot of difficulties for the Racing Board and for bookmakers, that some words should be added to section 3 (a) to <Col N="1817" /> make it clear that the normal practice of deducting the levy shall be regarded as having always been the law.  There are good reasons why one should not favour retrospective legislation of this kind but it does not really matter in this situation to validate the practice retrospectively because it has been pretty well a universal practice for many years.  Nonetheless it is a serious situation; until this Bill is passed what has been an invariable practice for many years and has been enforced by the Racing Board and by bookmakers in relation to punters placing bets with them does not have any statutory authority whatever.</P>
    <P>The provisions in this Bill relating to the establishment of an appeal committee is welcome.  While similar provisions were contained in the Greyhound Industry Act, 1968, they were not in the Racecourses Act, 1945 and the bookmakers were certainly at a disadvantage in the absence of an appeal committee.  For that reason I welcome the provisions establishing a committee. I am glad to note that the provisions in the proposed Bill are not exactly the same as those contained in the Greyhound Industry Act, 1968, as certain difficulties in practice had been encountered in connection with that Act and the necessary amendments to the Greyhound Industry Act are incorporated in this Bill even though they are not yet made to the Greyhound Industry Act, 1968.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (8) (d) provides that a person can be prosecuted for refusing to take an oath and refusing to answer questions and can be liable to a fine of £500, at the discretion of the court, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.  It is only a minor point but that should not be there.  Nobody in any court can be compelled to take an oath.  He should be allowed affirm or swear in other ways that are open to witnesses.  Section 8 increases the penalties very substantially.  I presume such huge increases are necessary but they seem very large.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is the normal sort of provision for regulations to be made by the Racing Board and laid before each House.  It has the effect that the regulations come into force straight away <Col N="1818" /> and, if they were annulled within 21 sitting days, that would be without prejudice to anything that was done under them.  Is that particular type of provision suitable in this instance?  If the board have power to raise the levy, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, would it not be advisable, if the amendment I suggested were not accepted about confining the increase to one per cent, that any regulations made by the board under section 9 increasing the levy would not come into force until passed by Dáil Éireann rather than have it come in and have the increase possibly disallowed afterwards when they would have to revert to the old figure with consequent inconvenience and difficulty?</P>
    <P>There are a number of smaller points to which I shall advert on Committee Stage.  I have been looking at the Racing Board's accounts for 1974. While they have got a grant of £100,000 from the Exchequer since 1969 last year they made provision for the payment of slightly over £100,000 in income tax to the Exchequer.  The grant they receive is unusual to some extent because they pay £241 more to the Exchequer in their provision for income tax than they are receiving. That was not true in previous years as the income tax provision was very much lower.  The grant of £100,000 which they get is a grant on paper only because they are paying more to the Exchequer than they are getting from it.</P>
    <P>The principle objective of the Racing Board in trying to increase their income by way of levy is to increase prize money.  They are also anxious to increase grants to racecourses. Quite a number of the privately-owned courses have incurred losses in the last year or so and some are encountering great difficulties in carrying on.  I had hoped that the Taoiseach would have dealt with the proposals of the Racing Board announced a year or two ago to grade courses into five different categories.  It is an important matter for the future of Irish racing and I hope the Taoiseach will deal with the up-to-date situation when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Many people are of the opinion that, <Col N="1819" /> because the amounts being staked at race meetings are increasing considerably, the yield from levies, both from totalisator and course bookmakers is increasing so much that it is not necessary to increase the percentage of the levy.  In view of the Racing Board's proposal to give a major increase this year to prize money I am of the opinion that there should be no reasonable objection to a one per cent increase in the levy provided it is confined by statute to that one per cent.</P>
    <P>Many people think that the fairly large sums the Exchequer takes from racing on off-course betting tax should, to some extent at least, be reflected in grants to racing.  Deputy Crowley will develop that point later.  It is one that should be borne in mind.  While there is not a great deal of off-course betting on Irish racing&mdash;most of it seems to take place on English racing &mdash;nonetheless, the very fact that race meetings are held gives the Exchequer a source of income they would not otherwise have.  It is not unfair to ask them to put back some part of that source of income into the sport itself particularly as the 1974 accounts of the Racing Board seem to indicate that they are now paying more income tax to the Exchequer than the Exchequer is giving in grants.</P>
    <P>There has been a fair amount of publicity in the last week of allegations that the increase in the on-course levy will give rise to illegal betting.  I do not think there is, in fact, foundation for those allegations because there is very little illegal betting on racecourse, if any.</P>
    <P>The matter is quite different so far as off-course betting is concerned.  The warning was given here by a number of speakers on the budget last January to the Minister for Finance that the proposal which he then put into force to increase off-course betting tax to 20 per cent would lead to a lot of illegal betting off the course in order to avoid what most people regard as a totally penal rate of tax.  Our forebodings in that respect have been proved right.  I am told there is quite an amount of illegal off-course betting <Col N="1820" /> being carried on at the moment because of the penal rate of taxation which exists on off-course bets.  This is regrettable from several points of view.</P>
    <P>It means that the State in the long run will be left out of it.  Secondly, the general public have not got the protection of betting with a licensed bookmaker, who has to apply to renew his licence and his permit to the courts and the Revenue Commissioners every year, when he is subject to objections by anybody who is aggrieved by any dispute with him. The public have not got that protection now with the increasing amount of betting that is going on with unlicensed bookmakers off the course. The whole economics of the off-course betting tax should be looked at again by the Government in view of the damage that in fact it is doing at this time.</P>
    <P>To sum up, we are prepared to welcome this Bill subject to the various provisos that I have mentioned and in particular to the fact that we think it should be written into this statue that the increase will be to 6 per cent only and if the racing board think at some future time that they require a further increase in the rate, and they are able to put up a sufficiently good case for it, then let them come back to the Oireachtas and let it be put before the Oireachtas by way of a Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Malley, in the main, we welcome very much the ramifications of this Bill.  As the Taoiseach said in his introductory statement the horse racing industry is a very, very important industry.  It is an industry that has brought a lot of fame to this country. It is one that a lot of small people in this country have considerably benefited from.  The crafts of that industry have been handed down from generation to generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are discussing in this House anything to do with the horse racing industry we are discussing the commitment that the ordinary Irish small farmer has to that industry.  It is absolutely vital that we have adequate funds provided for the benefit <Col N="1821" /> of horse racing, and indeed breeding, here.  I know the Taoiseach takes a very personal and special interest in that industry.  I know he is as aware as we are that the finances of that industry are heading for dangerous straits.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the fact that the 20 per cent off-course tax which is collected by the Exchequer does not go back into racing.  That is something that we all feel very very strongly about.  First of all, 20 per cent tax on off-course betting is a huge amount.  It is a complete deterrent to people to bet with legitimate bookmakers.  If that has to be persevered with and if the Government cannot see their way to changing that 20 per cent I would like to suggest that 50 per cent of the amount of the tax collected be ploughed back into the industry.  The industry could gain enormously from that.</P>
    <P>I had the satisfaction over the past couple of weeks of visiting one of the Middle East countries, Libya, and discussing there what our horse breeding industry and indeed our showjumping people could provide for the people in Libya.  We had a visit from a delegation there and they bought £50,000 worth of our horses after spending just one week in the country, with a promise to come back and buy more.</P>
    <P>The industry has gone through a bad year or two, but it is recovering and the potential for showjumpers and indeed for steeplechase horses in general is increasing at an enormous rate, especially in the developing countries. We should be ready and available to tap that vast new resource.  We have some of the best bloodstock in the world, indeed some of the best bloodstock lines in the world.  The National Stud are to be complimented for the way they have operated, very often on a virtual shoestring, and have been able to provide the Irish breeder with top class sires at very economic prices. This reinforces my argument and our wishes on this side of the House that as much as possible of the tax that is collected by off course bookmakers should be ploughed back.  That would be a productive use of the money collected from betting.  We are in a very <Col N="1822" /> fortunate position here in that we have the soil and the climate that seems to be the ideal blend for the breeding of horses.</P>
    <P>It would be a pity, if not a disaster, if we did not cash in on that completely. If we deprive our racecourses and indeed our owners of earning money and of reinvesting in the industry we are losing a very valuable asset.  While a lot of our racecourses are excellent there are other that need to have fairly large sums of money spent on them to bring them up to the standards that we would like to see them operating under.  When we remember that our racecourses are the show pieces of our horses it reinforces our argument all the more that they should be brought up to the proper standards.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill we could also refer to the display of our national jumping team.  What are we doing to try to improve our national jumping team?  I suppose the best advertisement that we could have for our horses or showjumpers would be for our team to do well and for our horses to win the various competitions they enter for. While we have German teams, American teams, English teams, all other kinds of teams with a lot of Irish bred horses in them winning the major trophies our team seem to be unable to get on the same scale of excellence that it had in former years.  I do not know why this is happening.  I am sure the personnel we have are excellent but I should like to know if they are being inhibited in any way because of lack of resources.  I suspect that is possibly the major reason why our national show-jumping team has not been doing as well in recent years as they did in former years.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the people involved in the industry in Bord na gCapall who met the Libyan delegation and showed them round to make sure they saw what was available on the Irish market, and the members of other boards involved in racing should have the appreciation of this House for what they are doing.  I know, of course, that in a time of economic crisis it is hard to ask for money for what is considered by many to be a luxury industry. <Col N="1823" /> We know it is not a luxury industry, that it is a very important industry in the sense that it is giving vast employment.  It is supplementing the income of many small farmers who keep the odd mare and breed the odd horse and sell at a good price thereby showing an extra profit they might not ordinarily make.</P>
    <P>We should consider those involved in racing, the jockeys and trainers.  I refer especially to the national hunt jockeys who go out in all kinds of weather and put their limbs&mdash;and sometimes their lives&mdash;at risk in giving entertainment.  There is very little provision made for these people by way of any type of welfare fund. They are a very important section of our sporting community, but they are badly provided for.  What can be more hazardous than jumping fences on a wet or icy winter's day and falling, maybe breaking one's neck or back?</P>

    <P>The report of the racing board states that attendances were maintained at the level of recent years. The report states that a special committee was set up in April, 1973, to explore ways and means of attracting larger attendances and that this committee has done much research and its report and recommendations are expected shortly.  Would the Taoiseach, when replying, tell the House if he has received any preliminary report from that committee and what <Col N="1824" /> action they intend to take to attract more people to race meetings?</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley said, we are in agreement with the general provisions of the Bill, subject to the 6 per cent being made a statutory limitation and that the racing board should have to come back to the House if they want to increase it to 7, 8, 9 or 10 per cent.  On Committee Stage amendments will be put down by Deputy O'Malley to ensure that is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface my remarks by expressing surprise and bewilderment that a man who is so attached to the industry is not present to plead the case for Fianna Fáil.  I refer to Deputy Haughey, an owner and a breeder, who has been accepted by all bookmakers as a man of affluence.  His word is accepted.  I am surprised that a man of his standing who has also interested himself in another operation in regard to the racing industry generally, the sales of bloodstock, is not here to make the case for people who know nothing about what they are talking.</P>
      <P>I refer particularly to Deputy O'Malley.  I have regard for Deputy Crowley because he owns and trains horses.  I cannot understand why amateurs are sent in to plead a case about which they do not know anything. If Deputy Haughey were making a case I would sit up and listen because I would know he was speaking from experience.  I am surprised at a Deputy speaking on behalf of a profession and an industry about which he knows nothing.  However, he has this connection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not go to solicitors to tell them what they should do.  The Taoiseach, as a <Col N="1825" /> member of our fraternity&mdash;he is a racing man and knows something about it&mdash;met the bookmakers and discussed the Bill in detail.  We assured him yesterday, having discussed the details, that we were satisfied with the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I fought this Bill on many fronts in 1945.  We never had recourse to any Minister, never mind a Taoiseach, until 1975.  The late Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh introduced the Bill and we fought it.  We got concessions, but like Deputy O'Malley, he new little or nothing about what he was doing. We advised him and he went some of the way with us.</P>
      <P>In 1945, we had racing at 2½ per cent, 1/- in the £ and free transport. The admission fee to racecourses has not increased since 1945.  We are the cheapest nation where racing and the bloodstock industry are concerned because of the fact that, with the co-operation of the public and the bookmakers, we made it possible for the small man Deputy Crowley referred to, to stay in business.</P>
      <P>In our discussions with the Taoiseach yesterday, the bookmakers discussed the situation of the small breeder.  We have the Taoiseach's ear and his concern because he is a man who understands the industry, not like some of the people who were talking about racecourses and horsebreeding today.  I do not know whether I should have gone for holy water or spring water when I heard Deputy O'Malley prognosticating about something he did not know anything about.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The selection of allottees for land is a matter that is reserved exclusively, by law, to the Lay Commissioners and is one in which I have no function.</P>
      <P>In this case I understand that because of the situation of the lands in question&mdash;adjacent to the town of Scarriff&mdash;and the need for land for housing and amenity purposes, the commissioners decided that the requirements of the county council should be given priority.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> No, it is not a precedent.  The Land Commission try to meet the requirements of local authorities adjacent to towns when they have lands on hand. The Land Commission have to take <Col N="1829" /> into consideration the annuity it would be necessary to charge on lands if they allocated them, but the primary consideration was that this was a small holding beside the town of Scarriff, that land was required for a factory site and for playing fields.  I do not want to be too hard on the Deputy, but I have representations on the file from Deputy Loughnane requesting that land be made available for these very purposes.</P>

      <P>That is correct.  I am quite satisfied on that score.  I am fully aware that the housing is necessary and will benefit more people than the number of people who are looking for the land.

The matter is dealt with at some length in Chapter 6 of the fourth report of developments in the European Communities&mdash;furnished last December and discussed in this House in February, March and April of this year.</P>

      <Col N="1834" /> As Deputies know, the purchase of rural land in Ireland is controlled by section 45 of the Land Act, 1965. This requires that all non-nationals who have lived here for less than seven years must obtain the consent of the Land Commission to acquire rural land&mdash;other than land required for industrial purposes or areas not exceeding five acres for private residential purposes.  The extent to which the provisions of section 45 are affected by this European court decision is being closely examined in my Department.  There are a number of facets of the judgment which require careful study and assessment before it will be possible to say what further action may be necessary.</P>

I know the Department supply manufacturers but the Cork, Kilkenny, Galway or Clare hurlers prefer the ash with the natural curve coming out from the root, not the forced curve which does not give what they call a natural hurley.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the procedure in question is aimed at implementing Point 6 of the communiqué issued at the end of the meeting of the heads of Government of the European Communities held at Paris on 9th December last in which the heads of Government stated that they consider that the practice of making agreement on all questions conditional on the unanimous consent of the member states should be dropped. In other words the procedure seeks to ensure that in the case of any particular proposal for which the Treaty provides for decision by a qualified majority, the practice of decision by unanimity will not apply where no vital national interest is concerned.</P>
      <P>Use of the procedure, of course, presupposes that there are items on the agenda for which the Treaty provides for a decision by a qualified majority vote as otherwise its application would be somewhat superfluous.</P>
      <P>To date the procedure has been applied at Council meetings attended by Ministers of Foreign Affairs although because of the presence of consensus among the member states in relevant instances it has not proved necessary to seek for a decision by a qualified majority vote.</P>
      <P>At the meeting of the council in its other formations the practice adopted has depended on the circumstances. In a number of cases no formal decisions have been required: this for example is sometimes the case with meetings of Finance Ministers. In other cases all decisions may have to be taken by unanimous agreement so that, as I stated earlier, application of the procedure in these instances would be superfluous.  Finally, I should perhaps add that the normal Council practice of taking qualified majority votes on budgetary items or on Commission decisions taken in accordance with specific regulations has, of course, continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The concern of the Irish Government about the system of detention as it operates in Northern Ireland has been made clear to the British Government.  Since 14th March, 1973, various aspects of the question have been raised at meetings between Irish and British Ministers on 17 occasions. The most recent such meeting took place on 15th May, 1975.</P>
      <P>The continuation of internment is making it more difficult to improve the political situation but the calculation of the rate at which the system can be dismantled involves security as well as political considerations and is therefore a matter primarily for those who have full information about the security as well as the political situation prevailing in Northern Ireland.  It is our hope and the British Government are aware of it, that the ceasefire will continue and that internment in Northern Ireland will shortly be brought to an end.</P>

The question is a very difficult one to answer generally.  Some of our representations have seemed to secure results while others have not secured an evident response at the time they were made.  During the period the Deputy refers to and since the beginning of this year there has been a regular rate of release of prisoners. This is in line with the policy that we consider should be pursued and which should have been pursued a good deal earlier.</P>

      <P>There are two sides to Deputy Gallagher's supplementary question.  The first side relates to the question of whether the conference failed or not.  I would not agree that it failed.  It did make headway although not as much headway as had been hoped for.  It made this much headway that the chairmen of the three committees into which the conference was divided succeeded in producing before the conference ended a unified negotiating text, which is a large step forward in a conference in which a big number of nations are represented.  This text will form the basis for negotiation at the next session of the conference early next year.  The second part of Deputy Gallagher's question relates to the question of our own maritime limits. The Government's present position is that not only ought we not to act unilaterally but that other States should not take unilateral action on matters falling within the mandate of the conference.  The Deputy's reference to Iceland envisages a situation which has not yet arisen.  When it does, it would be a new situation and the Government would have to consider it then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why Monaghan County Council decided on the guarantee scheme was the considerable delay experienced in installation of telephones.  There are hundreds of applications and very little headway has been made in the provision of the telephones.

The Minister does say that he proposes to accord a certain priority to the scheme but that there are heavy arrears of more urgent works in the engineering district.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason there is not more use being made of the telephone which is in the post office is that there is no box there and when people wish to make a personal or a business call they are not inclined to use that phone.  If there was a kiosk outside the post office it would have a greater use.  In addition, the telephone is available only during business hours and, as most of the people in the area return there after work, they would have greater need of a telephone after business hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there are about 20 telephones in the area and the population is approximately <Col N="1851" /> 250.  Receipts for the call office for the year ending 1973, which is the latest date for which figures are available, were lower than those in 1972. The downward trend was maintained during 1973 and the receipts at 31st December, 1973, were £34.79.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The downward trend was for the reason I have given, namely, that people are not inclined to use the phone because of the lack of privacy.  If there was a telephone in a kiosk outside it would be used to a greater extent.  In addition, the county council are building houses in the area and the need for a telephone will be greater than in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department do not recruit temporary staff specially for employment during the summer. Recruitment of temporary staff occurs throughout the year and its incidence depends mainly on the need for local labour for engineering works or to provide for absences on sick or annual leave not covered by reserves, or for additions to night operating staff at telephone exchanges to meet growth of traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The application in question was made on 8th January, 1973, but it has not been attended to because there has been a shortage of equipment at the local exchange which is unlikely to be remedied until the end of the year.

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is yes.  Service on the Dublin to Wicklow microwave link was interrupted at intervals on certain days between 4th and 20th May last by fading caused by unusual meteorlogical conditions of a kind and intensity last experienced in 1967. There is no question therefore of speech being distorted frequently in sunny weather as suggested.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The average capital cost of providing a public telephone kiosk is about £800.  There is hardly any difference between urban and rural costs, except where very long linework may be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not consider the cost exorbitant, but there is more involved than providing the money.  There is also manpower, the acquisition of sites and a number of other things, quite apart from the money, involved in erecting kiosks.  I understand there is also a considerable waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite recently a circular was sent to local councils by the <Col N="1863" /> Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the main reason given for not providing kiosks was that the costs were too high.  The figure given here now is not a very high cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not comparing like with like.  Obviously on an investment by the Department in public telephone kiosks they would need to have a certain minimum level of income to justify the investment involved and, if the income is lower than the required minimum, they ask the local county council to guarantee them against any loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I have been thinking about the way in which this section might work.  It seems to me that worthy of consideration is a provision that where a transaction would affect land, which is usually transferred by deed, it could include a declaration by the vendor that he was not directly or ordinarily a non-resident person. That would put the purchaser in the position of not being under liability to <Col N="1867" /> make the deduction.  If, however, the vendor was not in a position to make such a declaration then clearly the purchaser would have to make the deduction required by subsection (2).</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>I am not in a position to say at the moment the most suitable location of the requirement.  I will certainly give consideration to it.  I wonder if Deputy Colley, as a practitioner, would consider that to be of assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It will certainly reduce the area of difficulty that arises here. I agree with the Minister that if such a certificate appeared it could be completed and appear on a deed, then, as the Minister says, the problem would not arise at all.  Normally the certificate is given by the purchaser and not the vendor, but here it would be the vendor who would have to give the certificate saying he was a resident of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some certificates have involved both parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If such a certificate could be given it would give the purchaser adequate notice.  That is the real point with which I am concerned. I appreciate that that suggestion certinly removes some of the difficulties, but the Minister will appreciate that it does not remove all the difficulties because the other assets could involve rights in relation to the Continental Shelf, minerals or any rights, interests or other assets in relation to mining or minerals, or searching for minerals and assets in the State which, at or before the time when the chargeable gains accrued were used at, in or for the purpose of a trade carried on by the non-resident person in the State through a branch or agency or before that time were used, held or acquired for use or for the purpose of the branch or agency.  The remainder relates to the Continental Shelf, exploration or exploration rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister's suggestion in regard to the deed will get <Col N="1868" /> over the difficulty in regard to those assets.  It might in some circumstances but one could not be sure, as one could in the case of land, that it could.  In relation to those I want to suggest to the Minister that the obligation which is imposed with a penalty for non-compliance and in the case of a company, say a bank, which did not comply a very substantial penalty, produces a situation in which we are obliged to look at the machinery proposed and see is it feasible and reasonable to require people under pain of penalty to carry out what is proposed here.  It is not reasonable and is not feasible.</P>
    <P>I outlined before the adjournment some of the problems arising.  It would seem that the provisions of paragraph 11, and in particular of subparagraph (2) would impose on a solicitor, a bank or any other agency an obligation which in many circumstances could not be discharged.  This obligation attaches to any person through whom the moneys might be paid even though that person might have no knowledge of the source or the destination of the funds or of the fact that the transaction was connected with someone not resident in the State.  The provision in subparagraph (2) in relation to a payment, directly or indirectly&mdash;I stress indirectly&mdash;to a person who is not ordinarily resident in the State produces a situation which would be quite impossible, in some circumstances, for people to comply with. How could they know if they are responsible for making this deduction if the money will indirectly end up with somebody who is not resident in the State?</P>
    <P>The obligation in the case of a solicitor is being extended enormously but he might be in a better position than most other agents to have some idea of whether the person who will ultimately receive the money was or was not a non-resident.  However, a bank could be in an impossible situation in trying to determine what transaction the money was connected with and where it was going to end up eventually, not just the direct transfer but the indirect results of the <Col N="1869" /> transfer of the money by the bank. I suggest to the Minister that in so far as the machinery proposed in paragraph 2 relates to the kind of assets mentioned, other than land it is unworkable. The object of the machinery proposed is acceptable because it is an effort to ensure that non-residents do not escape without paying capital gains tax&mdash;a laudable purpose that we support.  However, there is no point in providing machinery which purports to deal with this situation if that machinery is unworkable and if, in the process, it imposes an obligation on Irish citizens which they are incapable of discharging and which, if they fail to discharge, can render them liable to penalties, some quite severe.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister can devise machinery which will not put Irish citizens in the kind of position they are being put into under this paragraph this machinery amounts, effectively, to window-dressing.  It will not do what it is supposed to do but it will create a lot of problems for people who are in no way involved or responsible for the payment of capital gains tax in the kind of circumstances envisaged in paragraph 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not dealing here with small assets with moveable property.  One might be dealing with moveable property but there would not be many cases involving moveable property which would be caught by this paragraph.  It does not apply where the disposal does not exceed the sum of £50,000.  That exempts a lot of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Would there be exemption up to £50,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, subparagraph (8) so provides.  The majority of assets would not have this obligation attaching to them and the kind of assets which would have this obligation attaching to them would, in the main, be land.  It would also involve property in respect of which it would be quite an easy matter to obtain a declaration from the vendor which could provide protection for the purchaser in the way I have already described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will certainly give serious consideration <Col N="1870" /> to the other points raised.  I can see situations, even though there would not be many, where the purchaser may have some difficulty in ascertaining whether or not the vendor was a person who was a non-resident. I am satisfied, having regard to the size of the consideration and to the necessity to ensure the tax is paid, that, broadly speaking, the paragraph is right, is correctly conceived and is workable.  If it is possible to make any adjustment in the minority of cases to ensure that a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser would not be jeopardised I would be prepared to consider an amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is prepared to examine the paragraph in the light of what I have put forward.  The Minister may be misleading himself in so far as he seems to think that because this applies only to cases where the consideration is over £50,000 there will be a small number of cases and that they will be readily identifiable.  I should like to put a case to him, remembering that the obligation to do what is set out in the section applies not only to the person paying the money, the purchaser, but to the person through whom the money is paid.  For example, we will presume that the bank is the agent through whom the money is paid, the consideration for the transaction is £100,000, the money is paid in to the bank and through the bank is paid out, by direction, to X.  The mere fact that that happens appears to impose an obligation on the bank.</P>
      <P>That kind of transaction going through a bank is not so unusual that it would draw the bank's attention to it so that they would make enquiries. If a bank held up payments of this kind while enquiries were being made they could find themselves facing other legal problems with their customers.  If the bank pays out the money in the ordinary course of business the bank has no way, in most cases, of knowing what the transaction is.  They have no way of knowing whether the transaction was one that would bring it within the terms of paragraph 2 and no way of knowing to whom the money is going directly or indirectly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that in the <Col N="1871" /> case of a bank it is utterly impossible to impose, in a realistic way, this obligation on them.  I can see no way in which a bank could discharge it. That is perhaps the most clearcut case, but it seems to me that less clearcut, although almost as difficult, could be the position of other agents, and in some cases of solicitors.  They may not be in a position to know the facts which would bring about the operation of paragraph 2 and if they do not they cannot do what paragraph 2 calls upon them to do.  If they fail to do it, technically they are liable to a penalty.  The Minister may say that if they can establish that they did not know they are not liable to a penalty. That may be so but if it is so I do not think it is the kind of machinery that one can stand over.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is reviewing the wording of this paragraph he should bear in mind that we should not attempt to impose undue burdens on innocent people, particularly people who are our own citizens, so as to get at non-residents who do not pay capital gains tax for which they are liable. We must ensure that the machinery is workable and that whoever becomes responsible under the provisions of paragraph 2, be they Irish citizens or non-Irish citizens, are responsible in such a way that their responsibility is clear to them and can be clearly established, so that if they fail to discharge it, then the penalty can be imposed on them.  As it stands&mdash;and it is difficult, I must confess, to see how an amendment of it can overcome the major difficulties that arise&mdash;I suggest it is unreasonable and unworkable, and if it is unworkable there is not much point in having it here at all.</P>
    <P>It may be that a complete rethink of the problem might produce a better way of tackling what the Minister is trying to tackle here and what we support him in, but not at the expense of imposing obligations and penalties for non-fulfilment of those obligations particularly on Irish citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I am satisfied that it will operate satisfactorily in the vast majority of cases, <Col N="1872" /> and in so far as there may be areas of specific difficulty, I am prepared to look at the paragraph to see whether or not relief can be given if a person has no way of knowing or ascertaining whether or not the beneficiary is a non-resident.</P>

      <P>No, as of now there is not and indeed at the passing of the Bill, if left unamended, there would not be either, but a prudent person would take steps to satisfy himself that a vendor was not a non-resident and, if the vendor was a non-resident, the purchaser should be in a position to protect his interests under subparagraph (2).</P>

      <P>There are a few other points on this paragraph I want to put to the Minister.  It is a little difficult to follow it because it has been substantially amended, but I think the point I am about to make still applies.  The paragraph as a whole is concerned with the payment of the tax on 50 per cent of the consideration, the deposit of that with the Revenue Commissioners, and the issue of a certificate, and so on.  However, there does not appear to be any <Col N="1873" /> provision giving credit for that tax paid to the person who is actually liable for it, that is, the non-resident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subparagraph (6), as amended, reads:</P>
      <P>(6)  The person chargeable under section 4 in respect of the disposal may apply to the inspector for a certificate that the tax chargeable for the year of assessment in which the disposal is made, and the tax chargeable on any gain accruing in any earlier year of assessment (not being a year ending earlier than the 6th day of April, 1974) on a previous disposal of the asset, has been paid and that no further such tax is payable for those years, and the inspector on being satisfied as to the facts shall issue a certificate to that effect.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question is that there is no provision specifically here for a refund of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am coming to that in a moment.  Does the Minister say that subparagraph (6), as amended, specifically provides for the giving of credit in respect of the tax paid by way of deduction and payment to the Revenue Commissioners by the other party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subparagraph (5) as amended reads:</P>
      <P>(5)  Where the amount of capital gains tax assessed and charged under subparagraph (3) or (4) is greater than the amount of such tax chargeable on the gain on the disposal in relation to which the first mentioned amount was accounted for, then, on a claim being made in that behalf&mdash;</P>
      <P>I now insert the words put into the amendment:</P>
      <P>&mdash;by the person chargeable under section 4 in respect of the disposal, relief shall be given from the excess, whether by repayment or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose, by implication, that decides that there is credit given although, as the paragraph was originally drafted in relation to the certificate being issued, it was then the <Col N="1874" /> purchaser rather than the vendor, which seemed to provide for credit being given to the purchaser but not to the person who was actually liable for the tax.  However, it is not a major point, but in regard to the repayment which is provided for in subparagraph (5), what is the position about interest, because presumably in many cases there may be an over-payment, and, indeed, that is envisaged in subparagraph (5)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters may be settled contemporaneously with the transaction itself, and if a taxpayer fails to apply for a refund that is due to him, it is difficult to see why he should be entitled to the payment of interest on money which could have been returned to him if he had made a claim earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so, because once the price of the article is struck, the vendor can thereupon proceed to obtain an assessment of the tax which will be payable by him.  They discharge the tax then and avoid the need to make a deduction and the passing over of money by the purchaser. If he does not do that and then does not apply for a long time afterwards to get a refund of any excess, there is some responsibility on his part for any loss he may have to carry as a consequence of his own omission.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin Central):</i> Could the Minister give us any indication as to how long this will take?  In the ordinary course of events a transaction would be finalised within five or six weeks of purchasing, but where a non-resident sells a property and before it can be finally transferred to the purchaser, Revenue Commissioners must be satisfied as to what capital gain is accruing.  I cannot see this work being carried out by the Revenue Commissioners in that short space of time.  It is quite obvious that it will be anything from three to four months before the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied as to what the capital gain is on the property and it <Col N="1875" /> cannot be transferred because one has to get a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners, I presume, before that can be done.  Does the Minister not think this will delay considerably the transfer of this particular kind of property of non-residents?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Transfers can take place normally.  There is no reason to hold up the transfer.  At worst&mdash;from the point of view of the taxpayer&mdash;there will be an excess payment to the Revenue Commissioners but it is an excess which the vendor can forthwith apply for.</P>

The vendor who has sold his property and has probably bought already another property cannot put his hands on this money.  There may be no capital gain accruing on the property sold but irrespective of that, 50 per cent of the consideration must be deposited with the Revenue Commissioners who can hold it for four or five months.

      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to subparagraph (8) of this paragraph which deals with a situation of a person trying to dispose of his property in parts so as to remain below the £50,000 level.  It is provided at the end of the first paragraph that where that situation arises the several disposals shall for the purposes of this paragraph and this subparagraph only be treated as a single disposal. Can the Minister elaborate a little on the meaning of this? Some of it is slightly opaque.  Assuming that for the purposes of this subparagraph the number of transactions are treated as one transaction, does the obligation imposed by subparagraph (2) to make the deduction and so on apply and, if so, how will that work in practice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

When that happens both transactions are to be treated as one transaction so that A is under the obligation, in accordance with subsection (2), to deduct and deposit with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>I cannot see this operating in practice.  Even assuming that people are willing to meet their obligations many people will not know about this at the time.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister say what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;for the purposes of this subparagraph and this subparagraph only&rdquo;?  What is the significance of it being worded in that way? As the Minister knows there is a section earlier where a similar approach is taken to deal with people who are breaking up property in order to keep within the thresholds.  Speaking from recollection I do not think that kind of wording is contained in that earlier section.  I thought that for the whole purposes of the Bill the two transactions were treated as one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but where there was a similar provision it related generally to transactions which would otherwise be liable to capital gains tax, which can be avoided by dividing disposals in this way.  There is a provision whereby in prescribed circumstances the whole is to be treated as one transaction.  My understanding is that where a number of disposals are treated as one transaction they are treated as such for all the purposes of this Bill whereas here it would appear that they are being treated as one transaction only for the purposes of this subparagraph and not even for the purposes of subparagraph (2).  I am intrigued by this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it is only for the purpose of this subparagraph could it be interpreted as meaning that it does not apply to subparagraph (2) which is the one imposing the obligation? I know that is not the intention but it seems a possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point and will examine this.  Perhaps we could delete the syllable &ldquo;sub&rdquo; before &ldquo;paragraph&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This might make it clearer.  Paragraph 12, subparagraph (1) provides that:</P>
      <P>. . .the persons assessed shall not include a person who is not resident or ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
      <P>Why is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are providing that the assessment would be made on the Irish resident and not on a trustee who is non-resident.  For practical reasons this ensures that we can operate the paragraph, whereas if the assessment were made on a person outside the jurisdiction it might not be possible to enforce the provision against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that prevent its enforcement against a person who was resident in the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason, why should he be excluded? Since it can be enforced against the non-resident I can see no reason why it should not be enforced in the other case, whereas this provision would seem in some cases to give an out to a non-resident. If the liability cannot be enforced against him that is too bad but if it can be enforced, there is nothing lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Deputy.  I can see that it might be useful to assess the non-resident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure why such non-residents must be excluded specifically.  However, I will look at it <Col N="1882" /> again.  It is in that form simply because it would not be practicable to make the asessment on the non-resident exclusively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that unless there is something lost by including the non-resident it is better to include him.  On subparagraph (2) what is the effect of the first words &ldquo;subject to section 8 (3)&rdquo; on the subparagraph?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This makes it clear that where trustees or personal representatives are chargeable to tax on gains accruing to them the charge rests on them and there is no looking through to the beneficiary except in the case of a beneficiary absolutely entitled as against the trustees.  This is the reference in section 8 (3).  Thus the alternative basis of charge on individuals under section 6 has no application to trustees or personal representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this not a reversal of what was provided earlier in the Bill? Again I am speaking from recollection but I thought it was provided that the trustee or personal representative and the beneficiaries under the trust or estate could both be chargeable with the tax on the gains.  I did not think that the Revenue were restricted in the way that is suggested here.  Is the Minister saying that you can only look through the trustee or personal representative where some person is entitled absolutely as against the trustee or personal representative?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to paragraph 13 on the conclusiveness of income tax decisions, could I refer the Minister to Schedule 3 paragraph 5? I do not know if I have the correct reference <Col N="1883" /> but it would appear to me that there is a provision in the Bill which has the same effect as paragraph 13, which says:</P>
      <P>Any assessment to income tax or decision on a claim under the Income Tax Acts, and any decision on an appeal under the Income Tax Acts against such an assessment or decision, shall be conclusive so far as under section 6 or Schedule 1 or any other provision of this Act liability to tax depends on the provisions of the Income Tax Acts.</P>
      <P>Schedule 3 paragraph 5, deals with cases in which because there was liability for income tax the consideration on which the income tax is levied is to be excluded from the consideration for the purpose of computing capital gains tax in different cases in different sections of the Income Tax Acts with certain exceptions in particular circumstances.  Does the Minister feel that the provisions of Schedule 3 paragraph 5 conform with the provisions of paragraph 13 of this Fifth Schedule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy anticipated that I would say yes and he would be right in his anticipation. This paragraph provides that any income tax determination is to be conclusive for the purposes of capital gains tax in cases which fall within section 6, which is the alternative basis of charge with reference to income tax, or Schedule 1 which excludes from the computation items treated as taxable receipts or allowable expenses for income tax purposes or any other provisions where liability to tax depends on the provisions of the Income Tax Acts.  The person cannot claim, for example, to have an item of expenditure allowed as a revenue expense for income tax purposes and then say in relation to capital gains tax that it is a capital expenditure which would, of course, increase the cost of the acquisition of the relevant asset.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a time apportionment of the cost of the stamp duty.  On paragraph 17 (1) there is a point that I want to make.  I shall not elaborate because it has arisen on another provision.  It says:</P>
      <P>This paragraph applies where a person who is connected with a company resident in the State receives or becomes entitled to receive in respect of shares in the company any capital distribution . . . </P>
      <P>I have already drawn the Minister's attention to what I consider to be problems which can arise by use of the phrase &ldquo;becomes entitled to receive&rdquo;. In subparagraph (2) there is provision for a person being assessed and charged in the name of the company to the amount of certain capital gains tax. I asked this before&mdash;I am not sure that I got a satisfactory reply or, if I did, it did not register with me&mdash;what precisely is the meaning of a person being assessed and charged in the name of the company? I take it that he is personally liable in such case.  Does it refer simply to the form of the assessment and charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The form is quite a usual one of charging Mr. X in the name of a particular company.  It means that the charge is kept separate from his own personal position and is related to the company.  He, of course, is primarily responsible for payment of the tax and he will have his right of recovery against the company but you do not mingle the company charge with any charge which may arise in relation to the individual's own affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from what the Minister has said that a person who is so charged is charged in addition to his personal liability, over and above his normal personal liability and that is so even in the case&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy used the words &ldquo;in addition&rdquo;.  I trust that he <Col N="1885" /> also understands that it is separate from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is over and above what would be his normal personal liability, and that is so even where this additional charge is based on a capital distribution which he became entitled to receive but did not actually receive.  I know that it is provided in subparagraph (3) that a person in this position has a right to recover that sum from the company, but it is conceivable that he could not recover because for some reason the company had gone into liquidation.  In such circumstances, he has no priority, whereas the Revenue Commissioners in recovering the tax have a priority. I am merely in saying this highlighting difficulties that arise by the inclusion of a person having become entitled to receive a capital distribution, even though he has not received it.  It can create various problems of the kind I have outlined.  I do not say it is going to happen on many occasions, but I urge the Minister again to see if some better wording can be found than &ldquo;becomes entitled to receive&rdquo;, or at least that some account be taken of the person who has become entitled to receive something but cannot receive it, in fact, because the company had gone into liquidation or there was embezzlement in the company.  I think that clearly if the person cannot receive the capital distribution, he should not be held liable for tax on it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that we had quite a debate on this earlier and I pointed out that there could be circumstances in which a person might not actually receive a capital distribution but would have a right to such distribution and be able to dispose of that right to another.

      <P>On the Schedule generally, while I appreciate that the Minister has undertaken to examine and, hopefully, to amend some of the provisions of Schedule 5 and amend them to our satisfaction, there are, nevertheless, some provisions in it as it is before us, and in particular the provisions <Col N="1887" /> of paragraphs 3 and 11, which as they stand are quite unacceptable.  I am hoping that the result of the Minister's review of the Schedule and in particular of those paragraphs will be that he will find himself in a position to amend them in such a way that they will be acceptable, but as they stand before us they are quite unacceptable. For that reason, we on this side ought to record our disapproval and non-acceptance of them and in relation to this we can only do it under the rules of the House in regard to the Schedule as a whole and for that reason I ask you, Sir, to put the Schedule.</P>

      <P>I would not say disenchantment.  I am not impeaching the Minister or anybody else in regard to intention, but I do think a better job could have been done in the presentation of the substantive parts of this Schedule.  Here we are, unfortunately, letting a Bill through which has buried in a Schedule some of the most important substantive provisions in the whole enactment, and that is a pity. Perhaps the House was not diligent enough in the past in querying these matters, but if one compares the type of Schedule in other Acts with the Schedules here, one will perceive a certain difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal and main objection one has to the Schedule is that, as in earlier Schedules, essential definitions or modifications of sections of other legislation are included and I do not think anybody has referred to paragraph 18 to which I referred last night.  I do not propose to repeat the argument on it. The Schedule will probably have to go as it stands, but in letting it go, I would like the Minister at this stage, before his memory fails him, to take <Col N="1888" /> note of the points he said he would look into.</P>
    <P>We cannot complain that the Minister did not offer to examine certain points.  The alacrity with which he accepted my comments regarding paragraph 6 was encouraging.  I should like the Minister to make the adjustments he promised so that we will not be in a position to reproach him later.  That is not to be taken as a warning but rather as a helpful hint that now is the time to act with regard to the adjustments he promised to make.  In this connection we have in mind paragraph 3 (3).</P>
    <P>When the Minister is considering this Schedule, will he consider it in the light of other Schedules?  He might draw the line at a different point at where the Schedule begins and ends.  We have failed to convince the Minister that the Tables are unnecessary.  If they are to be applied, will he take care that they are sufficient?</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a canon of the interpretation of tax law that if the law is capable of being interpreted as a relief it will be so interpreted.  If one enumerates one is taken to have done so intentionally, expressing fully one's intention.  If something is omitted inadvertently the canons of construction applicable to tax law will operate to impute an intenion of positive exclusion. Therefore, there is always the risk, particularly in a tax statute, that if something is omitted that might otherwise apply under a general provision the omission is interpreted as deliberate and intended.</P>
      <P>A good example of this is the deletion of section 176 by amendment which has been referred to.  I know the courts will have no knowledge of the discussion that took place in this House on this Bill.  Nevertheless, the fact that sections 170, 172 and 174 are to be applied seem to suggest that sections 171, 173, 175 and 176 of the Income Tax Acts are not to be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pointing out this fact to the Minister as something he should consider. I understand the points he made <Col N="1889" /> but I do not think a Schedule or an Act of Parliament should be considered a popular exposition.  We have explanatory memoranda and there are always booklets and pamphlets available that fulfil that function.  The function of a statute is totally different.</P>
    <P>Members of this House have good reason to come to the conclusion that it is intended to exclude the operation of section 176 from the Income Tax Acts.  This raises an interesting question in relation to paragraph 16 of the Schedule which, in itself, is eminently reasonable.  If section 176 is not applied that is the canon that will apply.  Notices and returns under the section appear to be in a rather peculiar character having regard to the other notices provided for in the section and in other parts of the income tax code. That raises interesting possibilities for practitioners and academics.  The latter have long ago given up trying to find logic or order in statutory legislation now that Parliaments such as <Col N="1890" /> this no longer use their brains on this kind of legislation but use their feet instead.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister it might be profitable to reconsider the Tables. None of us will claim credit if he does this.  When I pointed out a minor point with regard to paragraph 6, the refreshing alacrity and spontaneity of the Minister's response was appreciated. Any improvements the Minister will make to this Schedule will be accepted by this side of the House in that spirit.  In view of what he said on Committee Stage, Report Stage will produce some modifications from the Minister.  General comments will be in order on Fifth Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), after line 15, to insert&mdash;&ldquo;child&rdquo; includes&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a stepchild;</P>
      <P>(b)  a child adopted&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1974; or</P>
      <P>(ii)  under an adoption law, other than the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1974, being an adoption that has, in the place where the law applies, substantially the same effect in relation to property rights (including the law of succession) as an adoption under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1974, has in the State in relation to such rights;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words child, children and minor child are used throughout the Bill.  The term minor child is at present defined to include stepchildren and children adopted under the laws of foreign countries.  The absence of a definition of child could mean that reference to a child or to children would not include stepchildren or foreign adopted children. This could give rise to anomalies.  For example in section 5 <Col N="1893" /> (2), which refers in the first instance to a child or children of a marriage and then refers to the position where a minor child, being one of those children, is living.  It is, therefore, proposed to rationalise the situation by two amendments, Nos. 1 and 2.  The first amendment introduces the definition of a child, under which the word child will include a stepchild, children adopted under Irish adoption law and a child adopted under the laws of another country where the adoption has by and large the same effect as adoption under Irish law.  This places these categories of children, whether adult or minor children, on the same footing.</P>
    <P>The second amendment, No. 2, which follows, then defines a minor child as a child who has not attained 21 and has not married.  This amendment replaces the existing definition of minor child.  The introduction of the new definition of child means that the bulk of the existing definition of minor child is unnecessary, that is, step-children and adopted children are included in the definition of child and, accordingly, do not have to be referred to again.  All that is necessary for the definition, therefore, is a child who has not attained the age of 21 years on the relevant valuation date and who has not married on or before that date.</P>
    <P>The previous definition merely said, &ldquo;who has not married&rdquo;, and the amendment adds, &ldquo;on or before that date&rdquo;, for the sake of clarity.  Once a child marries he ceases to be regarded, for the purposes of the Bill, as a child of his parents; he forms his own unit.  The age of 21 is chosen because it is the age of legal entitlement and the age invariably inserted for absolute entitlement in trusts and settlements.</P>
    <P>The third amendment, No. 6, arises as a result of the introduction into section 1 of the definition of child. Under this new definition a child includes a step-child.  There is, therefore, no need to make a separate reference to step-children in this subsection. The position remains as before, namely, that the spouse and children, including step-children, are <Col N="1894" /> of the same degree of consanguinity in the context of a discretionary trust when a number of principal objects of their consanguinity to the settlor has to be examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 1 moved by the Minister, I am glad to note that the effect of it is to include in the definition of a child children adopted under our Adoption Acts from 1952 to 1974.  I drew attention on Second Stage to the fact that the Bill, as drafted, appeared, inadvertently, to exclude such children. The same drafting occurs in another Bill and this clearly requires a similar amendment.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 6 this follows automatically on amendment No. 1 but in regard to amendment No. 2 I should like to draw the Minister's attention to lines 18 to 20 of the original section:</P>
      <P>then, for the purposes of this definition, the child shall be deemed to be the child of the adopter or adopters born to him or them in lawful wedlock and not to be the child of any other person;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those words are used in the different Adoption Acts and they are used in a number of sections in those Acts. The way in which they were used suggests that in the drafting of those <Col N="1895" /> Acts it was considered necessary to insert them.  The Minister's amendment No. 2 would delete them.  From my perusal of the Adoption Acts I am not sure it would be correct to delete them.  I should like the Minister to consider the effect of their deletion in the light of the manner in which they appear in a number of sections in the Adoption Acts.</P>
    <P>I would not expect the Minister to be familiar, off-hand, with the use of these in the Adoption Acts but I should like to tell him that my perusal of these Acts shows that these lines occur in the sections not merely in a definition to be automatically carried through; they are used in a number of sections where they specify that for a particular purpose an adopted child is to be treated the same way as the legitimate child of normally married parents.  These lines are used in each such section and that suggests to me that it is necessary to incorporate them.  I ask the Minister to consider whether his amendment No. 2 is satisfactory in so far as it proposes to delete them from this Bill.</P>
    <P>My own amendment is designed to reduce the age of a minor from 21 to 18.  The time has come when we ought to recognise that the age of majority in the ordinary accepted sense is now 18 and not 21.  It is some time since we gave people votes at 18 and it is my belief that for all purposes of taxation legislation we should fix the age of a minor child at 18.  When I raised this on Second Stage the Minister said there might be a case for it but that it was not for this Bill.  A start has to be made somewhere and I suggest we should make it in this Bill where we specifically define &ldquo;minor child&rdquo;.  I suggest it is an anachronism now to insist, as is being done in the Minister's amendment, that the age of a minor is up to 21.</P>
    <P>One of the significant effects of providing that the age of a minor would be 18 and not 21 arises under this Bill in relation to a section of it which provides that any wealth which belongs to or accrues to the benefit of a minor is assessed against the father.  The father has to pay wealth tax on that <Col N="1896" /> wealth if the amount is sufficiently large and it is added to his own wealth. I should like to give an example which I admit will not happen every day but is not uncommon.  Where a minor aged 19 earns a large sum of money, as, for instance, a pop artist would, it is not unknown in such circumstances that the father of such a person may be in poor or at least ordinary circumstances. The effect of the provisions of the Bill and of the definition of a minor child as being up to the age of 21 unless married is that in such a case the wealth of the minor is attributed to the father who is legally liable to pay wealth tax on it.  In the case I have outlined he would not be in a position to do so and should not be made liable in that way.</P>
    <P>Of course, this is not the only reason for reducing the age to 18 but it illustrates one of the consequences of not doing so.  I would have thought that the desirablity of reducing the age from 21 to 18 was self-evident now, and the only objection that was made to it when I mentioned this before was that it had wider connotations and this was not the place to start it.  As I said, a start has to be made somewhere, and I do not see why it should not be made here in this Bill where it has considerable practical consequences as to whether one defines a minor as 21 or 18.  I would therefore urge on the Minister and on the House acceptance of my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this matter on Second Stage and I pointed out that the general law of this country, unlike the law of most European countries, regards 21 years of age as the age at which a person attains his majority.  I personally am in favour of a change in the law, but a tax Bill is not the Bill under which to change so fundamentally the age at which a person attains his majority.  It would create innumerable anomalies to provide a different age for the holding of capital than the age of majority which applies under the general law and applies under the income tax code as well.  The income tax code provides that the income of a parent which is paid to a child who is under 21 years of age and is unmarried is treated as <Col N="1897" /> the income of the settlor.  Therefore while not objecting to the philosophy which Deputy Colley has enunciated, I do not consider it is practicable or desirable to accept the amendment which he is offering, because I believe it would create a great deal more difficulty than benefits.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of it which I think is worthy of consideration is that it is argued in respect of wealth tax that one of the consequences of it will be to encourage people to pass substantial property to their children as soon as they attain 21 years of age.  It is argued &mdash;and I am not saying I accept the argument&mdash;that that is inappropriate, in that people of immature years will have control of substantial holdings of wealth and that it might be better for them and for society if they had not.  If that argument has validity in relation to the age of 21, it has a great deal more validity in relation to the age of 18 years.  The age of majority should not be looked upon as a complete blessing.  One of the advantages which a minor enjoys is immunity to claims which may be made against people who have attained the age of majority.</P>
      <P>While I have given very prolonged study to this matter by reason of the privilege which I had of being a <i>rapporteur</i> of a committee of the Council of Europe which was dealing with the matter for two years, I do not lightly adopt the idea of a total change in the law which would confer on anybody all the rights and responsibilities of seniority at the age of 18 years.  Perhaps on some other occasion the House will have the opportunity to debate the merits or otherwise of a proposal to amend the general law to bring the age of majority down to 18 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Deputy Colley's suggestion in relation to preserving the words at lines 18 to 20, I would observe that the effect now of the amendment which I am moving, which says that a child includes a child adopted under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1974, is to introduce for all purposes that particular description.  The reason why those words have to be used in the earlier draft is that it was related not <Col N="1898" /> merely to children adopted under the Adoption Acts of this country but also to cases where the adoption was in a place where that law applies and has substantially the same effect in relation to property rights as the Adoption Acts of 1952 to 1974.</P>
    <P>I am still personally of the view that there is no need to make a reference to the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1974, because those Acts make it clear beyond all argument that a child in Irish law includes a child adopted under the Adoption Acts.  However, I could see merit in providing as much information as possible in this Bill to people who would be concerned about all aspects of wealth tax, including the people who might be liable or free from liability, and as there is no contradiction in introducing the reference to the Adoption Acts in this Bill, I am prepared to accept the suggestion which Deputy Colley made on Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me refer the Minister again to his amendment No. 2 in regard to adopted children and tell him that what he has stated as being the position was my impression, too, until I looked at the Adoption Acts and found it was not so.  I was under the impression, as the Minister appears to be, that once the Adoption Act was introduced the words in lines 18 to 20 were automatically imported, but that is not so.  If you look at the <Col N="1899" /> Adoption Acts you will find these words are used in quite a number of sections.  Neither is it true to say, as the Minister said and obviously believes, and as I believed until I looked at the Adoption Acts, that the effect of the Adoption Acts is to put an adopted child in exactly the same position as a legitimate child of a lawful marriage in this country, for all purposes.  I believe that is what they should do, but it is not what they do. In fact, there are a number of sections which spell out that for purpose (a) a child adopted under these Acts &ldquo;shall be&rdquo;. . . . Then it goes on to say: &ldquo;For these purposes the child shall be deemed to be . . . &rdquo;.  Another section then deals with the adopted child for purpose (b) and spells it out, and these words are used again.</P>
      <P>That is why I have raised this point, because it is not true to say that the reference to a child adopted under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1974 automatically brings these words in for all purposes of this Wealth Tax Bill.  The Minister probably has not got these Acts available to him at the moment and I shall not press him on it, but what I am urging him to do is to have a look at them.  If he does he will see the point I am urging on him and he will see the necessity, first of all, of bringing in the reference to the Adoption Acts.</P>
      <P>Secondly, he will also see, I think, the necessity for retaining the words from lines 18 to 20 which his amendment proposes to delete.  This is not a matter on which there is any contention. I think everybody wants to achieve the same thing.  If the Minister has not the Adoption Act in front of him I will not press him but I would ask him to look at the situation and satisfy himself that the position is as he stated it and not as I have stated it.</P>

      <P>One of the reasons for what might be considered to be some lack of precision in the Adoption Act, is that that Act when originally introduced and as it still applies applies not merely to current and future events but, in certain circumstances, to past events like old settlements, <Col N="1900" /> but in this legislation we are dealing with events as from 5th April, 1975 and everything else is in the future.  I am certain that the definition we have now introduced in the amendment is the correct one, but the Deputy may be assured that we will examine the point he has raised.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1901" /> In page 3, line 46, to add &ldquo;except in relation to the year 1975 when it means the 5th day of October&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is in connection with the definition of &ldquo;valuation date&rdquo; and proposals to add to the existing definition in the Bill &ldquo;except in relation to the year 1975 when it means the 5th day of October&rdquo;.  The definition in the Bill is as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;valuation date&rdquo;, in relation to any year, means the 5th day of April in that year.</P>
    <P>The reasons for this amendment are first, that very many people understood from the Government's White Paper on Capital Taxation that it was the Government's intention to commence collection of wealth tax in 1976 whereas under the Bill before us it is proposed to commence collection of the tax in 1975.  The position is even more difficult for many people in that the production of the package of legislation&mdash;and it is not possible to view the wealth tax in isolation: it has to be viewed in the context both of the capital gains tax and the capital acquisitions tax&mdash;in its original form for submission to Dáil Éireann was delayed, so that we had in fact discussed two of the Bills here on Second Stage before the third Bill, the Capital Acquistions Tax Bill, was produced. Even now none of the Bills has been enacted in law and clearly it will be quite some time before they are all enacted through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Until they have been enacted it is not possible for people to know what their liability is in regard to capital taxation because changes may be made in the Bill as produced and it is clear, in regard to the Capital Gains Tax Bill of which the Committee Stage has just been completed that not only have there been changes during the Committee Stage but that there will be further changes on the Report Stage, quite apart from anything that might happen in the other House.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the Wealth Tax Bill to which quite a number of amendments have already been tabled, and we have not yet come to the Committee Stage of the <Col N="1902" /> Capital Acquisitions Bill but it is almost inevitable that the same thing will happen there.  That being so, it is quite impossible for taxpayers&mdash;and it will be for quite some time&mdash;to know what the law is with which they have to comply and how they can arrange their affairs in accordance with that law.</P>
    <P>The Government's White Paper on Capital Taxation specifically provided that an interval would be allowed for taxpayers who had arranged their affairs in accordance with existing death duty legislation to enable them to evaluate the implications of the changeover to the new capital taxation and to make any alterations that were necessary in their wills or arrangements they had proposed regarding their property.  That was the intention expressed by the Government but, as things worked out, that intention is not being complied with or honoured.  I do not say that this amendment would enable that intention to be complied with or honoured fully, but at least it would recognise the difficulties which are arising and give some opportunity to taxpayers to see&mdash;hopefully&mdash;all of the legislation in a final form and make arrangements accordingly and thereby become liable to taxation as proposed in these three Bills in a way that conforms not only with the law but with whatever area of discretion is left to them in the arrangement and disposition of their property.</P>
    <P>As things stand at present, the valuation date under this wealth Tax Bill is 5th April, 1975 and payment of tax is due during the three months following that.  There should be liability for interest on unpaid tax after three months at the rate of 18 per cent per annum but the Minister has informed us that he proposes to move an amendment which would have the effect of absolving people from interest on wealth tax which was paid before October next.  But that is still leaving the valuation date at 5th April last and is leaving people liable legally, once this Bill is enacted, for the payment of wealth tax within three months of the 5th April.  That is an indefensible position, a position in which people are liable legally to pay tax although the <Col N="1903" /> law under which they are being assessed and rendered liable is not passed and while nobody, not even the Minister, can say at this stage what will be the final form of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in an effort to meet this situation and to give some degree of legality to it, I am proposing that for this year the valuation date should be 5th October next.  That does not remedy the position but it goes some of the way towards doing so.  The effect of that would be that wealth tax for this year would not be due until 5th October and there would be three months allowed after that date in which to pay it and before liability for interest would commence.  I urge strongly on the Minister to accept this amendment or something similar to it and that he should recognise that a position which renders people liable legally for tax at a time when the law under which they are liable has not been enacted is indefensible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">

      <P>We have reached a new stage in legislation where we are talking of enactments that are not yet law but which are applicable legally. We are now reaching the end of the first week in June and wealth tax which eventually will come into force as a result of this Bill will be payable from April last.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley's amendment is reasonable and is intended to enable those people who will be assessable under this Bill to at least prepare to deal with the situation.  I do not know what people are doing so far in this regard but it is unusual that returns are due from 5th April last under a Bill which has not yet been passed. Although the Minister has expressed his intention of extending the period, the tax would be due legally in July. The Deputy's amendment would enable those fortunate enough to be assessable for wealth tax to make preparations for it.</P>

      <P>Since February, 1974 people have been aware of the Government's intention to introduce a wealth tax with effect from 5th April, 1975.  As a consequence of that <Col N="1904" /> throughout 1974 there was considerable public clamour for the production of the necessary legislation.  I met innumerable deputations to discuss the wealth tax proposals, the date on which it would become operative and so on.  At no time was there a suggestion from anybody that the White Paper did not forecast that the wealth tax would be operative as and from April, 1975.  It could not have been so said because it says on page 6 of the White Paper that the date of the commencement of the wealth tax would be 5th April, 1975 and that the new system would be operative fully for the year 1975-76.  It was only in March/April of 1975 there came forth the ingenious suggestion that the Government were bringing forward the date of the introduction of wealth tax.</P>
      <P>This is another example of all take and no give by some people who are not inclined to favour the taxation of substantial wealth.  I have never heard complaints from these people regarding the abolition of death duties with effect from April, 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since February, 1973 it has been made perfectly clear that estate duties would be eliminated and wealth tax introduced at one and the same time.  The argument being put forward may be a good debating point.  It might merit a mark or two at a child's debating society but it has no validity beyond that. The White Paper was explicit as to the date of the commencement of wealth tax.  It was clear that the valuation date would be 5th April each year and that this date carried with it a liability to pay the tax which became due as and from that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the special circumstances of this year I undertook during the Second Stage to introduce an amendment to extend the interest-free period from three to six months. I am doing this in amendment No. 18 which achieves substantially what is contained in Deputy Colley's amendment. His amendment would create <Col N="1905" /> considerable difficulty for many taxpayers. If it were to be adopted its effect would be that a new valuation date would be struck but already many prudent taxpayers have had property valuations assessed as and from 5th April, 1975 and these would now have to have new valuations carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of these people might not thank Dáil Éireann for making this change if the new valuations were to be at a higher level than the April, 1975 ones.  There is this further difficulty that valuation returns being made as at 5th October and possibly later would lead to a situation in which taxpayers would be called on to pay two loads of wealth tax, the first one, perhaps, in January and the next three months later, in April.  I consider it preferable to have the dates as far removed as possible from each other and to adhere to 5th April as the appropriate date for carrying out valuations and to meet the point about the special difficulties of this year by extending the interest-free period.</P>
      <P>Never has the introduction of taxation been announced so long in advance of the date on which it takes place.  It was forecast first in the White Paper of 28th February, 1974 and since then persons who are in the area of liability have had ample opportunity to make arrangements for valuations to be carried out.  There are some areas of uncertainty but the main bones have been there.  The liability has been known.  Fortunate are those who may have been relieved by changes in the threshold but by and large nobody has been taken by surprise by any of the amendments brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody has been disadvantaged by amendments made subsequent to the publication of the White Paper, only by any amendments tabled since the publication of this Bill, in February, 1975, again two months before the date of operation of the new tax, so that when one considers the fair and <Col N="1906" /> ample warning given of the introduction of the tax, how specific we were about the date of first valuations and of liability and that we are now extending the interest-free period for a further six months it will be seen that we have coped with the special problems created by the introduction of the new tax in a very fair way, indeed, and nobody can claim that he is at a disadvantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central</i>): I support the amendment and want to say that I completely disagree with the way in which the Capital Taxation Bill was brought before the House.  The cart was put before the horse in regard to the introduction of the Bills.  The Minister has spoken about abolishing death duties. We have welcomed that measure since it was first mentioned and I have always advocated that these duties were unpopular, but if we were being practical in our approach to legislation, we would not have the Capital Taxation Bill last week or the Wealth Tax Bill today.  If we had taken them in the proper order, when death duties were abolished the first Bill that should have come in is the Capital Acquisitions Bill.  This has not been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot from the Minister about how this wealth tax is necessary, how the capital gains tax is necessary and how the capital acquisitions tax is necessary to replace death duties.  We have gone over this only too often in relation to what was coming in from death duties and we know what death duties were bringing in over the past two years, roughly £13 million, and Deputy Colley is, indeed, very reasonable in his proposition for if I were writing that amendment, I would not alone postpone it to 5th October next but to 5th October, 1985 when the economy was in some way able to carry it.  A postponement for six months is very reasonable.  If the Minister were practical in his approach to the economy today, and the unsettled state of the economy, he would take the opportunity to go even later than that date for the implementation of the Bill.  He knows perfectly well that he has had <Col N="1907" /> representations from all groups of industry over the past three weeks, the FUE, the IFA, the ICMSA.  These have already submitted memoranda to the Minister setting out their views on the wealth tax, and if the Minister were sincere in his contribution&mdash;and he has asked these people to help and show how the economy can be helped&mdash;what he would do would be to defer this tax at this time because it will have a detrimental effect on the economy.</P>
    <P>He knows that in this amendment he has an opportunity to go some small way towards helping the economy by deferring the Bill to an even much later date than is asked for.  Deputy Colley is being very modest in his demand, because I would defer the introduction of the Bill for five years until the economy got back on its feet.  I thought we would be moving ahead with the Capital Acquisitions Bill, in which we can see many good sections which we welcome, as we said about the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  We did not fully oppose that Bill but tried to amend it and the Committee Stage served a very useful purpose.  The same attitude has been taken with regard to the Capital Acquisitions Bill, but this Bill which is going to undermine the economic confidence of the country is a different kettle of fish.</P>
    <P>The Minister should realise what Deputy Colley has in mind.  I know the Minister has the administrative point of view in mind.  The Wealth Tax Bill has not gone through the House and God only knows when this Bill will get through, but people are liable from 5th April to the wealth tax.  This will be an imposition on industry and we know the tight margins on which business people are trying to operate today.  We know the factories that have closed down.  I asked a question of the Minister for Industry and Commerce a fortnight ago about this matter and he informed me that 56 factories had closed down in the past 12 months.  I presume they will have to pay wealth tax.  I do not <Col N="1908" /> think they are exempt by virtue of the fact that they are not being operated.  There are many serious implications in the Bill which in my view is the most important to go through the House since I came here 11 years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems quite adamant in his decision to put it through but I ask him to consider very seriously the consequences of it.  He is only too well aware, far better than I am, of what the business community consider the implications of the Bill.  He has admitted that the amount of revenue to be collected from it will not be of great significance, but we must remember that three Bills are only to replace death duties, which amounted roughly during the past year, if properly assessed, to £15 million.  If we break that down, capital gains taking about 4 per cent, capital acquisition about 3 per cent, we arrive at a figure for wealth tax, if we take the Minister's figures, of £5 million or £6 million. This is what we are gambling with in the Bill.  Most of the damage is being done for the sake of this small figure. If a Bill like this could bring in £100 million and really help the economy, we would be legislating in a positive way because we could channel funds back into industry and social welfare but it is not in the Bill.</P>
    <P>That particular type of wealth will not come in from it in view of the thresholds in the Bill.  Once we take the 50 per cent valuation of agricultural land, you are going to find that they are all thresholds.  Taking agricultural land valued at 50 per cent, you can see the amount of land throughout the country that will be exempt.  All small businesses will be exempt, but we are directing this at people who are generating employment, a very small section of people but a section who generate employment, and this is the important factor and what we have to think about.  Whether the Minister likes it or not, before this Bill goes through he will be reminded of it on many occasions.</P>
    <P>I regard the amendment as very modest.  It would at least give business people time to assess their situation financially.  At the moment it is quite <Col N="1909" /> obvious that with unit costs climbing all the time, with inflation rampant, with bank charges high, this is 1 per cent of value of property.  This will have to be taken into consideration when costings are calculated.  This year wages increased by 25 per cent and the pay-related benefits accounted for 2 per cent, making a total of 27 per cent.  We are trying to export to European countries who have brought their inflation rate down to 7 or 8 per cent.  Italy has succeeded in reducing its inflation rate by an even greater precentage and they have no wealth tax even though they have much more minerals than Ireland.  There are several other European countries who have real wealth.  This country has had only 20 years since we started our industrial development and the industries concerned should have been given a chance.  The amendment by Deputy Colley is not demanding; it seeks to defer implementation of this measure to 5th October.  If I were the Minister for Finance I would defer it for five or ten years as my contribution to the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has talked about the realities of the situation in so far as he referred to the economic consequences of this Bill and what little might be achieved by postponing its operation.  I did not dwell on that aspect because I will do so at some length later on.  Nevertheless it is a most important and relevant aspect. So far as I am concerned, this Bill is a disaster for the economy, particularly at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment I am confining myself to the legal and administrative situation as we find it.  When one analyses the case made by the Minister against the amendment one finds that the real point he made was that the people who will be affected by the wealth tax have been given notice of its introduction.  Although changes have been made since the White Paper, nevertheless those who will be affected have been given notice.  In so far as the Minister is relying on people having been given notice, I would point out <Col N="1910" /> to him he is treading on dangerous ground.  Notice was given in writing by the Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave, on 24th February, 1973, to people that there would be no wealth tax.  In so far as people are to be held to rely on notice given, they were entitled to rely on notice in writing given by the Taoiseach.  I do not think it is good enough for the Minister to talk about the notice given in the White Paper. He avoided the real issue I put to him, namely, that he proposes to have people made legally liable for wealth tax, legally liable to assess their wealth and to pay tax on it.  He proposes that it will be assessed as on 5th April last, tax to be paid within three months of that date&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell him that is the position.  He is proposing they will not be liable for interest before 1st October but the provisions in the Bill are that the valuation be made on 5th April and that payment of tax be made within three months thereafter.  The Minister is not proposing to amend that.  The point is that when the Bill is enacted that will be the real position in respect of people who do not know the law.  I have been primarily concerned to avoid a situation in which people are being legally bound by legislation that does not exist.  This is not a case of notice being given of an increase in the rate of tax on some item from a certain date and its subsequent enactment.  This is a whole new code of taxation with a number of very complex provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any complex legislation, particularly if it involves taxation, which is being applied to people long before it is enacted so that the taxpayers concerned do not know what is the law at the time they are being subjected to the law, when they are obliged to have their property valued and when they are legally obliged to pay the tax is, in my view, indefensible.  I should like <Col N="1911" /> to hear the Minister's views on this.  He did not attempt to defend that position but unless he accepts my amendment we will have that position.  Even if he accepts the amendment there is no guarantee that it will not happen at some time in the future because we do not know when this Bill will be enacted.</P>
    <P>I made the amendment as reasonable and as modest as possible by referring to October.  Failure to accept the amendment means that the Minister and those behind him are saying they will enact legislation that will bind taxpayers from 5th April last, that will legally oblige them to pay tax three months afterwards.  The Minister and others are saying they do not care when the legislation is enacted, that they do not care that people do not know what the law was on 5th April or three months afterwards, that the only concession they will make to the facts of the situation, to what has happened to the legislation in relation to the Government's proposals in the White Paper, is to say that if people pay their tax before 1st October no interest will be charged on it.  Not just in relation to the wealth tax but as a general proposition, it is quite indefensible to make people liable in this way, under a complex piece of legislation and without their knowing what is the law.  It is a fundamental breach of the rights of citizens of any democracy to apply that kind of principle.  One can argue that in this case they will not be very adversely affected, although we do not know that.  But, if we accept the principle that you can do this, where is that going to end?  Does it mean that in future you can say, as from tomorrow everybody in a particular category will be subjected to a certain tax and, two years later, you can produce the legislation which spells out precisely what the category is and what the tax is and you make them liable from two years previously, and then extend that on and on.  There is a principle involved here and we should stand on it.  I would not have though it would be necessary from this side of the House to spell it out <Col N="1912" /> to Deputies on the other side; it should be quite clear.</P>
    <P>This amendment does not mean a loss of revenue.  It does not mean the Minister is being asked to concede any principle except the principle that taxpayers should not be subjected to and held legally liable for taxation under legislation which does not exist so that they do not know what the law is under which they are being made liable.  The necessity for maintaining these stances is so self-evident that I am surprised it has been necessary to put down this amendment at all.  I want to point out that the Minister, in replying to what I said when moving the amendment, did not deal at all with this point, which is the major argument in favour of the amendment if one ignores the economic realities referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  The Minister did not deal with that.  All he said was that, if taxpayers were given notice that there was going to be a wealth tax in operation, as he says, in 1975, that is sufficient, ignoring what has happened and what has failed to happen since the first announcement was made and ignoring the fact that, if people are to be bound by notice of that kind, they are entitled to rely on the notice given by the Taoiseach on 24th February, 1973, when he said that a wealth tax was not part of the Coalition then going before the people.</P>
    <P>I would invite the Minister to comment now on the real case that has been made for this amendment and not on an imaginary one; I would invite him to comment on the position arising where he proposes to make people legally liable for having their property valued and for paying tax under legislation which does not exist and which they cannot know.</P>

      <P>I should like to say something about this amendment and the Minister's explanation of the three months being added.  I would like to add my voice to the voices of those who have spoken urging the Minister to legalise the position almost certain to arise on 5th July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot really see how this Bill <Col N="1913" /> can become law, going through all stages here and through the Seanad, and finally becoming law, in any reasonable time before 5th April.  I do not know whether to say I would or would not be pleased to see it being passed before 5th April because, if it is passed much in advance of 5th April, it will mean of necessity that parts of the Bill may not have had the time for discussion we would all like them to have, especially legislation like this which is of a very fundamental character.  I would urge the Minister either to accept Deputy Colley's amendment or to bring in himself a somewhat similar amendment.</P>
    <P>The realities of the situation have been mentioned.  The reality is that the Minister has given 90 days of what one might call &ldquo;grace&rdquo; but, in dealing with a wealth tax, we are dealing with individuals, with estates and various things like that, with business people and not with people who have made fly-by-night quick change moneys here or there.  We are dealing with stakes people have had for quite a while and these people are not the kind of people who like to exist in an illegal position.  In fact, owing to their vulnerability they cannot place themselves in the position of owing money for the non-payment of which they could be heavily fined.  The Minister should alter that date.  I know that will mean consequential changes, perhaps even consequential difficulties, but I do not think they will amount to anything when set against the difficulties that will arise for people and for corporations who find themselves in the position of owing money illegally, being allowed by way of grace perhaps another three months for payment, and that is little enough time in which to assess the position.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that this was brought in in 1973 and that the people knew that this was coming.  I would like to remind the Minister that already the figure which was mentioned at the earliest date has changed radically and when a figure has changed so radically down to one per cent, as it is now, other radical changes can ensue and people could be pardoned for thinking changes would arise of necessity during the remaining stages of the <Col N="1914" /> Bill because the Minister would yield to the protestations and importunities of various bodies, some of which have been mentioned, who have been wearing a track to his door to get some of these anomalies corrected.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to place people under a legal disability which they cannot get out from under except by an alteration of the law or by, as I say, a certain number of days of grace.  But that is a wrong principle and I hope the Minister will find some way of altering it.  Changing it from three months to six months is a real effort to make it less onerous on the people concerned but that is not the only factor to be taken into consideration.  We will be legislating something which in the normal way is taken to be bad law, that is forcing people to break the law or leave themselves liable to a fine when there is no way they can get themselves out from under this.  When this Bill is passed we will need to give those people time to find out what they owe in the light of what the Bill will say is their liability.  Some people hope that a great deal of this will be done away with before the Bill leaves the House.</P>
    <P>It is important to give those people time to make the necessary financial arrangements.  In times of changing financial conditions, like those we are going through at the moment, one realises the value of property and of shares can change.  It is unfair to put a person in the position of having to sell out at the wrong time in order to find money to pay taxation, when he does not clearly know what the amount will be.  I hope that when the Minister replies he will be able to go into some of the points more clearly.</P>

      <P>I hope we will be able to carry on with this Bill in the same spirit as we did on the previous Bill.  Deputy Colley, Deputy Dockrell and Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick put what I might call the human merits side of the case for what is proposed here.  I <Col N="1915" /> would like to put the matter somewhat differently to the Minister.</P>
      <P>We have to have regard to section 2, which imposes the tax as an annual tax with effect from 5th April, 1975. Originally, if the Bill were passed by the 5th April, 1975 the tax would have become payable and similarly on every subsequent 5th April.  The legislation is not only not perfected but it has not reached any stage of finality so in contemplation of law at this moment and <i>a fortiori</i> at 5th April, 1975 there was no certainty whatsoever what the liability of the taxpayer was.  Until there is certainty it is impossible to make an assessment in a legal sense.</P>
      <P>We must have regard to what has happened on the previous Bill and what is likely to happen on this one. We must now come to the construction of this.  I want to put the case of somebody who comes into court after the Bill has been passed and challenges the validity of the assessment for this year. I am sure both the Minister and his opponent would be very pleased if the case I will outline has substance, to brief colleagues of theirs to argue a case in court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It might cost more than the tax to the State.  There is no certainty of liability and no possibility of ascertaining the legal position and making an assessment as on the date in the Bill until the Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put a novel case, which I have hinted at on the other Bill.  Even in contemplation of English law, where Parliament was supreme until today, the courts were completely bound by statute but even there they leant very strongly both against retrospection and in favour of the strictest construction of taxing statutes.  There is a general principle of jurisprudence of certain people before the law.  We have a different set-up.  Under our Constitution the Supreme Court are in a position analogous to the American judiciary and they have the duty to administer justice.  There are general <Col N="1916" /> clauses, like the provisions of Articles 40 and 43 in the Constitution, which deal with the rights of people and property.  It is perhaps tempting providence to tax a person at a date in respect of a liability that was completely unascertainable at that date. Would the Minister not be wiser, in his own interest, not only to extend the period of interest but also to extend the date of liability to the date of the passing of the Bill?</P>

I agree with Deputy Esmonde that, effectively, from the point of view of anyone who pays the tax, it would come to this, but we are now getting into very sticky ground and we will get into it further with this.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil group should have brought into this House somebody who knows something about this Bill; they did not up <Col N="1917" /> to then.  I mentioned particularly Deputy Haughey and Deputy Barrett. I am glad the latter is here.  Widows' weeds and crocodile tears were shed here this morning by Deputy O'Malley on behalf of the bookmakers. I should like to repeat that never since the introduction of legalisation of betting have the bookmakers had access to any Minister.  I speak as one who has been a bookmaker for more than 40 years.  If my memory serves me right, the late Seán T. O'Kelly introduced the Racing Board Act in 1945 and Deputy Paddy Smith introduced the Bord na gCon Act.  Those people never tried to get acceptance of the views of the people most concerned in the industry until now.  The bookmakers met, not alone the Minister for Finance, but the Taoiseach also. We are convinced, because of what the Taoiseach said to us that while he is in office&mdash;which will be for a long time&mdash;that what he is now doing is the right thing for the industry.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to 1945 when the Act was first introduced and when we were trying to plead to a Minister who would not see us.  I was one of those who was trying to plead with him: I tried to knock at his door but could not meet him.  We were told then indirectly, outside this House, by certain people who were members of Fianna Fáil and bookmakers, that this and that would be done.  However, we could never get in to talk to a Minister about the whole thing.  We did this yesterday.  Bookmakers are happy with the reception by the Taoiseach yesterday. We are satisfied that the 1 per cent being introduced will be provided particularly for the smaller man, such as Deputy Crowley, who has&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We will stand on our own feet.  We got assurances that we never succeeded in getting while Fianna Fáil were in power.  At the same time they took our subscriptions, our contributions and our heavy levies to the Fianna Fáil Party.  Now they shed crocodile tears for us.  We can look after our own profession and we do not need Deputy O'Malley to tell us about something we have been born, and reared in.

I want to assure the Taoiseach again that everybody is happy and satisfied with what is contained in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crowley mentioned our show jumpers.  The show jumpers were <Col N="1919" /> knocked completely by Fianna Fáil and we had the Dan Corrys, the Gerry Dwyers of Limerick and the Cyril Hartys who made our showjumpers famous all over the world, and what happened?  Fianna Fáil withdrew their travelling allowances, their expenses, their entertainment, and the Army jumping team collapsed because of the action of nobody else but the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I am prepared and I am sure the whole Coalition are prepared to see the Army jumping team and the bloodstock from our nation properly represented and wearing our colours in international fields, but it is very hard to dig a ridge that has already been covered and sown over by Fianna Fáil. Again we will have the Gerry Dwyers and the Cyril Hartys if we can only go back to the days when these people were treated properly.</P>
    <P>Let there be no misunderstanding in anybody's mind within Fianna Fáil, we are satisfied with the contents of this Bill.  We have encouraged it and we wanted it because, as I have said, we are the cheapest racing nation in the world.  Our racing has been kept to a minimum of 1945 prices, admission fees, free carriage for horses, owners, trainers and all the people concerned, more than any place else in Europe, and the world is satisfied because of what we are doing.  By putting an increase of 1 per cent on the levy charged we believe that, without our recommendation which has already gone to the Taoiseach and which he is considering and which will go back to him for further consideration, this Bill will provide for the bloodstock industry something that was never achieved previously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>My first inkling that such a Bill was in the pipeline was when the Minister for Finance made his budget speech.  At that time he made reference to an increase in the levy from 5 per cent to 10 per cent. My first reaction at that time was to indicate that I would be totally against that 10 per cent.  It is with reluctance that I would agree to the 6 per cent that has been mentioned here, but we must remember that, no matter what <Col N="1920" /> assurances are given to certain members of a certain fraternity behind closed doors and that might not subsequently be adhered to, what we must apply ourselves to is what is actually in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as I read it, proposes to increase the levy on course betting from 5 per cent to a possible 10 per cent. I know we are told now that it will be only a 1 per cent increase, to 6 per cent, but human nature being what it is, if we give the Racing Board a free hand to increase it as they think fit, people will need a little more, and so the 6 per cent in 1976 will surely become 7 per cent in 1977.  I can see the percentage keeping pace with the years, and by the time we get to 1980 we will have a 10 per cent increase in the levy.</P>
      <P>Our attitude on this side of the House is to ask the Taoiseach to ensure that the 6 per cent that he has promised and that he is quite willing to grant to Members on the otherside of the House be written into the Bill. If it is necessary for the Racing Board to come back and look for an increase they can come back to us and we will meet them as we are meeting them now with the interests of racing and the interests of the bloodstock industry at heart.  We should remember that at the moment the levy is a percentage levy. If the betting goes well there is every reason to hope that the percentage will go well too and an examination of the figures, which I will deal with later, shows that there has been a substantial increase in betting each year.  There would need to be a substantial increase to keep pace with inflation, but the increase perhaps is more than the inflationary increase, and, therefore, as things stand now 6 per cent in a good year should be enough to keep the wheels turning and allow the Racing Board to achieve what they hope for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that a 10 per cent increase would put a stop to a great deal of betting.  People who go to a race meeting now and have a £1 bet on each of the six races realise that they are going to pay 30p to the Exchequer. The proposal now is that it be made 36p even if they never back a winner.  That is enough to expect <Col N="1921" /> anyone to pay and we should not give anyone <i>carte blanche</i> to do more than that.</P>
    <P>I have listened attentively to the people who have spoken on this Bill. I have listened to the Taoiseach.  I am glad that we have a Taoiseach who is a racing man and a horse man and that somebody has intervened with the Minister for Finance to ensure that the 10 per cent he mentioned on budget day will be cut to a proposed 6 per cent now.  However, as I said before, I would like to see that figure written into the Bill hard and fast so that we could be sure it was there.  I have also listened to Deputy O'Malley and, unlike those who are carping in their criticism from the opposite side, I feel that he made a very good case.  He examined the Bill and examined the previous Bill to such effect that he was in a position to point out that there might be a possible flaw in the previous Bill and that the poor, unfortunate bookmakers out of their winnings are giving far more in taxation than they are required to give.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure some of them feel very strongly about that. Deputy O'Malley, in his contribution, showed that he had done his homework well as regards this Bill.  I listened to Deputy Crowley, too, who dealt with the future of the racing industry and further explained the need for assistance to this very valuable industry.  I listened to Deputy Coughlan before and after lunch and in the main I felt that he dealt in abuse of Deputy O'Malley.  He questioned Deputy O'Malley's motives in coming in here to speak on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  Everybody who has spoken on the Bill up to now was interested in the Bill from a racing point of view.  They looked on it as a very valuable industry, both racing and bloodstock, and they looked for its improvement and preservation. But Deputy Coughlan spoke as a bookmaker.  His interest in racing stems from the fact that he handles <Col N="1922" /> money and not horses.</P>
      <P>I have often heard it said that those that deal a lot with horses become equine in their appearance.  I dare say that those that deal in money become very merciless and that their life is guided by the fact that they are dealing solely in money.  To me as a representative of Kildare I think horses are lovely and I think that money is dirty.  Everything that Deputy Coughlan has said has convinced me of that particular view.</P>
      <P>I would like to deal with this Bill and horse racing as an industry and I need hardly stress to the Taoiseach or anyone else how important it is to my county where it gives employment in many ways.  The first type of employment that springs to mind and the people with whom I am more closely allied than any others would be the stable lads.  We have trainers and farriers and saddlers.  We have a market for straw and oats and hay.  In an indirect way we have a market for contractors, erection of buildings and pailings and digs for stable boys.  I am a little worried that we have running this country a cabinet that is composed of certain people about whose interest in racing I am very dubious.</P>
      <P>I am particularly doubtful about the interest of the present Minister for Post and Telegraphs.  I read a book he wrote called <i>&ldquo;The States of Ireland&rdquo;</i> and in one of the chapters he devoted considerable time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He felt that anyone who lived in a fashion where horses played a conspicuous part was a very low type indeed.  I hope that that feeling has not permeated the rest of the Cabinet.  But I have a feeling that, like woodworm in any other cabinet, that is likely to happen.</P>
      <P>We are fortunate in this country to have the climate and the bloodstock that we have and for many years we have been exporting horses to many countries.  I remember in my young days horses being exported to Russia and South Africa and Belgium, and in spite of the fact that more recently many of the horses that are winning our best races have not been bred in Ireland it is apparent that to renew the line all these people must come back to Ireland to purchase new stock from us.  Our climate and our land and our limestone seem to give horses that particular quality that is not available or that is bred out in other countries.</P>
      <P>We are fortunate that we have an industry that has taken a position in the shop window of the world, and we should not take this for granted and we should foster it in every way we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned that it is necessary to increase our prize money. The need for this is apparent.  Yesterday, we had an English Derby that was worth £106,000.  We should remember that the prize money that is available to owners here in Ireland is very much less than the prize money available to the people in England and particularly in France.  Our leading trainer last year, who had over 100 winners here in Ireland would, I am sure, have cause for thought if he viewed the prize money garnered by those 100 winners and the prize money that was gained by some of his entries who won some of the prestige races in England.  Possibly it is a sobering thought that the owner of those horses, who transferred those horses here to Ireland as a result of certain taxation proposals in England last year, has now brought them back to England again.  The Bill that was being debated a few minutes <Col N="1924" /> ago before this House, the Bill on wealth tax, has driven many people out of racing in Ireland and has made the future of the breeding industry and the future of investment by very wealthy people and the consequent employment very doubtful indeed.</P>
    <P>I am not so much concerned with the increase in big prize money for prestige races.  Yesterday when the Derby was being run in England we had racing in two venues here in Ireland and there was a sizeable field for a stake of £345 in Sligo.  It is essential that we improve our prize money at our small meetings rather than the big prestige races even though they may be at the Curragh, Leopardstown and the Park.  From looking at the figures and from a study of racing over a considerable number of years I believe that we have at the moment in our country too many bad horses in training.  This is to be seen every time there is a maiden race or a four- or five-year-old hurdle.  They usually have to be divided and we have horses there that are unlikely ever to win a race. We should remember that many wealthy people are not in racing for the purpose of making money; it is a hobby with them.  Many people who keep a horse down the country would hope that they will get a winner that will keep them in business and if they do not, they will probably be out of business.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley, during his contribution, divided the prize money available for the year by the number of horses in training and he came up with a figure that each horse is likely to get something in the region of £300 or a little more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>But he omitted free transport and little or no cost for admission.  Figures can be baffling and there is no greater baffler in this House than Deputy O'Malley.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>If you take all that into account even the Taoiseach admitted that it is conservative to say that £1,200 a year would keep a horse in training.  I am sure it would be <Col N="1925" /> nearer the £2,000 mark.  An owner would hope to gain £300 by investing £2,000.  Not many people are in a position to do that.  I think we should discourage some of the owners that we have.  If this can be done there would have to be a limit placed on the amount of horses in training because there is a limit to the amount of horses that racing can absorb in this country, just as there is a limit to the amount of horses that we can breed and hope to sell and keep our industry viable.</P>
      <P>It has been mentioned here by a representative of the bookmakers that the 6 per cent increase is a delight to them, that they are entirely happy with this.  I can see that this 6 per cent increase will lead to a need for a great amount of small coins, and I would hope that the representative of the bookmakers will make it clear to his colleagues that they should come to each race meeting with plenty of small change.  I trust that those people who receive your bet quite graciously will pay out just as graciously and will not ask if you have your tax ready.  I hope that when we bring to their notice the fact that this 6 per cent, the extra one per cent, which will prove difficult to pay in taxation, should be very acceptable to them and that their representative here in the House was quite happy with it.  I hope we will have no quibbles with any bookmaker over paying, particularly after the last race.</P>
      <P>I am glad that an appeals committee for bookmakers is to be set up. This is something that is needed.  It has already been in existence in the greyhound industry.  The appeals board that is likely to be set up will possibly benefit from some of the flaws that were seen in that earlier one.  Bookmakers have a right to appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Racing Board on having machinery at their disposal to allow the punters the right to appeal. I had an unfortunate experience at Punchestown when a bookmaker refused to pay me but when I brought a member of the Racing Board to him I was paid.  This type of appeal <Col N="1926" /> board would have to be a two-way zone.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley mentioned that the penalties to be imposed on those who contravene the regulations appear to be substantial.  I presume the penalties are in keeping with the amount of money that those who are hoping to defraud the Exchequer are likely to make.  I suppose they are needed for that.  What happens to the penalties imposed?  Perhaps they could be ploughed back into racing rather than to go to the Exchequer. Very little off-course betting tax, apart from the £100,000 mentioned by the Taoiseach, finds its way back into racing.  If we are sincere about improving our racing industry we would&mdash;as they do in other countries &mdash;improve the conditions and plough the money back into the industry.</P>
    <P>We must approach the whole problem with open minds.  Racing is not the preserve of the rich.  Our approach should be a helpful one rather than one which milks it of everything possible.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Taoiseach mentioned the National Stud.  I, too, would like to join with the compliments that have been paid to this establishment. I compliment them on the steady progress they have made particularly in the last few years.  I am aware that they have made a considerable profit. The stud is being run as a model stud should be run.  I am very proud to be able to bring visitors from abroad to our National Stud and let them see what we have on offer.  Being a National Stud and their business being known to everyone they are often cockshots for criticism.  Some considerable criticism was levied at them some years ago when Tulyar was bought and there was subdued criticism when he was subsequently sold. I am sure there will be criticism now that Whistling Wind has been sold to Japan and his progeny has won races with uncomfortable regularity. In general the National Stud is providing high class stallions at a subsidised fee to our producers are doing a tremendous job.</P>
    <P>The availability of chasing sires to <Col N="1927" /> breeders is something that could be improved.  It is impossible to recognise a chasing sire and in many cases the sire is dead before his progeny has made the grade.  Those who would look upon Red Rum and his sire and ask: &ldquo;how would you pick out a chasing sire?&rdquo; would probably be right.  There have been studs in Kildare that have produced sires like Fortino, Vulgan, and Bargello.  They seem always to be in the forefront as far as chasing sires are concerned.  I was hoping that the present sire in the National Stud, Guilymar, might prove his usefulness in this category but he has not done so up to now.  I hope another look will be given to this and help given to the people who are in the business of producing horses for jumping or for stores at a later stage.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that this Bill has a 10 per cent maximum, that this maximum could be imposed at the will of the Racing Board and that this would cause an increase in illegal betting.  I think that would happen if it was increased to 10 per cent because there would be twice as big an incentive to avail of illegal betting and to take part in illegal betting than there is now.  Six per cent may not have much effect in this regard but I hope it is 6 per cent that is adhered to.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley mentioned that the £100,000 paid to the Racing Board by the Exchequer is more than is paid back by way of tax and that this tax was only increased to this amount recently.  It is an indication of the Government's attitude that they take from racing rather than invest in racing.  I am glad that the proposal will lead to increased grants to racecourses.  Many racecourses are said to be losing money.  I would have hoped that no further efforts will be made to close down any of the existing racecourses.  I have seen the demise of two in Mullingar and certain others were scheduled for the guillotine too but I am glad that has been stopped.  There was a system of grading of racecourses at that time and certain racecourses were not to get any help.  I am glad to see that they have got a reprieve.  Some of them&mdash;<Col N="1928" /> like Kilbeggan&mdash;which were due for the guillotine and were reprieved have proved very successful.</P>
    <P>Racing plays an important role as an assistance to tourism.  It would be well to remember that there was racing in Tralee before there was any rose but it might be difficult to have a rose in Tralee without having the races.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was racing in Tralee before the Deputy was born.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McEllistrim was telling me about Deputy Coughlan's activities in Tralee.  The Galway and Tramore meetings in August are other examples of racing being the cornerstone of a festival.  In any other industry we would expect grants and subsidies from the Government rather than to be taxed.</P>
      <P>In racing we have dealt with the problems of the owners and the trainers. Deputy Crowley dealt with the problems of the jockeys, particularly national hunt jockeys.  I would like to comment on the wages now being paid to stable boys.  There has been a furore in England on this subject which led to picketing and a strike at Newmarket. Stable boys' wages are low; their hours are long, the work is hard but the perks are fairly limited.  We were told that the Minister for Labour had in his Department certain people who were kite flyers, so to speak, people who were in a position to give advance warning of trouble.  It might be well that these precursors of distress would apply themselves to this problem of stable boys, particularly in the Curragh area and see if they could help.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coughlan said that he never solicits.  Every successful bookmaker I know seems to solicit all the time because they are always shouting their odds.  If that is not soliciting I do not know what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the Government and in particular this city Cabinet would realise that we are dealing with the racing and bloodstock industry.  We are dealing with an industry which gives great employment. It is an industry in which, even now, there is no recession.  While we have factories in distress in Kildare, in racing there is no one on a five-day week.  The poor fellows involved in <Col N="1929" /> racing are all on a seven-day week. There is no cut-back.  They are doing this without any significant help from the Exchequer by way of grants or subsidies.  I am sure they are a help to tourism.  In many cases races are the major attraction around which a festival is built and they provide a market for our produce in many ways.</P>
    <P>The people involved in breeding and ownership of racehorses are very upset by the wealth tax.  I am confident of that and I know I have the facts right, and other taxes.  We should realise that owners as such are not in racing to make money, that if the leading ten owners in any year and their winnings were bracketted on one side and the cost of keeping the strings of horses in training bracketted on the other side the cost of keeping the horses in training would be much more than the amount of prize money they have won&mdash;and they are the leading ten owners.  It is no wonder, then, that they are forced to bring off a coup on occasions.  It is dubious whether this is a wise thing to do with the present climate here and in England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not frighten them away.  In spite of the criticisms I have made I would like to pay tribute to the Racing Board.  They do a good job for racing and I want them to continue to do so.  For many years, the winning of the Derby by any English challenger was a formality but even this year, yesterday's English Derby winner has indicated that he might come over for our Sweeps Derby here. It is no longer a formality and it is due to the efforts of many people that this has been changed and even reversed and our challengers can go over there and pose a threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute, too, to the firms that sponsor our racing.  It is good advertising for them and it is money well spent.  I am glad that admission charges are being kept down.  I would hope that this would have the effect of attracting more people to racing.  I would like to compliment <Col N="1930" /> various managements in different racecourses&mdash;Punchestown, for one&mdash;for their family day, and other racecourses who have innovations like this to attract more people to racing.  When we see a million people have gone racing in Ireland in a year it sounds a big figure, but when you divide it up among all the race meetings we have it is not such a very big figure at all.  I would prefer that the racing in Ireland was at the stage where the present 5 per cent of a bigger amount that would be got from betting each year by a bigger race going public would be more than the 6 per cent that might be got from a diminishing attendance.</P>
    <P>We know, if we examine the amount in betting, that there was £11.8 million bet in 1970.  These were bets with the books.  That increased from £11.8 million to £18.4 million in 1974; at the same time, Tote betting increased in the same year from £4.4 million to £5.8 million.  That to me represents a pretty steady increase and therefore the percentage increase should have been steady too.  I would ask the Taoiseach to ensure that this Cabinet, his National Coalition Government, approach racing and betting with the view of people anxious to help, to put in rather than to take out.  I am happy enough to accept the extra 1 per cent increase if it is needed now and if it will do good to racing.  We are happy enough to settle for that.  I trust the Minister will accept 6 per cent only for now and that he will not look for a potential 10 per cent to be used by the Racing Board at will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the Irish horse has been a great ambassador for our nation.  In every racecourse in the world, in every showjumping centre, the Irish horse has brought credit and honour to this country.  I would like to pay a tribute to our Taoiseach for coming here and introducing this Bill.  When I look back I can remember the support the late President Cosgrave gave to horse breeding and to horse-racing.  It is no wonder that his son should continue to take an interest in these activities. <Col N="1931" /> In that I include Mrs. Cosgrave whose family have been associated with the breeding and training and racing of horses and whose family have produced the best horses in the world.  I would also like to mention several other families here&mdash;it would take a long time to speak of them all &mdash;who have assisted racing, and I will not forget to mention Joe McGrath, who started a stud here and whose horses won every important race in the British Isles and outside it.</P>
      <P>Racing has given considerable employment here and if anything happened that would reduce that employment, it would have serious consequences for the country.  It is up to us here in Dáil Éireann to do everything we can to help the industry at this time.  With regard to the money involved in prizes, as Deputies opposite said, inflation has reduced its value and prize money must be increased to keep pace as far as possible with inflation. I had the prilivege of being in Cheltenham when that great racehorse won the Cheltenham Gold Cup for the first time.  I was amazed to see the number of Irish exiles who attended that meeting and were so proud to be associated with an Irish winner.  Indeed, the Irish roar as they call it at Cheltenham is recognised as meaning that a big percentage of those who follow the sport are Irishmen.  Many of them may give up their day's hire or week's hire to attend these races.</P>
      <P>The same applies to showjumping, whether in the White City, Rome, Canada or the United States.  Our horses and riders have indeed brought the name of Ireland to the fore. Visitors from those countries have come here and bought our Irish horses and indeed those horses have been recognised as the best the world can produce.  I hope we will continue breeding and keeping this type of horse and that we will give to the breeders every assistance we possibly can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Stud is doing great work for the small breeder.  This was initiated very recently and I want to thank them for it because without that help small breeders would not be <Col N="1932" /> able to pay the big fees demanded and given for those great sires that are at international studs.</P>
    <P>One aspect of horse breeding I would like to draw to the attention of the House is the breeding of showjumpers principally from the Irish draught mares.  I believe that enough encouragement is not given to the breeding and keeping of these mares. If that breed is to be kept and encouraged, a substantial sum must be given to the owners to keep them and breed from Irish draught stallions.</P>
    <P>If that is not done, we will lose the foundation stock for our showjumpers. While some advance has been made recently, and more nominations have been given for this type of mare, it is not really enough, that the best type should be given at least the sum of £50 towards the holding and the breeding of Irish draught horses.  They are the foundation of our showjumpers and if we lose them we will not be able to replace them. Anything that can be done to help the horse-breeding industry should be done and I know every member of my party will agree with me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this Bill.  Having heard Deputy Power's contribution&mdash;I did not hear the earlier ones&mdash;I feel he covered the course very well.  He did an excellent job of going through all the different facets and features of racing and showed a deep knowledge of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also heard Deputy Coughlan's contribution.  We know that the bookmakers are always very happy&mdash; rarely have I seen an unhappy one.  I do not think the punters worry very much whether the bookmakers are happy or not but we like to see Deputy Coughlan happy.  He is pleased with everything contained in the Bill even though he was critical of Fianna Fáil.  He said we robbed the horse-breeding industry and did everything possible to harm it.  Everybody knows that it was under successive Fianna Fáil Governments that racing reached its present standard, where we have become an important nation as regards the breeding of horses.  It was under Fianna Fáil that <Col N="1933" /> racing was commenced after the last war when it had been curtailed because of rationing and it was under Fianna Fáil that the Irish Sweeps Derby was started.  Therefore, our party did not do much harm to the racing industry.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill, we all appreciate, as the Taoiseach said in his opening speech, the importance of racing and the bloodstock industry to the country.  It is an industry that has survived and expanded and it contributes a great deal to our balance of payments.  We hope it will continue to expand.</P>
    <P>It was due to the efforts of the people involved in the industry that it expanded.  Many of them never got much out of it despite the fact that racing, over the years, was identified as the sport of the rich.  It is far from that.  Without the small punter and the ordinary racegoer there would be no racing.  It would probably reach the stage where two horses would be racing, watched by two millionaires. The racing public are all important and must be given first consideration.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the breeders, owners, jockeys and stable lads.  The owners are most important because without them there would not be any horses.  Conditions must be sufficiently attractive to encourage people to own and train horses because it not easy to do that today.  If the overall charges were estimated they would be in the region of £2,000 and it would probably be higher in the Dublin area than in the south and west.  Horse-owners, particularly the small man must have some incentive to continue.  We are not concerned with the millionaire-type of horse-owners who have horses in training with the O'Briens and Prendergasts and many other trainers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Costellos?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No millionaire owners there.  These people are not interested in the stake money; they are interested in the glory of winning the Irish Sweeps Derby, the Epsom <Col N="1934" /> Derby, the Prix de l'Arc de Triumphe, the Grand National or the Cheltenham Gold Cup.  The people who race horses at Limerick, Tralee, Thurles or Galway are the small owners.  They have often to struggle to keep a horse in training but they enjoy racing and like to be involved in the industry. The only way it can be made worthwhile for these people is to have increased stake money.  It is ridiculous at present to have a large number of horses racing for a first prize of £207. It bears no relation to the increasing costs of being involved in racing. Therefore, we should try to get the Racing Board to do something about stake money.  Stake money in the metropolitan area is better than on provincial tracks.  The percentage should be confined to 6 per cent and not be left open to 10 per cent when the Racing Board decide to apply for permission to increase it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also maintain that the 1 per cent, the extra money which would come from the Racing Board, should be put into stake money.  Without increased stakes racing will not be improved.  I am not thinking of the large races but of the provincial tracks.  Even 1 per cent of the bookmakers' course levy, the total for 1974 was £896,000, comes to a very sizable sum, and it would be a tremendous injection of prize money. It would have a most beneficial effect on our racing industry.  It would give a great fillip to present owners and would encourage new people to become involved.  At present people do not feel that it is worth while racing for £200 or £207 for first prize.  The only way they can subsidise their costs is to try to get involved in a gamble to the detriment of the bookmakers, of course.  There is nothing wrong with gambling.  It has always been part of horse racing and part of greyhound racing.  There is nothing like a good, healthy, clean gamble, though the bookmakers are not too happy when the gamble comes off.  Most racegoers, particularly Irishmen, like a good gamble.  They admire people when they bring it off.  In this country, when a good gamble is brought off, the bookmakers do not whinge so much as bookmakers across the water, something <Col N="1935" /> we witnessed a few months ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not have objected, of course, if the horse had lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we know, our own bookmakers who were involved in this particular gamble paid out without a word but we cannot say the same about the fraternity across the water, who started whinging, roaring and crying and created a great fuss when they were caught with their trousers down.  As Deputy Crowley said, we would not have heard one word about it if &ldquo;Gay Future&rdquo; finished up that day without a future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not even have refunded the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not have thought of refunding it.  The smaller stake money brings in more and more gambling but there is no way of stopping that.  The tendency to concentrate on the returns from gambling in racing is greater when there is nothing else to race for.  There must be some incentive.  The small owners are the people who must be looked after and £170,000 odd is a sizeable amount of money, if it is ploughed back properly into the provincial tracks and the stake money which is so very inadequate.</P>
      <P>As everyone appreciates, the industry has always stood on its own feet and has added in no small way to our balance of payments through exports down through the years, whether they be foals, yearlings, unraced two-year-olds, or even the horses in training. We have sent abroad some of the finest horses in the world, not only to England, France and America, but to other countries where they have performed with great distinction.  They will continue to do so and will bring fame and establish the names of the sires here in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The breeding side is all important. There are many fine studs here, some privately owned and some owned by foreigners.  They have, undoubtedly, an important function and have produced some very fine horses and sires with a great racing history and performance behind them.  The <Col N="1936" /> National Stud is most important but the very expensive sires there are beyond the reach of the small breeders. It is only proper that they should have available to them top-class sires at reasonable fees.</P>
    <P>Breeding of light racers can be very chancy.  Every year we read about the Ballsbridge and Newmarket autumn sales, about prices like £50,000 and £60,000 and about all those that make the big money.  However, if one looks down the small print there are always some down in the three figures as well.  The sires and dams of these are usually found to be fairly well bred.  Some people can be lucky and make a lot of money, if they hit on the right strain, but there are many more who take the risk of paying the stud fee, hoping for the best, and are not so lucky.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the National Stud is all-important as the foundation of racing, so as to ensure that our small breeders will continue in business and will have available to them top-class sires at reasonable stud fees.  The National Stud have had some fine sires.  They have given big money for some of them.  They gave big money for one that was a total failure, namely, Tulyar, even though he was a Derby and a St. Leger winner.  They were lucky to sell him when they did at a reasonable figure.  They have also imported some French and other strains in order to make top-class sires available to the small breeders and we hope they will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power mentioned the fact that the national hunt side of horse breeding should be looked at with a view to having better sires.  It takes time to realise that a sire is a national hunt proposition.  The national hunt horse does not develop as early in life.  We hope that our national hunt will be fully maintained and that the National Stud will look to the national hunt side of breeding.  We all love to see the Derby and to see five furlong sprints, but the sight of a really good steeplechase is really the tops in racing.  We know the attraction of the English and Irish Grand Nationals, or even the Galway Plate every year.  Even the stay-at-home <Col N="1937" /> public watch them on television.  I regret to say that Mallow racecourse has no decent big race in the year, although it is the only racetrack inside the boundaries of County Cork. The Cork people should do something about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It does and, in all fairness, it is the largest county in Ireland and, with such an interest in racing, there is room for development within the boundaries of County Cork. In County Kerry, where I do not think there is one horse trained, they have three festival meetings each year with some quite attractive races: Killarney, Tralee and Listowel.  This is something that the Cork people might consider.</P>

      <P>There is one in a place called Miltown Malbay but it is too near the Atlantic Ocean.  There was too much sand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We notice that the total number of bloodstock in the country is 20,000 and the number of horses in training is 4,600.  I do not know if that is an increase in recent years or if the numbers are going down.  I should have thought that the number of owners is not increasing because of the lack of prize money at the provincial tracks.  I understand that there is now a tendency of people grouping <Col N="1938" /> together to form a small group of four or five people to buy a horse.  This is the most economic way to do it.  The more money we can put before owners in the form of stakes, the better it will be for racing and for the racing public, who are the all-important people, and it will probably be even better for the bookmakers from time to time.  One per cent will give £170,000 or thereabouts.  If this sum was devoted towards the prize money on this occasion and the increase confined to 6 per cent we would be doing a great day's work for the racing industry, for the breeding industry and for our entire bloodstock industry, which is the first essential.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan mentioned that Fianna Fáil played hell with the Irish jumping team, show jumpers and so forth.  I do not subscribe to this idea at all.  It was during Fianna Fáil periods of government that these show jumpers, the Army jumping team and so on, improved and became internationally famous.  Again, it was under Fianna Fáil in very recent years that Bord na gCapall was set up.  They are trying to set about the task of improving our current show jumping image as far as they are able and trying to do so in a business-like way.</P>
    <P>This is a very difficult task, as most people realise, because the current prices for good, promising established show jumpers or nearly established show jumpers is so high because of the demand from foreign purchasers that it is prohibitive, first of all, for Irish people to retain them because the sale price for them is too tempting and, secondly, it is prohibitive for Irish people to purchase them in order to retain them.  There is bound to be a big export market for top-class show jumpers.  Bord na gCapall attempted to overcome this difficulty not only by purchasing a few horses themselves but also by trying a system of leasing horses.  It seemed to bring about some improvement and we hope this will continue.</P>
    <P>We also hope that our Army jumpers will remain in business and improve.  They had a few lean years because the horses they had were not performing very well.  We always seem <Col N="1939" /> to compare them with the great days of show jumping when we had Daniel Corry, Colonel Aherne and Captain Tubridy, whom Deputy Coughlan left out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We always seem to think in terms of those great days.  The Army have had some lean years and we hope that situation will not continue indefinitely.  Through Bord na gCapall an attempt was made by the previous Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to tackle the problems about which most people were becoming critical, particularly around the time of the Aga Khan Trophy at Ballsbridge when we were not successful for some years.  I suppose it is only natural that people would be critical when they were accustomed to hearing so much about performances of Irish teams in the past.</P>
      <P>We are not critical of the basic principle in this Bill.  The bookmakers have accepted it but they will not be paying the increase.  It is the punters who will be paying it but the bookmakers will be collecting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is quite common and the bookmakers seem to accept it. We believe that 10 per cent is too much.  It is an exorbitant amount. Raising it to 6 per cent at present is quite acceptable to us but our recommendation is that the extra 1 per cent and the money involved, £170,000, should, as a priority, be ploughed back into increasing the miserable stake money which many owners are racing for and which is really not worth considering.  If you win you get £207 in many races and the place money is really negligible.  Without good stake money you will not maintain racing.  One example of this is France, where there is a thriving racing industry.  France has tremendous stakes even down to the fourth horse.</P>

      <P>They have no bookies but I am not anti-bookie by any means.  France is probably the leading <Col N="1940" /> racing country on this side of the Atlantic.  We are famous but our stake money does not compare with the French.  The French have surpassed Britain, which was the leading racing country for years.  British stake money does not compare favourably with French stake money even though their Derby was worth over £100,000 yesterday.</P>
      <P>Our stake money compares very unfavourably also with English stake money, if you look at the average stake money paid in England.  The strongest recommendation we can make from this side of the House is that the stake money be improved because by doing so you improve the standard of racing and you get more people involved in it.  If you improve racing and have even more runners you will attract more and more people through the turnstiles, the bookmakers will have a large turnover and the 1 per cent will escalate immediately because you will have an increased turnover going through the books and through the tote, which also contributes towards racing.  I recommend that the increase be confined to 6 per cent and that an increase in the stake money be the first priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">

      <P>The Bill before the House has received quite a considerable welcome from both sides.  The Opposition will be happy if the levy is retained at 6 per cent so that a greater amount of money will be available to increase stakes and prizes.  It is extremely necessary that the prize money be increased substantially if we are to retain our place in the racing world.  Indeed, if it were not for the sponsors in recent years we might very well not be in the happy position in which we are regarding the racing business today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other items which cry out for attention, apart from the increase in stakes, such as the amenities and facilities provided in various racecourses. Many of them are extremely old and lacking in facilities.  When they are privately owned they certainly are not in a financial position to modernise and bring them up to the standards which are required <Col N="1941" /> today.  If something, is not done speedily in this direction I can foresee a considerable fall-off in attendances and they certainly will not be a tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was very emphatic in his opening speech this morning that bloodstock is a tourist attraction but he also said we must not be complacent. It is on those words that I would like to base the next few remarks. We must not be complacent. If we just go on increasing stake money or prize money and neglect the other items we will find ourselves very shortly trying to lock the door when the horse is gone.</P>
    <P>One of the bodies which came in for very highly deserved praise today was the National Stud.  Like Deputy Power, I am very proud of the National Stud.  Living as we are in the centre of the racing headquarters at the Curragh it is not unreasonable to expect that there would be an attraction to the county for racing and bloodstock interests.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Curragh we have the world famous Punchestown and Naas.  On my own doorstep we now have one of the most modern equestrian centres and, in a couple of months' time, we will have the most modern sales complex in the world. All these contribute in no small way to the economy of our county. Taking the Curragh alone, the employment in the racing stables amounts to a minimum of 400, and that is a conservative figure.  They would be catering for a minimum of 1,000 horses.  The figures mentioned today for keeping a horse seem to range between a £1,000 and £2,000 and that adds up to somewhere between £1 million and £2 million in Kildare and the surrounding counties.  That is no small money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not go below £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>Not much below it. However, I am not familiar with the figures.  A big amount of money is spent on hay, oats, wages, food and so on, in the area and that is why we want to see the industry expand if at <Col N="1942" /> all possible.  In the make up of racing we seem to think solely of the horse. Of course, without the horse we do not have a race; but we forget the stable boys and the jockeys.  Deputy Power, and other speakers, mentioned them but we have a facility at present in the National Stud for training those young boys.  This is not referred to often enough or sufficiently recognised for the service being given.  Apart from a six-month course in stud management for which they get students from all parts of the world, including Japan and Germany, there is also a two-year course for apprentice jockeys.</P>
      <P>At present the National Stud can only cater for 15 but they are hoping to be able to cater for 30 next year. This is a two-year course for 30 young men for whom the National Stud have not got adequate facilities. It is a great pity that more attention is not given to this side of this important industry, because in addition to receiving the basic training in the industry they are also being educated. Were it not for the assistance they are receiving from the Kildare Vocational Education Committee, and from the Army, I do not think this course could be held.  The vocational education committee are providing teachers free for them.  The Army make available their gymnasium and swimming pool.</P>
      <P>Naturally jockeys must be fit physically and mentally, more physically than mentally.  However, it all too often happens that young men of the right weight go into the racing business and are denied a basic education.  Here they have an opportunity which should not be overlooked. At the same time it is impossible for the National Stud out of their resources to provide the amenities which are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have not got accommodation for any more although they would like to cater for at least 50.  They require accommodation and at present for the everyday overheads they depend on the generosity of subscribers.  It is a tragedy that they have to go with cap in hand to various people, admittedly <Col N="1943" /> people who are eventually going to benefit from this service.  It is the duty of the State, through the Racing Board, to make available a considerable sum to them for the magnificent work they are doing.  While they have all this available at Tully one item is missing.  The efforts to have them all under one roof will not be achieved until Bord na gCapall set up there too. This has not happened yet and the courses run by Bord na gCapall, such as the farriers' course, are removed from the rest of the centre.</P>
    <P>If they were all under the one roof we would have a centre catering for every aspect of the horse industry. Other speakers referred to other matters and there is no point in labouring the case any further.  One other point I should like to draw the attention of the House to is in regard to the training facilities on the Curragh.  Inside the railed-off area is available to all trainers but at a fee.  A really good training area should be made available to trainers free on the Curragh.  I am informed that the Cloud Gallop is useless and that a new one is badly required.  That can be looked into although it may be outside the scope of the Bill.  I should like to welcome the Bill and hope that some of the extra money will be given to provide the facilities required in the National Stud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for the welcome all sides have given the Bill.  Even though sometimes it was couched in different terms the response which the House has given indicates that the aim we all have is to improve racing and to make it so attractive that it will continue to expand and develop.  A number of Deputies referred to different aspects of the proposals in the Bill and the desirability of retaining the levy at the figure I mentioned, 6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to correct one misapprehension that may have existed. Originally, under the 1945 Act, the board had a levy as high as 5 per cent. That was subsequently dropped to the 2½ per cent but, in fact, the original levy was 5 per cent.  I say that because when Deputies compared the existing <Col N="1944" /> 5 per cent and the maximum limit included in the Bill it is obvious that 10 per cent in the present-day values is less than 5 per cent was in 1945.</P>
    <P>At that time the 5 per cent levy was regarded as excessive and was reduced. It was only subsequently raised over the years.  The suggestion which Deputy O'Malley made, and a number of others, including Deputy Barrett, was that it should be specifically stated in the Bill.  The objection to putting in a small figure, an increase of only 1 per cent, is that it requires amending legislation and although Governments have come and gone in the last 30 years the 5 per cent included in the 1945 Act has remained until now.  There is one marked change in this Bill which I have referred to, that under section 9 any regulations made by the Racing Board would have to be laid on the table in the House.  The usual proviso applies to this that if a resolution is passed within 21 days its annulment is without prejudice to anything done in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley suggested that that should be in positive form.  I do not think it is necessary to do so because no State board would implement a decision of this sort in the knowledge that a motion would be put down suggesting that it be annulled. In a more contentious area the proviso in the Act dealing with the remuneration of a number of public officials including judges and politicians is laid on the table and subsequently if no amending or annulling order is made within the required period of 21 sitting days, it is formally signed and becomes effective.  The purpose of this measure is to inject more money into racing. The objective of the Racing Board when it was established was to do this, and it has undoubtedly made a significant contribution.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Barrett remarked, France is the best example in our racing range of the amount of money that is contributed to racing from betting levies.  In France in 1973 the total contribution to racing from the betting levy was £84 million; in Britain the figure for 1972-73 was £8.3 <Col N="1945" /> million; in Italy the figure was £16.9 million; in Japan in 1971, £180 million; and in Ireland £1.8 million. There are no bookmakers in France, whereas in Britain and here there are. I think racing would be much poorer without these colourful characters who operate at race meetings.  There are not as many colourful characters as there were.  There are still a few left.  Deputy Coughlan may not be <i>suaviter in modo</i> but he is certainly <i>fortiter in re.</i> The contribution made by bookmakers is considerable.  In France all the money is levied on betting on the totalisator.  In Britain and here the SP offices as well as the bookmakers and the tote take a share of the money.  There is another aspect we do not often take account of: in this country there is betting on football pools as well as on racing. Admittedly the football pools are in Britain but quite a considerable amount of money is channelled into these areas.  The difference is one that is obviously reflected in the figures.</P>
    <P>In so far as a tax on wealthy owners is concerned, that is an important element, but I agree with Deputy Coughlan and Deputy Barrett and other speakers that what is really needed is an assurance that relatively small owners are able to stay in the business.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that the emphasis in the course of this debate has been on increasing the stakes at the smaller tracks.  I would certainly ensure that the Racing Board are appraised of the views expressed by Deputies from all sides of the House, that they read and digest carefully the views expressed here.  It is a fact that racing is a speculative business.  It is significant&mdash;and I differ to this extent with some of the remarks Deputy Power made&mdash;that the wealth tax does not apply to bloodstock. It is exempt.  In 1973 when VAT was introduced bloodstock was also exempted.  The owner mentioned by the Deputy who has horses being trained in the Curragh said that one of the reasons why he chose to come to the Curragh was that VAT was not applied in this country.  Subsequently last year he sent out some horses; some he kept in training here, but he raced <Col N="1946" /> them in England because the stakes were better, and he had had some success there.</P>
    <P>So far as the proposals in the Bill about the appeals board are concerned, I think they were generally welcomed.  The National Stud and Bord na gCapall were mentioned by Deputies.  The National Stud are doing a good job.  The annual average profit they have made in the last three or four years is about £30,000.  They have undertaken a very considerable reconstruction programme.  Undoubtedly what Deputy Malone said is a fact, that what they have undertaken in respect of the apprenticeship scheme is most praiseworthy.  The Kildare Vocational Education Committee and the Army are helping to facilitate them and also other persons who are interested and anxious to see it develop and expand.</P>
    <P>I will discuss with the National Stud what further efforts can be made to expedite the completion of the necessary work there.  This scheme is in its infancy.  It is probably better to proceed gradually with it because as Deputies know, a great many young lads aspire to be jockeys but a variety of factors inhibit them.  They aspire to emulate the well merited success of people like Pat Eddery.  Many encounter weight problems, height problems and an inability to rise to the level necessary for successful careers as jockeys, although they ride reasonably well in the ordinary accepted sense of that term.</P>
    <P>In regard to the development of the Army jumping team, people tend to compare the past which was in many respects an era in which like was being compared with like.  In the twenties and thirties the contenders for competitions like the Aga Khan Cup were entirely Army teams and exclusively represented a particular country.  In the immediate post-war era for a short time that was still so. With the exception of ourselves&mdash;and recently we have had a mixed team &mdash;and possibly two representatives from Italy of well-known distinction, the D'Inzeo brothers&mdash;almost all the other contestants for these international competitions are private individuals. <Col N="1947" /> As Deputy Barrett said, we have a small population, but considering our size we have a very large racegoing population because one million racegoers annually is roughly one in three persons. Admittedly most of them are the same people going over and over again just as I understand most people who bet at the bookmakers are the same clients and for that reason the bookmakers like to remain on good terms with them.</P>
    <P>For our size we have a relatively large racegoing population.  Other countries have much larger populations and because of their wealth and resources it is a fact that we have to compete with their resources and with their numbers.  On the other hand, every year, with few exceptions, we have won international competitions abroad yet there is disappointment because as I say people tend to compare different situations; in other words they are not comparing like with like.</P>
    <P>So far as the Army Equitation school is concerned we have provided a substantial increase in funds for the purchase of horses.  Here again luck and chance, as Deputy Barrett mentioned, play a large part in it, but so far as finance is concerned the money that is necessary is being made available. In addition, as Deputies have mentioned, Bord na gCapall have operated a leasing scheme and some of the recent successes of the Army jumping team were on leased horses. I am certain that in one case at least at the weekend&mdash;and I think the previous weekend or a couple of weeks ago also&mdash;the successful Army rider was riding a horse leased from Bord na gCapall.  So far as our resources permit it is a fact that generally as much as possible is being done.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the remarks made by Deputy Barrett and Deputy Malone, that the important thing is to get the money into racing, to make it attractive for the owner, to make it financially worth his while.  It is obvious that it is not worth the while of many owners.  One of the reasons why people are combining is to enable them to have a share in the <Col N="1948" /> sport of owning a horse or owning a few horses and at a comparatively reasonable figure where three or four are involved.</P>
    <P>In addition, what Deputy Malone said is correct: it is essential to improve the amenities.  Long ago people were prepared to go to racing under almost any conditions.  That is no longer so, there are the amenities and attractions of other sports.</P>
    <P>Here, again, the modern development of television can bring racing into anybody's home, almost certainly on Saturdays and occasionally during the week.  Also, people can switch from one track to another and, as Deputies know, one can sometimes see as many as eight or ten races on Saturdays when there are good programmes. That, in itself, has an attraction because people can see the races from the comfort of their homes or perhaps a licensed premises and get in touch with their bookmaker and have a bet on the telephone.  Therefore, it is essential that the amenities should be improved and I understand that the Racing Board are proceeding with their overall improvement programme.</P>
    <P>Some query was made about the grading of courses.  I understand that it has been decided by the Racing Board not to proceed with that because the number of runners has substantially increased.  The number of horses being trained last year was 4,600.  The number has increased over each of the last few years from 4,200 in 1972 to 4,500 in 1973 and last year to 4,600. The number of runners has increased in the last four years from 2,600 to 3,000.  This, admittedly, would appear to refute the suggestions that racing is not economic.  On the other hand, in that time there has been a very substantial increase in the number of owners who share horses, and arrangements are now available whereby they are entitled to do so.</P>
    <P>The number of thoroughbreds in the country has increased from 17,400 in 1970 to 19,800 in 1973: the 1974 figures are not available.  The value of bloodstock steadily increased until 1972; 1973 and 1974 were not so good, as Deputies have mentioned, and sales increased again up to 1973 but last year as a result of the recession, <Col N="1949" /> declined.  It is important in this economic climate that we should ensure that the maximum amount is put back into racing because undoubtedly what many Deputies have said is a fact, that racing in Britain is not in nearly as healthy a condition as it was formerly. In fact the figure for yesterday's Derby to a certain extent camouflages the real position.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies will be aware that this year, even leaving aside the recent dispute with the stable lads in Britain, there have been repeated statements by the Chairman of the Racehorse Trainers' Association and a very lengthy interview by one leading trainer, indicating the rising cost.  He gave figures for wages, for food, for carriage, for trailer services, for veterinary services and all the overheads indicate that costs far outstripped the return.</P>
    <P>I think the figures mentioned on the opposite side, certainly the higher figures are correct.  Somebody mentioned that one might get a horse in training for £1,200.  Anyone who would train a horse for that now would have to get himself examined; certainly he would be overwhelmed with patrons going to him.  I imagine it would be much more like double that figure. Indeed, in Britain it is even higher still. Therefore, we have a chance now, and we must recognise that our great competitor is France.  The circumstances there are very different because so much money is channelled into racing.</P>

      <P>It would, of course, settle it.  The Deputy knows that any Minister for Finance seeks as many sources of revenue as he can.  We have to consider the system which operates there and very few people would like that to happen here.  One of the things that makes racing attractive here and in Britain is the bookmaker.  Certainly, the growth in the amount of money spent in betting with the bookmakers has been quite remarkable.  It is no wonder that they are reasonably happy because the money has gone from <Col N="1950" /> £11.8 million, five years ago to £18 million-odd last year.</P>
      <P>One other point which Deputy O'Malley raised in his speech is the deduction and the proposed amendment of section 27 of the original Act by section 3 (a) of this Bill.  But in fact&mdash;whether it was to protect themselves or not&mdash;the Racing Board had a form which bookmakers signed and this enabled the Racing Board to issue a permit on the basis that the bookmaker paid the levy to the Board.  In the case of a winning bet he would pay the backer or give him credit for the amount accruing to him on such a bet, including the stake less the amount of the levy at the prescribed rate enforced from time to time calculated on such amount, and to comply in all respects with the terms of the Racing Board and Racecourses Act and the regulations made thereunder with the lawful directions of the board.  That was signed by the applicant, witnessed and the witness was either a clergyman, a peace commissioner, a civil servant or a member of the Garda.  That was the method employed in order to overcome the possible defect of the Act. This is being remedied in the proposed amendment.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy O'Sullivan for his kind remarks and also to thank the House for the welcome it has given the Bill.  The proposals are reasonable.  As I mentioned initially, it is the board's intention not to increase the levy beyond 1 per cent and that can only be done with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  If in the future, the board seek to increase it, they must have the consent of the Minister for Finance and any regulation made thereunder can, under the proposed terms of the Bill, be amended by a resolution.</P>
      <P>The other major change is the establishment of an appeals committee similar to the provision in the Act establishing Bord na gCon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>On this amendment, before the adjournment, I was pointing out that perhaps there was a trap here for the Minister.  I concede fully, as Deputy Esmonde pointed out, that the deferment of the incidence of interest acts as a relief but it does not get away from the fact that in the Bill, under section 2, the tax is levied with effect from 5th April, 1975.  If 5th April, 1975 is to be the determining date, the tax on that date is completely indeterminate; it will remain indeterminate and the assessment will remain indeterminate until such time as this Bill becomes law or at least until such time as it has passed both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is only then that one will achieve certainty.</P>
      <P>We do not have to prove that proposition any further than to go back on the history of the Bill which preceded this where very substantial modifications were made.  Therefore, if the Minister says people made valuations as on that date they have no real basis for making these valuations. One does not know exactly what the incidences will be.</P>
      <P>What I am suggesting to the Minister is&mdash;I have suggested it in the earlier Bill&mdash;that sooner or later in regard to taxation and the intrusion of the Executive on citizens and the abdication of this House of its proper functions as a legislature&mdash;as I fear it does abdicate&mdash;the courts may be promoted to intervene in a most unexpected way.  Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God, and neither shalt thou tempt the Supreme Court in this case, because the Supreme Court is sovereign in a certain area under our Constitution.  One must beware of interpreting the cases and the accepted canons of English law in our set-up beyond a certain point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1952" /> I remarked earlier that, up to today anyway, the British Parliament was supreme; it was the single supreme authority; the British courts were therefore subordinate to it and could not question legislation, not even the retrospection of legislation. The judges and the judiciary generally went as far as they possibly could to enforce two principles, (1) to lean against retrospection and (2), to construe taxing statutes in the strictest manner possible.</P>
    <P>Here we have another set-up.  Here we have a case where our courts are independent and co-sovereign with this Legislature.  They are charged specifically with the administration of justice and a situation could develop, if it was provoked, where our courts could legitimately adopt an attitude that would curb this House in its legislation beyond what is currently accepted as being constitutional or unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>We must not forget that up to now it has not been necessary for our courts to proceed any further than the English precedents.  In deciding the constitutionality or otherwise of a provision, the courts have stayed strictly to the wording of statutes.  That was all that was necessary.  But if this Parliament abdicates its powers&mdash;this is why I questioned to some extent in the earlier Bill the extent of delegation by regulation&mdash;or if it acts irresponsibly and, in effect, tyrannically, for whatever motives or anything else the Minister wishes and when I say &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; I do not mean the present incumbent personally, to advance, we must have regard to the fact that it is possible that the courts might intervene.  It was in that sense that I said there was a temptation for the courts to intervene.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider the specific case where somebody resorted to the courts on the ground that he was asked to make a return or to make an assessment at a time when there was no necessity for him to be assessed and when, to say the least of it, there was uncertainty of the law and where the whole tenure of legal interpretation and the weight of the courts would lean towards judging <Col N="1953" /> the person in the <i>status quo</i> at the date in question.</P>
    <P>This may seem a very academic point but at the rate we are going it may develop further and that aspect should be considered.  The Minister took the attitude that a person who had assessed his valuation at 5th April might not thank us for extending the date if he found at, say, August 5th, another assessment showed an increased valuation.</P>
    <P>Lawyers deal with the case at the moment and tend to forget the one that went before but I should like to remind the Minister of his smiling if not explicit agreement with me when I pointed out to him that on this matter of dates what was lost on one Bill was gained on the other.  I do not think the Minister would deny the suggestion that the date would have disadvantages from one point of view but might have advantages from another.  In other words, taking any date, provided it is the same date, the requirements of the Wealth Tax Bill, of the Capital Acquisitions Bill and of the Capital Gains Bill would nicely balance themselves so as to ensure that the only safe course was to take the objective one in the middle.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is any great force in the Minister's argument in this.  I cannot see why he is adamant on it.  Foreseeably, the Minister did hope that his legislation would be through much earlier&mdash;that is very patent&mdash;because he had hoped that the period from which interest would run would be an earlier date and he has quite properly extended that date. Why does he wish to stick on this date for this year?  As Deputy Colley pointed out, it is this year only.  I have suggested to him that there is even a risk to him that he might lose the tax in respect of 1975 altogether, whereas if he put the date forward to the date of the passing of the Act even as the first assessment and 5th April ever after, he loses nothing but may gain in security and certainly will conform to more acceptable principles.  Why therefore does he object to this? What can he gain by sticking on that date for this year?  I am not going so far as to say that the amendment <Col N="1954" /> could be adjusted to meet the point of view I am suggesting, but I think it would be a much more proper and safer thing to do.  It would ensure that he would get the same tax as early and would not in any way prejudice future years.  If that is not a reasonable appeal to the Minister, I would like him to indicate what is unreasonable in the request put in that form.</P>
    <P>As I say, this Bill is one of a series, but it has this particular incidence in it.  We will have the Capital Acquisitions Bill afterwards, where another problem in regard to date may arise, and I wonder would the Minister rethink and reconsider this, taking this amendment as being something honestly presented to him as an adjustment that the circumstances of the case require.  It has taken long to put these Bills through and will take a considerable amount of time, but I do not think the Minister can complain that the attitude of the Opposition has been anything but what that attitude should be.  I am not suggesting that the job of the Opposition is to rubber stamp the Minister at every stage.  Our job is the process of argument, exactly as two sides in court bring out the truth and the judge decides.  In theory, the two sides here, the Minister and the Opposition, bring out the merits and demerits of a particular legislative proposal and the House decides, although the Minister will decide it by the weight of his support.  I do not think we have in any way exceeded what an Opposition should do and I confidently hope that the Minister will give due attention to what has been said in favour of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will, of course, give due attention to all that has been said.  That has been the Government's desire since the publication of the White Paper in February, 1974.  I would point out that we have probably exceeded all previous records in the time spent on the Committee Stage of Bills in the amount of time spent on the Committee Stage of the Capital Gains Bill.  By our calculation, it is 67½ hours.  I do not regret any of that time because it was time usefully spent and <Col N="1955" /> the more we can concentrate upon specific provisions instead of engaging in generalisations, the better will be the legislation and the more useful the expenditure of the time of the House, but I have made it very clear in my amendment, No. 28, that I am ready to allow people until 5th October next to pay their tax in respect of the holdings of wealth on 5th April, 1975, after they have been advised since February, 1974, that they would be liable as of that date to tax on that date.</P>
      <P>I pointed out to Deputy Colley, and very sincerely, that there are many people who might not be thankful if this legislature were to change the date of valuation.  I think particularly of people who might have stocks and shares.  It is not unreasonable to assume that they would be at a higher valuation next October than they were in April, 1975, because the movement of the market is upwards.  If we were to take a later date rather than the date announced some 15 months previously we would have many people understandably complaining that they had been unfairly treated because of increases in valuation.  So bearing in mind the fair indications which have been given of the date upon which valuations will be made, the fact that we are not dealing with people, in the main, who have made a sudden entry to the wealth tax liability area, but who have substantial holdings of wealth and the fact that any person who was within reasonable distance of liability would have valuations, if not formally bespoken of somebody else, at least made on his own account, the most appropriate thing to do is to stick to the valuation date of 5th April and allow, as is allowed in my amendment, an extended time to pay the tax.  Nobody is being taken by surprise. It is the most definite situation we can arrange and I think it would be in the long run a lot less vexatious, troublesome and uncertain than any movement of the date suggested in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I spoke earlier on this amendment and was disappointed to hear the Minister's reaction to it.  He referred to his own amendment <Col N="1956" /> extending the date for three months for charging interest.  Why is the Minister introducing this amendment?  I would say basically because the Bill is not yet law and it would be difficult to begin to charge interest until the Bill has been put through on a basis of valuations of the April date.  I do not think it would have been possible for the Minister to charge interest.</P>
      <P>He talked about giving prior notice, going back to February, 1973, and the White Paper, but what exactly was the Minister giving prior notice of?  Certainly it is not what is contained in the Bill and possibly not what the Bill will contain when it emerges.  In other words, the Minister can accept amendments.  As a Deputy on the Government side said, nobody will know what the terms will be in relation to wealth tax until the Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>I regard Deputy Colley's amendment as a soft amendment bearing in mind the attitude of our party towards this Bill as distinct from our attitude towards the inheritance and gift tax that is to replace death duties and in comparison with our attitude towards the capital gains tax.  We do not disagree with the principle of the latter but we disagree with the basis of this Bill because of its obvious disincentive provisions.  As I said when this Bill was introduced, at this stage in the development of our economy it must be regarded as a major disincentive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why the Minister cannot accept the reasonable amendment put forward by Deputy Colley which merely changes the date from April to October.  I am afraid that the Minister and his colleagues have no idea of what generates wealth in an economy.  I said earlier, and I repeat it now, I have no interest in those who have accumulated wealth.  However, at this stage in our history, after the significant progress of the 1960s, when we are now faced with a serious recession, the Government's introduction of this legislation indicates a total lack of understanding of the benefit of encouraging the creation of wealth <Col N="1957" /> in order to help employment and the economy generally.</P>
    <P>One would think the Government had no knowledge of the history of our country, a history of deprivation and of difficult economic circumstances, which drove people with enterprise and energy out of the country.  Since the foundation of the State the policy has been to encourage those with enterprise to provide the results we had until two years ago when we had an expanding economy and where for the first time in centuries the trend of emigration had been reversed.  What we are dealing with here is the introduction of supposedly popular legislation, somewhat like the supposedly popular legislation introduced at the present time in relation to television.  It is being done because it seems popular, despite the fact that two years of negotiations have not produced a result. I regard the introduction of this legislation before the Dáil as something that was done without regard to the economy and the loss of jobs.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with Ministers who are under the impression that ours is a wealthy economy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair.  The main purpose of the amendment is to delay implementation of the Minister's proposal so that at least some kind of encouragement might be given to those who are faced with this kind of tax at a time when 56 industries have been closed. It has been reported that another 50 firms are unable to pay the awards under the National Wage Agreement but despite that these industries may be subjected to this tax or the shareholders who are unfortunate enough to have shares in them may be liable for this tax if the industries are of sufficient significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister replied earlier to comments made by Deputies <Col N="1958" /> Colley, Fitzpatrick and myself, he made a facetious remark that the debate was rather like a children's debate. The Minister should know better.  I have described Deputy Colley's amendment as a soft amendment but we are at least trying to get the Minister to agree to a delay.  We do this because the matter was rather late coming to this House and, secondly, it may help the economy and retain jobs.  It does not come well from the Minister to compare the contributions made by Members on this side of the House to a children's debate.  Businessmen in this city are under the impression that a group of children have got hold of the economy and do not know what to do with it. As one Deputy pointed out, the Minister is not dealing with &ldquo;fly-by-night&rdquo; people; he is dealing with the business community who, despite what some of the Minister's colleagues may think, are making a contribution to jobs.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister and some of his colleagues strike me as being rather like a group of schoolboys who get hold of a bus and cannot find the right gear; so far as our economy is concerned the Government have had no trouble in finding reverse gear. That is the situation facing us.  Many of those who are employed do not know how long they will have work. This is not the right time to introduce legislation of this kind.  All we are doing on this side of the House is trying to get the Minister to consider seriously Deputy Colley's amendment. It is a reasonable amendment and it is important from the point of view of those people who do not yet know how they will finish up; business people are entitled to have some idea of how they will be affected.  From that point of view the Bill should not be backdated to April of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. It is a very reasonable amendment. The Minister refuses to accept it and so one is hitting one's head against a stone wall in trying to prevail on the Minister to change his mind.  All the amendment seeks to do is to put off the evil day for a matter of months to <Col N="1959" /> ensure that people who are leaving the country will stay at least until October or that the money which is leaving the country will not leave it until October.  The Minister is intent on getting his hands on as much as he can but we have had no estimate from him or anyone else as to what the yield from this ill-fated Bill will be.  Again, we have the retrospective element; the tax will be payable as from 5th April last.  The Minister has said he will not charge interest until 5th October and for that we are expected to be grateful.</P>
      <P>There is no indication that this Bill will pass because if some of the Minister's supporters, or nominal supporters, do openly what they willingly tell everybody privately they will do, the Bill has no hope of passing; a substantial number of the Fine Gael Party are opposed to the Bill.  Everyone is aware of that.  It seems extraordinary that the Minister will not accept this amendment.  There is bound to be a very long and tortuous Committee Stage.  A great deal of work has to be done.  Forms have to be prepared and printed, issued and completed, returned to the Revenue Commissioners and assessed and the tax has to be computed and, of course, paid.  All that is supposed to take place before 5th October on the basis of the Minister's amendment.  We are simply asking that the tax would run from 5th October this year not in any other year, so that people will have some opportunity of seeing where they stand or how they stand.  I do not know if there is any precedent.  A totally new tax is being introduced and made payable retrospectively from a date long before the Bill is passed.  There is no question of the Bill going through in its present form because we already have 3½ pages of amendments by the Minister to the first part of the Bill and we will presumably have another 3½ pages of amendments on the remainder of the Bill; that means approximately seven pages of Ministerial amendments in the month of June in regard to a tax payable from 5th April last.  The whole thing is a bit of a joke.</P>

      <P>It is too serious to be a joke.  I attended a semi-official function in this city last week where I met a large number of mainly foreign businessmen.  Their remarks on this tax and the other three taxes bound up with it staggered me.  I was a bit depressed about this up to that point and I am more depressed now.  I am seriously worried for the future of the economy.  I heard men who have millions of dollars at their disposal say that Ireland was finished, not just for them but for anyone so far as investment from outside was concerned.  I had that from the horse's mouth.  It's a pretty shattering experience to hear men who could create tremendous employment, which was never needed as much as it is needed today, saying they would not touch Ireland again with a 40-foot pole.  Some already involved are thinking of cutting their losses and getting out.  And here is the Minister refusing to accept a simple amendment to a Bill which is causing the principal trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In former years one might have said to a Minister for Finance, who refused an amendment of this kind, in a jocose fashion that he seemed to be trying to damage the economy.  Here we have the tragic stark refusal of a simple amendment and the only effect of that refusal can be to damage the economy even further than it is damaged.  If anything, I am critical of Deputy Colley's amendment because I think it is too mild but it would go some little way to recreate some little credibility or belief in our financial affairs and in State finance.  It is, of course, being refused.  We are starting tonight on the Committee Stage of this disastrous Bill.  I hope that the fact that the Minister refuses this minor amendment for no very good reason is not the beginning of a series of similar refusals on other amendments of ours.  Up to 99.9 per cent of those people will not have to pay wealth tax.  When all those new taxes and ideas that are crippling the country came out first 99 per cent of the people said they would not have to pay them and they would not affect them.  Now their attitude is, as we told them a year ago, <Col N="1961" /> that although they will not pay any of those new taxes they will affect them.</P>
    <P>How many people have lost employment as a result of those new taxes? If even a handful of them could be saved by this amendment would it not be worth accepting it?  What money will be got out of this?  The Minister does not know.  Perhaps nothing will be got.  The damage has already been done and the tax that will be collected is insignificant in comparison with that.  If a few of the people who are likely to lose employment between now and the 5th of October could be kept in employment by the acceptance of this amendment it would be worth while.  It appears that the Minister is not interested as long as he can leave the legacy he has set up behind him, the greatest tax collecting machine this country and perhaps Europe has ever seen.  The Minister referred to 67½ hours spent on the Capital Gains Bill haggling about the Committee Stage of it.  We have to spend that time in this House when the Minister, above any of us, should be bending his energies towards getting the country out of the financial and economic chaos it is in.</P>
    <P>We are asking the Minister to put this back for a few months to see if we could save it some little bit for the country.  I do not know how long it will take but we will probably have to spend another 6 or 7 hours going through every line of this wretched Bill.  At the same time over 100,000 are walking the streets without work and there are 52,000 leaving school this month with no jobs to go to.  Factories are closing everywhere but still the Minister for Finance has to insist on getting his wealth tax from the 5th of April instead of the 5th of October. I hope we live to see the day when it will be worth while to have a wealth tax in the country, but I can assure the House, whether it is the 5th of April or the 5th of October, as suggested by Deputy Colley, neither date is appropriate for the introduction of this wealth tax.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy O'Malley deserves to be credited as prince of balderdash in Ireland.  His <Col N="1962" /> very occasional interventions in the course of the capital taxation debate have invariably been explosive diatribes equalled only by the performances of Mr. Seán MacEntee, who was known in the House as the prince of mischief.

      <P>In Denmark they have a wealth tax since 1904, in Germany since 1893, in the Netherlands since 1892, in Norway since 1911 and in Sweden since 1910.  We have had one country compared with another here.  Belgium has no wealth tax but the level of taxation on capital is much higher there than it is in Germany, which has a wealth tax. Descriptions of taxes have been trotted out here for over a year suggesting that certain countries have a lesser rate of tax on capital than is proposed here. No country in Europe is giving exemptions on wealth tax at the level they are being given here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every country that has a wealth tax with the exception of Ireland, is taxing owner-occupied houses.  We are exempting them.  In addition to that we are exempting the first £100,000 for a married couple.  What is the exemption in Denmark?  Denmark involves the house and the exemption including the house is only £31,000.  In Germany they involve the house and the exemption including a house for a single person is only £11,400 and for a married couple is only £22,800.  In the Netherlands they involve the house. <Col N="1963" /> The exemption for a single person is only £6,800.  For a married couple they involve the house and the exemption is only £9,300.  In Norway they involve the house and the exemption is only £5,700 for a single person. They involve the house also for a married couple and the exemption is only £7,600.  In Sweden they involve the house and they give exemption of only £19,000 for the family.  In Britain they propose to involve the house and we do not yet know what level of exemption they will give.  In Belgium, which has no wealth tax at all, the combination of all taxes on capital is far higher than what exists in Germany, where they have a wealth tax.</P>
    <P>All Fianna Fáil are determined to do is use the world crisis, combined with the accidental coincidence of the introduction of this much overdue reform of capital taxation, to suggest that there is some relationship between economic decline in Ireland and the introduction of a proper system of equitable taxation on wealth.  I know there will always be paper to absorb their muck.  Deputy O'Malley came in yesterday and spoke for about 20 minutes out of the long day.  The hard work that was put into the Bill by Deputy de Valera, Deputy Colley, Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Brugha was completely rubbed out by 20 minutes of mischief-making muck from Deputy O'Malley.  He must be proud of himself when he comes in tonight to do the same.  I suppose he will do it through all the debate on this Bill.  That is why I say: &ldquo;Hurry on the day when all this legislation is through.&rdquo; Let the people of Ireland realise that the truth is that all the mischief-making of Deputy O'Malley and his ilk has no relevance to the reality of our very benign capital taxation proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>Nothing has ever annoyed me more than insincerity.  Insincerity with a small and contemptuous &ldquo;i&rdquo; is the middle name of Deputy O'Malley, who comes in here to <Col N="1964" /> preach about the effect of this taxation when he knows well that the only people who are being stung are those who have ill-gotten gains and have not paid their fair share of taxation over the years.  These people now know they are being caught and the several avenues of escape which they had in the past will no longer be available to them.  There are people with wealth in the country who have worked hard to earn it and they have paid tax on what they earned to accumulate their wealth. But the most vociferous, evil and mischievous comments come from those who have never paid income tax and who are damned if they will ever pay any other tax either.</P>
      <P>Those are the people for whom Deputy O'Malley is speaking.  I exempt many Members of the Opposition who have come in here with integrity, with conviction, with deliberation and with sincerity to discuss the merits of this legislation.  But they do not include Deputy Dessie O'Malley who has only entered occasionally in the course of the long debates we have had here, always to fling muck in every direction, always to cause mischief and always to be negative, to be destructive, to be mischievous, to try to erode confidence and to be as totally irrelevant as he can possibly be without being ruled out of order. I am glad to say I can exempt the vast majority of his colleagues from that and I do not think it is helpful to the production of good legislation to have the kind of contribution we have had from Deputy O'Malley this evening and on the other occasional interventions that he has designed to contribute to this Parliament from his other activities which certainly are not dedicated in the public interest.</P>

If he made that remark outside this House and did not accept the invitation to disclaim that it referred to Deputy O'Malley in his professional capacity Deputy O'Malley would have an action against him, actionable <i>per se</i>, for defamation.  The Minister, therefore, apart from being discourteous to the Chair, is cowardly enough to hide behind the privilege of this House to make such an accusation which he as a lawyer knows would be actionable <i>per se</i> if he made it outside this House.  I invite the Minister to repeat, for Deputy O'Malley's benefit, that remark outside the House and then Deputy O'Malley would have his remedy or else the Minister would have to disclaim his intention and the construction that has been put on his words.</P>

      <P>This is a matter of the most extreme seriousness to me. What Deputy de Valera has said is right.  If this remark was passed outside this House I had an action for defamation which was actionable <i>per se</i> without proof of any special damage. It is one of a category of five actions because it refers to my professional career.  Because any words uttered in this House are privileged the tradition has been always that if any remark of that nature was made an apology would be made and the remark withdrawn because it is not possible to sue on it.  The Chair has twice asked the Minister for Finance to withdraw the remark in question.  The Minister has not alone refused to withdraw it but has added insult to injury by his attitude and by his remarks.  I do not want to have to make this suggestion, but I think that some people will think in this House and outside it that if those remarks had been made by a backbencher or by someone other than a Minister the Chair would have insisted that a repeated request for withdrawal of these remarks would have been seen through, either by the remarks being withdrawn or by the Member concerned being asked to leave the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very unfortunate situation.  As one of the people in this House who detests seeing the <Col N="1984" /> business being interrupted for any reason, might I say that I was listening on the inter-com to the remarks made by the Minister and there is no question but that such a remark should be withdrawn.  I have been here for almost 20 years.  During that time I have had experience of various persons in the Chair but never have I known a Member, be he a Minister or otherwise, being asked to withdraw something, being appealed to to withdraw a remark by the Chair but not doing so and continuing to remain in the House. If it were my case or, indeed, the case of any other Deputy here.  I would have no hesitation in withdrawing the relevant remark.  The Ceann Comhairle begged repeatedly of the Minister to withdraw the remark.</P>
      <P>If the Minister were a man at all he would withdraw the remark at this stage.  It is easy to verify what is said. I suggest that the unrevised Official Report be sent for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In this way the Chair can verify what is on the record but not without it.  The Ceann Comhairle was placed in an awful dilemma but the Minister would not comply with the request to withdraw the remark and we now have the business of the House being held up.  Surely, Deputy O'Malley's reputation stands for something here and must be upheld.  Is it not the duty of the Chair to uphold the reputation of any Member?  Had we been outside the Chamber when the remark was made, Deputy O'Malley could seek redress quickly.  Perhaps in those circumstances he would take the law into his own hands as I would if such remarks were made about me.  I appeal to the Chair to adjourn the House until after he has perused the Report and made up his mind as to whether the remark should be withdrawn. The whole situation is unfair to the Chair, to the House and, in particular, to Deputy O'Malley.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who was not present when this affair took place that on two occasions in the course of the debate following the defamatory remark of the Minister, the Chair appealed to the Minister to withdraw the remark on the ground that it was improper and should be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Subsequently as a result of advice apparently received about ten minutes later, the Chair purported to rule that the charge concerned was a political charge, that the defamation concerned was in the form of a political charge. I would respectfully remind the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that that ruling is totally inconsistent with the repeated request of the Chair for the withdrawal of the remark, because if the remark were a political charge, the Chair could not have asked the Minister to withdraw it.  Nonetheless, the Chair asked him specifically on two occasions to withdraw it and on each occasion he refused, and on four or five other occasions, the Chair asked the Minister if he would say that it did not have any personal imputations, or some words to that effect and again the Minister refused to do so, but specifically he was asked twice to withdraw the remark.  He could not have been asked if the remark was in the nature of a political charge.</P>

      <P>I consider, without any disrespect to yourself, Sir, that many of the comments of the past 20 minutes have not been in order but as seemingly, they have been permitted, I want to say this.  you have heard a jaundiced account.  The Chair asked if the words uttered by me had the meaning attributed to them by Deputy O'Malley would I withdraw them, to which I replied that the words stood, that they were on the record and that I was not going to answer charges as to what the meaning of those words was.  That is the reality and the truth of the situation. I suggest now that as the Fianna Fáil Party have resolved by every and many means to obstruct the wealth tax and having gained nearly 35 minutes by this form of obstruction, they should now try to get back to a discussion <Col N="1986" /> on the merits or demerits of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Specifically the Minister was asked on two occasions by the Ceann Comhairle to withdraw and he refused to do so, and normally the procedure then would have continued and the Minister would not now be sitting in the House.  We must realise that if one of us were in that position and refused as the Minister did, he would not be sitting here, and rightly so, if we continued to refuse the request of the Chair.  The Chair went further and pleaded with the Minister to help him out of his dilemma and that was the word he used, but the Minister in typical arrogant fashion, with the attitude of the spoiled child which he has always adopted in the House, and of course being stubborn, refused to yield an inch.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power why a person in County Kerry (name supplied) has been refused a haulage licence in view of the fact that public transport provided by CIE cannot meet the demand in this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Under section 115 of the Transport Act, 1944, I may extend the operation of any merchandise (existing carrier's) licence or grant a merchandise licence to any person if it appears to me that the existing merchandise road transport facilities in any area are inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case the Deputy has in mind I have received representations to the effect that CIE cannot meet the demand in the area but only one case of a <Col N="1866" /> specific shortcoming on the part of CIE has been established.  CIE have offered on a number of occasions to meet the parties concerned to discuss their transport needs but the offer has not been taken up nor have the parties called on CIE transport for a considerable time.  Apart from CIE the area is served by a number of licensed hauliers.  I am not satisfied, therefore, that there is an inadequacy of merchandise road transport facilities in the area.</P>
