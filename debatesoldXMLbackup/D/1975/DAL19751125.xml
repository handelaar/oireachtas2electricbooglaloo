      <P>The number of persons on the live register at the four Dublin employment exchanges on 14th November, 1975 was 31,361. The figure includes 1,183 systematic short-time workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The question did not ask for that but I have some figures for Dublin county.  The answer was complied on the assumption that the <Col N="2" /> Deputy only meant the city.  The total city and county figures were 34,306 on 14th November, 1975 as against 24,129 on 15th November, 1974.  I have not got figures for individual trades.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make a statement on the future role of the County Hospital, Tullamore, County Offaly, in the light of the recent hospital plan announced by the Government; and the general effect the plan will have on this hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tullamore Hospital will continue in its present role for some years to come until the necessary additional <Col N="4" /> accommodation is provided at the centres to be developed as acute general hospitals.  It will then continue in existence as a community hospital with a role of great importance in the health services.  The details of this role will be discussed with the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that on Thursday last more than 8,000 people participated in a demonstration in Tullamore regarding the forthcoming closure of Tullamore Hospital as a surgical hospital?  I take it from the reply given by the Minister that this hospital will be turned into a community hospital; in my opinion, it will be better known as an old folks' home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Deputy would like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be regarded as an old folks' home.  So far as the demonstration was concerned I was not aware of it but I take the Deputy's word on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the south-eastern region there will be four general hospitals? The population in this area is 320,000 while in the midland region, which has a population of 178,000, there will be no general hospital whatever. Could the Minister explain that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I can explain it by reason of the fact that it was the Mid-Western Health Board who decided that there would be these hospitals and that they would be located as I proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the considerations that were responsible for his departing from the very firm recommendation in the FitzGerald Report that Tullamore would be the general hospital for the region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The FitzGerald Report made certain recommendations.  It included Tullamore as one of the sites for a major general hospital but I decided I would consult Comhairle na nOspidéal who laid down the guidelines which I am sure are well known <Col N="5" /> to the Deputy.  These guidelines were proposed by Comhairle na nOspidéal. All the various health bodies, from An Comhairle downwards, were consulted. The eventual decision by the Mid-Western Health Board was that there would be a hospital at Portlaoise and another at Mullingar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all aware that consultations take place on these matters. The Minister knows that the FitzGerald Report clearly and positively recommended that Tullamore be the general hospital for this region.  Can the Minister assure the House that he decided on medical grounds to downgrade Tullamore from being a general hospital to being a mere community hospital, or was he influenced, as is widely suspected, by political motives in this decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I was concerned I had made up my mind some time ago.  I submitted the proposals to the Government who approved them. As far as the FitzGerald Report is concerned, I do not think anyone is happy with it apart from those towns where the FitzGerald Committee proposed that hospitals be sited.  To say the least, when the FitzGerald Report was issued there was no enthusiasm for it from any side of the House.  I believe that the FitzGerald Report recommended too few hospitals and I still believe there should be greater facilities at shorter distances for people who need urgent hospital attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be right in stating that according to the latest issue of the <i>Medical Journal,</i> Comhairle na nOspidéal were not consulted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Not consulted about what?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <P>By the Minister in relation to his recent announcement on hospitalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether they were consulted or not&mdash;well, it does make a difference because Comhairle na nOspidéal are held in high regard&mdash;but it was Comhairle na nOspidéal that laid down the guidelines whereby there <Col N="6" /> would be a catchment area of 100,000 and the distance from a hospital would be no more than 30 miles approximately.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed a lot of latitude on this question. This must be a final supplementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Ceann Comhairle will admit that in the opinion of the people of Offaly and the people of the whole region this is a very important matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has given latitude in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if the Minister's decision in regard to the Midland region is open to negotiation of any kind or is it final?  Is it a final plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the final plan as recommended by me and approved by the Government.  I believe the area will be well served in the proposals that have been made and the decisions that have been made in relation to Portlaoise and Mullingar.  Neither the Deputy nor anybody in Tullamore should assume that there is this awful downgrading that the Deputy describes.  It will be deemed to be a community hospital and its functions will be decided in discussions between the health board and the Department of Health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that possibly the Deputy has not been able to treat the case in as detailed a fashion as he might be able to do when the debate on the general hospital plan will be taken in a short time when I introduce a supplementary estimate for that purpose.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health when he will be in a position to approve recent plans submitted by the Midland Health Board for continued improvement in facilities at the County Hospital, Tullamore, County Offaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Various proposals for the improvement of facilities at the County Hospital, Tullamore, have been submitted by the Midland Health Board.  These will be considered in the light of the general hospital plan and the health board's priorities but I cannot at present indicate when it may be possible to proceed with such of the improvements as may be agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems now that they will not be approved in view of the downgrading of the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not so. There are various proposals from the eight health boards throughout the country.  There are a number of proposals from practically every health board and these include a number from the Midland Health Board area. Certain of these proposals are not regarded as top priority&mdash;I do not say that they are discounted entirely.  The order of priority has been described to me by the health boards&mdash;for example, establishment of a day hospital&mdash;that is not scrapped: provision for new stores, a new mortuary and autopsy room; a health centre; extension of x-ray department and the provision of a day care centre.  The Deputy need not assume, as he seems to do, that no more improvements will be carried out at Tullamore hospital. That is entirely wrong.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware from the number of questions put down to him from time to time that there is serious overcrowding in Tullamore hospital at present and for some considerable time.  If he is not prepared to sanction these proposals <Col N="9" /> which are before him for the hospital, can he give us any indication as to how these patients who are at present in overcrowded conditions will be catered for?  Is it the intention that they be sent to Portlaoise or Mullingar or what will the outcome be? Further, in view of the present position with this downgrading&mdash;and no matter what Deputy Flanagan says, it is downgrading of Tullamore&mdash;will there be any major, first-class general hospital in this region if Tullamore will not be such a hospital?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to capital expenditure on this hospital.  The amounts of such expenditure for the years in question were: 1970, £13,000; 1971, £160,000; 1972, £125,000; 1973, £59,000; 1974, £99,000; 1975, £14,000. This expenditure covered the cost of a new 100-bed geriatric unit, which was opened in December, 1973, an extension to the X-ray department, recently completed and X-ray equipment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that there has been a vast amount of finance spent on that hospital.  Will that all go to waste?  As the Minister is aware, there is a cloud over the hospital now and it will be difficult to hold staff in the hospital never mind replace them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health when the building of stage one of the new regional hospital in Cavan will commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In my statement on the general hospital development plan I indicated that planning to implement the decisions would now proceed in conjunction with the health boards and other hospital authorities, that it would be necessary to determine priorities in development so that as resources become available they could be put to use in a logical sequence, and that the pace of implementation, but not of planning, would be influenced by economic circumstances.  My Department is currently making arrangements for discussions with the health boards with a view to determining priorities, and I expect that there will be discussions soon with the North-Eastern Health Board on the procedure for planning development at Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a very fine site available at Lisdarn?  Is he further aware that the 200-bed, stage 1, that has been suggested would not make great demands on his capital and would he like to give a time for a possible start?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I could not give a time for a possible start.  I do agree that Cavan should be reasonably high on the priority list in view of the condition in which it is at the present time but, as I described in respect of one of the hospitals in Dublin&mdash;I think it was Beaumont&mdash;it takes quite a number of years to have briefing, to plan and to build.  I know the hospital for Cavan would not be of the same dimensions as that for Cork but I would point out that the actual building took five years in Cork.  I assume it would take a much shorter period in the case of other hospitals, including a place like Cavan.</P>

      <P>The implications of the introduction of the SI units system, in so far as the health services are concerned, have been considered by my Department.  The relevant EEC directive, which is, of course, of general application throughout the economy, provides for the authorisation of the system for all purposes by 18th October, 1976, and for prohibition generally of the use of non-metric measurements from 31st December, 1977.  It is not expected that the implementation of the directive will give rise to difficulty in the health services. It is not possible to give a figure on the cost to the health services of implementing the directive but it is not thought that it will be significant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a question by Deputy O'Connell on 18th March last I indicated that my Department had written to the various hospital authorities, Comhairle na nOspidéal, the Dublin Regional Hospital Board and the Eastern Health Board giving details of the procedures proposed for the systematic planning and implementation of the Dublin hospital development programme, asking them if they were in agreement with the proposals set out in the letter on the functions of the different bodies, and inviting them, if desired, to a discussion about the proposals.</P>
      <P>Following this, all the hospital authorities and Comhairle na nOspidéal had separate discussions on the proposals with my Department. At the end of June a further letter issued to the bodies mentioned outlining formally the situation on conclusion of the discussions and indicating the next steps to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then a project team to prepare a brief for the major development at St. James's Hospital have been established and a joint working group representing the Department and Comhairle na nOspidéal have been set up to prepare a discussion document on the future development and allocation of specialties in and between the major hospitals in Dublin and the role of the specialist hospitals in relation to the major centres.  The working group are expected to complete their task within the next month and the various interested authorities will then be asked to let me have <Col N="19" /> their views on the document.  This is an important exercise, particularly in relation to the determination of the size and content of the major hospitals.</P>
    <P>Simultaneously, negotiations are in progress to obtain a site of about 35 acres at Beaumont Convalescent Home, on the acquisition of which the Sisters of Mercy have agreed in principle, and discussions on town planning and service matters in relation to the site are being held with Dublin Corporation.  Possible sites for the new hospital in south-west Dublin are also being explored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the discussion we had a short time ago about Beaumont hospital would the Minister consider appointing a senior officer of his Department, or similar person, to be a project director for this undertaking?  It would appear that if it is left to the normal departmental process it will be a long time before this hospital will be available for the north side of the city.  In view of the urgency of the matter would the Minister consider some sort of special approach along the lines I have suggested?  The person I have suggested should have plenary powers and be in complete control of getting the project off the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an admirable suggestion if it could be implemented but the Deputy will appreciate that discussions will have to take place between Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Department of Health.  Needless to remark, the Eastern Health Board would also be involved.  Last week the Deputy queried the length of time it might take to build Beaumont and, as far as I am concerned, I will try to cut down on that proposed time scale as much as I can.  The idea of a project manager, or a project director, is one I cannot comment on at present because I do not know what the implications might be.  I do not know what freedom he might have because in a delicate matter like this where so many hospitals are to be amalgamated and transferred the boards of the hospitals concerned would have to have their view considered also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring exclusively to Beaumont.  As the Minister knows, in the bureaucratic machine what is everybody's business is nobody's business and for this reason would the Minister not see merit in appointing a special person, directly responsible to him, to have full authority and responsibility for this project?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Epidemiology in its broad sense, that is the study of the factors determining the frequency and distribution of diseases in human populations, has gained increased interest in this country in recent years. The Medico-Social Research Board was established by my Department to undertake such studies.  The board commenced their research programme in 1969 and since then their range of epidemiological studies has increased progressively.  A description of the studies which the board have on hands at present is contained in their recently published annual report.</P>
      <P>A major contribution is also being made by the schools of social medicine in the universities, both in research projects and in providing training in epidemiology.  The Royal College of Physicians have recently announced that they are considering providing for a higher qualification in community medicine, the main requirement of which is in the field of epidemiology.</P>

When consulting the various bodies regarding the making of appointments to the comhairle for a three-year period commencing on 1st January, 1976, I stated that I considered this method of appointment was the best way of ensuring a balanced representation of the various interests which need to be reflected in the membership of the body.

However, I accept that there must be co-ordination and inter-communication between the different health boards.  These are responsibilities of my Department.  The Department issues specifications for ambulances, organises training courses, arranges with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to provide radio-telephone communication systems and is generally involved in planning mutual services between health board areas.</P>

      <P>The most recent year for which I have <Col N="29" /> figures in relation to the general medical services in Britain is that ended 31st March, 1974.  For that year the cost per person of the service in Britain was £9.58 and the cost per person covered in our general medical service was £14.31.  In comparing these figures it is important to note the differences in scope of the services in the two countries.  The National Health Service in Britain covers the entire population while our general medical services cover only about one-third of the population and, of those covered here, almost half are recipients of welfare allowances.  It is recognised that the need for health services is greater for these categories.  Indeed the visitation rate per person covered under our general medical service is considerably higher than that in the United Kingdom&mdash;5.5 visits per person as against an average of 3.8 in Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Under present regulations, two broad classes are eligible for dental services&mdash;(a) pre-school children and pupils of national schools referred to under the child health services, (b) persons with full eligibility for health services and their dependants: 192 wholetime and 140 part-time dentists are employed in the service. Because it has not yet been possible to recruit sufficient dentists to provide a comprehensive service for all eligible persons, priority is given to children and a reasonably comprehensive service is available to them. The service for adults is largely confined to extractions and the provision of dentures.</P>
      <P>The cost of dental services provided by health boards for persons now eligible is expected to total £2.5 million in the current year.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the Health Act, 1970 under which dental services could be provided for persons with limited eligibility but these services have not yet been extended to that group.</P>
      <P>Under a separate scheme administered by the Minister for Social Welfare dental services are made available to insured who satisfy certain contribution conditions.  Extractions and fillings are provided free of charge while a State contribution, generally on the basis of one-third of the approved charge is made towards the cost of prosthetic treatment&mdash;mainly dentures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £36,725,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to health boards, miscellaneous grants, and certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The House has already approved of the original Estimate of £177,022,000 and of a Supplementary Estimate of £414,000 in respect of compensation for thalidomide children.</P>
      <P>The supplementary sum of £36,725,000, for which I am now seeking the approval of the House, brings the total Health Vote requirements for 1975 to £214,161,000.  The additional Vote requirement relates to subhead A, salaries, wages and allowances for the Department; subhead G.1, grants to health boards; subhead G.2, payments to health bodies other than health boards; and subhead K, capital grant-in-aid of the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
      <P>An additional amount of £20,244,000 is required under subhead G.1.  Subhead G.1 provides for the payment of grants to health boards under section 32 of the Health Act, 1970 to meet all of their approved non-capital expenditures apart from the contributions from the rates.  The rates' share of the expenditure in 1975 has been fixed at a level equivalent to the produce of a rate in the £ equal to 25 per cent of the rate struck by each rating authority for 1972-73.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subhead G.2 provides for payments on behalf of health boards to voluntary hospitals, homes for mentally <Col N="53" /> handicapped persons, joint board hospitals and to the General Medical Services (Payments) Board.  The additional grant required under subhead G.2. in 1975 is £15,482,000.  The arrangements for the direct funding of these bodies by the Department were introduced with effect from 1st April, 1974.</P>
    <P>As the factors which have given rise to additional expenditure are common to bodies financed under subheads G.1 and G.2, I propose to explain the components of the combined additional requirements under these subheads.</P>
    <P>The additional provision sought under subheads G.1 and G.2 combined amounts to £35,726,000.  The components of this amount are as follows: An additional provision of £12 million is required to meet the cost of pay adjustments resulting from awards under conciliation and arbitration proceedings.  These awards include the adjustments in the fees for doctors and pharmacists for services provided under the choice-of-doctor scheme, awards for hospital consultants, nurses and certain other grades. A supplementary sum of £10.2 million is required to meet price increases of the various commodities which are required for the health services in excess of the provision for price increases included in the original estimate.</P>
    <P>An extra provision of £8.9 million is required to meet the cost of pay increases resulting from the application of the terms of national pay agreements to personnel employed throughout the health services.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £2 million is required to meet extra expenditure in relation to the choice-of-doctor scheme due to increases in numbers covered by medical cards and a consequential increase in doctors' visits and in the volume of prescriptions.</P>
    <P>Under the 1975 budget provision was made for adjustments as from 1st April, 1975, and 1st October, 1975, in the rates of allowances for disabled persons and those payable under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) <Col N="54" /> Regulations.  The cost of these adjustments in 1975 will be about £1.8 million.</P>
    <P>Increases as from 1st July, 1975, in the pensions of retired health services personnel and increases as from 1st April, 1975, in the employers' share of social welfare contributions account for £0.8 million of the supplementary estimate.</P>
    <P>The additional amount required under subhead A is £99,000.  This provision is necessary to meet pay increases to the staff of the Department in accordance with national agreements.</P>
    <P>Finally, an extra provision of £0.9 million is required under subhead K, capital grant-in-aid of the Hospitals Trust Fund.  There is a corresponding reduction in the amount to be drawn by health boards from another Exchequer source, the Local Loans Fund. The nature of capital projects determines the source from which the Exchequer provides the funds.  In 1975 changes were made in the detailed programme of works which increased the volume and cost of projects to be financed from the Hospitals Trust Fund but provided at the same time for a corresponding reduction in the volume and cost of projects to be financed from the Local Loans Fund. Accordingly, the total Exchequer liability in 1975 in respect of the Department's capital programme remains unaltered.</P>
    <P>A large part of the additional funds sought is required to meet the monthly grants to health boards, voluntary hospitals and homes and joint board hospitals due by the end of the month.  Because of the urgent need for extra funds I would ask the House to pass the supplementary estimate now.</P>
    <P>If the House agrees, I will provide an opportunity for a fuller debate later in conjunction with a debate on the general hospital development plan.  For this purpose, I will arrange for the introduction of a token supplementary estimate of £10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on this side, are prepared to give the Minister this Supplementary Estimate without debate. We recognise the exigencies of the <Col N="55" /> situation.  We recognise these moneys are needed and we are not prepared to interrupt the Minister's business in any way.  We are prepared to meet him. As the Leader of the Opposition explained, the Minister has undertaken to put down a token Supplementary Estimate to enable us to debate the health services in general and the general hospital development plan in particular.  My understanding is that the Whips hope to arrange time next week for this debate.  We are quite satisfied with that arrangement.</P>
      <P>I would comment very briefly on the fact that a Supplementary Estimate of this order has to be brought in at this point of time for a sum of £37 million over and above the original Estimate of £177 million, representing approximately an increase of 20 per cent.  This proves that the whole process of budgeting, as we have known it in recent years, is urgently in need of revision.  It seems to me that practically all of this Supplementary Estimate has been necessitated because of inflation.  No new services are involved and so the figure of £37 million relates to inflationary increases in relation to existing services.  That being so, it is legitimate to comment that these inflationary increases should have been visualised at the start of the year and realistic estimates would have built in a provision for this inevitable inflation.</P>
      <P>I make these remarks by way of general comment.  Supplementary Estimates are now becoming more or less standard practice and they are a serious reflection on our entire approach to the Book of Estimates and to the annual budgetary process. Having said that, I have pleasure in agreeing to the Supplementary Estimate and we look forward to the Minister introducing a token Estimate in due course to provide us with an opportunity of debating the state of the health services as a whole and, in particular, the general hospital development plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go back over all the ground we have covered but might I just briefly summarise what I was saying on this section?  I was suggesting that it looks as though the original thinking behind the section was based on the fact that, under the death duty code, there was a provision whereby in certain circumstances duty was payable in respect of gifts where the donor died within five years of making the gift.  That would seem to be the basis on which the five-year period in this section was arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also pointing out that if the concern of the Minister is that persons <Col N="58" /> who would have been liable for duty in respect of gifts of that kind would not escape liability we on this side of the House would be quite prepared to support a provision which would ensure that such persons did not escape the liability, whatever it would have been under the death duty code, either in the manner suggested by Deputy de Valera, by aggregation, or even by importing a specific provision that the liability under the death duty code in respect of such gifts would continue until the time had expired.  We would support an approach of that kind.</P>
    <P>We object to what is being done in this section which is not ensuring the liability of persons who would have been liable under the death duty code but rather is, in effect, applying retrospection. I suggest it is an illusion for the Minister to argue, as the Minister for Finance did, that there is no retrospection simply because tax is not being applied to gifts made prior to 28th February, 1974.  I say that because it is quite clear that, on the same amount of money given by way of gift subsequent to 28th February, 1974, a different rate of tax will apply, depending on what happened prior to that date.  If that is so, there is no use arguing that there is not retrospection.</P>
    <P>If a similar amount of money given by way of gift can be liable for a greater or a smaller amount of tax, depending on what happened prior to that date, it is not reasonable to argue that there is not retrospection.</P>
    <P>The major reason advanced by the Minister in justification of this provision was that it was necessary to protect the tax base.  I want to suggest that the tax base for a gift tax which commences on 28th February, 1974, is the tax levied on gifts made on or after that date, and is quite independent of anything which occurred before that.  The principle involved in this matter is very important. The amount of tax involved cannot be very great but, if the Minister's concern is to ensure that persons who would have been liable under the death duty code will not escape liability, we would support a <Col N="59" /> provision to that effect.  In so far as there is any question of protecting a tax base, it can be done in that way. Nothing involved in this matter from the point of view of the Exchequer, or otherwise, could possibly justify retrospective taxation however it is dressed up.</P>
    <P>We strongly urge the Minister to think again about this section and to amend it in such a way as to ensure there is no retrospection.  If he chooses to do so on the basis of ensuring that persons who would have been liable under the death duty code in respect of gifts do not escape liability, we are prepared to support that proposition if the Minister wants to make it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In completely supporting everything Deputy Colley has said I ask the indulgence of the House and the Minister who is sitting in for the Minister for Finance while I elaborate on it a little for two reasons.  The Minister for Lands has not heard the whole argument in detail.  Deputy Colley has given a very concise and precise summary of the position.  This section had the mis-fortune to come before the House on the last two occasions just when the House was about to rise at the end of the day, which is not the best time to get objective debate.  There is always the feeling that the clock is ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point which had to be made on this at the beginning is this.  I am not suggesting any turpitude or anything like that, because it is a very natural mode of thought, but we believe there may have been confusion as between the two separate taxes imposed by this Bill.  The Bill imposes a capital acquisitions tax and, in effect, and actually by legislation as between the operative sections, it imposes a gift tax and an inheritance tax.  The inheritance tax corresponds to the old death duty.  The gift tax is completely new.  With that distinction in mind, to make the case clear to the Minister I will give him the reference.  Gift tax is charged under section 4.  Inheritance tax is charged under section 10.  These are essentially two different taxes grouped together and they are of the one genus with the <Col N="60" /> general tax known as capital acquisitions tax.  In other words, it is a tax on capital acquisitions either by voluntary donations <i>inter vivos</i> or by donations on devolution.  Capital acquisitions means that it is to deal with the voluntary or automatic donations that are not caught by the capital gains tax. Within the scheme there are two separate categories although in administration and detail there will be certain inter-links : there is the gift tax <i>inter vivos</i> and the inheritance tax which is a tax corresponding to the old death duties, a tax that operates on devolution on a death.</P>
    <P>First, let us consider the second category.  In the case of the old death duties it was found necessary because of evasions that for a certain period before death voluntary gifts should be captured and aggregated with the assets that became the assets of the deceased. This was necessary for obvious reasons. For instance, if a person was known to be terminally ill and took six months to die it would be too easy a way of evading death duties to give a gift when it was certain that the property was going to pass on death anyway. To avoid that, a period of five years was fixed so that all gifts given in that time had to be taken into account when it came to marshalling the assets of the deceased.  This was a good logical reason.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Colley has said, the five years visualised in this section from 1969 to 1974 can be considered as analogous to those five years and, on the same basis and logic as before, it is rational to say that gifts given within a certain period of death should be aggregated and marshalled with the assets of the deceased.  Otherwise, the loophole that existed in the beginning for escaping death duties would be there to escape inheritance duties.</P>
    <P>Thus far we are completely with the Minister and his advisers.  From the point of view of equity, of administrative convenience and for other reasons, it seems reasonable to take five years as the Minister is doing here.  As Deputy Colley pointed out, it can be done in the way I am suggesting or there are other ways.  By all <Col N="61" /> means let us aggregate for five years if a death intervenes.  The effect will be precisely the same as it would have been under the old code from an administrative point of view.  I am leaving out another significant change in this section but I do not want to complicate my argument at this stage.</P>
    <P>Where a death intervenes there is the same kind of gamble as before. Let us consider the situation if this legislation were not introduced, where A gave a gift to his son, B, on 1st January, 1970.  If A died before the period in question had expired, the gift would have been brought into the estate, it would have been taxed accordingly, it would have been returned on the Inland Revenue affidavit and assessed.  However, if A did not die in the five-year period which expires at the end of this year and if he survives into next year the gift ceases to be of interest to the Revenue authorities and is not taxed.</P>
    <P>We submit that in principle this should continue.  It is provided for in the Bill but a completely new tax is introduced.  The Bill introduces a tax completely unknown to the law, namely, a tax on gifts <i>per se</i>.  Heretofore gifts were only taxed in relation to a contingent event, namely, a death.  Now we are introducing a new tax, an absolute tax on gifts as they occur.  We have debated that principle on Second Stage.  I am not impugning the principle of the tax but I am pointing out that we are introducing a completely new tax, that should only become enforceable generally on the date on which this Bill becomes effective. This is what we mean by the element of restrospection.  Unfortunately we are not altogether clear when we talk about this matter. Retrospection is one of these points that makes bad law because there is confused thinking on it.  Here we have a new tax, that is absolutely in contrast to the contingent nature of its equivalent tax that existed up to now. If it is in any way made operative retrospectively we are introducing the precedent of indiscriminate general retrospection in taxation.  Where, I ask, can that principle stop?</P>
    <P>I see the Minister taking a note and <Col N="62" /> I shall probably come back to deal with the distinctions on retrospection here.  Remember what I have said: on the basis of general, unrestricted taxation, unqualified, new to the law, it is a very dangerous thing to impose retrospection in such a case.  Before this Bill is passed and before the dates provided for in the section, the gifts between 1969 and 1974 would have been completely free unless a death which affected them intervened within the appropriate time.  If we pass this section they will not be free.  I hope I have amplified the point that Deputy Colley has made so that there will be no doubt about it.  There are two further points to be made once we have grasped the fact that gift tax <i>per se</i> is new, that if we do this and no death intervenes it is retrospective taxation, clean, general retrospective taxation.</P>

      <P>Clear is what I meant to say instead of clean.  I know the Minister opposite is very fairminded and no doubt will make his case as well as the next but one has the feeling, talking to him, that at least one has been listened to.  If I have made that point clear as to the difference between the two types of tax, the legitimacy in the case of the tax under section 10, the complete novelty and objectionable character of the tax under section 4, there are two other points to be made.  One deals with the question of retrospective legislation. Sometimes, it is necessary to legislate retrospectively but we should remember as a principle necessary to give certainly to the law, that the application of such retrospection should have a specific nature relating to a specific reason for being retrospective in the particular case and that there is something there that demands retrospection. These are the two prerequisites for legitimacy to justify a legislature in legislating retrospectively&mdash;that there is a specific quality about it, that it is to some extent clearly limited to a purpose that is clearly seen and that there is also a good public reason for doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are clear examples.  It is practically never allowed to happen in <Col N="63" /> a criminal case on the principle that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the law, paradoxically, it might be one of the cases where you might easily justify it.  In regard to taxation if, for instance, there was a specific case of scandalous and great proportions where some interest wiped the State's eye&mdash;to put it colloquially&mdash;for a large sum of money in flagrant abuse of the intention of an existing code, one is then justified in legislating retrospectively. In this area the Revenue are sometimes too touchy and instead of coming back here to go straight for the target there is a tendency to put down a barrage and blanket the whole area and probably miss the actual target. That would be a case where you could have specific retrospection, in order that when changing the law you would avoid serious loopholes or gross unfairness but there should be some such element in it and it should be confined to an area.</P>
    <P>Neither of these prerequisites applies in this case.  Here is a gift tax that is general and unlimited.  Nobody could be expected to think that this could happen.  I know the Minister for Finance said that one never expects what is coming in taxation.  Frequently that is a problem of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;to think out what people are anticipating.  A man could have made a gift in 1970 with full expectation of living perhaps another 20 years and having no idea at that time that that gift would ever be brought into account in the taxation code.  That illustrates the generality and also the point I made about uncertainty.  There can be no certainty in the law about these things.  If you push that kind of logic to its conclusion you could suddenly decide to bring into account for some purpose a gift given in the reign of Queen Victoria and there would be no logical reason why you could not do it.  If we are to have any jurisprudence or any legal principles and not work completely pragmatically to the logical conclusion that anybody who has the power&mdash;the Revenue Commissioners included&mdash;to pull a gun and hold up anybody, if you are not to find yourself from a jurisprudence point <Col N="64" /> of view in that position, you must have some principles and I am adumbrating the necessity for seeing this principle here, seeing what principle should apply to retrospection.</P>
    <P>The Minister was so considerate on the first occasion when I began bringing in authorities that I am sure there is no need to do it but if I were to embark on that line of country I could project a long debate which would take up too much time.  It should be enough for a Deputy to point out to the Minister and the Administration a principle of legislation and of law that should be considered and I shall finish that point by saying that if we are going into details the Minister can give me any number of examples of retrospection particularly in taxation.  In which case I will probably be able to come back and show him specifics, show him two things: that the retrospection is limited and that there is a clear specific reason for so doing it related to what is going through.  I can think of things in the income tax code particularly in this regard.  It should be sufficient for me to say that and to point out that there is this distinction.  I will therefore pass on.  Having made my distinction on that, I want to make my last point before I repeat, I hope in a sentence or two, the general point.  It is this: the Minister himself said&mdash;it is a technicality, if you like&mdash;that these gifts will not be taxed but they will be aggregated so as to bring up the rate of tax. Look at what that means.  I take it that the Minister was referring to the rates of tax set out in the Schedules to this Bill.  Take the case of a spouse, child or a minor child where the upper limit is £150,000 for this, where the rate of tax is nil.  If there is aggregation above that, tax is captured.  Come to the more remote case and substantial amounts of tax could be captured.  I take it I am not making a mistake when referring to these Schedules as relating to the rate of tax that the Minister mentioned.  If I am, I will gladly acknowledge my error.  I do not wish to take up the time of the House.</P>

      <P>We have always wanted this to be a friendly, constructive argument between both sides of the House because, as we readily admit, we are supporting the principle of the Bill.  There are excellent things in the Bill and I would like to make the Bill better still.  My reading is that you are bringing in that gift to lift the level.  When you lift the level you are going to charge money.  I submit&mdash;and I do not want my words to be taken as offensive&mdash;that it is a quibble to say if you use the gift to increase the return you cannot attribute the return to being a tax on the gift.  That is playing with words.  If you use the gift in such a way that you increase the tax yield and a greater sum of money is paid into the Exchequer as a result of including that gift, that gift can legitimately be said to be taxed.  Technically, of course, it is not taxed in the sense of being separately assessed but as far as the taxpayer is concerned he is paying more money because of that gift.  If you want to make it precise, at the very best, from the Administration's point of view, whatever increase resulted from the aggregation of that tax can be calculated as a percentage of the gift that caused that increase and it is taxed to that per cent.</P>
      <P>Not meaning to be nasty or offensive in using the word, I submit it is a quibble to say that you are not taxing the gift.  If you jack up the estate into a higher tax bracket and collect more money on it, you can do a sum by which you isolate the extra amount of money payable because of the aggregation of that gift and when you have got that figure you can calculate what percentage that increased taxation is of the gift that is aggregated. I do not see how you can avoid the conclusion that that gift has been taxed by that rate per cent.  If we go into that we are getting to the point of scoring debating points.  The fact is, it is a taxation of the gift when it is looked on in that way and can be shown to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the particular points to be made.  Could I pose this practical question, not necessarily for answer in the House but to which an answer <Col N="66" /> should be sought from consideration of the problem: how many deaths have occurred or are likely to occur within the period concerned that would be captured by this?  I do not think the sum of money involved would be very much but it is irrelevant because we concede that part of the argument.  You have now to ask yourself, how many substantial gifts were made in that period in anticipation of this legislation?  Here is a case of proper retrospection going back to 28th February, 1974.  That was fair enough because the White Paper was published then and if there had been a gap between that and the passing of the legislation the whole thing could have been rendered completely nugatory.  That retrospection has all the elements of justifiable retrospection that I mentioned.  But, before that, certainly in the immediate years, one of the problems was the devices that were being used.</P>
    <P>There had been a good deal of pressure from the Revenue authorities in the years preceding that for an increase of the five years to a seven-year period.  I wonder how much was done in anticipation.  I think relatively little, certainly little from the point of view of return to the Revenue Commissioners. If we are practical we find that those who acted <i>bona fide</i>, without ulterior motive, justifiably, without anticipating the new legislation, were entitled to the benefit of the law as it was at that time.  The number doing it for other reasons was, in my view, relatively small, unless the Revenue Commissioners know of specific cases. If it happens that there were a number of big cases they should try to deal with such cases specifically.  I am not asking for this information here nor would it be correct to give it to me.</P>
    <P>I suggest that a lot of money is not being lost to the Revenue Commissioners. The fact that somebody may have got away with something that does not mean a lot to us should not be allowed to influence us against the principles I have set out.  We must be careful when in a position of power, as we are, of being influenced by the human reaction: &ldquo;I will get that so-and-so <Col N="67" /> anyway&rdquo;.  I suggest that we should judge coldly what is being lost. There is no other reason for breaking the principle of retrospection unless there has been some serious abuse involving damage to the community or loss to the Revenue Commissioners.  If there is anything like that we should tackle the problem but in a more specific way.</P>
    <P>If those elements are not there I cannot see what benefit anybody gets from making gift tax retrospective in this way.  No matter how small the benefit would be&mdash;I called it catch penny last week&mdash;I cannot see any benefit that would outweigh the far reaching consequences, the insidious consequences, of extending it unwittingly. There is nothing sinister in this at all; it it incidental in the way it was drafted but it makes it all the more dangerous and insidious that we are breaching further into a principle that should guide us in legislation.  The logical end of that is to legislate retrospectively on anything.  I have dwelt at length on this matter because on the last occasion my efforts were somewhat abortive&mdash;they came at the end of the debate&mdash;and because the Minister for Lands is representing the Minister for Finance.  I ask the Minister for Lands to ask his colleague to reconsider this on the lines suggested by Deputy Colley.  In general terms the Bill is one of merit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> First, I should like to inform the House that I have all the authority in relation to this Bill that the Minister for Finance would have were he present. I found it necessary, when dealing with the wealth tax on behalf of the Minister for Finance, to make that point in reply to a query by Deputy Colley.  Had I not such authority this would not be a real debate and it would be unfair to the Opposition.  I should like to bring the House back to what is involved in the abolition of death duties as from 1st April this year and the introduction of this Bill in replacement of death duties, particularly what is involved in section 9. Up to 31st March last all estates <Col N="68" /> amounting to £10,000 or more were liable to death duties, whether those estates went to one or several persons and subject to exemptions and concessions in respect of widows and dependent children.  Death duties were abolished as from 1st April last, and this Bill proposes to impose a gift or inheritance tax on gifts or inheritances passing from one spouse to another or from a parent to a child provided each gift or inheritance or total of gifts or inheritances, exceeds £150,000.  Where the donee is not a child or spouse but a lineal ancestor or descendant the exemption is £15,000.  Where it is a brother or sister, the exemption is £10,000 and the threshold is £5,000 for a stranger.</P>
      <P>It follows that, in the case of a family man, provided he has enough children, an estate of £500,000, and, indeed, £1 million could be totally exempted.  It was necessary to capture all gifts or inheritances which passed after 28th February, 1974, because the White Paper was issued on that date and the world and his wife had knowledge of the proposal to introduce this Bill from that date.  Although it could be said to be, technically, retrospection in the sense that the legislation is only being introduced now, two years later, the Opposition accept that as a reasonable proposition.  I do not accept that there is retrospection involved in section 9.  For some time it has been known that there was a likelihood of a gift tax or inheritance tax being introduced&mdash;not so much an inheritance tax because the estate duty was there.  On Second Stage, Deputy Colley said he, and his party, when in Government, were considering the introduction of a gift tax to augment or strengthen the estate duty code.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> While I am not suggesting that there was a leak, other people might have been anticipating that it was intended to introduce such a tax.  A gift tax was in the wind and could have been anticipated by people who were directing their minds to taxation in general.  It is not proposed to tax a <Col N="69" /> gift that was made within the five years ending on 28th February, 1974, and that is conceded and understood, but it is proposed to take that gift into account in deciding whether gifts made subsequent to that date are to be taxed.  A parent could have made a gift of £200,000 to his wife or child in 1973 and that gift will never be subject to gift or inheritance tax.  Provided he lived until after the introduction of this Bill, it would not be subject to death duty.  He is getting off scot free.  The position has improved enormously and many people let out a sigh of relief.  If that person made a gift of £200,000 to his child in 1973, and this year makes a gift of £10,000 to that child, the £10,000 gift will be taxed because the threshold of £150,000 has been exhausted.  That is what is proposed here.  I do not concede for one moment that this is retrospection. It is taking into account the capacity of the donee to pay.  The donee who got a substantial gift in the last few years is in a better position to pay than someone who has not.</P>

As I understand it, Deputy de Valera and Deputy Colley&mdash;although protesting strenuously that there is retrospection involved here, which I do not admit &mdash;offered across the floor of this House to allow the former death duty code apply to these gifts.

        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;thereby improving the position of the Revenue.  As I say, taking everything into consideration, the removal of death duties and the introduction of this Bill will bring enormous reliefs to families, in particular, to brothers and sisters and, indeed, to strangers. Deputy de Valera asked if there were specific cases and conceded that if there were it would be wrong to spell them out.  Then he went on to suggest how we should deal with them.  I doubt if that would be possible.  I hate invoking the Constitution but it would be quite wrong to legislate for specific cases and I think the courts would set that aside.</P>
      <P>I do not know how much or how little section 9 would bring in to the Revenue.  In my view, it is a reasonable provision and while I do not believe it is analogous to the five years the Opposition Deputies speak about &mdash;do not think the Minister was influenced by that five years when writing it into the Bill nevertheless, the fact that gifts <i>inter vivos</i> were subject to death duties for a long time if they were made within three years of the death, and more recently within five years of the death, that is a precedent which might be borne in mind when considering this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that there is retrospection here.  There has been <Col N="71" /> retrospection from time to time under the income tax code.  I do not propose to spell out those incidents but I do not think it will be seriously denied that in the past there have been cases where there was retrospection under the income tax code.  Therefore, I do not think there is an innovation here or that we are doing violence to any long established principle.  We are not collecting tax retrospectively on gifts made before 28th February, 1974&mdash; about that there is no doubt.  The fact that those gifts were made prior to the 28th February, 1974, may decide whether any inheritance or gift tax will be payable on subsequent gifts and also the rate of tax paid.  I believe there has been a fairly lengthy discussion on this on previous occasions with the Minister for Finance.  I know he has considered the matter fully, and I put my position as clearly as I could. I could go into greater detail but I do not think that is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Minister's last remarks because I too do not wish to spell it out in a long debate because what we have said is on the record.</P>
      <P>In this pragmatic age when principles are unfortunately not sufficiently adverted to, we are reaping the fruits. In these cases the fruit is the uncertainty of the law and ultimately, it must mean penal taxation in one area as it means lots of things in other areas.</P>
      <P>Let me take the Minister up on two points.  I conceded that in one sense there was retrospective taxation on the matter of the five years.  In the technical sense yes, but Deputy Colley is perfectly correct: it was merely continuing in the new legislation what was there already and it is not retrospective in that sense.  Therefore, there is no contradiction between us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to specific cases, I must accept what the Minister said.  But is there enough social reason in what the Revenue lost to make us bloody-minded, to catch so-and-sos anyway? We must be on our guard against that kind of mentality.  When I say &ldquo;us&rdquo; I mean people in this House because we <Col N="72" /> are passing this legislation, not the people who drafted it or are advising us.  If there is no real loss to the State, this is wrong, and even if there was a small advantage, this does not outweigh the breach of the general principles that should rule for application of retrospective legislation which sometimes is necessary, as in the income tax code.  The Minister, however, made one significant remark.  He got back immediately on this point about the capacity to pay.  There is very dangerous thinking in that.  By all means for our present and our future let that be an influence, but are you going to justify retrospection on the basis of capacity to pay?  If you are, you are opening a very dangerous door.  When the Minister for Finance was there I noticed that kind of thinking too.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's party are taking credit for abolishing death duties.  They are certainly modifying them, and I say there are good things in this Bill and they will be much appreciated.  Our anxiety in this is to make the Bill a good precedent too, and the reason we are stressing this point on the section is that we see it as a serious and unnecessary blemish on the Bill, and the only real justification that can be given for it is on the basis of information which I am not entitled to and which I would feel it would be wrong to ask for.  As regards the amount of money that would flow from the Exchequer from it, I think that having regard to inflation <Col N="73" /> and all the rest, it cannot be a great deal.  Inflation was rampant since 1973, not so much before it.  Unless we have captured some very big interests, of which I cannot think, I fail to see how the Revenue can benefit to an extent that would justify this retrospection.</P>
      <P>There is a principle here.  That principle has to be abrogated and modified in particular cases which I have described.  There must be some limitation and there must be a specific purpose.  The Minister has failed to show that it is limited, because it is not, and he has failed to give me a good specific purpose.  In that connection I do appreciate that perhaps he has a specific purpose that he would feel it was not justified to give me, and that I accept.  I, therefore, ask: is it justifiable for the return?  Let me take the Minister's own case.  The Minister says that it is not retrospective taxation. The Minister gave a case of a man who had given a gift of £200,000 in 1973, and he did not die.  As things stand, that was a gift and that was that and would only have been captured if there had been a death duty.</P>
      <P>If, as in the example the Minister gave, the man gave £10,000 in 1975, if the £10,000 stood on its own, as it would have without this Act, it would have been intact and so would the £200,000.  The position now is that the £10,000 will be taxed on the basis of a gift of £210,000.  Take the schedule, and the figure of £210,000 in the £200,000&mdash;£250,000 bracket, that is assuming it is a child, a spouse, the best case, the biggest exemption; it becomes a very different kettle of fish under tables 2, 3 and 4, but I am confining myself to table 1, to the sum of £210,000 which is in the category between £200,000 and £250,000, which will then be taxed at the rate of 30 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Minister is wrong, I am delighted the Minister said that.  The Minister is confusing the matter.  The Minister would be quite <Col N="74" /> right if the donor died, but the case that we are making is not the case where the donor dies, which we have conceded; that is under section 10.  We are dealing with the gifts under section 4 which are not inheritances, because the donor did not die.  The effect of this Bill is going to be that the donor will receive only £6,666-odd instead of £10,000.  £3,333 will be lost if I understand the Minister's argument correctly. I am sorry.  Thirty per cent is not one-third. The donor gives £10,000, the donee gets £7,000.</P>

      <P>You are justifying retrospection on the grounds that somebody has done something in the past.  In my submission that is not sufficient, in general principle, to justify retrospection.  I am sorry the Attorney General was not here to hear some of our legal arguments on this. I am sure he would have appreciated the full force of the principle of jurisprudence involved.  I hope I have not confused the note-taking by that error. All that need be done is to put £7,000 where I said six and one-third thousand pounds and put £3,000 where I said three and one-third thousand pounds.  The result of this is that a gift that would have been free under the new legislation will be taxed for £3,000.  It amounts to taxing the £200,000 at the rate of £3,000, which is something over 1 per cent, which is in turn something more than the wealth tax.  Do you not see what you are doing here?  You are going to tax that £200,000 at something more than the wealth tax, because you are going to take £3,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of these coincidences.  I am not making any great point of it.  The result is that <Col N="75" /> you are retrospectively taxing the £200,000.  What I want to say to the Minister is this: can anyone deny that the effect of that is to impose a tax of £3,000 retrospectively on the £200,000?  If one were to take a gift that would bring it between the tax-paying groups here, one would have to sophisticate that argument by a difference&mdash;the difference between the rate payable on the gift&mdash;as it would be now and the rate that is paid.  On the table I have taken the rate payable on the gift is zero.  Therefore, I took the £3,000 on the £200,000 which boils down to a 1½ per cent tax on the original gift.</P>
      <P>The only reason I do such sums is to point out that we are right in maintaining that there is retrospection here. The Minister's answer about capacity to pay is not the answer to that argument. It may be a reason but it is not a good one where the principle is concerned. I do not want to detain the House beating this argument around the place.  We have conceded that, in specific cases, retrospection for a particular purpose has been justified.  This is the case where we think it is not.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree at all with the Minister that there is no retrospection. Taking the sum I took there shows it can be so retrospective it can be reduced to a percentage on the original gift.  I shall make a final appeal to the Minister, which is simply this: unless there is good, substantial reason, serious loss to the revenue&mdash; even if a few people get away with it; we all feel we do not want anyone to get away with anything; we want absolute fairness but there is something broader involved in this&mdash;is there enough there to breach the general principle that retrospection should be specific and bear a sufficiently weighty reason?  When I say &ldquo;specific&rdquo; I do not mean a specific case.  Perhaps &ldquo;limited&rdquo; would be a better word&mdash;that retrospection should be in some way limited.  But this gift tax is not limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister would take that point and consider it we would make a plea to him that where gift tax, pure and simple, is involved, where a death <Col N="76" /> does not intervene to capture it under the death duty code, I take it the provision will not carry on forever or will it?  Could there not be second thoughts on this section?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not intend to prolong the debate on this section.  I should like to put to the House as clearly as I can what is now involved in this as between the Government and the Opposition at the end of this debate.</P>
      <P>Death duties were abolished as from 1st April last.  These inheritance and gift taxes are being substituted therefor. I shall confine myself to the family man.  A family man could leave £150,000 to each of his children and be exempt.  I am asking the House to say that, in deciding whether the £150,000 threshold has been reached or not, regard should be had to any gifts made by the father to the same child or children since 28th February, 1969.  I do not think that unreasonable. The Opposition say it is but they are prepared to concede that some people might get away with something in the line of tax were that allowed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley offered to carry forward the death duty code in regard to deaths occurring less than five years after a gift was made.  Let us see what that means.  If that were to be accepted, I do not think it would make Deputy Colley very popular&mdash; but, perhaps, he is not seeking popularity&mdash;because the effect would be that a man who made a gift of £100,000 to his child in May, 1973, who survived until May, 1975 and left nothing further to that child, if I get my way, will be exempt.  If Deputy Colley gets his way, that child will be called upon to pay £51,000 in death duties.  That is the effect of the proposition put to me by Deputy Colley.  Whatever may be the merit in trying to exempt my proposal, and I do not believe there is any, a proposal to substitute it by that provision, in my opinion, would be outrageous.</P>
      <P>I ask the House to accept that what is being done in this section is a reasonable way of dealing with new taxation, of dealing with a move over from death duties to inheritance and gift tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong this debate unduly and I shall not but there are one or two points made by the Minister I cannot let go without comment.</P>
      <P>The Minister has chosen to refer to the exemptions in Table 1 of Part II which are the highest exemptions contained in the Bill.  In fact, he could have taken examples of tax being imposed on gifts above £5,000 but he chose the highest ones, in the category of a gift to a spouse, child or minor child of a deceased person. In that case there is no tax payable on a gift of £150,000.  The Minister talked about capacity to pay.  I suggest that in that regard there are many people, and I am one of them, who believe that someone who gets a gift of £150,000 has capacity to pay tax.  However the Minister chooses to provide that no tax will be payable in such cases.  What will be the effect? To take his own example again, if a gift were made during the five years with which we are dealing here of £150,000 to a son and if the father survived and then during the currency of this gift another £10,000 were paid, there would be a tax of 30 per cent on that £10,000.  If that father had given no gift prior to the introduction of the gift tax and then gave a gift of £150,000 there would be no tax payable. Thirty per cent on a gift of £10,000 and nothing on a gift of £150,000.  One could produce all sorts of anomalies arising out of this all because, I would suggest, this section is disregarding principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is mistaken in saying that the suggestion from this side of the House, if the Minister's concern was to ensure that people who would have been liable on gifts under the death duty code did not escape liability&mdash;if that was his concern we would not object and would support the continuation of that liability until the necessary five-year period had expired&mdash;connotes retrospection.  I suggest he is mistaken in that.  What is involved here is the five-year period referred to in the first two lines of the section between 28th February, 1969, and 28th February, 1974.  Any gift made on or after 28th February, 1974, should in our view be subject <Col N="78" /> to gift tax as provided in the Bill. Any gift made in the previous five years would have been liable and it would have been known by the person making the gift that he was running the risk of being liable to death duties.  That was known.  To say that such a person who made a gift, knowing that was the law, would then be subject to retrospective legislation if you continued that legislation until the five years had expired from the the date of the gift is, I suggest, both mistaken and misleading.  We are not saying to the Minister that he absolutely must continue that liability. What we are saying to him is that, if that is his concern, we will support him in continuing that liability but there is no basis at all for taking into account gifts made in that previous five years in order to fix the rate of tax subsequently.</P>
    <P>To do that is, however you look at it and however you dress it up, retrospection and we think the imposition of retrospective taxation in this way is wrong.  It is certainly wrong in principle, as can be shown in some instances, and, if it is accepted, it can lead to considerable difficulties in future in different fields altogether far removed from this legislation and in areas in which many more people will be involved, people with far less capacity to pay than those receiving gifts of £150,000, those who are not called upon to pay any tax under this Bill.  Many feel such persons have the capacity to pay, and I am one of them.  The Minister does not because he provides here that such persons will not have to pay tax.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not blowing hot and cold.  The Deputy is pointing out, as he did not only on the Second Reading but earlier on the White Paper, the number of anomalies being produced in this legislation leading to a situation in which millionaires will be far better off than they were before while people of lesser wealth will be worse off.  Presumably this was not intended, though some might suspect it was.  I am not saying that, but it is one of the anomalies arising from this legislation and it is our obligation and certainly our right to comment on such anomalies.  The fact is this section is producing anomalies.  It is producing them because it is based on the abandonment of a principle, that principle being that we should not in circumstances of this kind attempt to impose retrospective legislation.  This section is doing just that, wrongly in our view, not only because we strongly suspect the amount of money involved where the Exchequer is concerned is not great but, even if it were great, because the Minister and the House should hesitate before imposing this kind of retrospective legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister proceeds because, in his view, he is justified, then I can only say we do not agree with him and we hope that between now and the next Stage wiser counsels will prevail and the implications of what are being done here will be considered and the Minister will be prepared to amend the legislation.  If he is not prepared to amend it, we will give consideration certainly to the question of trying to <Col N="80" /> amend the section ourselves though it would be preferable if the Minister himself would amend it and thereby demonstrate that both sides of this House do not accept and will not support the principle of retrospective taxation in circumstances such as are provided for in section 9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made a stand on principle but I want now to point out one consequence of the Minister's case here to show the kind of thing that can happen.  Remember, there is a distinction.  If one were dealing with death duties and a death intervened, then the problem would be solved pretty quickly, but this aggregation will continue onwards under the Schedule.  The bringing in of this five-year period may have very wide repercussions and may result ultimately, through this device of retrospective taxation, in capturing substantial sums. If you do, there is a certain amount of double talk if not double think about the representation of the limits which were so lauded in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I pointed out that if there had been a gift of £200,000 in 1973, as the Minister postulated, and £10,000 were given at a later period, that would amount to a tax of 1½ per cent on the £210,000.  Even if the £10,000 had been given completely, it would not have compensated for the inflation of the £200,000 in the period.  From a practical point of view, I want to deal with a completely new aspect, the impact of inflation which, incidentally, I fear, will be one of the traps in this Bill. With the rate of inflation at 20 per cent and more, we will find very quickly that the limits in this Bill will not be very much better than the old death duty code.  In other words, the benefit the Minister is giving may prove to be relatively temporary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the case of a gift of £200,000 in 1973 to maintain a child who is disabled in some way.  Are we to go the whole way with certain Members of the Labour Party and say we do not recognise that people are in certain categories in society and that people have been used to certain standards so to speak?  Are we to adopt an extremely socialist approach to this? The man who gave £200,000 to maintain <Col N="81" /> an invalid or disabled child at great expense, probably did something luxurious in 1973.  Allowing that he was able to get 10 per cent on the £200,000&mdash;and remember banks are not paying that rate at the moment; an average of 10 per cent would be a fair level of remuneration on investment&mdash; that would leave only £10,000 a year to support somebody who probably required complete hospitalisation, or something like that.</P>
    <P>The gift of £10,000 in the following years would not be enough to make up for inflation.  Not alone are we giving less but, in effect, we are taxing the original gift.  A number of anomalies can arise.  The gift would be aggregated and, if the parent found it necessary to make further gifts, unless there were some other specific exemptions or something like that&mdash;for the moment I am not considering specific exemptions&mdash;inflation would operate. That should also be considered.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Colley said, we have made our point.  The Minister has stated his attitude.  I should like him to accept that we made our contributions in the spirit of improving the Bill rather than obstructing it.  I certainly do not want to obstruct it by repetition.  I would like the Minister to consider practical consequences of that nature.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The concessions under the death duty code were minimal.  They applied only to dependent children and widows. Here, in so far as the family is concerned&mdash;and bearing in mind that this is the promise originally given in regard to the removal of death duties&mdash;a husband can leave his wife £150,000 free of any inheritance or gift tax, and he can leave £150,000 to each of his children free of inheritance or gift tax.  If I understand correctly the question put by <Col N="83" /> the Deputy, that is the answer.  Perhaps it could be summarised by saying that inheritance tax looks at what such beneficiary got and ignores what other beneficiaries got.  I suppose that is the whole difference.  Estate duty looks at what the testator left.  Inheritance tax looks at what each beneficiary got with very generous thresholds.</P>

      <P>While it was described on the sheet of paper we received as an amendment it is difficult to understand this because the gist of it simply is to take the wording used in the first part of our motion without the words &ldquo;with concern&rdquo;. In other words, it states: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann notes the placing ... of an order ...&rdquo;.  Secondly, it &ldquo;asks the Government to ensure the continued employment of workers in Verolme Dockyard&rdquo;.  This is a slightly shorter version of what we asked in our motion which &ldquo;calls on the Government to intervene in this matter to ensure continued employment ... at a time of exceptional economic distress and heavy unemployment&rdquo;. That is also left out of the Government amendment.  I suppose the movers of the amendment do not consider there is exceptional economic distress and heavy unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Transport and Power has now arrived in the House.  We have an amendment that does not differ in virtually any respect from the original motion except to leave out certain bits that call on the Government to ensure continued employment rather than asking the Government to intervene.  This has been signed by three members of the Government.  I have never seen a motion or an amendment signed by members of a Government asking the Government to do something.  In my <Col N="85" /> simplicity I understood members of the Government to have collective responsibility, that when they made decisions they were bound by those decisions.  Therefore it seems incredible that the Ministers for Transport and Power, Industry and Commerce and Labour are calling on the Government as a body to do a certain thing.</P>
    <P>Are we to deduce from this&mdash;it is not an unfair deduction&mdash;that certain other members of the Government do not want to ensure the continued employment of workers in the Verolme Dockyard?  If not, what else are we to deduce from it?  I cannot remember any precedent in this House for three members of the Government putting down an amendment calling on themselves and their colleagues to take a certain action.</P>
    <P>When this amendment was handed to me at 12 noon today it caused a certain amount of incredulity and amusement not alone on my part but on the part of my colleagues who read it.  We could not believe such amendment would be put down.  It is totally meaningless in its terms because it is virtually the same as the original motion except that it leaves out certain bits and it asks the Government to do a certain thing.  It is fair to conclude from that that different parts of the Government have different views about this matter.</P>
    <P>If there is collective responsibility, why are three members of the Government asking the Government as a whole to do something?  It may be simply due to bad draftsmanship. Obviously the amendment was got out in a great hurry today, in the middle of a Government meeting.  It is probably designed to get Deputies in the Cork area off the hook so far as the original motion is concerned, but it is a ham-fisted and almost laughable way of doing it.  It has repercussions for the whole doctrine of collective responsibility which go way beyond the terms of this motion and the series of problems we are discussing under it.  They are of grave, long-term importance from the point of view of collective responsibility and parliamentary government.</P>
    <P>We presume the wording of the <Col N="86" /> amendment is so designed that it will cause somewhat less difficulty for the Labour and Fine Gael Deputies in the Cork region in voting for it.  This meaningless amendment will be put by the Chair in accordance with the usual practice, presumably it will be carried if everyone on the other side votes for it and the original motion will fall and will not be put by the Chair.  If this is the purpose it may well succeed but it is the most ham-fisted way of achieving it that I have ever seen.</P>
    <P>Our motion asks the Dáil to note with concern the placing of the order by Irish Shipping Limited.  If the Dáil refuses to note this with concern, it will be about the only institution in the country that so refuses because there is uproar not only in Cork but everywhere else with regard to what Irish Shipping have been allowed to do in a time of exceptional economic distress.</P>
    <P>We used the words &ldquo;and calls on the Government to intervene in this matter&rdquo; and I want to make clear what we mean here.  We mean we are calling on the Government to intervene because of the abnormal unemployment and the exceptional economic distress that exists.  We are calling on the Government to use their powers through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Transport and Power, or whatever Minister is appropriate in the matter, to inform Irish Shipping that in the circumstances they will have to cancel the order and that it should be replaced with Verolme Dockyard after suitable negotiations with that company have been carried out.  I say that at the outset in order to make it clear that is what we had in mind.  If the amendment, which is meaningless, is carried and the terms of our motion are not put, those who vote for the amendment are voting to encourage the Government not to intervene in the matter and to allow this substantial order to go to Japan.</P>
    <P>I am in the difficulty in opening this debate that the Minister for Transport and Power has said nothing about the placing of these orders with the exception of what he said in reply to <Col N="87" /> four questions from Deputies Brosnan and Cronin last week, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 285 of 19th November, columns 1558-1560.  What he said in those three columns is very limited.  We are given no figures for the actual contract.  All we are told is that the Minister believes that the cost of these ships would be considerably more&mdash;he estimated 40 per cent&mdash;if the contract were placed with a European dockyard which, I presume, includes Verolme in Cork.  He gives no indication of any alternative work for Verolme Dockyard in future other than the hope of a fishery protection vessel and the possibility of B &amp; I building a vessel, which he cannot guarantee would be built in Cork, and also the fact that Verolme Dockyard were hopeful of getting a fair share of the work arising from the Marathon platforms in the Kinsale gas field.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I have no assistance in terms of official information and I must rely for information in regard to this matter on what has been printed in newspapers which has not been denied and which I accept is reasonably accurate.  There it is stated that the price of these two ships as agreed with the Japanese shipyard is £11.2 million.  So far as one can estimate the Verolme price would be about 30 per cent more than that, about £3.2 million more.</P>
    <P>I want to make some general comments in regard to the failure of the Government, for the sake of £3 million or a little more, to insist on this contract being placed in Cork, which is the only dockyard in the Republic of Ireland suitable for orders of this size.  At present there are between 1,200 and 1,250 men employed at Verolme Dockyard.  They are among the highest-paid industrial workers in Ireland.  I cannot give precise figures for wages but in the case of a great many of these workers their pay is in the region of £80 or £90 a week and in quite a number of cases more.  Because of the size of their wages the income tax these men pay is considerably higher than the average amount paid by Irish industrial workers.  The country stands to lose, <Col N="88" /> because of the difficulties that now face Verolme as a result of the loss of this contract, a substantial sum every week in income tax and a fairly sizeable sum in social welfare contributions which would be made by workers who are now apparently becoming redundant in 1976.  The Exchequer will also stand to lose a considerable amount in VAT which would have accrued to the Exchequer from the expenditure, which is high, of these workers.  More exact figures will be given by my colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, when he speaks in this debate.  Even without precise figures nobody can deny that the loss to the Exchequer under these three headings is very substantial.</P>
    <P>As well as losing these amounts in a positive way, the Exchequer will be faced with, directly or indirectly, paying out unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, redundancy payments and pay-related benefits.  I know that a high proportion of these come out of special funds, but in the last resort they have to be supplemented and helped by the Exchequer. Also, the general area will lose the circulation of money and a large number of subcontractors and providers of various services to the dockyard will lose very substantially.  The loss to the Exchequer and to the general economy as a result of the loss of this contract for the sake of about £3 million will far exceed that figure.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to get precise figures but there is no doubt that at the very least these figures would cancel each other out.  It seems to me to be a strange form of economics when the Government approach the matter in this way&mdash;&ldquo;We shall let this go in order to save £3 million or so but we are quite happy to pay out roughly the same amount or lose it and that will not really matter so long as Irish Shipping Limited can produce healthy accounts and a good looking balance sheet.&rdquo;  I and my party think that approach, particularly at this time of exceptional difficulty in our economy, is totally erroneous and one that causes loss of confidence not only in this business but in all forms of business <Col N="89" /> activity right across the commercial and industrial spectrum.  If this is the approach of the Government in this case where substantial work would have been given&mdash;even though at a cost&mdash;and is not given while the Government will cheerfully pay out large sums in unemployment, redundancy and so on in lieu of that work being given, one cannot see much hope for the economy generally.</P>
    <P>The company in Japan, if one might so describe it, is a subsidiary of the Mitsui Corporation, one of these huge conglomerates of a size unique to Japan and at which our imagination in this part of the world boggles.  Their annual budget is probably a good deal bigger than the public national budget of this country.  Matters such as this £11.2 million are peanuts to them and whether they make a profit or a loss on them is of no consequence.  The shipbuilding yard in Japan which has got the contract is a small part of this enormous conglomerate and it pays Mitsui, as it would pay the other huge conglomerate there, Mitsubishi, to have certain work carried out in certain of its subsidiaries even at a substantial loss&mdash;and I think it is accepted that they will make a substantial loss on this contract&mdash;because it suits their overall operation.  The evidence appears to be in this case that the Mitsui Corporation possess, through various other subsidiary companies of theirs, vast quantities of heavy steel suitable only for shipbuilding.  They own this steel because they bought it over the past couple of years in the belief that the market for large oil tankers which was very buoyant in 1971, 1972 and 1973 would continue into 1974 and 1975.  In fact it did not and they were stuck with a lot of this steel.  They are losing very heavily on the stocks they had and are anxious to get rid of it at all costs. That steel is readily adaptable to bulk carriers of this kind and it can be used by them easily in the course of building these two 27,000 ton drawing bulk carriers for Irish Shipping.  While the shipyard concerned, as an individual entity, may well, and will lose heavily on this transaction, the Mitsui Corporation as a whole will profit by it because they get rid of a lot of steel they <Col N="90" /> would otherwise be stuck with.  Therefore we are faced with the situation that the tender of the Japanese shipyard is an artificially low one that cannot be matched by any <i>bona fide</i> shipyard such as Verolme in Cork without State help or intervention of some kind.  The sort of things Mitsui are doing in relation to this contract have, no doubt, the blessing of the Japanese Government, who see it as being in the overall interest of the Japanese economy that a corporation such as Mitsui should trade profitably. If a loss on a particular shipbuilding contract ensues it does not matter if the corporation as a whole are suited by the operation, as appears to be so in the case of this conglomerate.</P>
    <P>One result of this is that the Japanese Government are encouraging this sort of activity on the part of their huge companies such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi, particularly in so far as export orders are concerned.  The Japanese Government would be less keen to encourage this sort of loss-making contract if it were a domestic Japanese contract.  But it is part of their policy&mdash;they are entitled to pursue such a policy because it is in their national interest&mdash;to encourage this sort of activity where export orders are concerned.  The result is that the price which Irish Shipping Limited have been quoted for the building of their two ships has to be less than would be quoted for a similar order to domestic shipping companies in Japan.  Unfortunately, one cannot prove this with precise figures on this side of the world, particularly as the Japanese are very inscrutable and do not divulge to anybody the details of the inner financial arrangements in deals of this kind. But I do not think anybody can seriously deny that this is a special export order at a special export price and that the domestic price would be higher.</P>
    <P>This being so, that activity comes within the GAAT definition of dumping: to sell on an export market at a price which is significantly below the domestic price for the same product is dumping on that export <Col N="91" /> market.  In recent years we heard a lot about the dumping of commodities, mainly cheap textiles and footwear, and a lot of allegations and counter allegations were made about this dumping.  There was a lot of pressure on the Government to take steps in relation to it and, finally, they took some steps in relation to certain dumping activities when it was proved beyond doubt to them that dumping was going on.  We have an incredible situation here in that we have dumping again, not in respect of cheap textiles costing 50p or £1 but in respect of huge ships costing £5,500,000 or £6 million.  It is dumping if these ships are being provided for companies abroad at a price significantly less than they would be for the domestic Japanese consumer. It is a practice which an independent <i>bona fide</i> shipyard such as Verolme has no chance against unless the Government intervene in their interests and the interests of their workers to give some subsidy to enable them to keep going.</P>
    <P>In asking the Government to intervene to cancel this order, even at this late stage, and to provide a subsidy to enable Verolme to build these ships which they vitally need in order to preserve employment, I am conscious of the fact that subsidies were frequently voted by this House for Verolme shipbuilding down the years. I have not gone through all the occasions on which they were voted subsidies but I should like to refer to one occasion, in 1963, not long after Verolme got going.  At that time Verolme hit a recession in the world shipping market and ran into difficulties, much the same as they are in now.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Jack Lynch, moved on 18th July, 1963, a Supplementary Estimate for £990,000 as a grant-in-aid for Verolme by way of subsidy.  The reference to the Supplementary Estimate is Volume 204, column 1386, of the Official Report.  Deputy Lynch explained that Verolme were meeting with difficulties and finding it difficult to compete.  Indeed, this speech might <Col N="92" /> have been delivered by a responsible Minister for Industry and Commerce in this House today coming in with another subsidy in order to enable Verolme to obtain this contract from Irish Shipping to keep their operations viable and men in employment.  Unfortunately, we do not have anybody looking for a subsidy today, a subsidy which, as far as this side of the House is concerned, would be willingly given.</P>
    <P>At that time there was grave risk to the employment of the men concerned and Verolme were unable to get contracts without some form of subsidy. The Government agreed and gave the subsidy.  One would have thought there would have been enthusiasm for such a move in order to preserve this important heavy industry in which there was, and still is, a large skilled work force, but instead Deputy Cosgrave moved that the Supplementary Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.  A fairly long, and pretty acrimonious debate followed on the question of this subsidy. The present Taoiseach, a Member of the Fine Gael Front Bench then, was opposed to it and he was followed by a number of Cork Deputies who, while they felt Deputy Cosgrave was right, wanted the money given to Verolme. Later in the debate he was followed by the late Deputy Sweetman and the former Deputy McGilligan.  They did not pull any punches and were strongly opposed to the giving of a subsidy.  At column 1484 we see that the debate came to an end and as a result of the arguments put forward Deputy Cosgrave said that although he was still opposed to the matter he would withdraw the motion to refer back and, instead, would move a motion to establish a Select Committee of the House to investigate the affairs of Verolme, including the advisability of the expenditure proposed in the Supplementary Estimate.  This did not appeal to the late Deputy Casey who moved an amendment to delete the words related to the Supplementary Estimate and that, apparently, was accepted.  Deputy Cosgrave's motion was then put and defeated by 67 votes to 53.</P>
    <P>I mention this as an indication of the feeling of, at the very least, the Fine Gael Party and certain parts of <Col N="93" /> the Labour Party in relation to this dockyard as long ago as 1963.  Now, 12 years later, we should not be too surprised, much as we might regret it, at their present attitude.</P>
    <P>In the 1965 by-election Deputy Fitzpatrick, now Minister for Lands in a speech in Cavan referred specifically to the Verolme Dockyard as an example of good money being thrown after bad, taxpayers' money being wasted on a useless product.  He said also that the Fine Gael Party were opposed to projects of this kind and did not believe in them.  That speech got quite a lot of notice at that time and caused a stir in the Cork region. It was taken as an indication of the Fine Gael Party policy in relation to the dockyard and the subsidies which had been given at that time and which were subsequently given to keep the dockyard in operation.</P>
    <P>When talking about subsidies for Verolme I am not talking about something that is unique to Verolme.  There is scarcely a shipyard in the world today, outside of Korea and Japan where labour costs are extremely low, that does not constantly get subsidies from its Government to enable it to tender for work which it would not otherwise get.  We have a classic example here of a pretty large contract which would be of great importance to Verolme, whose tender was £3 million too high.  They got no special assistance to obtain the contract.</P>
    <P>As a further example of the assistance given to the dockyard, in 1967 Deputy Colley, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, formed a company called Irish Shipping Finance Corporation Limited, a subsidiary of the Industrial Credit Company.  The purpose of that company was to provide Verolme Dockyard and ship-builders and owners at that time with finance on reasonable terms and so enable the contracts to be carried out by Verolme.  Otherwise Verolme would not have been able to tender competitively for these contracts.</P>
    <P>We have a long history of assistance to this dockyard, assistance that was badly needed at that time but is far more seriously needed today when <Col N="94" /> there are 107,500 people out of work&mdash; a figure that has never been equalled since our Independence.  If these subsidies were necessary in the days of 50,000 unemployed, how much more necessary are they today when there are more than 107,000 out of work.</P>
    <P>I am flabbergasted that this contract was allowed to go out of the country. It has been known since August that Irish Shipping were having consultations and discussions with Mitsui in Japan.  Very strong representations were made by Deputies in Cork, trade unions and other interested parties asking the Government to avoid giving sanction to Irish Shipping's proposal to place the order in Japan.  All these suggestions and proposals fell on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>I recall being at a dinner in Cobh on the night of Friday, 18th September last at which Deputy Brosnan spoke at length and very forcefully about the very strong rumour then current in Cobh that the order for these two ships was to be given to Japan.  He had the unanimous backing not just of everybody connected with the shipyard, but of everybody in Cork, Cobh and the surrounding areas and everybody throughout the country who is interested in the economic progress of our nation. Unfortunately, his protest fell on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>It was confirmed last week that the contract had been given to Japan and the consequences have been spelled out by Verolme.  With the orders they have on hands they cannot guarantee employment for their work force after October, 1976.  They have already cut down on their intake of apprentices this year because of their poor order book.  Because orders take a long time to come to the actual fabrication stage it would appear, as there are now only 11 months to go to October, 1976, that even if big orders were to come straightaway there would still be a valley period in which some of this highly-skilled work force will have to be let go.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Transport and Power was asked last week by Deputy Cronin and Deputy Brosnan about the possibility of orders or work <Col N="95" /> being obtained by Verolme, the best he could do was to say that &ldquo;Negotiations are, I believe, in progress about the ordering of a fishery protection vessel for the Naval Service&rdquo;. I would like to say a word or two about this.  This has been referred to more than once as if it would solve Verolme's and everybody else's problems. The order for this small ship has been actively negotiated since we were in Government in early 1973.  I am not sure of its exact tonnage but I think it is something over 1,000 tons. By comparison with the two ships we are talking about now, this is very small.  An exact sister ship was ordered by us in 1970.  It took only 12 months to design and build and it was launched in 1971.  I am advised that the amount of actual working time on the ship was only three months.  I am afraid that that ship is not going to solve anybody's problems.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that exactly 12 months ago at a by-election in north-east Cork the Minister for Defence announced that the order was being placed with Verolme.  He announced this a month after he became Minister for Defence.  Unfortunately, the order still has not been placed.  Even if the Minister were to place the order today it is still only a minor order.  Although it might be considered important to the Naval Service and to general fishery protection, it is of very little consequence to Verolme.</P>
    <P>The other suggestion is in relation to the possibility of a B &amp; I ship which might or might not be built, depending on the financial circumstances of the B &amp; I company.  Even if they were to decide to build it, neither they nor the Minister could give a guarantee that it will be built in Cork.  The Minister said also that Verolme were hopeful of getting a fair share of the work from the Marathon platforms in the Kinsale gas field.  That, I am afraid, is a very speculative hope indeed.  We read in today's papers how disappointed Marathon are that after five years of intensive searching they have only one gas field and no oil well off our south coast, and they are becoming dubious about discovering oil there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> A couple of weeks after what is described as a Buy Irish Campaign began on the instructions of the Government, with money voted in this House, we have an incredible example of the Government allowing a State-sponsored body, all the shares in which are owned publicly, to place an order for two very substantial ships on the other side of the world at a time when it is well known that one of the few heavy industries here is running into serious difficulties from lack of orders.  If this is the kind of example we are getting from the Government in relation to commodities, such as bulk carriers of this kind costing £11 million or more, how can any housewife or shopkeeper be expected to further the economic interest of our nation by buying Irish in relation to small matters which come within their own buying power?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley sought to read great significance into the amendment in the names of the Minister for Transport and Power, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and in my own name.  All we seek in this amendment to the motion is to indicate that as far as this Government are concerned the maintenance of employment in Verolme Dockyard is a high priority and that no unemployment will occur in that yard, that there will be no reduction in the numbers presently working in that yard, in the present term of this Administration, in the next term or any future term.  We attach a great deal of importance to the maintenance of the maximum employment at this yard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make this point initially because we seek, in relation to employment at Verolme, to prevent a recurrence of the practice under previous Administrations where we had a reduction in the work force, a stop-go policy in the whole of the yard's life, no knowledge about what was to happen next year or the year after.  This has been the unhappy experience under the previous Administration.  We hope to depart from that and to be in a position very shortly, certainly before the end of this month, to back up by more than words a solid assurance of employment in that yard into the foreseeable future.  We have put the <Col N="97" /> amendment down to indicate that that is the case.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of natural disquiet about the placing of the order for the two Irish Shipping vessels in a Japanese yard.  Looking at the facts simply presented one would ask what could be the excuse for such a step at this time.  Both the Minister for Industry and Commerce and myself were approached last weekend at the annual conference of our party by delegates from the Cork region who expressed disquiet, and we listened to those delegates' representations, and entered into discussions with them.  We subsequently held further discussions with the Minister for Transport and Power, and we are satisfied that the decision to place the order for the two ships in the Japanese yards is, on the facts before us, justified on economic grounds.  We are also satisfied that the future employment of the yard is secure, and that is why we believe that the decision of the Minister for Transport and Power is the correct one.</P>
    <P>The Opposition would not be doing their work as an Opposition if they did not seek to exploit the placing of these orders in a foreign yard.  <i>The Cork Examiner</i>, on the 22nd of this month, refers to disquiet and a demonstration in Cork on the issue of the placing of the order for these ships and says:</P>
    <P>A group of Fianna Fáil Dáil Deputies were on the steps of the City Hall as the protest march arrived.</P>
    <P>I can sympathise with the feelings of workers who are worried about their jobs and who march in defence of those jobs, and I certainly would consider their fears justified if no guarantee was forthcoming about maintenance of employment in the yard.  However, guarantees are forthcoming from this Administration.  What I find it difficult to understand is the good faith of the Fianna Fáil Dáil Deputies awaiting the marchers on the steps of Cork City Hall, when I consider that those Deputies, some of them new Deputies&mdash;Deputy Fitzgerald was not around admittedly&mdash;are members of a party who when they held office <Col N="98" /> had four ships built in Upper Clyde. Therefore I find some inconsistency in the attitudes of the Deputies opposite.</P>
    <P>We heard Deputy O'Malley make a very good case.  I am not blaming him for the past of his party in the Cork region, but I think in fairness he will agree, and probably Deputy Lynch, if he speaks on the motion, will accept, that there is some inconsistency in the position taken up by Cork Fianna Fáil Deputies.  I have no doubt there was good reason for the placing of those orders for ships in Upper Clyde. I do not have the actual details of it but I have no doubt that the then Minister for Industry and Commerce based his decision on good economic grounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <P>There will be further time in this debate to discuss the inconsistency.  There were probably good reasons for the previous action&mdash;I can see there were&mdash;but if the argument is made that placing orders in foreign yards should not be countenanced, one must consider why it could be countenanced when Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>

      <P>We are giving an assurance of continued employment in the yard, and as soon as the details of the Capital Budget Programme are drawn up, we feel confident that the order for the new B &amp; I car ferry will ensure continued employment in the yard for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the reasons that justify the Government in placing the order for these two ships in foreign yards? I shall not follow Deputy O'Malley into the intricacies of the conflict of the Japanese with the rules and regulations of GATT.  I shall leave that to my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Nor shall I <Col N="99" /> enter into the argument of the scale of operation of Mitsui in contrast with that of Verolme Dockyard.  That will be dealt with later.  However, I would make one or two remarks in justification of the Government's decision. I am basing them on the requirement of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about Irish jobs, we must concern ourselves also with the 500 jobs in Irish Shipping.  That is a company who are not in receipt of any subsidy from the Government and who are earning for us something like £8 million per year in foreign exchange.  Of course the international shipping business is at present under-going a very difficult period in common with most other economic activities, and it is extremely important that that company should be in a position to have their ships built at the lowest possible price.  If we depart from the criterion in relation to Irish Shipping we make them less capable of withstanding competition, in which circumstances no subsidy of this Government can save them.</P>
    <P>There are ships presently locked up in Norwegian yards.  Irish Shipping must compete in these Pacific lane-ways. They have been doing it quite adequately, and the two ships in question here, multi-purpose carriers, will ensure that Irish jobs are maintained in Irish Shipping, but Deputy O'Malley says that there is very little difference between the tenders of the two yards.  In the Japanese yard both ships will cost about £5.7 million each and the sum involved is 25 per cent below the cost of building similar ships in the Verolme Cork Dockyard.  As Deputy O'Malley rightly says, this is no slur on the Cork dockyard.  It is simply a scale of operation which is out of proportion to the scale of the operation which Verolme Dockyard could manage.  Verolme Dockyard is not even of the proportion of a single bay of the large Japanese yards.  Again there is no slur cast on the capacity of the Cork dockyard.  It is simply stating the facts that the difference in price is enormous, and would certainly suggest that Irish Shipping must be given the freedom by this Government, <Col N="100" /> if we are to maintain their competitiveness, to order their ships in yards where they can get the lowest possible price, especially if one can combine that policy with maintaining maximum employment in Verolme Dockyard, and we can do that.  Irish Shipping made their decision to place the order with the Japanese company on the basis of a very comprehensive package and it included the following considerations.</P>
    <P>First, there was the matter of financing the purchase.  The Japanese are providing a loan of 70 per cent of the cost of the ships and the loan is repayable over seven years at an interest rate of 8¾ per cent, and this compares with the current lending rate in Ireland of something like 14 per cent.  This price cannot be matched in Ireland or in Europe.  They have given Irish Shipping a guaranteed fixed price which will not escalate with inflation, the guarantee that if the ships are not delivered Irish Shipping will be refunded whatever payment they have already made.  If it were possible for these terms to be repeated in Ireland, Irish Shipping could have placed those orders here in Ireland, but it is clear that the lower capital cost of the ships, the lower interest charges, place Irish Shipping in a strong competitive position and make that company capable of charging lower charter rates and earning more money for this country in these very difficult times.  The purchase of the two ships will enable Irish Shipping to maintain the place they have won for themselves in these very difficult sea lanes in which they ply for trade and manage to attract business.</P>
    <P>There was also the advantage that the delivery times quoted by the Japanese company for the two ships are September and December, 1976. That again is a date we could not meet with the capacity of Verolme. I repeat, in case Deputies opposite continue to resist looking at the facts and continue to attempt to exploit the situation for whatever local political advantage they may think lies in such exploitation, that this is no slur on workers or management of Verolme Dockyard.  It is simply com <Col N="101" /> paring two different things.  It is comparing a country which has been to the forefront of international shipbuilding since the second world war and a small yard in a country which could not compete with such an international giant in the shipbuilding world.  Verolme is at present building a 70,000-ton bulk carrier for a Danish company.  It is in the process of finishing a 51,000-ton bulk carrier for a German firm.  The work on these two ships will keep the employees going for some considerable time yet.  There is no doubt about the future employment in that company, but as I said, there will be a very early Government announcement that will banish all doubts on this score.  The difference between the Japanese company's price and the European price is about £3.8 million, a not inconsiderable sum.  A subvention of £2.8 million would be required if these ships were to be built by Verolme.</P>
    <P>I think I have said enough to explain the circumstances of Irish Shipping placing the order with this foreign yard, first, the attractive credit arrangements, certainty about delivery dates, and lower prices.  Verolme yard could not compete, could not offer the same terms.  However, it is within their capacity to perform quality work and the Government will shortly announce a firm order with the yard.</P>
    <P>Of course, to add further security and to dispel any doubts there may be on the part of anyone as to the Government's approach to the future of the yard, we intend to make a decision on the application currently before the Industrial Development Authority for an extension of yard development because it is possible that the yard may do much more work if it is extended sufficiently to cater for the off-shore oil industry.</P>
    <P>There are lots of development adjacent to Cork Harbour.  It will be for the Cork dockyard to play its part in ensuring that it services any work that may ensue from this development in the area.  It will be necessary to give such permission shortly.  This would permit a substantial part of the work force being freed for such off-shore development work in the years <Col N="102" /> ahead.  This is a very lucrative area of development.  Both in terms of wages and jobs it can be said that if the future of every other area in Ireland was as bright as that of Cork Harbour, there would be very little to worry about.  Increased employment is expected over the entire Cork Harbour area over the next year or two, work associated with the off-shore oil activities. This will provide jobs for welders, pipe fitters, skills now employed in Verolme, all of which will be required.  In fact, I have been stepping up the training activities in the area available to us under the National Training Authority.  I am considering plans for an extension of that training in the Cork area because it will be required in that area.  Cork is rapidly becoming the centre of very heavy industrial development.  All pointers suggest that its future prosperity is not in doubt.  In that future prosperity there is a secure place for Verolme Cork Dockyard.  If it is being whispered in the Cork area, by Opposition Deputies, that its future is in doubt, this cannot be said, in fairness, to be in accord with the facts of either the industrial development of Cork Harbour or the plans the Government have for the development of the Verolme Cork Dockyard.</P>
    <P>I would advise Members opposite that there is no political mileage to be got out of talking about the Government's intentions in relation to Cork dockyard.  I would advise them to switch rapidly to some other topic. Otherwise there will be no reward. There will be no Government casualties. The only casualties will be the weary feet on the Opposition side of this House. Their prognostications will not be borne out.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and I and the Labour Party delegates had to consider the maintaining of Irish Shipping and its employees in secure employment also.  We also had to ensure that ships were delivered at the right time and at the right price.  We could get the ships at the right time at the right price from Mitsui.  Verolme depend on foreign orders for the maintenance of employment in Cork dockyard. We may ensure in valley periods <Col N="103" /> that there is sufficient work there through certain orders we may give to the yard but in general the yard must maintain full order books also by getting orders from abroad.</P>
    <P>If the yard were to depend solely on home orders it would have no secure future.  We believe that in a mix of home orders and foreign orders the future of the yard is secure.  I mentioned the work of welders in relation to off-shore oil.  We have to consider the construction of the NET fertiliser plant, not forgetting the ESB generating station at Whitegate.  Their future will be all the more assured by the natural gas find off Kinsale. Shortly the Government will dispel any doubts there may be in regard to the future of Verolme.</P>
    <P>There are adequate reasons why these two ships went to the Japanese yards.  It was not a decision we took lightly.  We considered it very carefully indeed and I believe most fairminded Members will agree that the best interests of all were secured by the decision we took.  Remember, we took the decision on the understanding that employment would be maintained in Verolme.  The names of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, of the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Labour to the amendment indicate our confidence that employment in the yard is secure and will be secure in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I formally move the amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;notes&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the placing in Japan by Irish Shipping Limited of an order for two large ships and asks the Government to ensure the continued employment of workers in Verolme Dockyard.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech we have just heard was full of inconsistencies. No facts were given to us. The air of mystery surrounding this entire transaction still surrounds it.  I and my party, despite lectures and sermons from the Minister for Labour, will fight the case of the Irish workers and the Cork workers when they are <Col N="104" /> facing difficulties such as they are facing at the moment.  Can we accept assurances from the Minister for Labour or any of his colleagues with regard to employment in the dockyard or elsewhere when a short ten or 12 months ago we had assurances from a colleague of his about a huge number of workers in another concern with headquarters in County Cork?  Not alone are these workers adversely affected but the work force throughout the constituency is also affected.</P>
      <P>The amendment can only be described as laughable.  It is tabled by no fewer than three Ministers, two of whom are sitting here.  They make a complete joke of parliamentary procedure in order to placate the Members sitting behind them.  I say to those Members that the really important words have been left out of this amendment.  At the circus in Dún Laoghaire over the weekend there was a motion to the effect that it was the intention of the Government to prevent the order for the two bulk carriers being placed in Japan.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power and Irish Shipping intended to place an order for four ships with the Japanese yard.  Because of our motion it has now been decided that the second two ships will not now be placed with Japanese yards but will, hopefully, be placed with Verolme Dockyard.  Had the entire order being placed with Verolme Irish workers would not have had to look for assurances from anybody. They would have had concrete evidence of the sincerity of the Government.  On Wednesday, 19th November, the Cork branch of the Labour Party in a statement in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> described the placing of the order abroad as incomprehensible and inexplicable.  Yet the Minister for Labour sees fit now to defend the action of the Government in placing this order abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first intimation about this matter appeared in a trade magazine called <i>Marine Week</i> on 26th September last under the heading: &ldquo;First Order for Japan&rdquo;.  The writer, obviously an Englishman, expressed <Col N="105" /> amazement at the decision of the Irish Government to place the order for these ships abroad.  The magazine on 26th September contained an official announcement about the placing of the order.  On 1st October the following appeared in the <i>Cork Examiner:</i>&ldquo;Order Report Incorrect, Says Irish Shipping&rdquo;.  This is the mystery.  This is the uncertainty. These are the untruths which have been projected to the public and to the workers about whom the Minister for Labour now expresses concern. I wonder how genuine is the concern he expresses.  He mentioned my name in connection with a march or a parade last week and he forgave me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was absolving the Deputy of any inconsistency since he was not a Deputy some years ago when the Fianna Fáil Party placed orders in Scotland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with the Minister's inconsistency. About 107,000 workers, or almost 40,000 more since they assumed office, are now unemployed in addition to a huge number of school leavers.  These people can hardly be expected to believe any assurance given by any Minister of this Government now or in the future.  That is why any assurances given must be questioned.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about inconsistency. The basic difference is this. The Minister for Transport and Power was quoted in the Dáil last week by Deputy O'Malley in his reply to questions from Deputy Brosnan and Deputy Cronin concerning this transaction. He gave reasons, which were repeated by the Minister here tonight, for placing these orders for ships abroad and said they were completely financial.  Maybe so.  If two Minister say something we may eventually begin to believe them.  If we accept that as being true for the moment, there is no question of a delivery date being a problem.  Other speakers after me will question very closely when the order was first placed and who is telling the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the delivery date is not a problem now, it was a problem in the past <Col N="106" /> and delivery dates could not be met. I want to show the inconsistency of the arguments put forward by the Minister.  In his usual capable and eminent way, Deputy O'Malley pointed out the difficulty our leader had as Minister for Industry and Commerce in getting the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party to support the concept of a shipbuilding yard in Verolme.  It should be embarrassing for the Ministers sitting over there to read the debates at that time and see the insinuations which were made. What insinuations could be made now when an order, the value of which we have not yet been informed, has been placed?  We have only a newspaper figure to go on.</P>
    <P>The Minister contradicted himself by giving two different figures.  He mentioned 25 per cent of a figure we will call X which we have not yet been told.  If it is the newspaper figure of £11.2 million it comes out at something like £2.8 million.  Later on he referred to a difference in price of £3.8 million.  It is not hard to understand why I say we cannot accept an assurance from a Minister when millions are lost in ten minutes in a speech.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said no subsidies were made available to Irish Shipping under the Fianna Fáil Government. Subsidies were made available to Irish Shipping for the building of ships at Verolme Dockyard.  I will give him the names of the ships if he wishes. What does the Minister mean by saying a considerable length of time is still available to the work force in Verolme?  I am sure he knows as well as I do, that you do not place an order for a ship as you would place an order for a shirt.  A considerable amount of preparation has to be done, designs have to be made and materials have to be ordered before the work starts. You cannot wave a magic wand and say there will be continuity of work.</P>
    <P>The fishery protection vessel has been mentioned.  If ever there was a political football it is that same fishery protection vessel.  It was kicked by some Ministers around the gate of Verolme Dockyard about a year ago. One Government backbencher became overgenerous recently and promised <Col N="107" /> a B &amp; I ship as well as a fishery protection vessel, despite the fact that it would probably take 12, 15 or 18 months to design a B &amp; I ship.  As reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 22nd November, 1975, not even the East-Cork Fine Gael TD could find words to defend the Government action.  &ldquo;I would rather think of an expanding yard at Verolme, than one that's afraid of falling to pieces&rdquo;, he said.  The Minister spoke blandly here tonight but, but for the pressure of our motion, no concern was being shown.  Their own backbenchers were not informed that something was in the pipeline, or was it pie in the sky?</P>
    <P>With regard to this offshore gas we have all heard so much about, how long has the Minister been toying around with the money that was to be made available and should be made available for the building of a new dock to cater for oil rigs and platforms? Is there any significance in the recent announcement that two orders for Marathon oil rigs have been placed with Scottish yards, despite the fact that Verolme are quite capable.  The work force have the expertise and yet they have been kept on a string for too long.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point on the redundancy situation referred to by the Minister.  Obviously up to now the Minister has not taken a great deal of interest in the affairs of Verolme Dockyard.  When previous redundancies occurred, Fianna Fáil arranged with the Verolme management for diversification of production to provide alternative work other than shipbuilding. They still carry on quite a sizeable amount of that work. The work force of Verolme has been built up and a considerable standard of expertise has been reached.  I do not believe there is a comparable work force in the country. At present, it is somewhere around the figure of 1,210 people in excellent employment, in the top league in their earning capacity.  I am sure everybody in the House is agreed on that.  This has been built up over a number of years to a figure which is now almost at its peak.  When we see 101,000 people idle, and 40,000 jobs lost under <Col N="108" /> this Government, can we blame these good workers for being concerned about their future?  Up to now no positive steps have been taken to ensure that, after October next, employment will continue in that dockyard.  The waving of a wand does not provide employment in a yard such as this.</P>
    <P>I have referred to wages.  Conditions there are excellent and industrial relations are very good.  One of the most important things in that yard is the safety consciousness at worker and management level.  The loyalty and interest of the work force are of a very high standard.  There is very high morale in that yard.  With regard to training, before the advent of AnCO, training of a very sophisticated nature was carried out at Verolme.  Their present expenditure on training is in the region of £120,000 per year and the work force are trained to a very high level of skill not only in this country but abroad.  They have spared nothing in that direction.</P>
    <P>Training is important for offshore development.  The Minister referred to it a while ago.  Nowhere else is there more expertise available to AnCO than at Verolme.  How sincere is the Minister, or how sincere is anyone, when for more than two years now the plans for the building of the new dock have been lying about in the Department?</P>
    <P>Let me come back to the figures, to the assumed cost, as that is all we have to go on.  We are led to believe that the figure abroad is in the region of £11.2 million.  Our following speaker will explain to the Minister for Transport and Power alternative methods for financing the purchase of these vessels from Verolme Dockyard, financed by money that could be available as easily and as cheaply to the Government had they taken steps to explore them. Obviously they were not able to resist the pressures of the Irish Shipping management or possibly the board of directors of Irish Shipping.  Let there be no doubt that the concern of Fianna Fáil for Irish Shipping was always a very real one.  Who set up and expanded that concern?  Fianna Fáil did that.  The work force of Irish Shipping need have no concern about our interest.  Surely the sensible thing is to <Col N="109" /> combine the work force of Irish Shipping and of Verolme Dockyard?</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the figure of £11.2 million.  Deputy O'Malley mentioned a figure of 30 per cent and the Government have reduced that to 25 per cent.  This means the difference was probably less than £3 million. There could have been an overall saving to the economy if people had considered the matter in a sensible way. Let us take a number of 1,200 workers with an average wage of £3,500.  There is an annual pay-out by Verolme in respect of wages of a figure in excess of £4 million.  The Government may take it that direct taxation on that figure would be in excess of £1 million when one considers PAYE and social welfare contributions by the staff.  This is money immediately given back to the Government.  As there are two vessels involved in a two-year period, we may double that amount and immediately there is £2 million given back to the Government.  I am not talking about the purchase of a pint by the worker, or the purchase of a gallon of petrol, cigarettes or even a television licence.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost of the ship, approximately 60 per cent would be spent on wages and materials and this would be spent at home.  Sixty per cent of £11.2 million is between £5 million and £6 million.  Therefore, it can be seen that a considerable amount of money will come back to the Government by way of direct and indirect taxation.  Some of the money might be invested in savings and all of this would be of benefit to the economy Where, then, is the small savings, whether it is £2.8 million or £3.8 million?</P>
    <P>The Minister said there need be no concern about workers in Cork harbour. If one stands in Verolme Dockyard one can look across at Irish Steel Holdings.  In case the Minister does not know, approximately 500 jobs have been lost there in a comparatively short time.  How can we accept assurances from the other side when we are satisfied that people's confidence is being eroded daily?  There are 107,000 people unemployed and last night the Minister for Finance said the figure would be 120,000 in the not <Col N="110" /> too distant future.  That figure was given by the Minister's colleague, the person presently in charge of the financial purse of this country to the detriment of every Irish worker.</P>
    <P>The Minister made statements about the future of the dockyard. Let us hope that at least our efforts here will impress on the Ministers present the mistake they made in placing this order abroad.  We are asking the Government to intervene, to cancel the order and to give it to Verolme Dockyard.  We are asking that this be done at a time when the economy needs this kind of measure. It is not enough to say that the Irish worker will be kept in employment. If we can see positive signs that the Government are serious in this matter we will support them in measures designed to generate money in the economy.  The Government should give the jobs to workers at home, not to Japanese workers.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister referred to the B &amp; I vessel that may be built in the near future.  Will the Minister tell us what is happening regarding this matter?  Everyone knows a vessel is needed but there is much uncertainty.  If such an order can be placed with Verolme Dockyard, let the Minister clear up the matter in this debate.  For once, let him tell the House what is happening with regard to the comings and goings of Irish Shipping in Japan; let him tell us how long that has been going on and what has been the cost to Irish Shipping.  Let him state if there were bonuses in it for anyone.  This will be gone into in greater detail by one of the other speakers who has comments to make on it.</P>

      <P>Before the debate was adjourned we were discussing the nature of the inheritance tax and Deputy Colley had asked the Minister what was the difference in principle between this and the death duties that were abolished.  That led to the Minister for Lands saying that there was a difference in principle.  In order to clear the air I think we should look at it this way.  I am talking now on principle.  I am not derogating from the benefits that are being conferred by this tax, and the Minister is not to take it that I want to minimise that situation.  To the question raised by Deputy Colley, and partly answered <Col N="113" /> before the adjournment of the debate by the Minister for Lands, I think the objective answer is this: from the point of view that both taxes arise out of and are payable on a death they are both death duties.  Both inheritance tax and the old estate duty and the other duties that were lumped together as death duties are of the same genus in that they are occasioned by and are payable on a death. I think it is therefore legitimate to describe both the inheritance and legacy taxes and anything else under this part of this Bill, other than gifts <i>inter vivos,</i> as death duties equally with the old death duties.  The Minister will recall that this was why we quarrelled with the marginal note in the Finance Act which spoke of the &ldquo;abolition of death duties&rdquo;.  We regard that as a little trick to get political kudos, which I suppose is legitimate, but it seemed so unnecessary considering the very real benefits the Minister was giving under this Bill.  In that sense, therefore, there is no difference in principle and death duties have not been abolished.</P>
      <P>Coming to the point made by the Minister for Lands, which I think is a valid point, it is this: in effect the tax being imposed here is in the nature of the old legacy duty and is imposed, so to speak, on the gift that arises on death&mdash;to put it that way&mdash;whereas the old estate duty was appropriated to the estate itself.  If I understood the Minister for Lands that is the distinction he made and I think it is valid.  If that is a difference in principle, I concede it.  If I misquoted the Minister, I should like to be corrected.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Lands, we understand, was deputising for the Minister.  In that sense I concede a difference in principle here. But if I may exercise the privilege of the Opposition, which the Minister over here did not hesitate to exercise himself, I may criticise the representation&mdash;indeed the misrepresentation&mdash; that death duties are abolished.  They are not; they are being modified or adjusted, and commendably adjusted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section we are continuing <Col N="114" /> taxes payable on death or continuing death duties in that sense on an adjusted scheme:</P>
    <P>A capital acquisitions tax, to be called inheritance tax and to be computed as hereinafter provided, shall, subject to this Act and the regulations thereunder, be charged, levied and paid upon the taxable value of every taxable inheritance taken by a successor, where the date of the inheritance is on or after the 1st day of April, 1975.</P>
    <P>In the next section it says: &ldquo;on a death&rdquo;.  Like section 4, this section is the kernel of the Bill which provides a new scheme in substitution, broadly speaking, for what was the death duty code.  It does this by introducing two new taxes&mdash;if you like to put it this way&mdash;a new tax under section 4 which applies to gifts <i>inter vivos.</i></P>
    <P>The second tax imposed is death duty in a modified form, with a new scheme, under section 10.  The two taxes together will be known to the law as capital acquisitions tax.  This section, like section 4, embodies the fundamental taxing provision in the Bill.  It is to be recognised as such and is, therefore, deserving of comment and recognition as to what it does.  Thereafter, in that part of the Bill, Part II, we dealt with the details of the incidence of the gift tax imposed by section 4 and in this Part we will deal with the incidence of inheritance tax under section 10.  We are, in principle, agreeing to that dichotomy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reply briefly to what the Deputy has said and the brevity is no indication of discourtesy.  The essential difference between estate duty, which is loosely called, with legacy duty and succession duty, death duties, was that it was a tax which was related to the amount which had to be paid on the size of the deceased's estate.  If it was distributed amongst the poorest of the poor the amount of estate duty was precisely the same, whereas under the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, be it a gift tax or an inheritance tax, the tax paid depends upon the amount received by a person at that time or <Col N="115" /> over a period of time and the relationship of that person to the donor.  That is a very fundamental difference.</P>
      <P>So far as death is an element here it is the timing of an event, the occasion which gives rise to the gift in relation to an inheritance tax but that has no relevance to the liability to tax. It has a relevance to the rate of charge because if the tax arises under inheritance it is greater than if it arises on a gift.  If it arises on a gift it is at 75 per cent of what it would have otherwise been.  That is the only relationship of death to the rate of tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to encourage people to dispose of property during their lifetime and not waiting until death, in order to encourage gifts <i>inter vivos,</i> we have a low rate of tax if the transfer of property takes place during the lifetime of the donor.  It is a very dramatic change and an improvement to relate the tax to the amount received which is what matters. That determines the capacity to pay and it relates the tax to the benefit received rather than imposing it on the amount which is distributed irrespective of the manner in which it is distributed. I accept that legacy and succession duty had regard to that relationship but that was a different tax, it was really a topping-up operation on estate duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct; there is a difference.  The former one is attaching to the estate and the present one is attaching to the legacy that goes to the donee.  We recongnise this but there would have been no stick if there was no marginal note in the Finance Bill.  In either code death duties was a colloquial description of generality.  I submit that the <Col N="116" /> words &ldquo;death duties&rdquo; are as applicable as a colloquial description to this as they were to the other.  In regard to the administration, the collection and a number of matters connected with this Bill, we will find procedurally and administratively, unfortunately, a greater similarity with the old code than any of us would like to see but that will be the subject of later debate.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 11.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 11 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides that the tax imposed by section 10 becomes effective on a death.  I should like the Minister to explain the following portion of subsection (1):</P>
      <P>... otherwise than for full consideration in money or money's worth paid by him, he shall be deemed to take an inheritance.</P>
      <P>What is the purpose of that?  Supposing somebody pays the estate and secures some property that is clearly, and for full consideration, a purchase from the estate.  Presumably, the full consideration goes back into the estate. One would have thought that would be due administration such as the realisation of assets.  How can a person be beneficially entitled on a death if he has already purchased it?  This purchase as I see it is something after death.  If it was a contingent purchase before death I could see difficulties arising.</P>
      <P>For instance, take a testator or an intestate who has certain property and X pays for this property, before death, full consideration at the time and then the testator or the intestate dies, surely there is a Revenue problem there, especially in an inflationary situation?  What &ldquo;full consideration&rdquo; would mean and at what time that &ldquo;full consideration&rdquo; would arise is a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if that intestate or testator, as the case may be, should die and the property in question is then disposed to a third person for full value, it seems to me to be a sale in the course of administration.  So far as revenue is concerned, it would <Col N="117" /> have to be in the course of administration and it would not seem to come in as an inheritance at all.  Could the Minister enlighten me on this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand Deputy de Valera correctly, he has raised two cases, the first is where A leaves property to B but the property in question has been purchased by B before the death takes place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A would not have that property to leave to B at the time of death because he would not be the owner.  He could leave B the proceeds of sale which he had collected from B if he wished, and that would be a gift, but he could not leave property which he did not own at the time of death, if he had already disposed of it, albeit to the person to whom he would have given the gift if the transaction had not been completed before the death took place.</P>
      <P>In the second illustration, Deputy de Valera already answered himself, because he accepts that if A disposes of property to B for full value, all A is doing is indicating B as a would-be purchaser and the purchase takes place after the event, but B acquires it from the administrator or executor. There is no transfer at all because the estate gets the full value.  B has paid full value.  The phrase &ldquo;paid by him&rdquo; may be causing some difficulty and the question may arise as to why it is there.  Consideration could be paid to some person other than the donor&mdash; admittedly usually it would be to the donor but not necessarily so.  For instance, A could give his house worth £25,000 to B in consideration of B giving £10,000 to C.  Then B could get a gift from A&mdash;the house worth £25,000&mdash;but the real value of the gift would be no more than £15,000.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister appreciates that I am raising these points in a constructive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to pursue the first point that struck me, although the Minister now brings a third case to mind.  Let me start again. Supposing A, who dies either testate or intestate, before death sells a certain property to B for full value as at that time&mdash;if this happened in 1973 and the death occurred today there would be big changes in value if shares were involved&mdash;he need not part with the property.  He could leave it in the possession of the original owner, A, and A would be in the position of being a bare trustee and an agent. Nevertheless, as far as law is concerned, he might possibly be linked in that the legal estate might remain in the vendor and practically the full trust estate in the purchaser.  The change only occurs on death.</P>
      <P>B becomes beneficially entitled on death.  As I said, there are three cases. The outright sale before death, even if it remains in possession of the vendor, might escape altogether as not coming within the category of a person becoming beneficially entitled in possession on death for various reasons.  I am interested in the case where a vendor could constructively in law be considered only to have become beneficially entitled on the occasion of the death of A.  That case is all right.  The only complication for the Revenue Commissioners is an inflationary one. I can conceive, if there was a loophole here for instance, that such a transaction could be used in an inflationary situation.  If certain shares had been bought in the boom period and the section were to capture them in the depression, Revenue would suffer and I would see a complication there.</P>
      <P>The second case seems to be clearly one of sale in the course of realisation of asset.  Under section 10 assets are directly no longer subject to tax, the incidence of tax will occur when the assets are actually in the hands of the distributees.  In that case the clause seems unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> If there is any substance in the comments I made&mdash;the Minister said he might be misunderstanding me and I freely admit that I may be misunderstanding the section&mdash;I would like the Minister to give them his consideration. I am not urging anything on him except a desire to have unforeseen discrepancies provided for.  I would be glad if the Minister would reiterate the reason for the words &ldquo;paid by him&rdquo;. What would happen if those words were left out?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I hope I understand the Deputy correctly, if not I have no doubt he will put me right.  I think he made the case that A might sell the property to B for full value and B might appoint A as his trustee until A dies, whereupon B would become entitled in possession.  Am I right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt to say that, in the problematical things I have said, I do not expect the Minister to give me a comprehensive answer to this.  If I have raised something that should be considered, I am content to leave it with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I greatly appreciate the Deputy's understanding in that regard, because some of the problems he has posed are such as would give <Col N="120" /> lawyers much food for thought and some of them, as a practising lawyer, I could see myself taking down to the Law Library before giving an answer to a client.  Therefore, I appreciate the Deputy not pressing me for an instant reply.</P>
      <P>Of course consideration does not normally arise under wills or intestacies. It can to some extent.  Sometimes consideration is made a condition of receiving a gift.  What we are concerned with primarily here are cases where transactions could arise where a gift is made within two years of death and may involve some element of consideration.  We would have to look at that situation to see whether or not full consideration had been given for the particular gift received in order to ascertain whether there was some residue, as it were, which should be looked at for the purposes of the inheritance tax.</P>
      <P>The other elements that have been considered by the Deputy I shall certainly look at between now and the next Stage and if we consider it is necessary to deal with them specifically needless to say we shall come forward with an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I refer to subsection (2) which says:</P>
      <P>The provisions of subsections (2), (4) and (5) of section 5 shall apply, with any necessary modifications, in relation to an inheritance as they apply in relation to a gift.</P>
      <P>The Minister is satisfied that that is sufficiently explicit, I hope, because we have the old story here that by naming certain subsections there, you exclude what might be applied with necessary modifications elsewhere, and there is always a certain danger in that type of legislation, but I take it the Minister is quite happy about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as happy as the Deputy can be in relation to language of that kind, but the Deputy will appreciate that it would be interpreted as meaning that where the word &ldquo;gift&rdquo; appears in section 5 it should read &ldquo;inheritance&rdquo;.  It is of that nature, to convert section 5 to a section <Col N="121" /> which is applicable to inheritances, but we are satisfied it is the best way of dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

In subsection (2) there are the words &ldquo;property which was to be appropriated to the inheritance&rdquo; and &ldquo;property out of which property was to be appropriated to the inheritance&rdquo; shall not include any property which was not applicable to satisfy the inheritance. That phrase &ldquo;applicable to satisfy the inheritance&rdquo; is getting very near a technicality.  Could the Minister interpret that phrase and give the authority for the interpretation?  What precisely is the limitation implied in the words &ldquo;applicable to satisfy the inheritance&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>Section 12 (1) (b) (I) contains the phrase &ldquo;which was to be appropriated to the inheritance&rdquo; and (II) uses the phrase: &ldquo;out of which property was to be appropriated to the inheritance&rdquo;. Then one comes to (b) (ii) which says: &ldquo;a part of proportion of the property, out of which property was to be appropriated to the inheritance, was situate in the State,...&rdquo; There is the contrast between the two phrases as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I want to define subsection (1) (b) (i) (II), which deals with a share of residue or a pecuniary legacy payable out of the residue where the whole residue was Irish. For instance, £5,000 in any Irish bank account goes to B.  In these cases the whole inheritance would be taxable. The situs of property is looked to as at the date of the inheritance which, of course, is normally the date of death.  Paragraph (b) (ii) contains the words &ldquo;a part&rdquo;.  Say an English testator leaves all his securities to X. The securities are partly Irish, partly otherwise.  The Irish securities are taxable. I come now to the words &ldquo;or proportion&rdquo;.  There is a pecuniary legacy under a foreigner's will which is payable out of the residue which is a quarter Irish and three-quarters foreign&mdash;a quarter of the legacy would be taxable.</P>
      <P>As to subsection (2), paragraph (a), in deciding the amount taxable in the examples I have given, a specific legacy to a different legatee would be excluded in determining how much of the pecuniary legacy was Irish. Thus one would look only to the property available to meet the pecuniary legacies after excluding specific bequests or property given on trust to pay debts, costs or annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to paragraph (b) of subsection (2), for example, a foreigner owns Irish land and leaves it on trust for sale to foreign trustees and bequeaths legacies out of the proceeds of sales. The land is looked to as at the date of the inheritance&mdash;usually the date of death&mdash;and the legacies are treated as being payable out of Irish property. If this provision was not made each legatee would take a foreign, chose in <Col N="123" /> action or a right against the foreign trustee for a sum of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that explanation.  As far as it is possible in circumstances such as these, he has made the position commendably clear.  That is not quite the point worrying me here, whether the jurisdiction is foreign or local.  What I am concerned about is the general import of the phrase &ldquo;applicable to satisfy the inheritance&rdquo;.  The Minister may think I am not doing him the courtesy of following up his argument. I admit freely that I have not sufficient knowledge at present.  I accept everything he says.  I get the impression that in the case of any inheritance the property from which it can be taken will depend on a number of factors, including the priority of charges.  Does the Minister know what I mean?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>For instance, burial charges, revenue charges and so on.  If one were to pursue that argument, one would have burial charges, tax charges encumbrances of various sorts, and a nett.  I could understand generally that that might be what was meant by the phrase the property that was applicable to satisfy the inheritance.</P>
      <P>I want to ask this from the point of view of the structure of the Bill. It will depend largely on the terms of a will.  Something is going to be imported here that was not in the old code.  Under the old code it was the estate which was taxed.  Here the legacy will be taxed.  There can be a case of priorities in the regard to the property.  In other words, as prior claims are satisfied the property left to satisfy a particular inheritance becomes less and less.  Am I then to understand that the meaning of that phrase &ldquo;applicable to satisfy the inheritance&rdquo; taken as a general phrase in the Bill means what nett property is left out of which the inheritance in question can be paid?  Is that a fair interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;applicable to satisfy the inheritance&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>What we are primarily concerned with in this section is the situs of the property.  I would agree generally with what the Deputy has said.  Obviously if a specific legacy is diminished in value because there are prior charges on the estate what is taxed is only the amount actually received and not the amount left, because if it is left subject to prior charges those prior charges have to be disposed of and the value of the gift is only that which is actually received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 13, to delete subsection (3) and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Subsection (1) shall not have effect to the extent of the amount of any consideration in money or money's worth received for the disclaimer, renunciation, election or lapse or for the waiver of a claim; and the receipt of such consideration shall be deemed to be a gift or an inheritance, as the case may be, in respect of which no consideration was paid by the donee or successor and which was derived from the disponer who provided the property in relation to which the benefit, entitlement, claim or right, referred to in subsection (1), arose.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subsection (3), as introduced, it could be argued that the gift or inheritance which was deemed to be taken was taken for a consideration, that an allowance should be made under section 18 for such considerations.  That would defeat the purpose of the provision and the amendment is necessary to prevent that.  The possible argument would have been on the grounds that the giving up of the right waived was the giving of consideration. For example, A is given lands <Col N="125" /> worth £20,000 under the will of X Another person, B, who is the residuary legatee, has been living on the land and to avoid trouble A agrees to forego the devise of the lands on payment to him, out of the estate, of £10,000.  Subsection (3) makes him liable to tax on £10,000 as an inheritance derived from X.  B will be treated as getting the lands as residuary legatee.  He takes legacies which are refused by others.  But the £10,000 given to A will be deducted in arriving at the taxable value of what he receives.  Were it not for the amendment, A could say that in order to get £10,000 he had to give up £20,000&mdash; that is, he had to give up full consideration in money or money's worth. The subsection is designed to identify the real benefit taken by each legatee and tax each accordingly.</P>

Where there is a disclaimer the person who disclaims will not be taxed on a gift he has not taken.  It also provides that if, as a result of his disclaimer, another person receives property from the donor, one must look at the property passing to the person who benefits by disclaimer.

I should like to ask the Minister has he provided intentionally for any difference in the market value of property in this Bill as against section 8 of the Wealth Tax Act.

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> With regard to the valuation of property, families will be inheriting properties from their parents. There are family businesses in Dublin today which will never change hands. How will the Revenue Commissioners ascertain the value of such property? Sites are valued at a very high rate far in excess of what they are worth to the businessman.  There are family properties which will probably never pass out of the hands of the family. What criteria will the Revenue Commissioners use to value property held in the family?  Will it be valued on the business accounts or on the returns certified to the Revenue Commissioners or will they consider what it would make on the open market?  If it is to be valued on the open market the type of family I am talking about will be victimised.  Will the Revenue Commissioners use the business accounts to value property such as that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not, in fact, changing the rules for the valuation of property.  I am familiar with the difficulties which can arise and the arguments which can take place about valuations of property.  Obviously, the fairest rule is to apply the open market value.  That is determined by what a willing purchaser would pay a willing seller.  Obviously, there are situations where there is not an intention to dispose of the property, or there are people who have certain rights to property who would be opposed to a sale by a co-owner.  In order to ensure that a fair valuation is made, one must consider that the parties are free to dispose of the property and that the best possible price will be paid.  That is <Col N="130" /> the old rule and it is the only fair rule which can apply.</P>
      <P>Criticism has been offered from time to time that all these Bills fail to spell out specific rules in relation to the valuation of property.  I am satisfied that legislative rules would probably cause as many injustices as they might help to cure and would generate innumerable anomalies.  It is better to leave it to the ordinary forces of the market place to determine where value is and to allow, as we do allow, a right of appeal by any person who is dissatisfied with a valuation attached to a property by the Revenue Commissioners. This ensures that a third party is brought in to arbitrate.</P>

      <P>I might make the point that in Henry Street there is only one licensed premises now whereas there were about six there in the thirties.  This is because no licensee could afford to pay the amount of money per square foot which, say, a draper could pay.  There is the further point that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce should impose price control the position would be that the owner of a licensed premises would not be able to charge enough to render his business viable compared with other types of businesses on the same street. Why, then, should businesses be assessed on site value rather than on trading value?  By way of explanation let us take a draper, for instance.  He may sell a pair of shoes to a customer at a profit of £5 and after the customer has spent only a few minutes on the premises whereas the publican would be selling pints for a long time in order to make £5 profit on the one man although that man would be taking up space and spending a considerable time on the premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>The Deputy is asking me to pass comments on habits of consumption as well as on property <Col N="131" /> valuation.  That is beyond my scope and is not provided for in the Bill.  The general rules of valuation of property would apply in the cases cited by the Deputy.  These would be no different, so far as the Revenue Commissioners were concerned, than the rules which would apply in the ordinary market place between people interested in disposing of or acquiring property.  If the Deputy's argument were a cause for an objection to any valuation, the matter could go forward to an arbitrator for a decision as to what would be a fair valuation.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, in respect of valuation relating to the interest disposed of&mdash;this might well be a public-house on a certain site and the valuation might tend to relate to that factor rather than to some potential the premises might have in the future if disposed of for another purpose&mdash;the question of whether the potential value would have a greater relevance than current use would be one to be determined on the merits of each case and is not something that one should set out in legislative rules.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Practically everybody now-a-days&mdash;farmers, business people and all the others&mdash;submit accounts.  In these circumstances should the Revenue Commissioners not change their practice and ascertain what each business is worth, because that is all that is meant by the value of a property? If, say, an elderly farmer has 200 acres of land but by reason of his age is not able to <Col N="132" /> work it to any great extent and if he has three sisters, the position in the event of his death would be that these three women would be granted an exemption between them of only £30,000 whereas the land might fetch £300,000 if it were put on the market.  The £300,000 is arrived at because of the return being got from the land at present. We all know that a business can make 25 per cent more than it is worth on the market place.  In such circumstances how can the valuation office decide on the market value? The real criteria for valuation, especially in terms of capital acquisitions tax, should be based on business accounts.  If the accounts are available to the Revenue Commissioners they can be aware of the net profit of the business.  The valuation of the property will be approximately ten times the net profit.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> On that basis the Revenue Commissioners will have to take accounts into consideration with regard to valuation.  There is no point in harping on the practice that obtained up to now because we are changing laws all the time.  If the present practice of taking the market value into consideration is to be continued, certain sections of the community will be victimised because some properties would fetch much less on the market than the valuation put on them by the commissioners. There are a lot of properties which considered on face value would not appear to be worth very much but in respect of which the accounts might amaze one.  Many of the properties that will be concerned will be the old-established businesses which remain in the hands of successive gen-erations and do not come on the market.  A family owning a business in O'Connell Street, for instance, would not be likely to sell regardless of how much they were offered. People are like that where property is concerned.  That is why I say that valuation on the basis of site value can lead to injustices.

There one could challenge any action of the commissioners under subsection (1), but unless you have such a clear-cut norm, the effect of subsection (3) is to give a very wide discretion indeed to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>It is rather difficult if you are to give effect to taxing property other than that whose market value is clearly ascertainable, one might almost say mathematically ascertainable, how you can attach tax at all without giving this discretion and I for one have always argued on the history of the Revenue Commissioners that that discretion is warranted and desirable, but we are confronted here with certain difficulties that must cause anxiety to a number of Deputies.</P>
      <P>The first is inflation.  Inflation in itself makes it difficult for the commissioners to value, and they must try to get rules.  The problem might be simpler if you could apply fixed inflationary rates.  This could apply to taxation of private companies under the next section, but it could also arise in cases of private trading proprietors, such as Deputies Belton and Fitzpatrick spoke about.  Here you could have a notional inflation of what one might call real property and a deflation of value arising out of costs. As both Deputies pointed out, it will be extremely difficult to arrive at an equitable basis for valuation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take licensed premises.  The sale of such premises will depend on its business, its location, its site value, on its licence.  It is one of the things about which there is a considerable amount of uncertainty: if it is not up for sale, on which basis will it be valued for succession within the family?  We are throwing the Revenue Commissioners back completely on their discretion and tying them to the notional market value.  Attractive and <Col N="135" /> all as it is, this notion of market values in such cases might become a shackle when it comes to cases outside ascertainable market value which should be clearly put into subsection (1). I am wondering whether it is not shackling the Revenue Commissioners to be talking about market value.</P>
    <P>We have not put in an amendment here&mdash;a simple amendment would need a lot of thought&mdash;on the matter of whether the deletion of the word &ldquo;market&rdquo; in subsection (3) might not be considered.  We are here giving discretion to the Revenue Commissioners but how will they ascertain the market value in the cases Deputies Belton and Fitzpatrick mentioned?  If they are constrained to ascertain the notional market value, what notions can they have? It will vary from case to case.</P>
    <P>I throw this out as a desperate remedy and I am open to the charge that we might as well reduce the Bill to one section and say that wherever there is a gift or a death the Revenue Commissioners may tax it as they think fit at such and such rates, and trust to their good judgment to ascertain the valuation.  I know this is the implication of what I am saying.  But on the one hand we are between the devil and the deep blue sea and on the other tying the Revenue Commissioners to a situation where they can beneficently exercise their discretion on the notional market value.  This problem must certainly have arisen under the death duty code.  I do not know what the solutions there were, but in the past one did not have the present shifting inflationary situation and furthermore, and I regret to say it, I feel this legislation with this new code may make the problem of the uniform if not the equitable administration of the code very difficult for the Revenue Commissioners and their officers because of the administrative complexities that are involved.  Admittedly the computer will help.  Because of these things it would be helpful to have some information regarding the norms that would operate in such cases.</P>

      <P>Having regard to inflation, I regard market value as completely unrealistic particularly for property that remains in the family.  I know something about this matter as it affects farming and death duties and there have been many instances in my experience of the totally unrealistic value put on farms because of inflation.  In many instances the people concerned were most surprised when they discovered the value put on their holdings and I should not like to see that practice followed in this measure.  It may be all right in the case of a property which is put on the market but it is not right in the case of a property or farm that stays in the family.  We are giving the Revenue Commissioners very little leeway if we tie them to market value.  I have not the answer to the problem.  Deputy de Valera spoke about leaving it to the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners to value the property but I do not know if that is fair.  People can be very badly hit when market value is applied to their holdings.  It applied with regard to death duties but I should not like to see it in this Bill.</P>

      <P>It depends on whether a person is buying or selling What is relevant is the value of the property on the date it is received and that can be determined fairly easily.  It is probably true to say that there is nobody with a better access to property values than the Revenue Commissioners.  They know the value of any property transferred by deed in any event and of other properties also.  They may have a little more information in the future than they had in the past about some properties because many transactions will come under notice in future that were not known previously.  However, they do not use that information unfairly, nor may they do so.  It is well stated in law that the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners may not be an arbitrary one but must be based on the principle of a reasonable price in a hypothetical free and open market where a willing seller and purchaser are involved.</P>

      <P>The value is based on the assumption that the parties are free to dispose of and to acquire an interest.  That is the only fair way because if it were otherwise all kinds of controlled situations could be arranged, either to inflate or to deflate the value, depending on what suited the people involved.</P>
      <P>Section 51, Part VIII, of the Bill, provides for appeal procedures where anyone who is dissatisfied with the assessment of the Revenue Commissioners may challenge it.  In practice &mdash;I speak here with some humble experience as a practising lawyer in this field&mdash;if a person is dissatisfied with the valuation of the Revenue Commissioners he can negotiate with them, usually with the assistance of a valuer, an accountant or a lawyer.  My experience is that in the vast majority of cases&mdash;well over 95 per cent of cases &mdash;a value acceptable to all parties is agreed.  It is only a tiny fraction of cases that go to arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="138" /> In the appeals procedure, which is 65 years old, only one or two cases went to court and this is a fair indication that the real situation is not as depicted by Deputies.  I accept the <i>bona fides</i> of their comments, and I can understand their worries and the sense of caution and perhaps fear that people may have that the Revenue Commissioners may be unfair in their assessments.  However, from my own practical experience I am satisfied the Revenue Commissioners are open to persuasion.  If assessments are made that are out of line with what is fair value of the property, the Revenue Commissioners will listen to reasonable arguments asking for a reduction in the assessment and in most cases a satisfactory figure is negotiated.  As there is ample machinery available when dissatisfaction still exists on the part of the taxpayer, I consider we have provided for every possible eventuality and I am confident that the fears expressed will not be justified. If I were to find that difficulties arise and that we had a large number of appeals I would be the first to move that some steps be taken to rectify a situation.  However, in the 65 years experience of valuing properties that has not been the experience and I do not think we have any reason to anticipate that it will be the experience in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept completely what the Minister has said about the Revenue Commissioners. There was no suggestion otherwise. My only point on that was that I wanted to make sure that they were not constrained.  Unlike the common picture of them, the Revenue Commissioners have a legal conscience and, although they have discretion and exercise it admirably as the Minister said, they also have the conscience not to depart from the law.  If the law gives them a direction they will be bound by it.  In the past it has not been unknown for an inspector to be sympathetic and willing to do what he could but who found himself coming up against the statute.  We must not forget that the inspector is the officer who has the responsibility of administering the statute.  It is because of that <Col N="139" /> consideration, in addition to the difficulties of fluctuation, that I made the point and why I was willing to give the Revenue Commissioners greater discretion.</P>
      <P>I suppose when I refer to the Revenue Commissioners I am really talking about their inspectors who have to do the work and make decisions in the ordinary cases.  I accept completely what the Minister has said about the benign and sympathetic approach of the commissioners&mdash;I endorse this fully from any experience I have had with them, professionally or otherwise &mdash;but it must be emphasised that they are officers of the State.  They have the responsibility of carrying out legislation, they have a legal conscience and they are constrained by this.  That should be recognised here.  We should not be deluded by the fact that we are giving certain discretion when we prescribe.</P>
      <P>When we do prescribe we cannot salve our consciences too easily by saying: &ldquo;We do not really mean what we are saying&rdquo;.  If we take that approach and say: &ldquo;We will say this in the Bill and leave the Revenue Commissioners to wriggle a way out of it&rdquo; we are imposing a complete contradiction on them.  It is bad enough to have other people about whom the Minister has complained finding a wriggly way out without asking the Revenue Commissioners to do so voluntarily.  This is why I made the point that Deputy Callanan seized on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the inflationary situation, since we are discussing a taxation measure, it is no harm to see what the implications are of what we are doing.  There is, I am sorry to say, a diminishing class but a very worthy class of people in our society commonly called the family businesses. The father has built up a business and the sons have been brought up to be interested and they have continued it on and the family in succession have made a job of this.  It must not be forgotten that the success of that business has depended on the industry and the total absence of&mdash;shall I say?&mdash; restrictive practices on the part of the family concerned.  In such a case the actual value of the real assets of the <Col N="140" /> terms of its clientele, its value as business, the goodwill as assessed in shown in its books are all insufficient measures of valuation.  Inflation will inflate the value of the assets, so much so that generally the Minister in his budget has recognised that it would stop relief.  It is exactly the same type of problem.</P>
    <P>As regards turnover, this is not something that stands on its own; you cannot in this case separate it from the people who are producing the turnover.  When you have an employed labour force and management in another type of business you have a certain norm and you apply it to the accounts of that company and judge the value of the business as shown by the accounts.  In the case of a family business&mdash;and indeed this will probably apply to some of the private companies we have been considering&mdash;you cannot separate in your assessment of the accounts the industry and contribution of the interested people who are carrying on the business. A father and two sons running a business of this kind may not only be equivalent to a greater number of hired help but their whole psychological approach is such that the value of the business cannot be judged on their accounts.  The same applies to the goodwill of that business in a particular area.  It is simple enough to see this in the case of the dwindling population of small shops.  But there is another type of business which has grown and it is the family business operating as a unit of a larger chain. This has happened in regard to what one might call small supermarkets where the supermarket technique and its overall advantages are applied on a family basis.  This is not unknown and may be on the increase.  I have a licensed premises in mind where the personal activity of the proprietor made all the difference.  It made such a difference that in the case of his personal temporary illness it was very evident.</P>
    <P>This type of problem makes the concept of market value a very difficult one for the Revenue Commissioners and yet under this section they are completely tied to that concept. Without delaying the House I think <Col N="141" /> the point is worthy of consideration particularly because there will be a bigger organisation here to deal with it over a wider area of activity, when you take the three Acts together.  I regret that my remarks must be in the nature of comment and criticism rather than helping the Minister with constructive suggestions but I think we should appreciate what we are doing and if possible stimulate the Minister and his advisers to cope with the problem and, if remedies can be found, to come up with them.</P>
    <P>Within the past 24 hours I came across the case of a business in a nebulous category where there is a very substantial volume of business being done and where for certain reasons it is foreseen that it will not be viable because of current economic conditions in the following year.  The proprietors of this business are anxious to unload.  But the unloading on prospective takers is just &ldquo;not on&rdquo; for other reasons.  In all the conventional approaches to this problem of market value that business would be assessed at a considerable value from the points of view of the lives and succession of two individuals.  On the other hand, to my certain knowledge, as I have been told the case, if the business were put on the market it would have no value; there would be no takers and it would fold up. Here is a case&mdash;I am now going away from the reality and giving a hypothetical case; what do you do in a case like this where A has a business which seems to be all right at present but actually has very little in prospect and would find no takers on a market value basis as the Revenue Commissioners could find out if they went into the facts.  At the same time a substantial amount of business is being done; there is considerable present value of turnover and there are assets. What do you do if that proprietor dies just now?  What is the market value of that business?  Does it have to be put up for sale to ascertain the market value, or can the Revenue Commissioners say it has no market value?  The Minister rightly said that this was not a new problem.  What is new, and here we get at the kernel of the whole matter, is that our concept <Col N="142" /> of money values from the point of view of transmission in time is collapsing around us.  The concept of money as a store of value which is implicit in this legislation is breaking down and in that situation there is something to worry about in the assessment of values.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduced the Bill the thresholds and limits were generous and Deputy Colley went so far as to say they were too generous in comparison with certain other things. That situation is daily being eroded and I believe the time will come when the exemptions the Minister is giving will be considered inadequate in the categories the Minister is anxious to benefit and believes he is benefiting.  It is considerations such as these that make me urge the Minister to consider the word &ldquo;market&rdquo; in line 10 in getting the Revenue Commissioners to evaluate the value of the property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One might generate more mischiefs than benefits by changing it and I would be somewhat worried about the introduction of artificial values of any kind which could generate more difficulty.  As has been recognised, we are not dealing with a new problem; perhaps we are dealing with an old problem but the pace of change is more rapid to make valuations more difficult to make.  I would accept that that could be true.  Looking back on my own experience, I would not like to say compromises were made in which the Revenue Commissioners lost out, but I found that my clientele were, by and large, satisfied with the compromises made.  If they were not, they, and others, would have appealed.  In my own experience I cannot recall any case where there was an appeal to arbitration.  Perhaps it was because would-be appellants feared they might do worse on an arbitration than on a settlement and that happens in all cases where the question of arbitration arises.  The Revenue Commissioners will, no doubt, observe what has been said and, through the appeal procedures which are there, we need not anticipate that too many difficulties will arise.</P>

      <P>The rules determining market value do not relate purely and exclusively to what would happen at an auction because one does not know what will happen there.  People assess properties according to different criteria; each person has his own set of criteria.  Some people will look at the goodwill or the existing profit record of a business but others would have no interest whatsoever in that record because they might intend using the property for a different purpose. One could deal with a whole variety of criteria.  The rules determining market value are a mixture and amalgam of all these.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unusual, as the Deputy knows, for a control company not to declare a dividend and yet the ownership of the shares could be within the control of a particular person.  Such control might or might not involve voting rights.  Normally it would involve voting rights but one could have the class of shares where voting rights would not exist but nonetheless they would be eligible for dividends or interest if declared. It is in order to ensure that one cannot get out of the category of control by not declaring a dividend that we put in the words &ldquo;dividend, whether declared or not&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Company accounts are in a certain form.  A person could be in receipt of, and entitled to receive, dividends and not be in control. At best, from the Minister's point of view, you could have a contradiction in this section because there are alternatives.  Under this section you could find two people in control.  For instance, suppose somebody was actually in voting and executive control of a company, say a father, who made himself a trustee as to more than half the proceeds of the company&mdash;I am using the word &ldquo;proceeds&rdquo; to cover dividends declared or not&mdash;and assuming that person was <i>sui juris,</i> is it not a case of a bare trust because the father is only trustee for an income and he is in control?

      <P>The mere fact that two people are in control would not mean double the rate of taxation. Control is only one of the elements in the valuation of a share.

      <P>Where joint control was equivalent to individual control I can see the validity of the Deputy's point, but it is very difficult to be specific about the way in which the value of a particular shareholding could be made.  Control is one of the elements to be valued and that value will vary according to the degree of control exercised in an individual situation. Where a company has more than five controllers it would fall to be valued in accordance with section 15, but where the number is five or under it is treated under section 16.</P>

      <P>This amendment is necessary to establish a consistent method of dealing between section 20, which refers to an interest defeasible by the happening of a contingency, and section 18, (5) (a), which refers to a liability which becomes payable on the happening of a contingency.  On this amendment being made, the position in both cases will be that in the first instance tax will be paid without allowance for the possibility of the contingency happening, and if the contingency does happen the tax will be reassessed on the basis that the donee took the amount for a period certain&mdash;Table B, First Schedule refers&mdash;and any excess tax that was paid will be refunded with interest from the date of payment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are introducing it in order to ensure consistency between the <i>modus operandi</i> of the two sections, 18 and 20.  As I say, if there has been an excess tax we shall be making a refund and the refund will be paid with interest.  Maybe I could give an illustration that might be of assistance.  A business worth £50,000 is given by will to the disponer's grandson B, subject to his paying £5,000 to his brother C.  If and when C, who is 12 years of age, is aged 21&mdash;that would be of course in nine years time unless C dies before he attains the age of 21&mdash; B is taxed on the basis of a taxable value of £50,000 without the allowance of the £5,000.  Until he has to pay the £5,000, B enjoys the whole <Col N="150" /> business.  He may never have to pay the £5,000.  If and when C attains 21, B will be allowed relief on the £5,000 which he will then have to pay to C as follows: tax will be assessed on the £50,000 less £5,000, that is, on £45,000, but B will also be treated on the same lines as in section 20 as having enjoyed £5,000 for the nine years up to the payment date, and under Table B, First Schedule, £5,000 for nine years certain equals £2,278.</P>
      <P>The new adjusted taxable value will be £45,000 plus £2,278, that is, £47,278 instead of £50,000, and tax will be refunded with interest from the date of payment on the excess payment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (5) (d), line 38, after &ldquo;inheritance&rdquo; to insert &ldquo; , or of the costs, expenses or interest incurred in raising or paying the same&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The costs and expenses of raising and paying the tax after it has been ascertained and assessed are excluded from the costs and expenses allowable as a deduction in arriving at the taxable value.  The method used by the donee or successor to raise the money required will vary from case to case. One may have ready cash; another may have to sell part of the property taken as a gift or an inheritance; another may raise a mortgage on the property and so on.  Some of these methods can involve the donee in costs and expenses, but such costs and expenses arise out of the method of raising the money which is chosen by him.  This amendment is essential so that finality can be reached in respect of assessment.  If, after £X have been assessed to tax on the taxable value of £Y, the donee were allowed to send back the assessment to reduce the taxable value and the tax assessed by the costs and expenses incurred after the assessment was made&mdash;claiming that <Col N="151" /> such costs and expenses would be a deduction under subsection (1) of section 18&mdash;no assessment could ever be stated to be definitive until the tax was actually paid.  The amendment in no way precludes allowance in subsection (1)  for valuation fees, solicitors' costs and so on incurred in ascertaining the taxable value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined to ask the Minister whether he was not being a little sweeping in this. Paragraph (d) of subsection (5) says that no deduction shall be made in respect of tax, interest or penalties chargeable under the Act in respect of the gift or inheritance.  That is fair enough.  One does not deduct tax and then tax what is left after that deduction. One could go on with that premise until there was nothing to pay, which would be very unreasonable. On the other hand, is it not a bit sweeping of the Minister to say that because there are so many ways of waving the wand to avoid paying the taxman one simply excludes all? For instance, there might be a situation like this: there may be an assessment for tax due&mdash;and remember that nowadays there is the factor of interest where tax due is concerned&mdash; and it may be necessary to sell part of the property to minimise one's own losses.  If I am on the wrong track please stop me.  I do not want to waste the time of the House or of the Minister. One goes to the bank, gets a loan and pays the tax.  One can make that quite definite.  It can be made definite either for a reasonable period or until the property is sold.</P>
      <P>I take the point the Minister made about finality.  On the other hand, some relief could be given here; it could be confined to certain ways. But it is going a little too far to add the tax to the taxation the State is enforcing, or to enforce taxation for the benefit of the bank.  Does the Minister get the point I am endeavouring to make?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point completely about finality. I also recognise the intent in paragraph <Col N="152" /> (d) as it stands.  Therefore, what I am seeking is a compromise. Could the Minister not settle for something less omnibus than he has in this amendment?  I agree there are so many ways one could not legislate for them all but one could recognise one or two common ways.  One might even solve the problem by remitting interest for the period concerned. But surely there could be some little way found here to establish equity.  Does the Minister see the point I am making?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Either one selects something like raising the actual cash by a recognised lending procedure for a definite rate of interest for a period specified&mdash;that is definite&mdash;or one takes the alternative, which is to hold in abeyance the interest payable on the tax, which would defer the payment of the tax.  Possibly there is a middle road here the Minister might consider because it is a little wrong to have to pay the tax and then to have an enforced tax on one's temporary lack of liquidity.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, as a matter of practice, under the estate duty code, one got no allowance for the cost of raising the money to pay the tax.  Therefore, in this amendment we are simply providing that no allowance be given for the cost of getting the money to pay capital acquisitions tax.  Nor do I think it right that we should grant such an allowance.  For instance, the person who may have cash immediately available and who uses it to pay tax would be deemed to be at a loss by so doing.  The point I want to make is this: one cannot assume that that person is not at a loss by using cash available to him for the payment of tax because that cash could probably be invested and that loss suffered by him might be comparable to the cost that somebody else might have to meet.  One could have a whole range of property holdings under which a person might decide to leave assets which were easily <Col N="153" /> cashable in their existing form and take out a loan, because of the natural inclination which exists to pay the money to anybody except the tax man.  I know that Deputy de Valera does not disagree with a lot of what I am saying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice I cannot see how one could have&mdash;as he calls it&mdash;a middle road which would not entail many difficulties and anomalies. Obviously, if the tax is payable, then that is the appropriate tax to be paid. Were we to entertain the idea of allowing people to set off the cost of paying tax against the tax liability, it would apply not merely to capital taxation but to income tax as well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect I reject what the Minister says, that this would apply to income tax.  Income tax is a totally different thing.  We are dealing with assets.  The case I am making is on legal assets, like real property&mdash;particularly real property where there was a difficulty about title&mdash;where there would be some time lag in converting that into cash and where the only remedy was to go to the bank or some other lending agency and raise the money at the cost of interest.  In a case as definite as that a solution on the lines I suggested might be found.  The amount raised is certain, the rate of interest is certain and so is the period for which it is raised.  In the past, where such situations arose interest was not chargeable.  Interest on tax is a relatively recent concept.  I think I am right in that.  I do not know what it was under the estate duty code.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  In those circumstances I am suggesting to the Minister that he look at this amendment. That is totally different from saying: I have cash in hand; I did not pay it over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I have cash in hand, I am foregoing a benefit.  Admittedly, I am using income, but I am buying the asset and the income, so to speak, goes with the cash.  In this sense I <Col N="154" /> have to raise cash and pay money for it.  There is a very essential distinction there for which the Minister, I think, failed to give me credit.</P>
    <P>With regard then to the administrative difficulties, with the inland revenue affidavits, as they will be&mdash; goodness gracious, the present ones, and I have four in my hand, are searching enough &mdash;there should be no difficulty. As I conceive the administration of this Bill and the information that will come in to the Revenue Commissioners, as the Minister himself said on an earlier section, there should be no difficulty in prescribing a limited course which would obviate the necessity in such clearcut cases for what I might call &ldquo;double taxation&rdquo;&mdash;taxation by the State and taxation by the land agency&mdash;because that is what it would amount to.  The person concerned would be doubly taxed. This might not be important between fathers and sons but when you come along to Table III, brothers and sisters, and to strangers under Table IV, the incidence of tax might be quite substantial.  It is only in the case of spouses and children as a matter of fact that the reliefs are really substantial under present conditions.  If that is so I think some limited, specific, middle course could still be found to answer this problem and the combination of the Revenue Commissioners' knowledge, the returns they will get under this legislation, their experience in the past, the possibility of being certain, all these add up substantially to support the plea I am making to the Minister to give this a second thought on the basis I suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not always easy to arrange loans with all the certainties the Deputy suggests because one could easily visualise a term loan providing for fixed interest over a fixed period which could nonetheless be repaid the day after it had been obtained for the purpose of paying tax and it seems to me that it would be wrong to give preferential treatment to the person who is able to arrange a fixed period loan to avoid liability to tax and treat him more favourably than someone who was not able to get <Col N="155" /> terms as explicit and certain as that. The difficulties are multitudinous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. Could the Revenue Commissioners, now they have gone into this business of usury and charging interest themselves, not expand that area of their business and give some discounts, so to speak?  After all, they are expanding now into, as I say, usury and charging interest.  I should not say &ldquo;the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;&mdash;the state.  Why not have the State do it through the agency of the Revenue Commissioners?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that but, on the other hand, there is a certain equity here where a certain compensation could be afforded since they are collecting interest.  I would not make this point if the Revenue Commissioners were not charging interest after a certain date on tax that is owing.  I apologise for saying &ldquo;the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo; because they are simply an agency.  It is the Minister and ourselves who are to blame and not the Revenue Commissioners. The point is, if we are charging interest and thereby forcing people to incur further costs&mdash;I repeat deliberately that we are imposing a double tax, the tax to the State and then the tax paid to the money lending agency &mdash;in those circumstances some solution should be found to balance this. The Minister and I could argue all night on this.

    <P>This subsection is being recast so as to take into account three amendments. It is for clarity purposes.  The whole of the former subsection is being replaced.  The amendments to be made are: (1) costs and expenses, mentioned in line nine, as well as liability; secondly, similar mention of <Col N="157" /> costs and expenses is made in line 12; thirdly, lines 13 and 14 are amended by changing (b) or (c) to small Roman ii and iii to correct the reference to section 19 (2) which has been redrafted. This is purely an amendment consequential on the new format of section 19 which is also introduced as an amendment at the Committee Stage.  The only significant change is the mention of costs and expenses.  It was originally considered the word &ldquo;liabilities&rdquo; would be interpreted as including costs and expenses.  However, as the expression &ldquo;liabilities, costs and expenses&rdquo; is used in the section on a number of occasions, it is a possibility the court might interpret it in a narrow sense as not including costs and expenses thus enabling a donee to claim more than once against separate gifts for the same costs and expenses.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to delete subsection (10) and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  <i>bona fide</i> consideration in money or money's worth has been paid by a person for the granting to him, by a disposition, of an interest in expectancy in property; and</P>
      <P>(b)  at the coming into possession of the interest in expectancy, that person takes a gift or an inheritance of that property under that disposition,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the deduction to be made under subsection (2) or (4) (b) for consideration paid by that person shall be a sum equal to the same <Col N="158" /> proportion of the taxable value of the taxable gift or taxable inheritance (as if no deduction had been made for such consideration) as the amount of the consideration so paid bore to the market value of the interest in expectancy at the date of the payment of the consideration.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment which widens the area of application afforded in subsection (10) as initiated. The subsection provides for a deduction of partial consideration where a successor has given some consideration for the granting to him of a future interest.  Briefly, he will be treated as having paid for the same proportion of the property which he eventually inherits as the proportion that the price he paid bore to the actuarial value of the future interest when he paid the partial consideration. No actuarial tables are provided in the Bill for valuing such a future interest.  Normal actuarial principles, age and health of the life tenant, the nature and income of the property, and so on, will apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It will also catch the type of case I spoke about earlier in another connection.  Supposing a person acquired a property from a donee before death in such a way that it only vested on death for a consideration which might have been valid at the time and then inflation affects it, it will work for the State as well.  In other words, if value is given for the gift before the death of the testator, this brings in an interesting distinction between gift tax and succession. It is tied to being an inheritance tax.  I do not want to repeat the hypothetical cicrumstances under which A and B could be linked. Under the section the point now is that, if an arrangement were made between two people by which an inheritance was paid for at current prices, if the donor died no tax would be paid but, if inflation continues, the donor's gift will be valued at the date of death and there will be tax on the difference accruing to the Revenue.  Will that not be one of the effects of it?  There is another side to the relief.</P>

Every time the Minister gets up expansively in his capacity as tax master and says he is giving a relief or a concession, I am reminded of the old saying: &ldquo;Fear the Greeks when they bring gifts&rdquo;, because there always seems to be another side to the Minister's gifts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 18 before section 19 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;19.  &mdash;(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;agricultural property&rsquo; means agricultural land, pasture and woodland situate in the State and crops, trees and underwood growing on such land and also includes such farm buildings, farm houses and mansion houses (together with the lands occupied therewith) as are of a character appropriate to the property;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;agricultural value&rsquo; means the market value of agricultural property reduced by 50 per cent of that value, or by a sum of £100,000, whichever is the lesser;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;farmer&rsquo;, in relation to a donee or successor, means an individual who is domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State and in respect of whom not less than 75 per cent of the market value of the property to which he is beneficially entitled in possession is represented by the market value of property in the <Col N="160" /> State which consists of agricultural property, livestock, bloodstock and farm machinery, and, for the purposes of this definition, no deduction shall be made from the market value of property for any debts or incumbrances.</P>
    <P>(2)  In so far as any gift or inheritance consists of agricultural property&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  at the date of the gift or at the date of the inheritance; and</P>
    <P>(b)  at the valuation date,</P>
    <P>and is taken by a donee or successor who is, on the valuation date and after taking the gift or inheritance, a farmer, the provisions of section 18 (other than subsection 7 (b) thereof) shall apply in relation to agricultural property as they apply in relation to other property subject to the following modifications&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  in subsection (1) of that section, the reference to market value shall be construed as a reference to agricultural value;</P>
    <P>(ii)  where a deduction is to be made for any liability, costs or expenses, in accordance with subsection (1) of that section, only a proportion of such liability, costs or expenses shall be deducted and that proportion shall be the proportion that the agricultural value of the agricultural property bears to the market value of that property; and</P>
    <P>(iii)  where a deduction is to be made for any consideration under subsection (2) or (4) (b) of that section, only a proportion of such consideration shall be deducted and that proportion shall be the proportion that the agricultural value of the agricultural property bears to the market value of that property.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a taxable gift or a taxable inheritance is taken by a donee or successor subject to the condition that the whole or part thereof will be invested in agricultural property and such condition is complied with <Col N="161" /> within two years after the date of the gift or the date of the inheritance, then the gift or inheritance shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, to have consisted&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  at the date of the gift or at the date of the inheritance; and</P>
    <P>(b)  at the valuation date.</P>
    <P>of agricultural property to the extent to which the gift or inheritance is subject to such condition and has been so invested.</P>
    <P>(4)  In relation to the deduction, in respect of agricultural property of 50 per cent of its market value, or £100,000, whichever is the lesser, the total amount deductible in ascertaining the agricultural value shall not exceed £100,000, in respect of the aggregate of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  all taxable gifts taken on or after the 28th day of February, 1969; and</P>
    <P>(b)  all taxable inheritances taken on or after the 1st day of April, 1975.</P>
    <P>which consist in whole or in part of agricultural property, taken by the same person, as donee or successor, from the same disponer.</P>
    <P>(5)  (a) The agricultural value shall cease to be applicable to real property which is agricultural property if and to the extent that the property&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  is sold or compulsorily acquired within the period of six years after the date of the gift or the date of the inheritance; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  is not replaced, within a year of the sale or compulsory acquisition, by other agricultural property,</P>
    <P>and tax shall be chargeable in respect of the gift or inheritance as if the property were not agricultural property;</P>
    <P>Provided that this paragraph shall not have effect where the donee or successor dies before the property is sold or compulsorily acquired.</P>
    <P>(b)  If an arrangement is made, in the administration of property <Col N="162" /> subject to a disposition, for the appropriation of property in or towards the satisfaction of a benefit under the disposition, such arrangement shall be deemed not to be a sale or a compulsory acquisition for the purposes of paragraph (a).</P>
    <P>(6)  For the purposes of subsection (2), if, in the administration of property subject to a disposition, property is appropriated in or towards the satisfaction of a benefit in respect of which a person is deemed to take a gift or an inheritance under the disposition, the property so appropriated, if it was subject to the disposition at the date of the gift or at the date of the inheritance, shall be deemed to have been comprised in that gift or inheritance at the date of the gift or at the date of the inheritance.</P>
    <P>(7)  In this section, other than in subsection (4), any reference to a donee or successor shall include a reference to the transferee referred to in section 23 (1).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is deleting the existing section 19 and putting in a new one. The decision to simplify the test for a &ldquo;genuine farmer&rdquo; in both the Wealth Tax and Capital Acquisition Tax meant considerable rewriting of section 19.  It was on that account that we decided to put in a new draft.  The section now provides special rules for the valuation of agricultural property, as I mentioned earlier to Deputy Callanan, where the agricultural property is taken by a farmer as donee or successor by permitting the deduction of 50 per cent of its market value or £100,000, whichever is the lesser, from its market value in order to arrive at its agricultural value.  The section incorporates the provisions of section 18 into this section but with certain modifications.  &ldquo;Agricultural value&rdquo;, as defined in the section, is substituted for &ldquo;market value&rdquo; and a proportion only of the debts and liabilities, and of the consideration, is deductible, being the same proportion that the agricultural value bears to the market value of the agricultural property.</P>
    <P>The section also provides rules as to <Col N="163" /> where the agricultural value can, in certain other circumstances, be availed of and where, in certain cases, it will cease to apply.  A limit of £100,000 is set for the special agricultural deduction in respect of all gifts or inheritances taken by one donee or successor from the one disponer.  The purpose of the section is to afford a measure of relief&mdash;the Greeks once again&mdash;from tax to agricultural property where at least 75 per cent of the gross value of property in the beneficial ownership in possession of the donee or successor consists of such agricultural property and farm stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Why not define it for other properties?  The Minister specifically mentions agricultural value.  Some type of criteria could be found for other businesses.  If a formula could be found in this section, I do not see why one could not be found for other businesses in cities and towns.  A family business could be valued at a very high <Col N="164" /> rate for industrial development.  A drapery or a grocery business, for instance, might have a very low value in so far as profits were concerned but a very high market value in the context of commercial development.  The Minister does not appear to be able to find any formula for this type of valuation.</P>
      <P>The concession in regard to agriculture is welcome.  While I am not thoroughly conversant with activity in this sphere, I come from a part of the country in which agriculture is very important and I am aware that the return on investment in agriculture may be only two or three per cent. Return on capital is dictated by the amount of capital available.  I can see why the Minister is allowing the reduction in respect of agriculture but there is a case to be made for allowances in respect of other types of business, too. However, the brothers and sisters of deceased holders of land will find that they are being dealt with harshly in this Bill.  The Minister had no choice but to grant the concession in respect of agriculture because people in this industry are very dissatisfied with their lot. Their return on capital, compared with other forms of business is relatively low, perhaps 50 per cent lower than the return from other types of property.</P>

      <P>1.  The employer must be a person engaged in agriculture, including horticulture, whose income is wholly or mainly derived from that source.  2. New eligible employees, additional to the base level, must be recruited during the currency of the scheme, i.e. 3rd August, 1975 to 26th June, 1976, and retained in employment for a continuous period of 9 months.  3.  The eligible additions are measured by reference to the base level of the employer's work force on 25th July, 1975. 4.  An eligible employee must fulfil the following basic conditions : (a) be in receipt of unemployment benefit at any time after 20th June, 1974 and; (b) be continuously on the live register for not less than the four weeks immediately preceding first employment under the premium employment programme.  5. Employees at the base date and any additional employees must be paid at least the full time minimum rate for workers as prescribed by the Agricultural Wages Board throughout the currency of the scheme and must be persons who are insured at the rate applicable to agricultural workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since certain postal handling operations are not necessary in the case of franked mail, such mail obtains to that extent a measure of priority over stamped <Col N="50" /> mail.  However, the postal service is organised on the basis that, in general, all mail, whether franked or stamped, posted before the advertised latest times of posting, should be sorted in time to connect with out-going despatches.  Exceptionally, under the Post Office Acts 1908 to 1969, it is permissible to defer the handling of second class mail, whether franked or stamped, if this is necessary in order to avoid delay to first class mail.</P>
