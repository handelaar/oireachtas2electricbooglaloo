      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £200,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for a grant (grant-in-aid) to An Comhairle Ealaíon.</P>
      <P>The council have reached a stage which makes it necessary for us to pass this Vote in order that further issues can be made by the council and I understand there is agreement between the Whips to take this Vote now.  The provision of £200,000 represents an increase of 33? per cent in the level of last year's grant.  The report and accounts of the council for 1973-74 were presented to the House and the report for the last nine-month financial period will shortly be available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We were given to understand there was a certain urgency in the provision of these moneys and that is why we agreed to take this Estimate this morning.  I can only express my disappointment and dissatisfaction at the manner in which the Taoiseach has introduced the Estimate.  He has given us no particulars whatever and the Estimate is presented in the Book of Estimates without any elaboration other than an indication of the total grant-in-aid. Having regard to the ready co-operation we extended, I would have expected more information from the Taoiseach as to the disposal of the moneys and, because of the absence of such information I can only speak <i>in vacuo</i> since I have no knowledge of the policy of An Chomhairle Ealaíon at the present time and there is no indication of what the body proposes to do with this money.</P>
      <P>I know they have plenty of commitments and plenty of means of spending the money.  From my own experience, I know there are a thousand and one requests and demands from different organisations with a fairly substantial and justifiable claim for assistance, all of which cannot be met; indeed, only a fraction can be met.  For every one cause or organisation An Chomhairle Ealaíon can assist there are about 50 equally worthy causes they would like to assist but cannot because they have not got the necessary finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an increase in this Vote and that is welcome.  However, we all know that £200,000 today is far too little really for the council's purposes.  I was glad the Government honoured the commitment of the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government to subsidise the Irish Ballet Company and the Irish Theatre Company.  These are providing excellent entertainment of excellent standards. They are operating mainly in the provinces but they have come to Dublin on occasion.  They can truly be regarded as nationwide organisations, cultural undertakings giving good value for the amount of money given to them.  What we would like to see is some initiative on the part of the Government.  Honouring undertakings given by the previous Government is <Col N="947" /> one thing; the provision of adequate assistance in, to use an in expression, an on-going situation is another thing. Having assisted ballet and theatre, we must now ensure that all the visual arts and all the creative arts are equally assisted to the fullest extent possible.  I would, therefore, like to see the Government taking some initiative.  I should like to see action on the ground and there is quite a share of ground on which Government action could be expected.</P>
    <P>It is not, perhaps, completely relevant to this debate but it is noteworthy that a Government which would regard itself as having some aesthetic values would not see fit to assist in the purchase of what is a national treasure such as Fota Island is.  It is an artistic asset in its own right but, unfortunately, the Government have ignored completely the value of this asset to the nation.  I know the Minister for Finance, when this was brought before him during the debate on the appropriate Estimate, said it was a local matter because it was situated some 160 miles from Dublin.  That is not the right kind of thinking for a Government whose responsibility extends throughout the whole country.  As I said to the Minister at the time, if Fota Island were located within 20 miles of Dublin city, then I feel sure the attitude of the Government would have been different and they would have regarded it as a treasure worth preserving for the nation.</P>
    <P>I will come nearer home.  At the present time we have an area where action on the ground in the artistic field is possible even for the Government. I refer in particular to the Olympia Theatre which suffered serious structural damage by some inherent defect several months ago.  It is one of the last two fairly independently-run theatres we have in this city.  The Gaiety was saved, perhaps by the grace of God and a bit of foresight by the then Minister for Local Government, in indicating that the kind of development envisaged for it, when it came on the market, would not be permitted.</P>
    <P>The same applied to the Olympia Theatre when it, too came on the <Col N="948" /> market and when speculators&mdash;I do not use that in any derogatory sense &mdash;from London bought it and the area surrounding it, the then Minister for Local Government, in association with&mdash;to give them their due they helped the Minister&mdash;Dublin Corporation ensured that the Olympia Theatre would be preserved for its main purpose, the presentation of stage offerings in acting, song and otherwise.  Now we have the unfortunate situation that, because of the passage of time, the Olympia Theatre has suffered a severe structural defect and there is far too much dragging of feet.  There is a small band of men there, dedicated people, who came together, formed a company and took a limited lease of the Olympia Theatre.  Unfortunately, they do not know where they stand now, whether they will get any assistance from the Government to ensure that this theatre will be preserved not only for the people of Dublin but for the people of the country as well.  This is a national asset as well as any of those well-known theatres throughout the country and it ought to be preserved.</P>
    <P>This also is an indication of where action is possible for the Government if they have the will to undertake it.  I have always held that if there is political will in almost any sphere then it is possible.  Civil servants, whether they be working at national or local level, will carry out the will of those who have the power of political direction, which comes mainly from the top.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to ensure that where there are assets to be preserved, like the Olympia Theatre and Fota Island, the direction comes from the top.  I feel in some cases Ministers who are indifferent about these matters and Ministers who are intellectually remote from these things, if left to themselves, will not apply the necessary will and the necessary dedication to doing the right thing.  The Taoiseach in these cases ought to direct his Ministers to ensure that proper assistance is given and that, above all, our national heritage will not be left waste.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" /> I was recently in Vienna on my way back from Srilanka.  I know most people recognise there are magnificent buildings, of all descriptions mainly left by the Hapsburg family, to the Austrian and Viennese people but the famous Opera House, the Stadt Opera, as it is called, was damaged over a decade.  It was almost completely destroyed.  Almost at once its restoration was undertaken.  Some years ago I was in Germany in my capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce when I was helping a particular area to attract certain industries to this country.  I went to the town of Essen which was almost annihilated during the war.  I discovered the first thing they restored was their Opera House.  That is the kind of mentality which persists in many of those Continental countries. Some semblance of it ought to spill over on us.  We should ensure that where we have something worth while preserving we have the political will, the necessary intellectual commitment&mdash;not lip service&mdash;and the aesthetic commitment to ensure these things are preserved.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay any longer except to say again I was disappointed that we got no indication whatever with regard to the direction this £200,000 was to be expended.  I know there are many areas where it could be expended and that there are many calls on it but there are very obviously cases, having regard to all the claims for priority, where some assistance could be given to ensure that things I have referred to are preserved and maintained for the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also disappointed that the introduction of the Estimate in this way precludes discussion on the activities of An Chomhairle Ealaíon. I hope an opportunity is made available to the House for such a discussion later on.  I do not know how this can be arranged procedurally but I invite the Taoiseach in his reply to give his views on it.  The amount of money, comparatively speaking, is not great but it is probably £ for £ a sum of money that should be watched most carefully by the House because of <Col N="950" /> expenditure on very important aspects of the life of the country.</P>
      <P>I should like to have had an opportunity to assess the activities of the New Theatre Company and its relationship to the Abbey Theatre, to find out how this money is being spent.  I should like to know how the new Comhairle is working.  I understand the chairman has accepted a position in the new educational institute in Firenze and I would like to know if the question of appointing a successor has been raised or considered by the Government. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach knows something about it because he knows the stable from which the best thorough-breds in that regard seem to come.</P>
      <P>I should like to know how the new specialised committees of the various arts, those which deal with sculpture, painting and so on, are working, if they are working.  In proper discussion on this Estimate we could tease out all these matters.  When the new legislation was going through the House a point was made in relation to artistic activity that provincial centres should be accorded their due place and that the people who are responsible for the expenditure of the moneys would not fix their gaze so steadfastly on the capital city in the future.  I should like to have an opportunity to discuss how all this could be related to new plans, for example, for adult education where, perhaps, the Arts centre in a provincial town and the adult education centre could be brought into unison to the mutual benefit of both; in fact, how an educational programme in the Arts could be sponsored and developed by the Adult Education Authority, when there would be illustrative material available at a local Arts centre.</P>
      <P>I should like also to know how far the Arts Council is committed to supporting, say, poets or prose writers in the Irish language.  We seem to be relying more and more on external support, particularly from the United States, for those who are attempting to develop a literature in the Irish language at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is a different Estimate that caters for the National Museum and the National Library.  But I think the <Col N="951" /> Arts Council, An Chomhairle Ealaíon, should have a monitor, somebody to watch for sales, for example, of important items&mdash;books and other important museum items.  I know that the fund available to the National Library and the National Museum for this is meagre enough.  I feel the Arts Council should have a special responsibility in this regard, particularly as some items are purchased&mdash;admittedly, it is good they are in this country&mdash;by the Belfast Museum.  But there is only one National Museum and that is in Dublin. There is only one National Library and that is in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I should like also to have an opportunity to see what An Chomhairle Ealaíon are doing with regard to a wonderful crop of young poets in the English language as well.  The pleasing aspect of this is that this generation of young poets is a nationwide generation. In other words, youthful poetic activity in the Six Counties part of the country and in the South is very promising.  I should like to have an opportunity of seeing what the Arts Council are doing in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition said we are indulging in a game of blind man's buff here because we have had no outline of the activities of An Chomhairle Ealaíon and, consequently, it is very difficult to have a discussion. Before concluding, I should like to suggest to the Taoiseach that he make time available for a general discussion on this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join the previous speaker in saying I regret we have not a better opportunity of commenting on this Estimate.  We are not a very wealthy nation but we do not give enough publicity, time or money to cultural things.  To my mind, the money available to An Chomhairle Ealaíon is far too small for the activities in which I should like to see them engage.  I should like to pay tribute to them for what they have done over the years with the money placed at their disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach if there is any possibility that An Chomhairle Ealaíon would take over from <Col N="952" /> Bord Fáilte the financial subvention of some of the international festivals we have here at present started under the aegis of Bord Fáilte more than 20 years ago, largely as tourist promotions and which have become now, in many instances, international cultural features which reflect a great deal of credit on the organisers and participants.  In Cork next week there will commence the Twenty-second International Choral Festival, attracting 73 choirs, 50 of them from outside the country and a dozen from behind the Iron Curtain.  The planning and organisation of such an event must commence more than a year or two before it takes place.  When the organisers are dependent on Bord Fáilte's budget to ascertain whether or not they can run it, it makes their position intolerable.  To my mind, this is one of the things which should come under the aegis of the Arts Council, who would be much more competent to assess the value of such things for the country in the cultural sense anyway.  I do not want to be parochial about them.  We have two in Cork.  There is also the Wexford Festival, the Waterford Festival and, perhaps, one or two others without which the country would be very much poorer.  I know we are confined to a few remarks this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed the Deputy is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House.  I should like to compliment An Chomhairle Ealaíon and particularly the Art Gallery on the way they are now distributing the nation's pictures outside the National Gallery in Dublin and giving centres such as Cork a fair show.  I should like to pay tribute to the Director of the National Gallery in that respect.  The Cork International Film Festival takes place in June for the 21st consecutive time. They are very handicapped by not having direct intervention in some form from the Arts Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Wilson, I should greatly appreciate if the Taoiseach could see his way to direct the business of the House so that we could say a little more and be furnished with more information about the activities of the <Col N="953" /> Arts Council.  Naturally, I was very interested in the formation of the second Irish theatre.  I wish it success. It was opened in Cork and the play they performed was very well chosen and acted.  The work they are doing and the aims they have in view are excellent.  As Deputy Lynch pointed out, now that we are in Europe, we can appreciate the value Europeans place on cultural matters.  We must also feel far behind in the international sphere, when one observes the pains to which they have gone and the expenditure they have undertaken to restore old buildings, their opera houses the theatres, in line with housing their people.  Unfortunately, we have not got that tradition but that is one of the beneficial effects of our entry into Europe.  I hope we will make such progress and I should like to see much more money being made available to An Chomhairle Ealaíon than is made available to them at present and see them engaging in more of this type of activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Taoiseach replies&mdash;now that the Minister for Defence is at his side&mdash;perhaps I could put one question to him.  It has been the practice in the past, since Deputy Healy has referred to the Cork International Choral Festival, that the Army No. 2 Band assisted in that festival. They have given buglers and made available some of their band personnel to the Cork Symphony Orchestra.  I believe some difficulty arose about the availability of the Army No. 2 Band this year during the week of the choral festival.  It was understood that their services were required for the Dublin Spring Show.  This is the kind of activity that we, non-Dubliners, do not like to see develop.  I wonder has the problem been resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the practice for the band of the Southern Command to perform at the Cork Choral Festival but it was their turn to spend the week at the Dublin Spring Show.  The request from the Cork Choral Festival has been acceded to and the band is available for that, both as a band&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="954" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and individual members for performances and rehearsals for the last number of weeks.</P>
      <P>In reply to the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition and others I should say, first, I appreciate that a number of Deputies&mdash;in fact, many Deputies from this side of the House&mdash;were anxious to speak as well.  But I understood that an arrangement had been reached with the Whips that because of the need to pass the Vote there are a number of items of expenditure which An Chomhairle Ealaíon have agreed to defray and it is necessary to have the money for them.  If the House wishes and it is possible to arrange a suitable time, it would certainly be agreeable to me and the Government Whip to arrange an occasion either to have a motion or a token vote in order to provide time for a further discussion.</P>
      <P>I should say, however, that a number of the matters that have been raised are strictly within the discretion of An Chomhairle Ealaíon and any comment or suggestions that I or any Deputy or Member of the Seanad might wish to make would only be recommendations or observations.  In fact, An Chomhairle in the course of their report which is available for 1973-1974 and in the report for the last nine-month period which will shortly be available have set out in great detail the items under which they had committed themselves for expenditure and the various matters that have been assisted in one form or another, in each case setting out the actual amount given by way of assistance for exhibitions in respect of the visual arts, music, ballet, and the various bodies that are helped&mdash;literary, educational, dramatic and so on.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go through all these but if Deputies look at the report they will see that these matters are covered in very great detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, An Chomhairle refer in the course of the report to the fact that they had before them and read carefully the comments of Deputies during the passage of the amending <Col N="955" /> Act of 1973.  Under the 1951 Act, as amended by the 1973 Act, the entire discretion as to how the money is spent is within the province of An Chomhairle.  They, naturally, take into account the comments that are made and, as the Leader of the Opposition said, both An Chomhairle and whoever is responsible receive numerous representations for expenditure on a variety of worthy objectives and the question is how can the available funds be distributed.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition did raise a number of somewhat wider matters.  One is the question of Fota. This is a matter for the Office of Public Works and as the House is aware it was considered and I understand that certain action is being taken by the bodies interested in it in Cork.</P>
    <P>I think it is correct to say that there is no particular bias in favour of Dublin or any other area.  In fact, An Chomhairle Ealaíon have helped projects all over the country.  It is true that a number of Cork Deputies did table a motion on Fota here but that is more appropriate to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government defeated the motion and, in effect, said: &ldquo;No, we will not assist Fota&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the motion was signed by Cork Deputies only and even in his own party apparently it did not secure the same appreciation outside Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not ask for it. We could have got every member of the party to sign it if we wanted to. The fact is that the Government refused to assist in Fota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, there are a number of problems involved in it.  There is agitation on the one hand for land distribution. There is an approach from the university in Cork.  There is also a problem involved of both local authorities, I understand Cork Corporation and the Cork County Council.  It would be a mistake to imagine that every property <Col N="956" /> that comes on the market, no matter how desirable it is, can automatically be taken over by the State. Involved in that would be expenditure of a very considerable amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The joint body of Cork County Council and Cork City Council are not involved in Fota now. The motion we had down covered the farmers' representations.  I want to be factual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Olympia Theatre is concerned, the problem here is not merely one of finance; there is also the question of clarifying the legal position as to the right of the lessees to carry out the restoration work.  This has yet to be clarified.  The Arts Council, in fact, gave a grant of £1,000 as an earnest of its goodwill towards the restoration project, although the council is aware of the doubtful legal position.</P>
      <P>On this general question, as the House is aware, An Chomhairle Ealaíon itself functions under the Arts Act, 1951, as amended by the 1973 Act, but, in addition, the State provides considerable sums of money under the Miscellaneous Vote of the Minister for Finance under which help is given to the theatre, to the Abbey Theatre and other theatres.  As the House is aware, that has been the position for very many years going back to the twenties.  In recent times there have been suggestions that all these cultural activities be brought under one heading and, indeed, under one body but because of the conflicting interests involved and the fact that a number of these arrangements have been in operation for many years there has been a reluctance on the part of some of those involved to depart from that procedure.  While the Minister and the Government might wish to do so, one has to take into account the fact that what has been operating for a considerable time has achieved a certain sanction or status and to transfer all these cultural activities to the Arts Council would involve far-reaching changes, although it is correct to say that the matter has been the subject of consideration and consultation over a period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> We can all share the view expressed by the Leader of the Opposition that there are many more important historic buildings that many of us would like to see maintained or restored. While it is true, as Deputy Healy remarked, that other countries have done a good deal in this regard, in most cases they have considerably greater resources than we have.  It is also true that the Office of Public Works has done a great deal in this regard.  In many parts of the country restoration work of a magnificent kind has been very effectively carried out by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>So far as the question of individual festivals or other matters is concerned, I will draw the attention of the council to the remarks made by Deputies here but, as I say, some of the matters referred to are dealt with under the Miscellaneous Vote of the Minister for Finance and a further opportunity will be available when that Estimate is before the House.  If, however, there is a request for time, an arrangement will be made at some later date to have a special debate on the workings of An Chomhairle Ealaíon.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £48,946,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain services administered by that Office; for the pay and expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>

      <P>Since we last discussed the Estimate there have been some changes in the Department of Defence and a new secretary has been appointed.  First, I should like to put on record our appreciation of the outgoing secretary who, like his predecessors, rendered a great service to the Department.  I know the new secretary, Mr. Murphy, will act in the same way and I should like to congratulate him on his appointment.  I have no doubt he will be a great asset to the Minister.  He comes from my part of the country.  He has a good national background and it is only appropriate that we should wish him well.  I should also like to wish the outgoing secretary a happy retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we last discussed this Estimate I referred to special allowances for members of the Old IRA.  These are service medal holders for 1916-21. Last year when we were discussing this Estimate the Minister said he would put certain proposals to the Minister for Finance to ease the <Col N="959" /> means test and give those people an extra allowance but nothing has come of this.  I realise that it is difficult to get money for all types of aid but we owe something to the surviving Old IRA verterans.  It is degrading that a much more stringent means test is applied to these people than that applied to the old age pensioners and I cannot understand why it is necessary for the Old IRA veterans to undergo such a means test.  These people may be living with their families who have enough to do to support themselves.  Nevertheless, it is not uncommon for the social welfare officers when submitting their reports to the Department to state it is no hardship on the young families to keep and maintain the older people.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure that the necessary finances are available so that the Old IRA veterans have at least £5 per week.  If it is thought necessary, there could be a means test for sums in excess of this amount. Some of them may have Old IRA pensions of £6 or £8 per week but many of them have nothing.  The fought for the freedom we enjoy today and they suffered in the process.  It is sad to see some people trying to forget that period in our history but among the youth there is an interest in it and a desire to know what happened.  Many families lost everything during that time but the unsung heroines are the women of that generation.  They helped those who were on the run and without their help, and that of the public in general, the movement would not have succeeded.  Despite all they did we are not helping the Old IRA veterans.  Other countries cater for their old soldiers, for the people who fought for them and defended them but we have neglected them.</P>
    <P>I had those thoughts in mind when I asked the Government some time ago to allow the Army to participate in the Easter commemorations.  I do not think the Army should be available at every crossroads to commemorate every political event but Easter has a special place in Irish history.  The Easter Rising should be commemorated and we should not be afraid to <Col N="960" /> do so.  The Government decided that the Army would participate in the commemorations on St. Patrick's Day and I agree with that, but the message of St. Patrick's Day is totally different from the message of the Easter Rising.  St. Patrick came to Ireland in the year 432 but there was not a British conquest at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy sure about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was later than that when the Deputy was hunting the Jews out of Limerick but that is another matter.  As a nation, we should not be frightened to honour the Easter Rising.  The right to elect our own Parliament started with that rising.  The Minister should allow the Army to participate in the commemorations at Easter.  It will not do any harm if the commemorations are coupled with those on St. Patrick's Day.  The people want to commemorate the Easter Rising and they will do so themselves if the Government refuses to participate.  It will be much better for us to act in unison.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that if the Army participate they might be accused of showing preference for one group over another.  Surely we should be united as a nation in commemorating that very special occasion.  It will do no harm to anybody.  The Government will lose no caste by adding that ceremony to the one on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The FCA have a very special role. People are inclined to look on the FCA as a poor relation of the Army. We have not advanced very much in the way in which we cater for the FCA.  There are no incentives offered to young people to join.  If a young man joins the FCA, trains regularly and reports for duty at all times and if a job comes up in his area no special consideration is given to his application. Somebody with no idea of national security or a man who has been holding up the corners for two or three years may get the job.  Members of the FCA should get a certain priority when jobs are available in their local areas.  There should be a bonus <Col N="961" /> mark given for service to one's country. This country could not survive without our Defence Forces.  It would not survive without the FCA.  We need them to maintain law and order.  We need them in times of peace.  Our Army have gone abroad and given good service.  I would like to see more lectures given in schools on the role of the Army and of the FCA.  Young people of 16, 17 or 18 years of age who are in fifth or sixth year at post-primary school are attracted to guns and warfare.  They should be given the proper slant on those matters at that age.  It would be a good thing for them to join the Army for a period or at least to become involved in the FCA.</P>
    <P>The amount of money asked for by the Minister is not very large.  A sum of about £1 million a week for our Defence Forces may sound large but it is not a great amount of money when one considers the value of money today. He will find it difficult to run the Army properly on the amount he has mentioned. I certainly cannot see how he will carry out the great rehousing programme he has been talking about.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Army School of Equitation, the Department of Defence now seem set on a policy of regaining our past glory in the jumping arenas of the world.  Our Army riders with civilian riders may once again show the world that there is no horse equal to the Irish horse in the show jumping field.  We wish them very well in that. We wish them well in their relationship with Bord na gCapall.  We hope that within a very short time the fruits will be seen by everybody.</P>
    <P>I would again make a special plea to the Minister on behalf of the old veterans.  When one takes inflation into account and the fact that this is a full year the Minister's Estimate is no improvement on what we did last year. Everybody knows there is wide scope for improvement within the armed forces.  New weapons and so on cost a lot of money.  We are a small nation but a proud nation.  We have a very good Army.  We should be proud of it and cater for it better than we are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we must <Col N="962" /> make excuses for the ability and capacity of anybody for thinking but I want to assure Deputy Meaney that as far as the Rising of 1916 is concerned I consider it the greatest event in our history.  Since my young days as a Fianna Boy Scout I have attended the Easter ceremonies wherever they were held.  I have not missed even one commemoration in all that time.  That is what I think of the Easter Rising. I believe it should be fittingly honoured as the greatest event in our history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put my views to the Minister, being in no way obstructive or critical but trying to be helpful.  I would suggest that juveniles who have had convictions from the age of 18 downwards should have such convictions overlooked when they apply for enlistment in the Army.  I am sure everybody here knows of boys of 17, 18 19 or 20 years who see a future in the Army, who see in the Army something that will develop them physically and mentally, but because of some little misdemeanour&mdash; perhaps two or three years previously, perhaps they were charged with taking a coat or breaking a window&mdash;of which they were acquitted, it is held against them if they want to enlist in the Army.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at this and if he accepts my view he will find that the majority of those boys see that they were misguided or misled in the past and as a result of their Army training they will turn out to be excellent citizens.  I do not think they should be deprived of that privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to impress on the Minister the need for proper housing facilities, not for every member of the Army but there should be a greater commitment to the erection of married quarters or single quarters in areas convenient to Army barracks. We have married quarters which were handed over to us by the old regimé. When I was spokesman on Defence for the Labour Party I inspected all those places and I found that in all cases married quarters were absolutely substandard.  If they had been <Col N="963" /> under the control of the local authority they would have been condemned because of the lack of sanitary and other conveniences.  Certainly, the local authority would condemn the living quarters at Sarsfield Barracks on first inspection except for six or eight smaller type houses that have been erected within the barracks complex in recent times.  Similar type houses should be built in the barracks complexes at Athlone, the Curragh and Clonmel.</P>
    <P>I would press, too, for an extension of the trade training facilities.  This policy is very important because it ensures that on retirement, whether at middle age or younger, a man is capable of earning his living in another sphere.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the provision of university facilities for cadets and other Army personnel. These facilities are available in Dublin, Cork and Galway but now that we have an Institute of Higher Education in Limerick there is no reason why they should not be extended to that city also.</P>
    <P>Regarding the FCA, there are boys in that organisation who, because they have enlisted voluntarily, obviously are attracted to a military life. Therefore, every effort should be made to recruit them to the Army. We need all the people we can get for our Army today.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that our Army bands are not being utilised sufficiently.  I suggest that both bands visit the cities and larger towns, if not at quarterly intervals, at least twice a year.  There is not much point in having them in Dublin all the time.  The people in rural Ireland are entitled to hear them, too.  One of the bands visits Limerick each year and there is a marvellous response on the part of the people to their coming.  They give an open-air concert which generates tremendous interest.</P>
    <P>Regarding the general condition of Sarsfield Barracks, a building that was passed on to us by the British regimé and which was built more than 130 years ago, one can imagine how out-of-date <Col N="964" /> the accommodation is there. Fireplaces are falling asunder and the condition of the buildings generally is very bad.  Part of the barracks were burned during the Civil War but another part of the building was renovated in about 1923 so that this might be regarded as being comparatively modern.  If we wish to keep our standards in line with those of other European countries we must have up-to-date accommodation for Army personnel.  It is time that the whole situation in the barracks at Limerick was taken in hand.  It is possible to make the improvements necessary at Sarsfield Barracks because the space, and so on, is available.  I discussed this with the Minister and he is favourably inclined towards my suggestion. Let us expedite this transformation from the old to the new in the Army.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on the manner in which he received me when I made the case on behalf of the Limerick Corporation for the purchase of 190 acres of land.  I have been advocating the purchase of this land since I came into this House in 1961.  My advice fell on deaf ears. Time and time again I asked previous Ministers for Defence to do something about this land which was lying idle on the boundary of Limerick city.  It was used on one occasion, for a very short period, to house the Hungarian refugees.  The huts which cost so much money at that time are now derelict.  We suggested that they could be used as holiday camps for our young people.  We made several suggestions but they are now derelict and the money spent on them has been wasted.  In the debate on every Defence Estimate since 1961 I recommended that this land should be purchased but to no avail.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister.  He has taken up the cudgels and Limerick Corporation are now in the process of valuing those 190 acres.  The Minister has agreed to give this land to us provided the price is right.  Further than that he cannot go.  We hope to provide extra housing for our people, an industrial estate and public amenities for the physical and mental development <Col N="965" /> of the people of Limerick.  I congratulate the Minister on the business-like way in which he handled this problem which, to my mind, is a minor problem but to his predecessors it was a major one.  You would imagine I was talking about the evacuation of Saigon instead of the acquisition of 190 acres of land which is now derelict.  If Fianna Fáil think that is the way to encourage people to join the Army their standards are very low.</P>
    <P>I want to talk now about the Army Equitation Team.  There was a time when our great Army equestrian team won fame and renown all over the world.  Most of those men are alive today, the Hartys, the Corrys, the O'Dwyers, the Lewis'.  Then Fianna Fáil clamped down.  The allowances given to these men who represented this nation in the competitive field were not sufficient to enable them to keep up with their counterparts.  They could not afford to put their hands in their own pockets.  At that time the Government were too niggardly to provide the few extra pounds needed for entertainment purposes and the Army Equitation Team fell to pieces.  That was a tragic day for this nation.  They were the greatest ambassadors we ever had.  As a result of their activities we built up a name and a standard for our equine industry and people came from all over the world to buy our horses.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is interested in bloodstock.  I would ask him to reverse what was done by Fianna Fáil, the ruination of our Army jumping team. Our show jumping horses can be sold to people outside the country at a much higher price than the Army can afford. You cannot blame the man who is selling.  He must go into the best market and get the best price for his animal.  If we sell the cream and keep the skim we cannot compete with the people who buy the cream from us. Jumpers are always in demand. Middle-class or good-class show jumpers are pounced on by foreigners. If they are worth that much to foreigners surely they are worth keeping at home.  I cannot see why we should breed and rear and train these horses to be exploited by other people.  The <Col N="966" /> Minister and I have enough in common to recognise the foolish policy which our predecessors had in this regard.  I should like to see this position rectified.</P>
    <P>I want to make a passing reference to An Slua Muirí.  As far as we in Limerick are concerned they are dryland sailors.  They go to the classroom and to the blackboard but the only place they see the sea is on postcards or on maps.  In Limerick we have a very active branch of An Slua Muirí.  We have a large complement of boys who are interested.  As far as training is concerned, it is absolutely negligible.  They have neither a pleasure boat nor even a rowboat to go down the Shannon.  They spend their time in a room looking at the blackboard.  If properly developed An Slua Muirí could play a very important part where these young people are concerned.  An Slua Muirí could be used to protect our fisheries and do all the other things commonly associated with naval life.  I would ask the Minister to consider this very seriously.  I would ask him to direct his attention to the reorganisation of An Slua Muirí.  Let us see these boys actively engaged at sea.  Activity pays the best dividends where young people are concerned.  If they are not actively engaged physically and mentally they go to seed.  None of us wants this to happen.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be critical, as some Opposition Members were, about what is not being done in the Army. What did Opposition Members do when they were in Government?  Defence was the most neglected Department until the present Minister took over.  Let no one think otherwise. Now young lads can see a future in the Army.  The advertising campaign has been splendid.  Why is it that we cannot have a system whereby our young boys would do at least 12 months' compulsory training in one or other branch of the Defence Forces? Such training would pay a tremendous dividend.  It would make them excellent citizens.  It would not be a year lost because very often a boy who does not get his leaving certificate has to go back for another year.  A <Col N="967" /> year in the Army would make no difference.  Indeed, it would pay a very big dividend.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister success in his task.  He has shown himself to be a man of ability and capacity, a man with advanced ideas; he is the first Minister of this kind in Defence that I have seen since I came into this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with Deputy Meaney in his congratulations to the new civil service head of the Department of Defence. We must also congratulate the men and women in our Defence Forces.  I say Defence Forces; too often we are inclined to speak of the Army and forget about the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Coughlan raised the question of Army bands and I support everything he said on these. If these bands travelled around to the larger cities and towns they would do an excellent public relations job.  That does not mean that they are not doing that at the moment but I am thinking of the Garda band which is doing a great deal of travelling and, in the process, doing an excellent public relations job too.  I hope the Minister will adopt Deputy Coughlan's suggestion of having the Army bands travel around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to be associated also with the Minister's tribute to the First Line Reserve and the FCA.  They have been doing excellent work in this emergency period.  Where the FCA are concerned I believe the regulations should be changed.  I spoke about this two or three years ago and the present Taoiseach, who was then Deputy Cosgrave sitting on these benches, supported the suggestions I made.  I am thinking of a young lad of 15 who has left school or has done his intermediate certificate; he has at least three months free time, gallivanting around and possibly getting into bad company.  If this young lad could go into a military barracks as a full-time soldier during those three months he would ultimately turn out a much better citizen.  Boys attending secondary school could spend the following <Col N="968" /> summer vacation at the end of fifth year in the same way.  They could be trained as ordinary soldiers or even as NCOs.  By way of reward for that training it should be made a subject in the leaving certificate in which they could get a pass or an honours.  We hear a great many people complaining that our youth are wild.  If they are it is our fault because we are not doing something for them.</P>
    <P>Army discipline would be excellent for these youths.  They would also be trained in hygiene and develop a comradeship it is not possible to develop in other walks of life.  Quite often one will hear an ex-soldier, when he sees another man approaching, proudly say: &ldquo;I soldiered with him.&rdquo;  In the FCA, if the age were reduced, young boys could be trained in camp with full military discipline.  I am sure if the Minister consults his colleague, the Minister for Education, they will be able to evolve some method of doing what I suggest with proper recognition in the leaving certificate for the boys' services.  Military discipline would stand to these boys for the rest of their lives.  I hope the Minister will seriously consider these suggestions.</P>
    <P>We regret that due to the problems which exist in the country our troops had to be brought back from serving with the United Nations.  The Irish officers, NCOs and men who served with the United Nations did an excellent job.  I meet parliamentarians from other countries who have met some of our troops in Cyprus, the Middle East and the Congo and they have told me how much the officers, NCOs, and men of the other armies admired our troops.  I am glad to put that on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>Equipment has always been a hardy annual during the debate on the Defence Estimate.  Probably due to financial difficulties, it has always been very difficult to have the type of equipment our Army need.  An army in a small country needs to be mobile and if that is so then we must have our troop carriers and lorries. We must be able to move our troops quickly.  I am glad to see that during <Col N="969" /> the past five or six years a fair amount of money has been spent on this type of equipment.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that the standard of recruits which the Army are getting today is quite good.  This is probably due to the better educational system we have as compared to what it was 30 years ago.  There is one little criticism I might offer, and that is in relation to dismissing young men from the Army.  Say a young boy of 12 years of age goes into a shop and steals some sweets or a few cigarettes and the local gardaí are brought in, he is brought to court.  If he later joins the Army normal inquiries are made into the background of this young recruit.  Sometimes recruits are dismissed from the Army because of small crimes they committed when children.  I am not suggesting to the Minister, as was suggested 20 years ago, that if the local sergeant wanted to get rid of a bad lad in the town he sent him off to the Army.  I agree that the background of recruits should be investigated by the gardaí and if they are not suitable for civilian employment they are certainly not suitable for the Army.  I would like the Minister to ask his officials to have a look at the criteria laid down for dismissing a recruit because of small crimes committed when he was a young boy.  I know of young men who stole sweets or cigarettes when they were 12 or 13 years of age who would make excellent soldiers, if those small crimes were not taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Resettlement is always raised during this debate.  A boy of 16 or 17 years of age may enter the Army while his pals become teachers, carpenters, builders or work at some other jobs. The boy who goes into the Army gets promoted to corporal, sergeant and perhaps further up the line and when he reaches retirement age he has to come back to his local community.  He is still a young man but finds it very difficult to fit in because the other people have all got the jobs available. The only way we can help is to ask businessmen to give some consideration to those ex-Army men.  Specific jobs should be earmarked in the Departments of Local Government, Defence, <Col N="970" /> Justice, the Board of Works and perhaps other Departments for men who retire from the Defence Forces.  I hope the Minister will take action on this during the coming year.</P>
    <P>Civil defence is a very important aspect of this Estimate and also as far as the country is concerned.  I think it was the late President Kennedy who said:</P>
    <P>The world is large when it loving hearts divide,</P>
    <P>the world is small when your enemy swoops from the other side.</P>
    <P>He spoke this in the context of Russia or China.  We could use it as far as Civil Defence is concerned.  There is not a public awareness of the importance of it.  People do not think about Civil Defence until possibly a nuclear bomb bursts somewhere off the south coast of Ireland.  If something like that happened they would ask the Minister what he was going to do.  I hope the good of Civil Defence is brought home to the people.  The Minister paid a tribute to Civil Defence for the work done during the bombings in Dublin.  Tragedy can strike at any time and it is only then we realise the importance of Civil Defence.  The Army are always at hand in times of disaster but Civil Defence have a very important role to play.  We should have good Civil Defence units in all areas so that we are prepared if we ever have nuclear fallout.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his speech that the Old IRA men who are still with us are getting £194 per head per annum.  People have often asked if this is the best we can do for the Old IRA veterans.  If the brothers Pearse, Clarke, Connolly, Plunkett, McDermott or any of those others who were shot in 1916 were alive today would this House consider that £194 per annum was sufficient compensation for the services they gave to the country?  I know there are problems in regard to finance but I sincerely hope the Minister will do something about those Old IRA veterans.  I do not wish to detain the House further.  I sincerely hope the Minister will change the regulations <Col N="971" /> so far as the FCA are concerned and that he will remember the importance I have placed on Civil Defence and the last point I made.  Let us not forget those who founded the State.  I think it is an important part of our duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to congratulate the new secretary of the Department of Defence and wish him well.  I should like to take this opportunity also of congratulating the Minister on the partial success of his recruitment campaign.  It has been fairly successful.  It is continuing and I hope it will continue because I know the Minister is anxious to get more recruits.</P>
      <P>The Minister has brought lots of fresh air into the whole structure of our Defence Forces.  It is recognised that he has not been afraid of tackling problems in the Army that had existed for many years.  There seemed to be a lot of dust on the files. The Minister has at least made an effort to tackle such problems and bring them to a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>With regard to the recruiting campaign, I think it is a good thing for any young man to get Army training. It is the best that can be given.  Army equipment has improved also in no uncertain fashion during the Minister's term of office.  Young soldiers are fairly well paid and are fairly well satisfied with their rates of pay. I am not saying they are entirely satisfied with all of the conditions but it is a way of life of which any young man could be proud and one any young man would be well advised to consider seriously, especially in the current economic climate where employment is at such a premium.  I feel we should have no difficulty in bringing the Army up to the strength required and I wish the Minister every success in so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points to which I want to draw the Minister's attention. I mentioned some of them before. There have been some things in respect of which progress has been made and for which I thank the Minister.  I must repeat the question <Col N="972" /> raised before of people retiring from the Army living in Army houses or married quarters and who have been there for a number of years.  They are known in the Army and in my part of the country as the over-holders. When these people retire from the Army they find themselves and their families in a very bad position.  Their pensions, gratuities, and so on are withheld.  Sometimes the people in my constituency in this predicament, while they are over-holders, find they cannot obtain civilian employment.  I know the Minister's views on this matter.  We had discussions with Kildare County Council and with the Department on this problem.  Kildare County Council went some little way in endeavouring to solve it but, unfortunately, that is not enough.  They allowed two or three houses in each scheme adjacent to the military camp in the Curragh for over-holders, the tenants of which would be named by the Army.  Were there no backlog, that suggestion would probably adequately cover people in military quarters retiring each year but I am sure there is a backlog of 50 or more people awaiting attention.  In those circumstances one can appreciate how slow the process would be, which would be aggravated by people continuing to retire.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister feels that any money he has available for housing is needed for serving personnel.  I understand his position but, as far as my constituency is concerned, there is a problem.  I do not blame the Minister for it.  It has obtained for many years.  I was on many deputations to previous Ministers concerning the problem of the over-holder at the Curragh but it is a very real problem. It is a problem about which something will have to be done.  It is something that cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>A few years ago I know discussions took place between Kildare County Council and the Department of Defence concerning the provision of a site on the Curragh where many such people might be in a position to build houses with the help of county council loans.  Perhaps even the county <Col N="973" /> council might be prepared to give an extra grant either from the Department of Local Government or the Department of Defence for the building of such houses for over-holders. It is a problem which will have to be tackled because it militates against the Army.  People look at those over-holders and see their pensions with-held. They are unable to obtain employment. They live in married quarters after they retire.  That is not a good image of our Army or for young men who might be thinking of joining the Defence Forces.  In my area the current problem could probably be solved by agreement with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>But there has been this hang-over for years during which the county medical officers felt they could not go into military quarters to inspect them or ascertain whether or not people were living in over-crowded conditions.  Because of the regulations regarding the letting of local authority houses, such people could not at that time, go in and inspect those houses.  Even if there was over-crowding an over-holder did not get a local authority house.  We find now that the county managers and the county medical officers at last recognise this huge problem.  In County Kildare we are providing the number of houses necessary to meet the requirements of people retiring from the Army in any one year.  But there are 40 or 50&mdash;I do not know the exact number&mdash;people who have retired living in married quarters, who have nowhere else to go, who cannot get their pensions or obtain employment because of the situation in which they find themselves through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that the Department of Defence have responsibility for this matter because it was they who created the problem in the first instance.  It was they who brought those people into those houses.  I know the Minister feels that any money he has available is needed for houses for serving personnel. I understand that attitude but I do not think Kildare County Council can be expected to build houses <Col N="974" /> for those 40 or 50 people while they have such housing problems themselves, with people living in caravans and in very bad conditions throughout the county.  This battle has continued and it is time the Department of Defence, Kildare County Council and the Department of Local Government get around the table and solve it once and for all.  I am speaking only for the Curragh which is in my constituency. If the existing problem there was solved an arrangement could be made with Kildare County Council whereby recurring problems could be dealt with without much difficulty.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note from the Minister's statement that plans are well advanced for the building of 50 houses for serving personnel on the Curragh.  The first lot of houses built there are good houses.  I do not want to be recorded as saying that they are not good houses but there were faults in them which the Minister and the National Building Agency should avoid when drawing up the plans for the new houses.  At the time when the existing houses were built cheap oil was available and central heating was provided.  There was no fireplace provided.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that that will not be the case in future houses.  I have already mentioned to the Minister that the possibility of providing at least one fireplace in the existing houses should be investigated because the people find the cost prohibitive.  It was an experimental system, a combination of gas, oil and electricity, which is very expensive now and very awkward to maintain.</P>
    <P>The Orchard Park scheme on the Curragh is an open plan design. Some local authority schemes are also open plan schemes.  I would suggest that in connection with the 50 houses planned the open plan be discontinued. There are people who would prefer to have their gardens fenced in and to grow flowers in them.  One man from Orchard Park enclosed his garden and now has one of the most beautiful front gardens in County Kildare but I understand that he is under pressure to remove the railing because it conflicts with the open plan design.</P>
    <P>A soldier in his own home should <Col N="975" /> have the privacy that a railed-in garden provides and to be able to develop his horticultural skill in his own garden. The open plan is not suitable.  I say this not in reference to the Army alone. I do not believe it is suitable anywhere. People should have their gardens marked out and fenced so that they can cultivate what is their own.  There should not be an open plan in connection with local authority or Army housing.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take note of the two points I have made.  The Minister says that the 50 houses are at an advanced stage.  The Minister had my views on these matters before they were too advanced and I hope that different arrangements will be made in connection with the next lot of houses.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made in regard to the entitlement to a gratuity of single men and single officers serving in the Army, although perhaps not at the same rate as is applicable to their married comrades.  I would like the Minister to spell it out.  He may have to bring in a Bill or provision may have been made in a previous Act.  If the latter is the case I would congratulate the Minister.  Many soldiers felt that there was discrimination against single men in the Army in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>Many things are being done at the Curragh by serving soldiers that could be done by civilians.  In present economic circumstances it would be preferable to have this work carried out by civilians and to confine serving personnel to Army duties as such.</P>
    <P>The two previous speakers referred to Army bands and I am in entire agreement with what they said.  Under the present Minister Army bands have been available for any function worthy of having an Army band.  The Minister has done his best to have an Army band in attendance at any function where it would be reasonable to expect that an Army band would attend. On behalf of the men in the Army bands, I have this to say.  They are performing a great exercise in public relations.  They devote their full time to music.  The promotional outlets for them are very limited.  This matter <Col N="976" /> has been alleviated somewhat by the Minister.  If a man serves in an Army band for a certain period he should be promoted automatically.  Otherwise, his participation in this very valuable Army activity involves sacrificing chances of promotion.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Army Equitation School and I should like to support what has been said that we should build up a top-class Army jumping team.  Members of the Army Equitation School take part in international events.  The teams are mixed.  The Army jumping team, when they were at their best, did wonderful work in publicising Irish horses abroad.  They brought us to the top in showjumping.  We should ensure that the best available jumpers on the market are retained here for use by the Army.</P>
    <P>The Army have given wonderful service during the years and they have operated efficiently under difficult circumstances in recent times.  I look forward to the time when they will not be involved in work that should be done by the Department of Justice.  The maintenance of a prison on the Curragh Camp has put a great strain on the ordinary soldier and there is also a considerable strain on the people of the area.  I realise that it is necessary to have security checks but it is inevitable that a certain degree of strain and inconvenience is imposed, particularly when we consider there was always free movement on the Curragh.  I am afraid a barrier may come between the Army and the ordinary people because of those security measures, although I admit they are necessary.</P>
    <P>I hope the whole question of civilian prisoners being held in military detention will be re-examined and that it will end as soon as possible.  I know it is inevitable at the moment and that the Minister can do nothing about it.  I realise it is vital to the security of the State that we have the prison.  The prisoners there are not considered political prisoners.  It is a pity that prisoners, who are primarily the responsibility of the Department of Justice, are kept in a military camp and that the military policeman and the colonel in charge are jail personnel. <Col N="977" /> Army training was not given to them to deal with civilian prisoners who are in prison because they have robbed somebody or committed some other offence.  The sooner the Department of Justice are able to deal with that problem and remove the prisoners to a civilian prison the better it will be for the soldiers.  It is not a job the soldiers want.  It is not one for which they were trained.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister for allowing certain sporting organisations in Kildare to use part of the Curragh plain.  He is adopting the right attitude.  Although it may not be practical at the moment, when things become normal the gymnasium in the Curragh might be used by outside clubs who might wish to avail of the training facilities.  It would build up a fund of friendship between the out-lying areas and the serving soldiers. Relations have always been good between the people of the area and the soldiers but I want them to improve even more.</P>
    <P>The apprentice school in Naas is doing a very good job.  It is turning out electricians, carpenters, motor mechanics, fitters and radio technicians and many of these young men now hold responsible jobs.  However, some small improvements could be made to ensure the boys get the best training possible.  The teachers are employed by the Kildare Vocational Education Committee and the school is under the control of the Army. Five trades are catered for, with a total intake each year of approximately 50.  The courses are for three years which means there are approximately 150 boys in the school.  There is a heating system in that school which makes a dreadful noise and even in the coldest weather teachers are forced to turn off the heating in order to be heard by their pupils. Surely this matter could be dealt with quite simply.  The simple fact is that the heating system is not suitable for a school.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Army and the Department of Defence are notorious for red tape and this applies especially when the question of supplies arises. <Col N="978" /> If an officer in charge orders some item the order is sent to the Department of Defence and, for some unknown reason, it is then sent to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who may have to issue an advertisement for the item in question.  A situation arose in the apprentice school where the teacher of carpentry had timber but no glue.  If the teachers are supplied by the Kildare VEC, surely the school equipment could be supplied by the Department of Education. I am assured that the present system is not working.  The teachers, for this reason cannot give of their best and the pupils are not getting the maximum benefit.  I have mentioned that a teacher may have timber and no glue.  This sort of thing has been an aggravation to both teachers and pupils in that school.</P>
    <P>The Minister has improved the standing of the Army in the estimation of the public.  He is strict on the kind of recruit that is accepted.  We should be very careful to accept only the best type of recruit.  However, we seem to be too strict on the age regulation. I certainly do not think the Army is the place for a fellow who is not fit for civilian employment, as was the case some years ago.  I remember a justice telling somebody on one occasion that if he would join the Army he would acquit him.  I do not agree with that sort of thing.  However, if 17 is the minimum recruitment age, I see no reason why a fellow of 16½ who may look 20 or even a 15½ year-old boy who has his parents consent cannot be accepted.  I also do not believe we should keep a man who is two years above the maximum age limit, especially if he is a trained soldier, out of the Army.  We need trained soldiers.  It is a little bit silly to be so rigid on the question of age.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Army on the wonderful job they have done in the past few years in very trying circumstances. I also want to congratulate the Minister.  He has brought a breath of fresh air to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little new in this Estimate.  I appreciate that the <Col N="979" /> Minister has done much for the Army in the last two years and is continuing on the line started by his predecessor. However, most of the increases in this Estimate are due, I would think, to increased costs rather than to the purchase of newer type equipment.  I have noted the reference to new equipment, vehicles and so on and, indeed, they can be seen by all of us.</P>
      <P>For years I have been asking the previous Minister, the Minister before him and now the present Minister to bring a little humanity into the administration of the free travel scheme and to give the wives of Old IRA men separate free travel.  At present, such a woman cannot travel free unless she is accompanied by her husband. If her husband dies, she gets free travel as the widow of an Old IRA man but if her husband is in hospital in, say, Dublin, she cannot have free travel to visit him.  I would ask the Minister to consult the Minister for Finance in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister has increased the amount of Border pay for members of the Army.  This was originally introduced by his predecessor.  I always found it exceptionally unfair, and particularly during the Portlaoise Prison breakout, that a member of the Garda Síochána rightfully got his overtime payments while the soldier who did the exact same amount of time got no overtime but a miserable allowance. The garda may have earned £8 or £9 in overtime while the soldier got £1. The soldier was the person who was armed and who might have had to take a decision whether to discharge his firearm or not.  He would also obviously be the first target because he was the only person who was armed. I know the Minister cannot introduce a system of overtime in the Army.  One can imagine some very funny situations in a time of war if there was a strike on both sides because of overtime. However, he could bring in, for the special circumstances we have today, a special active service pay so that when a soldier is in a position where he may have to use his rifle, Sten gun, Gustav or whatever his weapon may be, when he is in danger and when he <Col N="980" /> is in charge of public safety in streets and at check points, he will be given a very special rate of pay for the hours he puts in.  He should be paid on the basis that he is in an active service position.  The facilities for such people in the Army have been very bad.  They have been shabbily treated on many occasions as regards canteen facilities at check points and so on. They have not been getting sufficient breaks.  They are expected to work more than an eight-hour day on security duties and while there is no need to doubt dedication or enthusiasm, it is a disincentive to them to find another force doing, basically, the same work as themselves but receiving £8 or £9 per day more than the private or corporal with whom may rest a decision involving life or death.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would be sympathetic towards those people.  If the question is one of money I am convinced that he would make every effort to find the necessary finance. However, I appreciate that the problem concerns the question of the introduction of overtime to Army regulations and, also, that there are some members of the Civil Service who would disagree with any payments being made to the Army in respect of overtime.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on extending to single men the gratuity payable on retirement.  This has been one of my hobby horses for the past few years because I considered it very unfair that a man who had given, perhaps, 33 years' service to the Army would not qualify for a gratuity on leaving merely because he was not married.  It has always been my contention that the single man needed this money as much as, if not more than, the married man.  The Army had been his life.  He had lived in the barracks so that on leaving he would have to find accommodation elsewhere whereas it was likely that the married man had a home already.  I trust that in the case of the single man the gratuity will be on the same generous basis as applies to married men.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to building and to the work that has been carried <Col N="981" /> out in Border areas.  In this connection the only place I wish to refer to is Kickham Barracks at Clonmel. From reports I have received from members of the Defence Forces, their families and friends, I understand that conditions in the canteen there leave much to be desired.  The situation is so bad that instead of the canteen being a place to which the soldiers should be proud to bring their friends, they are ashamed of it.  I do not know whether the problem is one of construction or decoration but I trust the Minister will have it looked into.</P>
    <P>Regarding the use of members of the Defence Forces on special security duties, I would mention that on a recent occasion I witnessed what was a ridiculous waste of money&mdash;a convoy from Portlaoise to Dublin consisting of two helicopters, one flying over either side of the road, two garda vans, four military jeeps and at least six squad cars.  They were engaged in escorting a prisoner to Dublin whose case continued for three days.  Speaking commercially a helicopter costs £150 an hour but if we assume that the cost of an Army helicopter would be £100 an hour, it follows that for two helicopters to make the journey to and from Portlaoise the cost would be £400 for each day or £1,200 for three days.  We must take into account also the cost of the other vehicles and also the cost of the manpower involved. There is no need for such extensive activities on the part of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Allowing for the non-payment of duty on petrol and so on, we shall deduct 10 per cent from the figures I have given.  Was there any reason for the engaging of two helicopters to accompany the convoy? Is this not making heroes of the people involved?  It is an attempt to put them on the same standing as Treacy or Breen when there is no comparison whatever to be made.  The Minister tells us that the decision was a military one but I blame him as much as anybody else.  Such action is putting those people on a par with the bandits of the wild west or with the Kellys of Australia when four or five armed and disciplined men would be sufficient to escort a prisoner of this type.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out here before, the FCA could become one of the most <i>élite</i> forces in the country if their numbers were reduced.  I do not know how many men are in the force&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>About 60,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but many of these are fellows who are kept on the roll, who are not discharged merely because they take part in a parade once in about nine months, whereas if we began with a hard core of about 2,000 intelligent young men, we could build from there.  We could have a high standard of acceptance and the force built up, at small cost to the country could be as good as, if not better than, the regular defence forces.  There is a tremendous amount of interest and talent among members of the FCA but not enough emphasis has been placed by successive Ministers on this talent and interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The FCA uniform is very unattractive in design and general appearance. In many cases wives or mothers of members make alterations that improve the uniform's appearance but there are many members who have no one to do this work for them. A full-length tunic is a must for members of the FCA.  If the Minister builds up a high standard in the FCA <Col N="983" /> not only will he create a good force but the enthusiasm which will swell from that will be absolutely fantastic.</P>
    <P>I do not know if this is a possibility, but I was told some years ago that quite a number of helicopters are sold after the NATO exercises every year. They are two or three years old. Our present helicopter force are doing an excellent job not only in the military sense but in the service they provide to hospitals.  I regularly see helicopters outside the county hospital in my own town.  Perhaps the Minister would look into the possibility of buying some of the NATO or American helicopters which I understand can be bought very reasonably.  They are in excellent condition. This might lead to a saving for the Exchequer rather than buying the brand new Alouettes.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to see in last evening's paper mention of our first &ldquo;Paras&rdquo;, although we would not like to be associated with the word &ldquo;Paras&rdquo; in the sense we know it in this country.  I congratulate those young men who are our first paratroopers. I hope this is the beginning of a new corps which will be built up and that the Minister will be able to buy a troop-carrying helicopter so that we could move troops in cases of emergency.  For example, in the event of trouble at Portlaoise they could be brought there by helicopter very quickly.  Therefore, it will be necessary to carry out parachute training.  A wonderful image was built up a couple of years ago of the ranger training.  That was fantastic advertising by the Army and created a tremendous image of the Army.  I know this is not being done at the moment because men cannot be got together to be trained in present circumstances but when the situation is back to normal it will be important to have a commando image for our men.  This is important to the men and to the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that the gratuity he has promised is given on a generous basis.  I congratulate the Minister on that.  I would also ask him to investigate the possibility <Col N="984" /> of introducing special active service pay for men who are issued with live ammunition for security duties such as road blocks.  This would be a small token of our appreciation of the position these men find themselves in.  It would be appreciated by them from the financial point of view and it would also alleviate the feeling which was building up between members of the Army and members of the Garda Síochána with regard to the pay difference.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister's staff and especially those in his own office who are so obliging and helpful.  I want to thank him for his courtesy in replying to representations made to him during the past year.  I trust that he will keep up the same high standard in the replies he gives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Border Deputy I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without paying the highest compliment possible to the officers and men who have manned the Border over the past 12 very difficult months.  The past 12 months have probably proved hard and severe not only for our Army but also for our gardaí.  About 12 months ago along the Border there were incidents practically every second day, especially along the Border in Counties Leitrim and Donegal.  The stringent methods adopted by the Army and the gardaí have paid terrific dividends. I am sure I do not have to remind the House that there are practically no incidents now.  In my area in south Donegal there has not been an incident for over 13 months.  We must give credit for this to the security forces who operate along the Border.  They work in very difficult times and under very difficult conditions. They have to endure bad weather conditions and housing facilities and they are on duty at all hours of the day and night.  Officers in particular are on duty for two and three days running sometimes without a break.  As a Parliament, we are certainly indebted to those men who have cooled the situation in the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davern was right when he said officers and men on Border duty receive Border allowances only.  We <Col N="985" /> were all delighted to see them getting an extra bonus but I would ask the Minister does he think that the men who have put their lives at stake are getting enough compensation for the job they are doing?  When they joined the Army they were not primarily interested in money.  If two men are doing the same work side by side, one of them armed and the other un-armed, there is nothing worse than for one man to walk away at the end of the week with £20 more than his counterpart because his counterpart is a soldier.  I would ask the Minister to see if it would be at all possible to get an increase for men and officers doing Border duty.</P>
    <P>We must offer these men terrific incentives to do Border duty.  One of the incentives we cannot offer them at the moment is housing for their wives and families.  There is a shortage of houses in places like Ballyshannon and Letterkenny.  The Army have in their ownership hundreds of acres of land in both those places.  I have often wondered would it be possible to do a deal with the National Building Agency.  They could put up the money to build the houses on the land available to the Minister.  This would not cost the Minister anything.  All he would have to do would be to guarantee that the money would be paid back.  Once the houses were built, they could be leased to or vested in Army personnel and the Department would not have to carry the can so far as money was concerned.</P>
    <P>It is amazing how many people try to get into the county council scheme. Usually an Army man or an Army officer has not got more than one or two of a family.  Therefore, they are not high on the priority list.  I would ask the Minister to have a talk with the National Building Agency to see would it be worthwhile to get them to build houses in Letterkenny and Ballyshannon.</P>
    <P>I should like also to compliment the people who man the helicopter service and who take people involved in accidents to hospitals in Sligo and Dublin and provide a lifeline to the islands off the coast of Donegal.  For <Col N="986" /> too long the islands could not be reached because of rough seas and the people were just left, often for six or seven weeks with food supplies running low.  The islanders appreciate the work the Government and particularly the Minister for the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Defence are doing to ensure that the islands are no longer left in isolation.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing to notice that recruitment is up only marginally.  I can think of no better career than the Army for a young man.  If he joins up for three or five years he will come out at the end of that time with a trade of some kind.  He will also have discipline and that discipline will stand to him all through his life.  The days are gone when a man joined the Army in preference to going to Britain or America.  A previous speaker referred to a judge telling a young man he would not commit him for some crime provided he undertook to join the Army; the speaker did not approve of this approach.  I think more judges should adopt this approach because the Army will knock the right discipline into these young men.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on buying some fine horses.  The Army has the men; all they needed were the right horses.  It takes years to train a horse as a jumper and the Minister should be encouraged to buy as many young stock as possible.  There is a tremendous export potential, though in recent years our name had gone down somewhat in the show jumping world.  Sufficient money must be made available to buy the right horses at the right time.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister to keep up the good work.  We all know he is doing a good job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan) Patrick S. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should say, since neither gentleman involved will have an opportunity of saying it publicly for himself, is that the retiring secretary Mr. Kearney, and the incoming secretary, Mr. Murphy, are very grateful for the kind remarks made about them.  I would like to add to that my firm conviction that in losing Mr. Kearney the civil service has lost an <Col N="987" /> excellent man, who has given great service and, in taking Mr. Murphy into the high office of Secretary of the Department of Defence, they have taken a man of excellent capability.</P>
      <P>I regard the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Justice as two of the most important Ministries in the State.  When speaking here on Defence we must at all times be most circumspect and careful because we are living in dangerous times and I thank the Members of the Opposition, who paid compliments to the Department and to me, for their deep sense of responsibility in this debate.  Very little of the debate could be described as in any measure irresponsible.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I have to introduce a small barb.  I am sure my good friend, Deputy Dowling, will receive it in friendship.  He will agree with me that there is an old Army saying that every man is entitled to 27 inches in the ranks and his grouse.  That applies to Deputy Dowling and to myself both retired.  I was a voluntary officer in the Red Cross.  The only snag is I have a feeling that our commanding officer, looking at us now, might produce the tape measure and say: &ldquo;We will worry about the 27 inches&rdquo;.  If Deputy Dowling erred in any way he erred in producing some of the accepted grouses.  He was, of course, trying to cure the ills.  I suppose he was entitled to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling referred to something he described as the giant civil service machine.  I was aware long before I became Minister that serving soldiers and serving officers felt they were held back by the civil service. It is a most natural feeling because every good soldier and every good officer want more supplies, more equipment and a better Army and every civil servant is bound by the exigencies of the financial situation at any given time.  Therefore, what people wanted and what people were prepared to give could not always coincide.  In fact, on most occasions there would be a divorce between the two.  It is a mistaken idea that this giant machine&mdash; it is not giant at all as far as Defence is concerned&mdash;is not with the Army. <Col N="988" /> My ambition as Minister would be to blend the two agencies together to get the very best both for the Defence Forces and for the Department.  Their responsibility is to the people through that blending and through working together.</P>
    <P>The civil servants are there to assist the Minister and act under his direction. Advising the Minister is one of their functions.  They are part of the apparatus by which the Minister maintains civil control of the Defence Forces of the State on behalf of the Oireachtas and ultimately on behalf of the people.  The military command over the Defence Forces and all executive and administrative powers in relation to these forces are exercised not by the secretariat but by the Minister for Defence so, if anybody should be blamed, it should be me.  The civil service staff also assist the Accounting Officer of the Votes for Defence and Army Pensions and he has to discharge his duty to this House as represented by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The staff perform a wide variety of duties: to mention a few, they keep the pay accounts of some 15,000 full-time military and civilian personnel, 17,000 reserve personnel, 25,000 pensioners and special allowance holders.  I call attention to the fact that that is the reason why the first computer in Government was sited in the Department of Defence.  The staff deal with legislation, including regulations and schemes under the Defence and Army pensions code.</P>
    <P>They are responsible for the central administration and direction of Civil Defence.  They place thousands of contracts every year.  In global financial terms they control or oversee an expenditure of nearly £50 million in the current year.  They have to keep a watch on the audit and be responsible to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Those total works are carried out by a staff of 550.  We have seen the numbers of PDF Reverve personnel, pensioners and special allowance holders.  That is apart altogether from buying even one gun or one helicopter.</P>
    <P>That 550 includes cleaners, messengers, clerical assistants right <Col N="989" /> through up to the secretary of the Department.  Some of the staff provide services for both the civil and military branches of the Department and their functions and distribution; if anybody wants to look at the cost and so on, it is under subhead A.  I cannot, therefore, accept that Deputy Dowling is right in saying that this is a giant civil service machine.  I know there will be Army personnel drinking a very expensive pint in a pub tonight who may hear I have said this and they will still not believe it.  The fact is that it is not a large civil service machine.  There is sometimes a mis-conception about the 1,800 civilian employees attached to military units. These are not civil servants and they do not do the work of civil servants. They are employed under the authority of the Defence Act, 1954, and work under the sole direction of military officers.  They provide the Army with a wide variety of skills and services. I constantly see on my desk the appointment of people like storemen, cleaners, pioneers, messengers and all sorts of people.  I think the last one was the messenger in Collins' Barracks who acted as postman.  The normal postal delivery was made at the gate and he went around the barracks delivering postal packages and anything else that a military officer wanted delivered in the course of his duties.  The whole machine consists of 550 civil servants, 1,800 civilian employees and numbers in the PDF, the Reserve, pensioners and special allowance holders.  Every one of them has some contact, whether it is merely to receive a cheque or to do his work as an officer or man in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Before I go into the debate in greater depth I would like to refer to the Cork Choral Festival and the contribution by Deputy Meaney.  A fortnight ago I was faced with the position whereby it was the turn of the Southern Command Band to go to the Spring Show for a week.  The idea is that those bands should circulate around the country, gain all the experience they can and be seen everywhere.  That band was kept in Cork for some years to look after the <Col N="990" /> Cork Choral Festival.  It provided not only practice but individual musicians for the festival.</P>
    <P>The military decision was to send it to the Spring Show and provide another Army band.  I rescinded that decision on this occasion, but I have indicated to the Cork Choral Festival people that it would be inappropriate if on every occasion when the Spring Show comes up the Southern Command Band were precluded from giving their contribution.  I was really saying that it is not true that Cork is a Republic.  Next year, if I am Minister, and if there is a military recommendation to me that that band goes to the Spring Show instead of to the Cork Choral Festival I will try to provide the services through another band and give all the musicians I possibly can the rehearsals they need.  I ask the people of Cork to realise that it would be a wrong decision to copperfasten that band every year for the week of the Spring Show. That is the reason behind it.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the day of commemoration, St. Patrick's Day, and Deputy Meaney's view that there should be a commemoration at Eastertime. He then said that the people should be taken in hand and we should all go together.  I could not agree more with the Deputy in that regard.  When the Government made the decision it was because of the times we are in and the idea was to bring all the people together, to commemorate all the dead of Ireland on one day and there was discussion as to what day it should be on.  I respectfully put it to the House that it could be Christmas Day except that this would interfere with people's Christmas festivities.</P>
    <P>In the course of my duties during my first year as Minister for Defence I had to go to the Wolfe Tone Commemoration. There was the usual military ceremony, the Last Post, the laying of the wreath but no speeches.  I emerged and then two people, who I am sure have nothing but the goodwill of the past and the commemoration of the past in their hearts, Senator Brian Lenihan and Deputy George Colley, were standing on the far side <Col N="991" /> of the road, with a trumpeter in mufti that I had produced waiting to go in and pay their tribute.  At the same time a large number of people with black berets were marching up from Sallins.  That is not a proper commemoration for the dead of Ireland. Even if the Government may have to some extent made people feel there was not sufficient commemoration for Easter it was not their intention. In my view they have quite responsibly produced a proper day of commemoration for the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>I should also like to say that one of the things I had to do as Minister for Defence on that occasion, advised by the Secretary of the Department, was to take into account the fact that the Mass and ceremony at Arbour Hill was an occasion when relatives of the dead of 1916 were invited and attended as well as various dignitaries. The Government decision, on my recommendation, was that that should be kept.  It is celebrated on the most appropriate Sunday during the month of May.  I am not sure if it is next Sunday or the Sunday after but I will be there.  All the relatives will be asked, as before, and the ceremony will, as usual, be most impressive.</P>
    <P>That was the Government decision. I have given one experience of mine as an indication to the House of what way we were going.  One of the reasons for the Government decision was that they accepted that everybody had the right to celebrate and commemorate anything in any way they liked as long as they did it within the law.  At the present moment certain political parties have special commemorations.  The Government have no argument with that at all, but I am sure the House agree with me that it would be most inappropriate if we had the sort of thing happening that I described.</P>

      <P>No.  I suggest it is better to have a day that will commemorate all the dead and in so doing you do not denigrate or take from any of the dead, which includes every one of them, such as Wolfe Tone and Padraic Pearse.  In my view the day was appropriate.  I am not arguing about the day.  I merely say my experience on the occasion I have described was that it was inappropriate and denigrating not only to the Government but at the time to the Opposition and bringing the whole thing into the sphere of a laughing stock.</P>
      <P>I would like to deal with young offenders who were charged and are not being received into the Army.  This matter was mentioned by various people, including Deputy Coughlan and Deputy Nolan.  Deputy Nolan suggested that somebody who stole a half pound of sweets would not get into the Army.  It is highly unlikely that such a person ever appeared in court.  I suggest to Deputies that I have a very serious responsibility in this regard.  It will be a long time to come before we can get cubicles and proper sleeping accommodation.  The position will be that men will be sleeping in billets which can mean 15 to 20 good young Irishmen to a billet.  The risk of putting in with 19 top-class young recruits somebody who will steal their money or their watches, somebody whose hygiene habits are not what we desire, or somebody who will take down the tone of that group of excellent young men, is something I have to take into consideration.  It would be a very serious default in my duties if I were to create a situation whereby the standard was reduced.  While nobody wants to exclude a young man who stole a half pound of sweets when he was 13 years of age nobody wants to create in the Army as a whole an élite corps.  At the same time the responsibility is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to every Deputy here that, were they in my position, <Col N="993" /> they would find themselves in exactly the same frame of mind.  I would suggest that we leave it as it is.  We would hope that, between the Garda and the Army a reasonable view would be taken.  If somebody has a particular case in mind, let me know of it.  But, on the basis of the report from the Garda officers, when a recruit presents himself and while he is undergoing the first training period of 16 weeks and not finally approved, the commanding officer gets the report and makes his decision.  I accept that one commanding officer's decision might vary from that of another.  If there is found to be an individual case, in a friendly manner&mdash;because it is not my decision, it is a military one&mdash;I would certainly take it up with a commanding officer on behalf of a Deputy.  Deputies will realise my responsibility in this regard; realise also that, while we do not want an élite corps, we want people looking up to our Army as never before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>While we accept that &mdash;and no doubt the Minister will have the full support of Deputies on this question&mdash;might I ask him if there is a criterion laid down in regard to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could quote for Deputies two paragraphs from the Defence Forces Regulations.  Paragraph 12 of the Defence Forces Regulations A. 10 provides that certain persons will not be enlisted in the permanent Defence Force.  These persons include&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person who has been convicted of a serious offence by a civil court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Paragraph 22 (b) of Defence Forces Regulations A. 10 provides that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  Immediately subsequent to the attestation of a recruit the attesting officer will forward A. F. 340 to the member of the Garda Síochána in charge of the area in which the recruit resided or to some other person of standing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  A recruit will not be finally approved unless a satisfactory report has been received on A. F. 340 <Col N="994" /> and he is otherwise considered suitable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>If I might quote further from the Regulations as follows:</P>
    <P>The military authorities have issued certain instructions regarding the procedure to be carried out in relation to Army Form 340 (Garda Report).  The following is an extract from these instructions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Command Adjutants, in consultation with the Records Officer, should NOT reject a man on the grounds of a civil conviction without first considering the gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the offence, if available from A.F. 340, and the age of the person when the offence was committed.  If considered necessary, the views of the OC Training Unit may be obtained in order to assist in arriving at a decision.  The views of the Command Medical Officer, if pertinent, should also be obtained.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is clear from these instructions that a civil conviction should not automatically result in the rejection of a recruit.  Individual officers may, however, interpret the instructions less liberally than others.  I do want to say this, that the old District Justice comment&mdash;which unfortunately existed when I became Minister for Defence: &ldquo;If you join the Army, I will let you off&rdquo;&mdash;I said then, and say now, is one guarantee that a fellow will not join the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give the Deputy that information now.  If he would communicate with me, certainly I will have it furnished to him. But, as far as my experience goes, it is a question of the gravity of the offence.  In fact, I am advised it is the same.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coughlan mentioned the condition of Sarsfield Barracks.  I was around Sarsfield Barracks.  In my view it has two deficiencies.  One is that the married quarters are very old and decrepit. There are five or six new ones which are excellent but, within the barracks themselves, there is a grave deficiency in relation to recreational facilities.  There is a small playing pitch; I think it is a soccer pitch because it is not large enough to be a Gaelic one; I doubt if hurling could be played on it.  But that is all that exists, apart from a gym and so on. There is no doubt but that, in dealing with all Army property at present, there is room for decision and work.  I am working on the matter referred to by Deputy Coughlan.  But I would say immediately that the personnel in Sarsfield Barracks and that area must have training ground made available to them.  Any question of disposal of the land mentioned by Deputy Coughlan &mdash;he did not give the name but it was quite obvious from what he said where it was situated&mdash;Knocklasheen, would mean that there would be the provision of training ground, of similar or better quality, for the Army.  One just could not have the number of young people in Sarsfield Barracks without outside training facilities, other than what I have described as a small soccer pitch, which is not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> I might as well deal with the question of the equestrian team, which was referred to, before dealing with more serious things.  I reckon, in round figures&mdash;in any man's language&mdash;it costs approximately £4,000, taking account of officers' pay, grooms' pay and so on, to keep a horse in McKee Barracks.  Some people might think that is an awful lot of money.  But one has to take into account the horse, the officers riding it, grooms and so on.  The second point to be borne in mind in relation to McKee Barracks is that the number of highly-skilled grooms and people who deal with horses there could not be achieved by a millionaire, if he so desired, within years.  Therefore, the best unit to carry the flag in this country in years to come will be McKee Barracks.  Bord na gCapall will help and we are working in close association with them.  I should like people working in those barracks, notably grooms&mdash;who felt there might be some change effected to the Curragh and so on&mdash;to understand that that will not transpire, for the simple reason that one could not dispose of the assembled skills or, if one did, one would completely wreck any chances Ireland might have in international equestrianism.</P>
    <P>The next point to be borne in mind is this: there are very few people rich enough in this country to have a string of jumping horses.  If one bears in mind the figure I mentioned&mdash;which is approximate but which I would think is not too far wrong&mdash;and thinks of a man, say, in Germany who keeps 60 jumping horses, then one realises the situation between the rich and poor nations.  In Britain, America, Germany &mdash;I presume Russia is in a different position&mdash;there are perhaps 10, 12 or 15 men or women contesting for the honour of winning an international competition, who are prepared to spend vast sums of money in so doing.  We have not got that type of person here. Therefore, what we need is a Government agency that can promote the Irish horse, as it has been defined by various people, including Deputy Davern and Deputy Coughlan.  But the promotion of the Irish horse entails the expenditure <Col N="997" /> of a lot of money, which is included in the Department of Defence Estimate.  It forms part of the Defence Estimate because, in years past, an Army marched on its stomach and rode on a horse, and the number of horses armies possessed and bought formed a very big feature of the horse trade. Some countries have abolished horses altogether so far as Army participation is concerned.  We have not and, I hope, never will.  Our position in this respect is that we can provide a unit that can advertise the Irish horse.  Nobody else here, with the exception of perhaps two or three people, could undertake it financially.  The size of the Irish horse trade within the gross national product is such that it is good money spent by the Government&mdash;the people's money. As I have said in this House before, one may be in a position to advertise a bottle of stout by putting a label on it with the name of the brewer, or one may be in a position to do something else with a trade name.  Take the case of a farmer down in Tipperary with two or three brood mares who hopes to sell a few horses on a second or third year; one cannot take those horses and put a label on them saying &ldquo;marvellous Irish horse&rdquo;.  The only way that can be done is at the very highest level, by winning the Irish Sweeps Derby, the Prix de L'arc de Triomphe, or some such event in the racing field and, in the jumping field, win international competitions.</P>
    <P>That is the Government thinking behind the matter.  Were the agency to exist it would have as much to do with skills as with money.  Indeed, at this point, I should say how glad I was to see Captain Larry Kiely having been placed fourth in Rome yesterday; fourth in Rome and first of the Irish team.  Captain Campion last week was joint sixth and first of the Irish.  People sometimes write up things and people get great names and fantastic reputations.</P>
    <P>In the Aga Khan Cup last year we had 24 faults; 23 were from the civilians in the team of four and one fault was from the Army.  Let us not think that they are doing so badly. In fact, if you looked at it clinically and cut off all the headlines in the <Col N="998" /> papers and read the small print and checked it out you would find that they were doing quite well.  We do not expect to do as well as we should do until next year because you cannot buy horses, marry men to them and get results immediately.  The effort is being made.</P>
    <P>A further effort is being investigated that I would like to tell the House about.  It is not a fact as yet but I dearly wish that it will become a fact. We have had the benefit of high class equestrian coaches, such as Mr. Bubbel, loaned to us from Bord na gCapall and at one time Mr. Rodgianko. These gentlemen cannot last for ever. The work of Mr. Bubbel is so fantastic that I would hope that he would live to be 100.  They last for a time only.  Then we will have to look for another high-class equestrian coach. You are talking about dressage, about fantastic things like the six best Army jumpers which I saw after three days special training doing quadrilles to music, you are talking about things they have to do eventually in competition, with a man being able to place the two front feet of his horse within an inch and the two hind feet within an inch, and take off and jump, not against those great names that were mentioned here today but with a far greater degree of expertise than was needed, say, 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>That means that we need a permanent coach who would be succeeded by another permanent coach who would have an Army career.  We cannot spare any senior rider who might be interested, any retired rider within the Army who might be interested, until after the Montreal Olympics next year.  We are investigating the question of sending our man on these coaching courses and eventually creating our own high-class equestrian coach.</P>
    <P>That affects two things; first, his future Army career and, secondly, career structure within the Army Equitation School, because if you were to take a man with the rank of commandant and spend £7,000 or £8,000 on him on courses, he has then got a liability to the Army when he comes back.  If his horses are winning <Col N="999" /> and he is accepted as one of the best in the world or in Europe, you have the man I spoke of like the man with 60 horses jumping in Germany, coming to him and saying, &ldquo;You had £7,000 spent on you and they are paying you £4,600.  Here is a retainer for starters of £20,000 and I will pay you £10,000 a year&rdquo; and you lose him. I do not think the sort of person that we would have would be interested in going full length for money, but it is a factor that must be considered, and we are studying at the moment the Army Equitation School career structure within the Army for a man who has gone on courses and has come back so that he would be at a rank commensurate with his work for the country.  Then there is the fact that he will not last for ever.  A very detailed examination is required of the position in relation to high-class equestrian coaching.  That is being carried out at the moment, with the reservation that we can spare nobody until after the Montreal Olympics, on which we have our sights set for some success at least.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan mentioned the question of selling the cream and keeping the skim in relation to horses. The clear definition of the position would be that we would keep some of the cream and would sell a lot of the cream which we could not afford to keep, for very high prices, and that our keeping some of the cream and winning with it would enhance the price of the cream we sell, and let the skim look after itself.  That would be my view of the matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to take up the question of overholders.  It is a very sore point.  I am glad to say that we have succeeded by friendly discussion in getting certain local authorities to reserve a certain number of houses in housing schemes for soldiers.  I should like to put this to overholders: it is a very difficult matter.  There are young married soldiers with families coming in.  As Deputy Bermingham said, we will be starting the second 50 of a projected group of 450 houses in the Curragh Camp and there is certain other building going on.  It is difficult <Col N="1000" /> to exclude the young serving soldier from his chance of a house when the ex-soldier overholds.  The great gap as far as the overholder is concerned is the difference between the maximum £4,500 loan a local authority can give and the cost of a house.  I have checked with the secretariat.  We would be quite happy, if we owed him any money, to let him, as I am sure all Deputies have done many times with constituents, irrevocably sign off his gratuity or pension that he has earned to a bank and let the bank produce the bridging finance and let him buy or build a house.  The Department of Defence will co-operate to the fullest in this.  There is no reason why he cannot produce a document which is an irrevocable authority. I have done it in my political capacity many times with constituents. I am told you can do that and we will do our very best.</P>
    <P>There are 86 married quarters over-held by ex-military personnel, 37 in the Eastern Command, 32 in the Curragh training camp, 12 in the Southern Command and five in the Western Command.  That is not too bad.  If we can get over the hump by the suggestion I have made, plus the fact that we can get a few houses from each local authority, we will have done quite well.  I have the greatest sympathy for overholders.  It is all right to say that a man is wrong.  If he is in an inextricable position, it does not matter whether he is right or wrong, he is in trouble.  That is the position with the overholder but I cannot do very much about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>You have to guarantee his life for a start.  That is rather difficult.  Deputy Dowling suggested that personnel coming into the service should be able to attain high rank at an early age.  This is quite difficult because the first thing you have to think about is that our Army is based on the assumption that in time of terrible trouble such as the 1939-1945 war the standing Army of a little over 12,000 could be increased, as it was increased at that time, to over 42,000. That meant that you have to have within the Army a very high degree of officer ability, that you require more technical people than you would need if you felt that your Army would never be more than 12,000.  Then there is the question of recruitment.  Every year I am advised on the number of cadets that there should be.  The advice I get is based on the prospects in future.  So that if one were to go absolutely mad and for five years take in 50 cadets too many, in about 12 years' time you would have wrecked the career structure of the officer corps.  We are very limited in what we can do.  I can help Deputy Dowling by telling him the average age for promotion from lieutenant to captain is 25-26 years and the average age for promotion from captain to commandant is 41-42 years.  However, the expected age&mdash;based on what has been done and is being done&mdash;is 38-39 years.  From commandant to lieutenant-colonel is 52 years but the expected age is 48-49 years.  The movement is generally in the way desired by Deputy Dowling, by myself and by Army personnel.  However, there is a limitation on what we can do and this is governed by what kind of Army we need.  If an enlargement of the Army were necessary, I am sure it would come from the people, as it did in 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a misapprehension in the Army with regard to the question of extension of service and it is thought <Col N="1002" /> it is blocking promotions.  The order I signed specifically said that no such extension would be given if it blocked promotion.  That is a fact.  The officers who are granted extensions of two years are held supernumerary to the establishment.  For example if the establishment is four lieutenants-colonel and there is a fifth serving he is supernumerary.  If one of the four lieutenants-colonel retires there is a promotion.  Each case is looked at carefully by the military and by the secretariat and there is no question of anyone being impeded in his promotion because of an extension.  Men may be impeded because there are too many people before them but that is something about which I can do nothing.  When a man gets a commission he has the right to serve to retirement age, given good health and good conduct.  Our reason for allowing officers to remain supernumerary in administrative posts is that we need them at the moment.  We can release more active officers who have not reached retirement age for work on the Border and for all the efforts the Army have to make at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that such extensions do not interfere with the promotion prospects of lower ranking officers.  A matter arose recently regarding extension of service.  Each officer and man in the Army is entitled to 122 days extension of service, or less if that is sufficient, so that he may get an increase under the national pay agreement which would affect his pension or gratuity.  This was done recently in respect of one officer and it will happen in the case of other officers also.  Some of them will need 87 days and some 65 days and they get them as of right.  One officer got the first slice of the national wage agreement applied to his pension and gratuity and another officer who got this extension recently got two slices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowling seemed to be under the impression that a 5 per cent increase to captains and commandants is being withheld for no good reason. Proposals for the revision of pay of officers up to and including the rank of commandant are under consideration but a decision has not been reached.

If the Deputy wants to go round the Army and meet serving men and serving officers and have long chats with them he can do so and when he comes back he will be entitled to his 27 inches&mdash;like myself he is too broad for it now&mdash;and his grouse.  If the Deputy wants to go through the Army <Col N="1005" /> reglations, look at every salary there is, look at every right there is, he will find anomalies because they are different from other regulations.  If you want to leapfrog you can.  If you want to say a fellow is entitled to something you can and then another fellow says: &ldquo;I am entitled to one step more&rdquo;. If you keep on at that you will end up where this country seems to be very quickly bringing itself.</P>

      <P>The Deputy went on a fair trot around the Army.</P>
      <P>The question of the structure of the FCA was mentioned.  The FCA do need a very hard look at present. That is not something that can be done in a month but it is being done. One of the great problems is the fall-out of first year recruits.  Deputy Nolan raised the point of boys having completed their intermediate or group certificate courses being recruited to the FCA to undertake whole-time training between the months of June and September, the object being to build up a first class reserve force with attendant benefits for the boys in relation to discipline, hygiene and comradeship.</P>
      <P>This suggestion has been made many times but there are a couple of things to consider.  One is that you probably would have to go under the age limit.  Deputy Bermingham said that if there is a fellow of 15½ and he looks as if he is 21 he should be let in.  There are very serious responsibilities here.  Say, for instance, that boy, as has happened in the last year or so, accidentally shot a comrade. You cannot loosen this up.  One can argue about what is the right age, the right period for basic training and under whom he should serve.  These are all Army regulations but if these were loosened up we might have the situation in which we would have boys with guns.  We cannot have that.</P>

    <P>Mention was made of An Slua Muirí.  An Slua Muirí I agree has not got the boats I would like it to have but Rome was not built in a day and I would not like to say that An Slua Muirí will always be in that position. Members of An Slua Muirí do go on training courses.  An Slua Muirí used to be defined as Seaward Defence and in ports and harbours they were to be observers during a time of national emergency.  Deputy Coughlan suggested that perhaps they could be used for pursuing poachers and so on. I do not think it is possible to have people in An Slua Muirí with the competence to control boats such as the <i>Deirdre, Gráinne,</i> the <i>Fola,</i> which are the sort of boats we must have in our sea conditions to control poaching. Therefore, the concept of An Slua <Col N="1007" /> Muirí as observers of persons and matters at ports and harbours must stay.  The strength of An Slua Muirí in Limerick city has increased by 25 per cent over the past four years.</P>
    <P>In addition to the training carried out on one night per week An Slua Muirí personnel are encouraged to undergo annual training for a few weeks in Cork harbour where Naval Service facilities are made available to them, including professional instruction on naval vessels where possible.  They are also encouraged to participate in organised week-end training on frequent occasions during the year.  Further, An Slua Muirí personnel are encouraged to undergo courses of instruction for two or three weeks at the naval base which, when practicable, includes some seagoing in naval vessels.  While steps have been taken towards procuring a sea-going vessel for An Slua Muirí, the suggestion to use An Slua Muirí in special vessels for fishery protection duties is considered impracticable.  I also consider it impracticable.</P>
    <P>I would like to add to what I have just said that there is another opportunity open to members of An Slua Muirí, a limited opportunity for about two years and then a much more unlimited opportunity.  I would suggest that members of An Slua Muirí should write to me or to Captain Eric Healy and put their names down for courses of training on the new sail-training boat <i>Creidne.</i>  They would get a very good hearing to get on to this boat. It is nearly booked up for the summer.  People between 16 and 21 are going on ten-day and week-end courses and I would suggest that personnel of An Slua Muirí should do that too.  I hope that when the new sail-training vessel, which will have 25 places, is built it will be possible for members of the ordinary PDF and An Slua Muirí, to get training on courses say for a fortnight on this vessel.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are working towards a sea-going experience for members of An Slua Muirí if not a sea-going capability and I would suggest that people in An Slua Muirí might take <Col N="1008" /> this as advice and write to the Department of Defence or to the skipper of <i>Creidne</i> and see if they can get on those sea-going ten-day courses.  If that does not make them a little bit better sailors I do not know what will.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan said that special concessions should be given to members of the FCA in relation to cadetships. There were 63 on this occasion so it is just a stock description.  The regulation reads:</P>
    <P>Not more than 20 of the 63 cadetships to be awarded may be reserved for (a) men of the Permanent Defence Force who were on full-time service on 21st of December, 1973, and who continue so to serve up to the date of commencement of interviews by the final interview board; and (b) members of An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí</P>
    <P> (i)  who have been on the effective strength of their units from 21st June, 1973, and who continued to remain on such effective strength up to the date of commencement of interviews by the final interview board, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  who have completed a course of training or instruction of at least seven days' duration as prescribed in paragraph 39 of the Defence Force Regulations R5 or in paragraph 45 of the Defence Force Regulation R6. </P>
    <P>Then there were cadetships reserved for potential members of the Army Equitation School.  The regulation reads:</P>
    <P>Not more than three of the 63 cadetships to be offered may be reserved for candidates who are experienced horsemen particularly in regard to jumping and are likely to qualify as members of the Army Equitation School.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is preference or if not preference, an opportunity for members of the FCA to get into the Army as officers through cadetships.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern talked about Border allowances and waxed eloquent on the question of Garda overtime.  In relation to allowances for Border duties and for security duties generally, let <Col N="1009" /> me say first that I do not regard any such allowance as straight payment for extra responsibility or extra hours of duty.  I regard them entirely as a small appreciation of the services rendered by these men.  I do not know how it could be possible to have overtime in respect of Army personnel. Rates of pay and other conditions can be examined with a view to improving the situation but I cannot see how there could be overtime paid. The fact remains that army life is different from life in other spheres. For example, this difference is epitomised in regard to army pensions, which could not be on the same basis as, say, civil service pensions. A garda qualifies for a pension after 30 years' service but if he continues serving for another ten years, there will be no addition to his pension as a result of the extra service.  A civil servant qualifies for a pension after 40 years' service but if he serves for another five years, there will be no addition to the pension to which he was entitled after the 40 years.  The Army situation is very different. Various officers retire at different ages.  They cannot be compared with gardaí or other public servants, but that is not to say that their situation is either worse or better than that of those people.</P>
    <P>A soldier is on call for 24 hours of each day, for seven days a week. That is pointed out to potential recruits during their first briefings.  A garda, for example, finishes his stint of duty and goes home.  The only domestic facility in his station may be an electric kettle, whereas the soldier may be living in the barracks, or, if he is married, he has an extra allowance. I am not saying that these conditions are equivalent to overtime.  I am merely emphasising that they are different and, consequently, not comparable.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting, either, that the Border duty allowance is generous. For a married officer, it is £1.35 per day, for a single officer, £1.20 per day, for a married soldier £1.15 per day and for a single soldier £1.05 per day.  The reason why a security duty man, regardless of rank, gets £1.50 <Col N="1010" /> a day is because he would not be on security duties every day.  If, say, he were attached to Collins's Barracks and was sent to guard a vital installation, he might not be on that duty the next day, whereas if he were sent to some such place as Dundalk or Finner for three weeks, he would have the allowance for every day of that time although, it has been suggested, he might be dancing in Bundoran while on a 24-hour call.  More luck to him for that, but that is the difference between security and Border duties.  However, the allowance is nothing more than an appreciation of the security duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Could there not be special active service pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>A rose by any other name.  The rates of pay in the Army are good.  The conditions too, are good and improving.  The Army is being regarded as a very important feature of this country and something we could not do without at this time. It is appreciated by the Government and will be dealt with properly by us.</P>
      <P>An ordinary recruit has, on joining the Army, a weekly pay of £29.17, for a three-star private with three to six years' service, it is £32.15; for a sergeant with three to six years' service, the figure is £38.39 and for those with six to nine years' service it is £38.87 while a company sergeant with from nine to 12 years' service gets £43.63; and a sergeant major with from 12 to 15 years' service gets £51.93.  In addition there are rations and accommodation in all cases. The respective figures for married personnel are £35.98, £38.96, £42.61, £45.68, £50.44 and £58.74.  These wages are not bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out also that the commitment of the man in the Army is different from that of a garda.  The garda enlists on the basis that he will serve until he is 63, Of course, there is some fall-off for personal and other reasons, but the soldier's commitment is for three years initially after which he commits <Col N="1011" /> himself to another six years and so on.  He may serve for 31 years. The commitment, the life and the recompense in cash and kind are not comparable with those of the gardaí. In this context the idea of leapfrogging should be got out of people's minds, especially out of the mind of Deputy Davern.  What we want to do for the Army is to give a fair deal to every member, from the recruit right along the line to the Chief-of-Staff, but let us compare only like with like.  I shall talk to Deputies if they say to me that, for instance, privates are not adequately paid during their first 16 weeks, but let us not try to compare people whose conditions are very different.  This would not be good for the morale of the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>As an acknowledgement of our appreciation of these men, the allowances can be considered to be fair but they will be reviewed regularly.  I shall put forward a case for increasing them at any time that I consider an increase to be appropriate.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to a certain escort.  As I have pointed out these decisions are military ones.  I think I know the occasion that Deputy Davern was referring to.  I do not know why, even if it only happens once in four months or so, a garda car follows my car, but it happens.  I can tell the Deputies what security costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>For some reason it happens.  I can tell the House what security costs and what this sort of thing costs.  The cost is enormous.  The decisions on these things are not ours. If on information the chief superintendent of a district and the officer commanding the Army in that district decide that there should be a very strong escort, that there should be an absolute certainty that there will not be a mistake, that is a military decision <Col N="1012" /> and a Garda decision which we in this House should not question.  I do not think that the Army officers or the Garda officers are deliberately throwing around people's money.  There are occasions when these things are extremely modest.  There are also occasions when they are not modest. I have seen this myself.  In my opinion criticism of that kind should not be made.</P>

      <P>That is the Deputy's opinion.  Perhaps he is a military genius like Moshe Dayan.  As I say, it is a military decision.  I will have the complaint about Kickham Barracks investigated.  I am sorry if there is any deficiency there in the men's canteen. In the places I visit the men's canteens seem to be constantly improving.  Rome was not built in a day.  Perhaps the Deputy is right and I will certainly have his complaint examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I told the House that a study is being made of the FCA.  We instituted <Col N="1013" /> an NCO's course for officers this year. I hope that from that we will get 20 officers who were NCO's.  In your officer corps you must have different capabilities.  I have heard criticism of the fact that we have places for 120 officers and cadets to go to Galway University and take their degrees.  I was amazed at this.  It was on the basis that we were overdoing it to some extent and that the officers were getting everything and the men were getting nothing.  I instituted this NCO's course.  There had not been one for five years.</P>
    <P>I examined what was said to me and what was given to me to read, and a decision had to be made as to what the requirements would be within the officer corps.  There is always the fact that we may have to bring the Army up to a much larger figure.  Therefore we must have the engineers and we must have the various people who do their university courses.  We must also have the people who have done their command and staff courses on the military side.  We must also have the people who have gone abroad and taken military courses.  Within the officer corps we must have a very high degree of professional capability.</P>
    <P>The secretary of my Department and I saw a full-page advertisement in <i>The Times</i> some time ago and we were gratified to find that they were boasting of a percentage of officers with degrees which was far lower than ours and that we were at a much higher level as far as the training of our officers was concerned.  Somebody smiled when Deputy Taylor mentioned this.  Deputy Taylor has been in the FCA for a long time and he knows the Army very well.  So far as we can discover from facts and figures Deputy Taylor was right.  It is easier to do this with a small army than with a big army.</P>
    <P>I hope we will get 20 good officers from this NCOs' course and I hope we will see them going on to officers' courses.  If I am Minister for Defence in the years to come, the limitation on me is that I must always think not only of the men but of the degree of ability and skills and acquired skills in the officers' corps.  At the moment <Col N="1014" /> that is confined to about 1,150 men. If you make it 1,300 men or 1,400 men you destroy your career structure and chances of promotion.  Therefore, you must know your statistics and then you can say: &ldquo;Now we can have 20 more NCOs taking courses to become officers.&rdquo;  I would hope that we would get 20 next year and 20 the following year, but I must be guided by the requirements of the Army in time to come.  When I am gone another person will have to face up to these responsibilities, perhaps in worse times than we face now.</P>
    <P>Take for instance such people as bomb disposal experts.  We have people in the Army who have defused tens of bombs.  I do not want to give an exact figure.  I think one gentleman defused 50 bombs.  That is a skill.  A year-and-a-half ago our problem was not the provision of equipment for these officers but getting the officers themselves.  You cannot send in a person who is not skilled, and who has not done his courses, and who has not gone through very exacting training, to defuse a live bomb.  An officer went with Inspector Donegan&mdash;no relation of mine but a namesake&mdash;to defuse a bomb in Cavan.  Inspector Donegan was blown to bits and the officer spent many months in hospital.  I think the greatest tragedy we ever had in the Army was in the Glen of Imaal, but what I have just said shows that within the officer corps there must be people with the ability to do many things and do them well.  That means Army training and university training and it means great attention to duty and a high degree of vocation.  I hope the men who are now selected, or on the point of selection, for the NCOs' course for officers will be successful. In the years to come I should like to see them taking command and staff courses and taking the various courses which will provide them with the high degree of ability which is needed in the Army today.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a correction. I referred to the Arbour Hill ceremony in commemoration of the leaders who were executed in 1916. We kept that in acceptance of the <Col N="1015" /> fact that relatives and friends would like to be there.  That commemoration was not on Sunday as I said.  It is on Wednesday, May 7th.</P>
    <P>The question of the promotion of a lieutenant was raised by Deputy Dowling.  I promoted that lieutenant because I thought it was in the general interests of the FCA that he should be given a higher rank.  At the time, quite frankly, I did not know anything about establishment.  I knew the gentleman personally.  I want to make that quite clear to the House.  He was recommended to me for promotion by the Chief of Staff and I signed the promotion.  I did not know he was in the FCA until I met him at an FCA commissioning ceremony in Collins Barracks.  Some weeks or months later Deputy Meaney drew to my attention&mdash;as had the Minister for Transport and Power&mdash; that this man had been assigned to Cork and was blocking a promotion. I immediately took the matter up with the military authorities and I found that he was not, in fact, blocking a promotion because no recommendation had been made in respect of the FCA man or men who might be promoted.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out here that the manner of promotion of FCA personnel is governed by certain qualifications they must possess; they must have served a certain number of years in the rank of lieutenant, captain or whatever it is; they must have attended courses every summer during a certain number of years and they must have been a certain number of years in various ranks.  It may have been that the individual who, it was suggested, was blocked had not acquired these various essential qualifications before he would be eligible for promotion.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will establish a scheme for vocational rehabilitation to restore the employment potential of disabled persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Vocational rehabilitation services are already available in this country under the aegis of health boards and a range of voluntary organisations.  These services include training for open employment, occupational therapy, industrial therapy and sheltered employment.</P>
      <P>Some of the services concerned are provided by health boards in conjunction with their psychiatric services; others are provided in association with centres for the mentally handicapped, while some are provided by voluntary organisations, such as the Rehabilitation Institute.</P>
      <P>I indicated last year that there was a need to develop these services further and also to create a situation in which development could take place on a planned basis in the future.  I set up a working party of experts to advise me in the matter.</P>
      <P>Last January I accepted in principle the working party's recommendations. I have already taken steps to begin to implement their findings.  In this regard, a special training course for instructors of the handicapped has been initiated by AnCO and the Board of the National Rehabilitation Board has been strengthened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present discussions are taking place between the National Rehabilitation <Col N="1019" /> Board and officials of my Department with a view to improving the board's present staffing structure.  This is a prerequisite to further development in the field of training the handicapped, since the National Rehabilitation Board will pay a major role in developing these services in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down this question to the Minister for Defence because it related to Army personnel. I felt the Army had a responsibility in relation to occupational disablement in the case of personnel who suffered disabilities of one type or another and who were retained in the service of the Army and wanted to ensure that, when they left the Army, they would not be on the labour market at the end of the queue and I was asking the Minister for Defence if he had in mind the establishment of a scheme of vocational rehabilitation in the services.</P>

      <P>With all due respect, there was no mention of the Army in the question.  I want to be quite frank with the Deputy.  Like him, I believe that those services should be developed. The National Rehabilitation Board operate a placement service which helps to get employment for the handicapped with suitable training for those who need it.

      <P>On his insurance record under the insurance number given by the person concerned on his claim for retirement pension he did not satisfy the contribution condition for pension which requires a claimant to have entered insurance before reaching age 55.  As a result of information received from him on 21st April in response to an inquiry by my Department, an earlier insurance record, under another number, which serves to qualify him for pension, has since been traced.  He has been awarded pension at the rate of £19.40 a week from 6th February, 1975 increased to £23.85 a week from 3rd April, 1975.  Appropriate pension books were issued to him on 25th April, 1975.</P>

The delay was due to the fact that particulars of the claimant's county council pension required by the social welfare officer were not received until 24th April, 1975.</P>

      <P>There has in the meantime been a further decision increasing his means with effect from 9th April, 1975, which will result in a further reduction in the rate of assistance payable. He has been advised of his right to appeal against this decision if he is dissatisfied.</P>

      <P>Some of the wide range of social security schemes administered by my Department apply only to women, others extend to men and women on an equal basis and in other instances men and women are treated differently.</P>
      <P>In the case of disability benefit, invalidity pension, unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance a single man or a widower may be paid a housekeeper's allowance if he has a dependent child and is wholly or mainly maintaining a woman to take care of the child.  This allowance is not yet payable to single women or widows.</P>
      <P>A married woman claimant who is being wholly or mainly maintained by her husband is paid unemployment benefit, disability benefit and invalidity pension at a rate lower than that payable to a single man or a single woman.  The duration of unemployment benefit for such a married woman is limited to 156 days as compared to the 312 days duration applying to single women and men between 18 and 65 years of age.</P>
      <P>In the case of unemployment assistance, there are qualifying conditions applying to women applicants which do not apply to men.  A single woman or a widow must either have a dependant or 52 employment contributions in the four contribution years preceding that in which unemployment assistance is claimed.  A married woman applicant must not be dependent on her husband and must have at least one dependant.</P>

    <P>I am conscious of the need to eliminate all instances of what might be <Col N="1033" /> regarded as discrimination against women in my Department's schemes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Parliamentary Secretary like those of us on this side of the House is conscious of the discrimination and the anomalies which exist in the social welfare code as applied to women.

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, in the Report on the Status of Women there were 15 recommendations made regarding the administration of social welfare benefits.  Of those 15 recommendations, eight have been fully implemented; three have been partially implemented; three are under examination.  One, in fact, was not implemented because the effect of implementing it would have worsened the position of women.  I think the Deputy will agree that considerable progress has been made in two years in eradicating a very large number of anomalies which had existed over a long period of years.  In fact, I am glad to say that recognition for the progress that has been made in this area was expressed by Dr. Thekla Beere and we are hoping, as I said in the reply, to eliminate all discrimination in full where it does exist, and the remaining recommendations which have not yet been dealt with are under examination.</P>

I wonder would the Parliamentary Secretary, for the benefit of myself and the House generally, place on the record of the House the 15 areas of recommendations which were made by the Commission. <Col N="1034" /> The Parliamentary Secretary has told the House that eight of the recommendations have been dealt with fully, a number have been partially dealt with and some remain to be dealt with.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in common with a number of his comrades or brothers in Government, thinks that if the public are told something often enough and long enough they will believe it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In October last I announced that the existing development sections in the Department of Social Welfare had been combined and reorganised as a new research and development branch.  The staff in the branch comprises 16 officers all of whom are permanent civil servants. These officers have so far been engaged mainly on work in connection with the revision of the home assistance scheme and the preparation of a Green Paper on a national incomerelated pension scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition, the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty established in May, 1974, have announced that they will implement four pilot schemes, two of which are directly related to the question of improving the social welfare services.  These two projects are a welfare rights project and a home assistance project.  The committee's authorised staffing establishment consists at present of 19 persons, which includes five management personnel, eight research officers and six administrative support staff.  The majority of the research officers being recruited will have a Master's degree in the social sciences.</P>

      <P>I am hopeful the discussion document on pay-related benefits and social security cover for the self-employed will be available later this year.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the National Committee to Combat Poverty have designed four schemes and I mentioned two of them because they were directly relevant to the Deputy's question.  Three of the schemes were submitted to the EEC and have been favourably received by the Commissioner responsible, Dr. Hillery.  The schemes will go ahead irrespective of whether they <Col N="1037" /> are passed at ministerial council level by the EEC.  We are hopeful that the commission's recommendations on their implementation will be approved at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers which I understand is due to take place in June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That sounds like a reasonable complement.  I assume it compares favourably with the research and development branches in other Departments, in size and status.  The Parliamentary Secretary may recall that shortly after he took office I asked some questions about a fundamental review of the work and operation of our social welfare system as a whole and I expressed some misgivings about whether the Parliamentary Secretary had the staff at his disposal to carry out such a fundamental review. Is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that the research and development branch are capable of carrying out that fundamental review or will they merely be a section that will <Col N="1038" /> deal with specific issues the Parliamentary Secretary may refer to them, such as the pension scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  When the Government took over quite frankly I was horrified to find that not one penny was available to the Department of Social Welfare to carry out any kind of research.  The Deputy has on previous occasions indicated his desire for and his recognition of the necessity for such research.  We have managed to get an allocation now for the Department to engage in research and as I indicated the National Committee to Combat Poverty will also be engaged in a type of action research which can be very beneficial to the Department as a whole and need not necessarily be used solely in the single area but can be used as a guide to the future development of the services as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that there are now 16 head of staff allocated to research and development.  Does this mean that the total staff of his Department has been augmented by that 16 head or is it simply that those 16 people have been taken from some other work in the Department and labelled a research and development section?  Have an additional 16 persons been added to the complement of the staff of the Department to carry out this work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to mislead the Deputy.  There has undoubtedly been some addition to the staff in Social Welfare over the last two years.  I would not like to suggest that the 16 people are new recruits. The Deputy will appreciate that in any organisation with a staff of approximately 3,000 if one examines it closely one can find that people can possibly be utilised on work other than that on which they are engaged. Not only are those 16 people engaged on this work but, if it is found necessary, it is now possible, due to the allocation of funds for research which were not previously available, to engage outside assistance in the form of properly qualified specialists in a <Col N="1039" /> particular area to assist in this form of research.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Army Pensions Acts make provision for hospital and medical treatment in the case of persons who are in receipt of temporary awards of disability pension.  Such treatment is afforded, on the recommendation of the Army Pensions Board, with a view to containing, reducing or finalising the pensionable degree of disablement arising out of service.  The Army Pensions Acts make no provision for hospital or medical treatment in any other cases.  Soldiers on discharge from the Permanent Defence Force are, however, as insured persons, eligible for normal health services under the Health Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a general rule in other countries that military hospitals are available to personnel for the <Col N="1052" /> treatment of chronic diseases contracted during service.  Bearing in mind that our military hospitals would have the case history and that there is a responsibility on the Defence Forces to ensure the continuity of proper treatment, would the Minister not consider making available to the personnel I mentioned in the question the facilities of these hospitals? It would be better if such treatment were given in the military hospital where the individual originally went for treatment rather than his being identified on leaving the Army as a digit on a medical card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Army Pensions Act there is no entitlement to medical or hospital treatment.  A person who is in receipt of a temporary award of pension may, as a condition of his continuance, be required to undergo such treatment with a view to containing, reducing or finalising the pensionable degree of disablement. That is provided.  These factors do not exist in the case of final awards and, consequently, a pensioner whose award is final is expressly excluded from treatment under the Acts.  Treatment for temporary pensioners is normally provided on the recommendation of the Army Pensions Board.  In other words, the Army Pensions Board, not the Minister for Defence or the Government, decide that a person who is in receipt of a temporary award of pension shall receive treatment.  At the end of this treatment it is decided whether or not the person has recovered or whether there is permanent disability.  If there is a permanent disability, then it is a question of money.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned about the Army Pensions Board.  I am concerned about the continuity of treatment in a service that has a responsibility to its personnel.  The case history of the people I am referring to is with the military hospitals and I should like to know if the Minister will consider, where occupational diseases such as skin cancer are contracted during service in the Congo and elsewhere, giving such <Col N="1053" /> personnel treatment in military hospitals? In most cases these people would have been undergoing treatment for a long period in our military hospitals.  Would the Minister consider, after such personnel have been discharged, giving them this treatment because the hospitals concerned have their case history?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I consider that it is extremely fair and proper that the Army Pension Board, which is a completely independent authority, should decide whether or not a disability is permanent in the first instance. If the board decides that disability is temporary, treatment is provided, and having provided treatment a decision is made as to whether or not the temporary treatment has not either brought an improvement in the person's condition, got rid of the trouble entirely or whether it will be a permanent disability.  If there is to be a permanent disability, that same Army Pensions Board, not the Minister, the Government or anybody political, decides what the final award is to be by way of pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In October, 1967, the then Minister for Defence directed <Col N="1055" /> that an examination should be made in consultation with the Department of Local Government of the possibility of working out an arrangement whereby Army drivers by virtue of their having passed the Army driving test would be exempt from the requirement of having to undergo the driving test conducted by that Department. Arising out of this direction, a proposal was put to the Department of Local Government in December, 1967, that Army drivers or ex-Army drivers who have passed the Army driving test should be exempt from having to undergo the civilian test to obtain a licence to drive privately-owned vehicles of the classes in respect of which they had passed the Army driving test.  The matter was subsequently discussed between representatives of this Department and the Department of Local Government. The latter stated that when the driving tests were being introduced their Minister decided that there would be no exemption granted from the tests to any category.  They said this was decided in order to ensure that there would be only one standard, the standard laid down by the Department of Local Government.  Various bodies, apart from the Army, have their own instruction and testing arrangements, such as the Post Office, CIE and Messrs Guinness, and if an exception were made in one case it would, it was felt, open the door to application for similar concessions in other cases. Furthermore, if an exception were to be made, the Department of Local Government would have to take power to examine the testing procedures involved and keep them under constant surveillance to ensure that the required standards applied and were maintained.  That was the position in 1967.  I have now taken this matter up again with the Minister for Local Government and it is being re-examined.</P>

I immediately asked him to do what he could to remove any doubt there might be and he removed the officer from the Cork establishment as supernumerary to Dublin.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was dealt with at length by the Minister for Defence of the day, the late Deputy Oscar Traynor, during the proceedings of the Special Committee on the Defence Bill.  The Minister stated that the matter was so important he submitted it for examination to a committee of three lawyers&mdash;one nominated by the Attorney General, a second by the Minister for Justice and the third by himself&mdash;and that they had advised him that a system of appeal from conviction by court martial was neither necessary nor desirable.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the extensive procedure being provided for the fullest consideration of charges against a soldier and the different steps by which, at every stage, mis-carriages of justice were guarded against.  In particular, he mentioned that under the provisions of the Bill the findings and sentence of a court martial are not valid until confirmed by a confirming authority; a superior authority may, after a sentence has actually been confirmed, mitigate or remit the punishment or substitute a proper or a lesser punishment; certain sentences may also be suspended and eventually the punishment remitted; the Minister has power to quash the findings and sentence of a court martial where it appears to him that the proceedings were illegal or the accused was wrongfully convicted; the Minister may also direct a retrial; provision is made for the presentation of petitions by or on behalf of persons sentenced by court martial; the Minister gets the advice of the Attorney General as to any action which may be taken by him.  The procedure regarding the presentation of petitions has worked well over the years.</P>

      <P>While I have no immediate plans to increase the local authority house purchase loan limit of £4,500, I am keeping the matter under continuing review.  In the case referred to by the Deputy, the figure of £6,000 represents the maximum net amount, after deduction of the appropriate deposit, to be paid to Dublin Corporation by persons who qualify by means of a public draw to purchase houses specially built by the corporation for sale to tenants of corporation dwellings or persons on the approved housing list and others whose present accommodation is unsuitable or inadequate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government why the Northern Committee of Cork County Council has not been permitted to proceed with the erection of new houses in Ballyhooly, Ballindangan and Doneraile, for which tenders have already been accepted, until a further submission on them has been furnished to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that Cork (North) County Council are unable to proceed with the erection of new houses at these locations.  On the contrary, I have told the council that I am concerned that work which is ready to be started should not be held up unnecessarily.  The Deputy may have in mind a circular which issued to housing authorities on 14th March, 1975, following the announcement by the Government that steps were being <Col N="1064" /> taken to make an additional £7 million available for the local authority housing construction programme in 1975, for which £51 million had already been provided.  The circular expressed my concern that work which cannot be financed out of the expenditure already authorised should not be held up unnecessarily; stated that, pending finalisation later in the year of revised allocations from the extra capital made available, local authorities should, where necessary, submit special requests for the authorisation of new work when it is ready to be started; and promised appropriate interim adjustments of the original allocation to allow work on the new schemes to proceed.</P>
      <P>I have not since received any such special request from Cork (North) County Council for authorisation to start the schemes referred to by the Deputy.  A general request for an additional allocation of £200,000 was made by the council on the same day that the circular letter issued.  This request made no reference to specific schemes.  Arrangements have been made for officers of my Department to visit the housing authority shortly to examine this claim with the council's officials.</P>

In January, 1974, Dublin Corporation adopted a recommendation to redress the imbalance created by the people who left the city centre and for that reason they are now going ahead with plans to try to get the first of them started.  The Deputy can be assured that I am as anxious as he is to see proper dwellings in the centre of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The High Court action Deputy Crinion was talking about dealt with the payment of one-third of the purchase price which Fianna Fáil insisted on being paid by a tenant who was selling a local authority house.  This is a different matter altogether.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that Deputy Molloy's question is intended to refer to the 1975 capital allocation for the local authority housing construction programmes. As regards the capital allocation for house purchase loans and supplementary grants, initial allocations were made to each local authority on 21st February, 1975, in respect of the six-month period ending on 30th June, 1975.  A supplementary allocation will be made in respect of the six-month period to 31st December, 1975, later in the year.</P>
      <P>As the reply to the remainder of the questions is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have it circulated with the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has not got the point.  I said an initial allocation up to 30th June was made available and that there will be a further allocation made from 30th June to 31st December.  Therefore, it makes no difference what the discrepancy is between the allocation and the amount requested because, until the second allocation is made, councils will not be aware whether or not there is a deficiency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not preferable that local authorities would be informed at the beginning of the year of their allocation for the whole year so that they could plan accordingly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because as the Deputy is aware, changing costs make it somewhat difficult to decide what will be the exact amount of money required.  Therefore, it is a much fairer way to estimate for six months and then for a further six months. At least it gives local authorities a better chance of knowing the amount they require and the amount they they will be able to spend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in repeating something if the Deputy does not want to understand it.  I have already said on a number of occasions in this House that local authorities have been instructed to plan a programme <Col N="1077" /> of housing, to proceed with any plans they had and that the necessary money would be made available. I have repeated that now for the umpteenth time.  There is no question whatever of a local authority not being able to get the money they require.  As a matter of fact, the local authority about which the Deputy speaks in my opinion will not be able to spend the money they will get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Two questions were taken together.  Can the Minister explain why the allocation to Galway County Council was cut down to £440,000, whereas they requested £938,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would need to put down a specific question on that account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be £880,000 for a whole year, without talking about the additional £7 million.  If the Deputy takes that into account he will find probably that Galway County Council are coming fairly well out of it and there is another aspect of it if Deputy Molloy would like to put down a separate question about that I shall take great pleasure in answering it next week and giving him the fullest details.</P>

      <P>Question No. 45.  The Deputy asked for one supplementary and he was allowed one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to get some satisfaction in the matter and to clarify the points that have been discussed perhaps the Chair would allow me ask one further supplementary?  Is the Minister aware that the deputy county manager informed the housing committee of Galway County Council that the capital allocation for 1975 was £440,000, that the council had in fact requested £938,000, and that the council's housing programme for 1975 has been seriously interferred with because of this decision?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 83 of the 13th February, 1975, a formal agreement between the National Building Agency and the EEC Commission is required to secure the release of the loan funds already approved in principle.  Normally this agreement is drawn up by the Commission, but to expedite matters the agency undertook the drafting of the agreement for submission to the Commission for approval.  I understand that the agency expect to have the draft agreement, which by its nature is a legal and complex matter, finalised at an early date.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply and what might be called a serial story at this stage, is the Minister aware that a group of <Col N="1080" /> people in Irish Steel Holdings in Haulbowline have been messed around by his Department and by the Department of Finance for two years while we are told legal details are being sorted out in order to give them what is rightly theirs under EEC regulations?

      <P>The position is that I met some of these people last week-end and they did not make the complaint made by the Deputy.  They said they were disappointed that they had not got their money before now and I am also disappointed about it.  However, it is only fair to the NBA and to them to point out that the regulations are that the EEC draw up the agreements.  We did everything we could to get them to draw up the agreements but we did not succeed because they said they were over-worked. We then agreed the NBA would do so and we are now trying to get agreement on the final text of the document with the EEC.  As soon as that matter is cleared, which I hope will be in the next few weeks, payments will be made.  It is untrue to say the NBA or the Government have been dragging their feet.  They have been doing everything they could to get the matter cleared.</P>

I am also aware it was not unusual to have them out for very much longer.  I have taken steps to ensure that they come in more quickly.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the number of persons employed in the building industry in April, 1975 and in April, 1973; if he regards this industry as being in a satisfactory condition; and if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics of employment in the private sector of the building and construction industry are published on a monthly basis by the Central Statistics Office.  The latest figures available relate to March, 1975, and show that the number of persons then employed was 57,273. <Col N="1084" /> The corresponding figure for March, 1973, was 60,436.  Figures of the number of persons employed in the public sector of the industry are not available.</P>
      <P>The overall position is that the industry is bearing up well notwithstanding the present world-wide economic difficulties.  The industry has benefited from the positive steps taken by the Government to maintain employment.  In the nine-month period April to December, 1974, a total of £189 million, equivalent to about £240 million in a full year, was provided in the public capital programme to generate work for the industry and, in 1975, the corresponding provision was increased to over £300 million.</P>
      <P>In particular, the housing programme, which accounts for approximately 40 per cent of the overall output of the building industry, has been given substantial financial support. The 1975 public capital programme includes over £100 million for housing in the current year, which is more than double the amount of £46.2 million provided in 1972-73.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the subsidy for building societies, introduced by the Government in May, 1973, to encourage a higher level of savings with the societies, has had the desired effect of attracting additional funds for investment in housing.</P>

People in the house building industry, and particularly their representative organisation, the Construction Industry Federation, have continuously denied the claim that the Minister has made that these figures relate to housing output in the previous year.

Deputy Haughey has not got the same weakness and he should be able to understand that if the figures given do not include the persons employed in the public sector of the industry and since the public sector has shown a remarkable increase in output what he has said is rather ridiculous. With regard to the question of the erection of houses and how they are counted, Deputy Molloy is aware that the statistics being used now and the method being used now are exactly the same as were used for 12 years by Fianna Fáil before I took office.  If they are wrong now they were wrong then but Fianna Fáil found nothing wrong with them.  I do not care how many times people like Deputy Molloy who cannot accept facts say that the houses were not built.  All anybody has to do is to go through the country and look at them.

      <P>I am informed by the National Building Agency that in <Col N="1087" /> calculating sale prices for a scheme of new houses provided for industrial workers, the agency take into account all items of prime cost&mdash;land, building, public lighting, landscaping, and so on &mdash;together with the amount necessary to meet the agency's overheads in the design and administration of the scheme.

      <P>Will the Minister have a look at the prices now being asked by the NBA for houses constructed in Galway for industrial workers?  It is strongly believed that there is an effort on the part of the NBA to take a profit.  I would like him to satisfy himself that this is not so.  I have very strong suspicions that the allegation is correct but I would like the Minister to investigate it and have a calculation made by experts such as surveyors.  If he is satisfied with the result I will accept his word but I am afraid there has been an attempt to take a profit.</P>

It has been very successful indeed and we have a school for the children and they are going into factory employment.  What I am talking about here is the question of Walkinstown Avenue where the corporation set up barriers on the unregistered and non-recognised site, without any facilities, which they are now inhabiting.  The barriers have been broken down.  I believe the State should take authority to deal with these matters rather than having what seems to be a loose application of justice by the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Errill scheme has been with the Department since August, 1974 and the Portlaoise one for almost as long.  Therefore, is it not possible for the Minister to give a clearer indication as to when sanction might be given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Errill scheme was submitted first in June, 1969 but it was only in May, 1973 that Laois County Council informed the Department <Col N="1094" /> that tests carried out to determine the subsoil conditions indicated that the treatment proposed was not satisfactory.  In June, 1973 the council were requested to submit an estimate for an extended aerated method of treatment.  A revised proposal was submitted but the unit cost would be £920 per house.  We are attempting to find a more satisfactory way of dealing with those two matters.  I should be glad to be able to say that the matter could be dealt with but as of now it does not appear that the proposals are entirely satisfactory.  Perhaps if the Deputy puts down another question in about a month's time I shall have more information for him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is not the same but the estimated cost of the Portlaoise scheme is about £250,000. In view of the size of the scheme and of what is proposed it is not considered as being an entirely satisfactory one and that is why it is being given so much consideration.  That is why I suggest that the Deputy ask about the matter again in about a month's time when more consideration will have been given to the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I said to the deputation was that the scheme was a long and straggling one which included a village and a number of country areas, that it covers a much bigger area than that of any other sewerage scheme proposal before the Department.  I suggested that the whole scheme would not be considered as a high priority one either from the Kilkenny or from the national point of view.  I suggested that there is another way of dealing with the village end of it where houses have been built already and where other houses could be built.  I had expected somebody to come back to me with another proposal but this has not happened.  I am disposed favourably towards helping in regard to the upper end, that is where the village is and where more houses are to be built but I do not see any immediate chance of sanctioning a straggling scheme of more than two miles.  Also, there is an argument regarding the question of a river being affected by any such scheme.  If the county council came back to me with another proposal, I should be glad to deal with the portion of the scheme indicated but not with it in entirety.</P>

      <P>Kilmeedy is a village of 45 houses with a population of about 100 people.  The preliminary report in question proposes a sewerage scheme costing £50,000.  Many of the houses already have septic tanks.  While sewage disposal arrangements in the village do need improvement, the cost per house of the proposed scheme is very high.  The views of the county council are being invited and I will be prepared to consider the matter further in the light of their reply.</P>

The results of investigations carried out to date under this survey have been made available to local authorities. The results of a recent survey of lakes will be available shortly.  An Foras Forbartha have also carried out local water quality surveys at the request of individual local authorities and other bodies.  Local authorities also carry out limited water quality testing and I am encouraging them to expand their activities in this field.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to raise this question about the community school in Bagenalstown, or Muine Bheag, because of the importance of community schools.  I should also like to thank the Minister for being present.  Sometimes Ministers have a habit of sending in their Parliamentary Secretary.  I assume from his presence that the Minister realises how important this problem is.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that before a decision is made on a community school in an area, certain problems always arise with various religious orders, vocational education committees, and so on.  He is also aware that he got full co-operation from the nuns in the Presentation Convent, from the De la Salle Brothers, from the vocational education committee, from the teachers in the vocational school, and from the parents in the whole catchment area.  After consultation with the officials of the Minister's Department, they all agreed that the solution to the problem in Bagenalstown was a community school.  This problem was due to the fact that there was a growing population and the fact that the two existing religious schools were in need of replacement, the De la Salle Brothers' school and the Presentation Convent school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No site was available in the grounds of the Presentation Convent school or the De la Salle Brothers' school.  No site was available where the existing vocational school is.  An agreement had been reached with all the people concerned on a community school, and the people of Bagenalstown were amazed when, out of the blue one day, they discovered that the Department of Education had purchased a <Col N="1100" /> six-acre field half a mile away by road but a quarter of a mile away if you go through a housing estate, in through the back of the houses, down over a bank and into a field which is flooded at present.  The Minister will be getting by post shortly a photograph of portion of the field taken about two days ago.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate it if Deputy Governey would stop speaking to the Minister until I am finished.  It is important that the Minister should hear what I have to say.  Deputy Governey is a member of the county council and he knows that this field was ear-marked at one time for housing development. When Carlow County Council got technical advice and when the county council engineers examined the field, it was found that it was not suitable for housing development. This is where the crunch was.  This is where the whole thing broke down. Without consulting the teachers, the parents, the vocational education committee, the town commissioners, or anybody else, the Minister's Department decided to take this field which is 400 yards away from the existing vocational school and this is where the Minister proposes to build the community school.</P>
    <P>Last Tuesday, Deputy Wilson asked the Minister was he aware that there are only 2.4 acres in it.  The Minister replied that the suggestion by Deputy Wilson that there were 2.4 acres did not tally with his information and that the total area of the site was 4½ acres.  That is what you said in reply to Deputy Wilson last Tuesday.  If there were 4½ acres in the site it is still too small for a community school for 800 or 1,200 children.  I do not know where you got your information that the site is 4½ acres.  The existing site of the vocational school is approximately 1½ acres and the playing ground for Páirc Mhuire and Railway Road is 2 acres.  I presume somebody told you this was the property of the vocational school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be more appropriate if the Deputy made his remarks through the Chair rather than directly to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Those two acres are the property of Carlow County Council. This site is being used as a playground and an open space, which we all agree with, in a housing estate known as Páirc Mhuire.  Four years ago or more we wanted to extend the existing vocational school and build on two or three rooms.  We required half an acre and the county council in consultation with the vocational education committee said: &ldquo;We will give you half an acre but the Páirc Mhuire Tenants' Association said you must give us an undertaking that you will not sell any further portion of that site.&rdquo;  That is a guarantee given by the vocational education committee of which I am a member, a guarantee given by the county council of which I am a member, and a guarantee which Carlow County Council and the vocational education committee will stand over.</P>
      <P>Last Tuesday, in reply to Deputy Wilson, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>This, indeed, may be so but the net question is can I, as Minister for Education, preside over the abolition of £150,000 worth of a vocational school building?</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson said the figure was £75,000 and the Minister said it was £150,000.  I have a letter from the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee.  It is dated 22nd April, 1975.  This includes the original building and the extension.  It states that in round figures costs are as follows: Buildings including architects' fees and consultants' fees and expenses, £67,000; furniture and equipment, £8,500; total, £75,500. Therefore, Deputy Wilson's figure is correct and not the Minister's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might like to know what the vocational teachers and the religious orders think and what the people of the town think.  It is important to put this on the record.  It was resolved at a meeting of the vocational teachers that a majority were in favour of a community school for the area on educational grounds and that the buildings and all other facilities for a community school should be on one self-contained site of a minimum of 15 acres.  The <Col N="1102" /> religious teachers met and said they were in favour of a community school on educational grounds and that it was their professional opinion that the proposed site was unwise and the new school must be erected on a minimum of 15 acres.  They said that the emphasis by the Department on the cost difference between building a new school on its own site and extending the present vocational school with a new structure was grossly exaggerated. The exaggeration there refers to the Minister's £150,000.  I have confirmed Deputy Wilson's figure of £75,000 from the records of the Carlow Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    <P>It may be no harm to put on the record the decision of the people of Muine Bheag at the last public meeting they held.  It was held in Muine Bheag on 21st April, 1975.  It reads:</P>
    <P>The people of Bagenalstown have not changed their opinions with regard to the siting of the proposed community school, namely, as a people they refused to allow the school to be built on the Páirc Mhuire site for the following reasons:</P>
    <P> (a)  A site of some four acres to accommodate and facilitate the teachers and pupils of 800 enrolment with a possible number of 1,000 or 1,200 pupils in the foreseeable future, is an insult to the intelligence of parents, pupils and teachers.</P>
    <P>(b)  Such a site would deprive the residents of Páirc Mhuire of the green belt for that housing area and consequently of the life belt of their children at a very tender age, that is, primary school level.</P>
    <P>(c)  There would be no space left for future expansion of buildings and the school registers of Bagenalstown and its catchment area pre-suppose such an expansion.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>2.  The people reject unanimously the two proposals of the Minister as stated in his letters to Deputies Governey, Nolan and Pattison namely; that the community school should be built on Páirc Mhuire <Col N="1103" /> site or that at some point in time the Minister would consider a dual secondary school for Bagenalstown under the following conditions&mdash; that the local community buy the site and furniture and pay 30 per cent of the building cost.</P>
    <P>Thank you very much, Minister. Where are the people of Bagenalstown going to get such money?  The Minister can get the total amount of money from the World Bank to build a new community school on an ideal site available in the town.</P>
    <P>The document goes on:</P>
    <P>3.  That the Minister's duty for a democratic people is to come in person and see the impossible conditions under which pupils and teachers are working, then, being convinced of the injustice of the situation, that he takes a Ministerial, political, decision on the situation, overrides the ludicrous proposals of his Department officials and gives the people, pupils and teachers their basic rights of reasonable working conditions and facilities.</P>
    <P>4.  The people point out to the Minister that Mr. Ó Cearbhaill who represented him at the first meeting regarding the school last October and immediately after it, authorised the purchase of a £12,000 swamp as a playfield to cajole the residents of Páirc Mhuire, must now bear the consequences of his folly, face the fire and ire of Government auditors on public spending and be made to realise that the people of Bagenalstown will not be the pawns of Departmental lunacy.</P>
    <P>5.  It is the professional opinion of the post-primary teachers of the town and catchment area that the proposed site is absolutely unsuitable from every educational point of view.  They believe it is the right and duty of the parents, as parents, to object unanimously to the siting of the school in Páirc Mhuire.  To accept the school there would be an insult to ordinary <Col N="1104" /> common sense and a violation of the rights of pupils to a well-rounded and social development as an intrinsic part of their education.</P>
    <P>6.  The people have unanimously resolved to picket the Minister henceforth at all his public appearances until they get the community school on the proper site and without delay.</P>
    <P>7.  The people will use the media and all other sources of publicity to highlight the tyranny and contempt of the Department of Education with regard to parents, pupils and teachers.</P>
    <P>Those resolutions were passed at the meeting I referred to.  The people in that town are reasonable but if they are forced to picket the Minister they will do so.  The Minister should visit the town privately to see for himself the stupidity of the decision as to where this school should be sited.</P>
    <P>The Deputies for the constituency, the county councillors, the town commissioners, parents and teachers will not stand for this.  The Minister should realise that he only holds this office for the time being.  He should also remember that the officials will not be in that Department forever but the future of the area mentioned is in question.  I do not want to see 1,000 or 1,200 pupils going like the Charge of the Light Brigade moving from the proposed site through the housing scheme, over garden walls to a field which has been referred to as a swamp.  If my colleague from the constituency, Deputy Governey, wishes I will permit him to make a contribution in my remaining four minutes.</P>

In speaking on this matter at Question Time during the week I left no doubt in anyone's mind as to the stand I am taking.  The Minister is aware of my feelings and I am pleased that, at my request, he agreed to receive a deputation from the area.  There is little use in going into the details because Deputy Nolan has covered the ground very well.  I have not been inactive over the last few months in spelling out to the officials of the Department of Education and to the Minister the position in this regard.</P>
      <P>The site is not a proper one for the building of a community school.  On one side it is bordered by a road and a railway line while on the other side by Paírc Mhuire, a housing scheme. If the Department build an extension to the present school, they will be depriving the children of that scheme of a playing area.  A sum of £12,000 was spent by the Department on the field before I knew anything about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on record, in the first instance, the facts of the case. In 1969 the County Carlow Vocational Education Committee proposed <Col N="1106" /> to have the vocational school at Muine Bheag extended.  For this purpose they proposed to lease from the county council an adjoining 2½ acres, which would provide for the extension and allow the remainder of the land to be developed for playing facilities to be used by the pupils of all the schools in Muine Bheag.  In addition, the playing facilities would be available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the files here. It is not customary for Ministers to read from files and I shall not do so unless I am compelled.</P>
      <P>In addition, the playing facilities would be available for the children of the town after school hours.  At the time this proposal was received favourably by the county council and the nearby resident's association of Páirc Mhuire.  This was in 1969.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to record that the vocation education committee considered it&mdash;and I quote from the minutes of the relevant meeting&mdash;&ldquo;an imaginative proposal and a model for the country&rdquo;.  It was further stated that&mdash;again, I quote&mdash;&ldquo;this was a true example of how vocational education could be integrated into the lives of the community.&rdquo;  Subsequently the question of providing a community school was raised and agreed to by my Department.  That was in the year 1972; it will be readily realised I was not in office at that point of time.</P>
      <P>I have in front of me here a letter dated 29th January, 1973, by persons in County Carlow speaking about a proposal to erect a new community school at Muine Bheag and making reference to the site, so this matter does not arise under my jurisdiction only and I am not in any way departing from the positions of my predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed new school would incorporate the existing boys' secondary, girls' secondary and the vocational school.  Having regard to the original <Col N="1107" /> proposal to extend the vocational school on the adjoining 2½ acres owned by the county council and being satisfied that the overall area of 4½ acres would accommodate the new community school and any future expansion, my Department considered that the best solution was to proceed with the new school on the extended site.

      <P>My Department was aware of the fact that the local residents had the amenity of an open space adjacent to the vocational school, for a number of years.

      <P>When suitable accommodation was available there would be no question of not using <Col N="1109" /> this accommodation when providing a community school.  Indeed, this is a condition of the sanction which the Minister for Finance in the former Government imposed in relation to the community school programme.  If my word is taken for it, I will pass on.</P>

      <P>The position in Muine Bheag is that the existing boys' and girls' secondary schools need to be replaced but not &mdash; I repeat &ldquo;not&rdquo;&mdash; the vocational school.  Listening to Deputy Wilson the other day, one would get the impression that the case of Muine Bheag is a unique one.  Of course, it is not.  Apart from Muine Bheag, there are nine other cases of community schools where some existing accommodation in a two or three schools centre situation has been retained, even though this entailed a considerable amount of disruption in school organisation.</P>

      <P>Let me say that most of these cases occurred during the tenure of the previous Government. When in Opposition, the Government respected the principle of retaining suitable existing school accommodation in a new community school situation.  I am continuing that policy which I believe is the right one in the interests of the taxpayer.  The luxury of opposition should not entitle one to compromise on principle.</P>

      <P>If I were to agree to the building of a new community school on a new site, I would be responsible for incurring the expenditure of an additional £150,000 of the taxpayers' money.  I do not know where Deputy Wilson got his figure of £75,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is the replacement cost at present prices of the accommodation in the vocational school.  What is more important than the amount, whether it be £75,000 or £150,000, is the principle involved.  I have a duty to taxpayers to ensure that the moneys made available to me by the Minister for Finance are not wasted.  I cannot, and I am not, prepared to stand over the writing off of a good school&mdash;that, at least, is not in dispute&mdash;built in 1964 and subsequently extended.  That is the kernel of the issue and none of us should forget that.  I wonder what strictures <Col N="1111" /> would the Committee of Public Accounts pass on the Accounting Officer of my Department if the proposal to abandon the vocational school were implemented.</P>
      <P>If there were a demand for the vocational school building to be used for other purposes, I would be happy to consider any adequate offer.  But the fact is that nobody wants it.  The South Eastern Health Bord&mdash;Deputy Nolan and Deputy Governey know this&mdash;had it examined with a view to seeing whether it could be adapted and used for hospital purposes.  I understand that they regarded it as unsuitable and are no longer interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>And they were told by the Minister's Department that there were proposals to sell it.  That is on record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no prospective buyer as far as I am aware.  In conclusion, I can only reiterate that it is not open to me to abandon the vocational school and to build a new community school on a new site.  As I see it there are two options remaining, proceed with the sitting of the community school, as proposed, on the extension to the site of the vocational school or abandon the idea of a community school and examine the feasibility of some alternative organisation of the educational facilities of the area.  Let me emphasise that it is only by the adoption of the first alternative that immediate progress may be made for the provision of educational facilities in Muine Bheag.</P>

      <P>The person concerned who is aged 67 is a claimant for a non-contributory, not a contributory, old age pension.  He was not qualified for old age pension on age grounds until 1st April, 1975, when the qualifying age for pension was lowered to 67.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay in dealing with the case is due to the large number of claims received following the budget <Col N="1099" /> announcement of the reduction of the qualifying age and easement of the means test for old age, non-contributory, pension and to the fact that the social welfare officer awaits further particulars which he has sought in relation to means derived from a business.</P>
