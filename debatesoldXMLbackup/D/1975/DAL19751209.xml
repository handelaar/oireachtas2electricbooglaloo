      <P>Estimates of net migration are compiled for intercensal periods by relating successive population figures compiled from censuses of population to data for births and deaths in the same periods.  The following are the average annual net emigration figures in each intercensal period since 1951: 1951 to 1956, 39,353; 1956 to 1961, 42,400; 1961 to 1966, 16, 121; 1966 to 1971, 10,781.</P>
      <P>For the period since the last census the only indicators of net migration are the figures of net passenger movement by sea and air.  These figures indicate that in recent years there has been a small inward flow, that is, immigration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his Department have surveyed the position of 1975. <Col N="1051" /> school leavers; and if any figures are available as to the number who have succeeded in obtaining employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>A clear picture of the employment position of school leavers in any year does not emerge until later in the year.  I would expect that the information which the Deputy requests should be available from the proposed survey early in 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware of the serious situation which is affecting school leavers.  Is he aware that applications for jobs are somewhere in the ratio of 57 to one. Can he indicate what steps he intends to take to try to provide jobs for the 56 young people whose applications are unsuccessful?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware, as the Deputy is aware, that there is a serious unemployment situation. Young people suffer from that as much as any other category.  Last week I gave an indication to the Deputy of some of the pilot project surveys we have started.  Based on the success of these surveys, we will consider their extension throughout the rest of the country in an effort to assist young people who cannot find employment at present.  It would be naïve to think young people can be protected against unemployment as long as it continues at its present high level.  Unemployment will be licked here only when the economies of the countries with which we trade show some improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister discussed with the Government the possibility of providing money for public works projects to alleviate adult unemployment and unemployment among school leavers?  Is it proposed to make money available?  Has the Minister made application for money available from the EEC fund to assist school leavers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, at EEC level our intervention has consisted of a certain extension of aid to school leavers throughout the <Col N="1052" /> Community countries.  That was one of the initiatives we took at the end of the Irish presidency.  At home, our main thrust has been to turn back unemployment as it affected all categories of Irish workers, and especially those who have been thrown out of work as a result of the unemployment crisis.  With regard to young people, we will be considering very carefully the result of the surveys I have announced.  We have pilot projects already started in various parts of the country and, depending on their success, we will consider their extension to see whether, despite the bad economic situation, more young people can gain employment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if, in view of the continued plight of school leavers seeking employment, he will now consider extending the scope of the premium employment programme to help them obtain employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The premium employment programme was introduced in order to encourage the re-employment in agriculture and in certain manufacturing industries of workers who have lost their jobs as a result of the current recession.  The conditions applicable to eligibility were formulated to achieve this objective.  It is not designed to help persons seeking their first employment. Indeed, if the programme were extended to school leavers it could worsen the prospect of securing re-employment <Col N="1061" /> of those whom the programme was designed to benefit.</P>
      <P>The problem of school leavers is a separate one and has had to be tackled independently of the programme. On 16th October, 1975, I announced a series of pilot measures which if successful could be extended to help deal with youth employment and training.  I have outlined these measures in my earlier reply to questions by Deputies Lemass, Faulkner and Moore.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had discussions with other services, and various categories&mdash;the meat processing industry was one&mdash;but the main thing is that more than 3,000 people have been put back into gainful employment since the inception of the scheme.  We must bear in mind that some of the months of the operation of the scheme were holiday months, such as July and August, but the main obstacle to its wider use has lain in the reluctance of employers to take on extra workers at this time. There is a need for a greater confidence on the part of the business community that we have turned the corner in the present recession.  They see ample sign in this, and in other economies, that that time has not yet arrived.  That is the main reason why the scheme has not gained wider acceptance among employers but it has many months yet to run.  At least 3,000 people have been brought back into gainful employment.  I explained to the House, when introducing the scheme, that my objective was to bring back 10,000 people into gainful employment but for this we require the co-operation of employers.  This, in turn, means that they must have the confidence to start taking on extra people.</P>

      <P>That is part of a big question.  There is no doubt that we must have the most modern production methods because if we do not our goods will not be competitive.  On the other hand, at a time of high unemployment it would seem to make good sense that we should bring as many people as possible back into extra work.  That is the object of Government expenditure and our general economic policy at this time. It is part of a larger question whether we should make these serious choices suggested as between machinery investment and personnel investment.

      <P>There has been a lot of controversy about this.  The PEP does not apply to people who have not been in gainful employment and who have not drawn benefits. There must be a certain period in which the person has drawn unemployment benefit.

      <P>It was designed to assist in the promotion of employment because there was loss of employment as a result of the present recession. It was designed to give financial encouragement to employers to reemploy people.  It was not concerned with young people leaving school, a separate, serious question on which some progress is being made.  It would be naïve to suggest that we could turn back unemployment in this country without general recovery in most of our major markets.</P>

There is a great deal of inaccuracy and lack of understanding of the problem of school leavers in the course of the present recession, both here and in Britain.  There is quite a lot of misconception about it. Apparently more gain employment than one would have thought possible in the circumstances.  In other words, they are not as heavily afflicted with unemployment by comparison with other groups worse hit.  We are striving to get accurate figures of the extent of unemployment so as to gear any projects we may undertake to meet the real needs of the situation rather than imaginary needs.

Galway is suffering from unemployment and we do not wish to see one of the best factories in the town closed, as was threatened.  It was only then that the Minister intervened personally.

The Deputy corrected himself when he said that I had been involved in attempting to settle the dispute from the beginning.  My last intervention was based on the facts available to me at that time and the imminent closedown of the factory. In the absence of any further indication from the parties in dispute of some move towards acceptance of those proposals, I do not see how it would be beneficial to the resolution of this dispute to intervene again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>No absolute ceiling was fixed to funds available for International Women's Year.  Instead, the criteria used made it possible that financial assistance would be forthcoming for worthwhile projects which would advance in a practical way the status of women in our society.  Many such projects were recommended by the women's representative committee and, in all, 17 organisations have been assisted with International Women's Year projects.</P>
      <P>The programme endorsed by the women's representative committee for International Women's Year 1975, announced on the 10th January, has been fully complied with.  Activities undertaken over the year included the issue of a special commemorative stamp by the Department of Posts &amp; Telegraphs; the preparation of an essay competition, prizes for which will be presented during this week.  A number of very successful conferences, seminars and exhibitions organised by the various women's organisations were held.  During the year, the media co-operated in producing many discussion programmes of an informational nature on the status of women in our society.  I would especially, in this connection, like to congratulate RTE radio on the Thomas Davis lecture series on women and Irish society.</P>
      <P>The International Women's Year programme in this country has, I think, assisted in focusing attention on the steps needed to equalise the status of women in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the <Col N="1082" /> 17 organisations or associations the Minister mentioned how much money was made available through them by way of assistance?  How many other associations applied and did not receive assistance?  Was dissatisfaction expressed to him about the lack of advertisement at an early stage of the availability of funds to such organisations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am very satisfied with the way this has gone. The main criterion was if the project for assistance was worthwhile.  The women's representative committee made a recommendation on that and indicated, if the organisation themselves were willing to run it, support for work undertaken in aid of the project.  From memory, the last time I looked at it, something like £6,000 was spent in helping projects of this nature during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The accounts are not final but as I indicated in reply to the question there was no ceiling on expenditure on help during the year. The only criterion was the nature of the project, whether it was worthwhile, whether it helped practically in accord with the Commission on the Status of Women.  I believe most of the projects complied with that and helped to focus attention and interest on the practical steps necessary to equalise the status of women in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the second occasion on which I have come to the House with a measure to control the salaries of bank officials.  The previous occasion was in 1973.  That Act expired by order on 14th December, 1973.</P>
      <P>In June last, the Government, with the twin objectives of combating inflation and maintaining employment, took certain budgetary action.  The measures included the removal of VAT from clothing, footwear, electricity and all fuels (except road fuels), the introduction of subsidies on most CIE rates and fares, bread and flour, butter, liquid milk and town gas.  As a result of these Government initiatives, the cost of living was reduced by 0.8 per cent in the period mid-May to midAugust, 1975.  As a Government we sought that, in return for a slowing down of price increases, there should be a corresponding slowing down of income increases.  Such voluntary agreement with trade unions was secured in that the third and fourth phases of the 1975 national agreement were revised to link them directly to changes in the consumer price index. The immediate effect of the revision was to cancel the increases due to workers under the third phase of the 1975 national agreement and to provide for indexation in the fourth phase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's subsidies of June to reduce prices were designed to reduce the cost of living for all&mdash;including bank officials.  That is why I requested the banks' Staff Relations Committee on 30th September, 1975 to advise as to what proposals the banks had for a comparable revision of the terms of their agreement bearing <Col N="1090" /> in mind that all other workers had revised their existing agreements.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and I met with the bank employees on 27th and 31st October, 1975, in the hope of securing from them a revision of the third and fourth phases of their pay agreement, in line with the amendments effected in the national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>In the discussions with the employees' representatives, we did not seek any sacrifices from them or anything beyond what other workers had accepted voluntarily.  The bank employees, however, did not indicate that they would be prepared to amend their agreement in a manner likely to bear comparison to the amendment made by the majority of workers in the national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Banks' Joint Industrial Council on 13th November, a proposal for the modification of their current pay agreement was considered by both sides.  This proposal was subsequently balloted on by the employees but was rejected.</P>
    <P>Last Friday I met representatives of the Irish Bank Officials' Association in an effort to avert the need for legislation.  I said that if at any time an acceptable voluntary agreement could be reached the legislation would not be activated.</P>
    <P>I undertook to withdraw the Bill now before the House on the understanding that I would refer the 1974 and 1975 bank pay agreements to the Labour Court to report on whether these agreements conformed with the 1974 and 1975 National Agreements as revised; for their part, the Irish Bank Officials' Association would agree to a deferral of payment of the third phase increase of their current pay agreement pending such Labour Court recommendation and that they would agree to accept the recommendation. Regrettably, these proposals were not acceptable to the representatives of the Irish Bank Officials' Association.</P>
    <P>I accept that bank officials are not parties to the national agreement and in my efforts to achieve voluntary agreement on this matter I respected <Col N="1091" /> their wishes that they need not conform with every detail of that agreement but their settlement must bear some comparison with that of the majority.  Dáil Members, the Judiciary and many others who are not formally bound by the agreement keep in line with it.  This principle appeared to have gained the acceptance of responsible bank employees but their refusal to accept an amendment to their present agreement as other workers have done compels me to ask the House to pass this legislation. If any interest group choose to go their own way they make a mockery of the restraint practised by others, many of whom are suffering much more immediately from the effects of the recession in terms of job insecurity and unemployment.  I would hope that on passage of this legislation if any savings accrue to the banks as a result of the Labour Court adjudication that the benefits will be passed on to members of the general public.  I have already suggested that consideration should be given to abolition of bank services charges to personal current account holders.</P>
    <P>The present recession is longer and deeper than had generally been forecast. Last June the Economic and Social Research Institute predicted a fall of 1½ per cent in GNP for this year.  By October they felt the situation had deteriorated still further than had been expected so their revised forecast was for a drop of 3½ per cent.</P>
    <P>It is now expected that since the major economies of the world have begun to show signs of improvement by early 1977 a general recovery will be under way.  We will be in a weak position to participate in this recovery if we find ourselves with inflation and its counterpart, unemployment at levels above those of our trading partners.  In 1976 we must devote our resources, not to consumption but to investment; we must prepare our physical and human assets for a quick return to high growth rates and full participation in an expanding pattern of world trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> The Bill is on the same lines as the legislation governing pay and conditions in the banks which was enacted in 1973 and I hope, therefore, that all Stages can be taken today.  The present measure will come into operation and expire on days to be appointed by order.  The Bill contains provisions whereby I would, should I consider it necessary to do so, impose a stay on the salaries and other conditions of employment in the banks.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains provisions which would enable me, by order, to prevent the banks from offering increases in wages or improvements in other conditions of employment in excess of those which the Labour Court would determine as appropriate in the light of the provisions of the national agreements.  Contravention or failure by the banks to comply with the terms of such an order would constitute an offence which would render them, on conviction, liable to fines but not imprisonment. There are no penalties of any sort directed against bank employees or their representatives.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time in his short Ministerial life that the Minister for Labour has introduced a Bill of this nature.  I dislike legislation in a situation such as this and I am inclined to suspect here that the reasons for introducing the Bill are connected with a certain amount of incompetence and, possibly, arrogance at ministerial level. My party have for long stood by the concept of national wage agreements and I think one must be allowed for a moment to go back and compare similar situations with the present one if it had occurred in our time.  I can imagine the reaction of Deputies like the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Posts &amp; Telegraphs, who is present, to such legislation being introduced restraining certain people from getting increases.  To give an indication of what the Labour Party then thought, I think it is best to quote the Leader of that party when he spoke here on the Prices and Incomes Bill, 1970 on <Col N="1093" /> 28th October as reported at column 56, Volume 249 of the Official Report. He said then:</P>
      <P>As far as this party is concerned and as far as the trade union movement is concerned neither they nor we will ever agree to any measure which takes away from them the right to free collective bargaining.</P>
      <P>The major difference between the introductory speech in this case and in the case of the 1973 Bill was that at that time the Minister for Labour was not long in office and he couched his speech then in all sorts of platitudes and nice sounds saying that we were eliminating poverty and creating a completely different social structure. Obviously, even he is now honest enough to admit that the imaginary dreamland he was trying to create in his own mind has not materialised.  We have before us a short factual document setting out the basic details of the present situation.  I have and always will have a personal preference for cultivating an encouragement situation in industrial relations, not for legislating for them or towards them.</P>
      <P>It is an amazing somersault for the Minister to introduce this type of legislation despite the need for it.  You could possibly say that he has adopted a responsible role in Government but I begin to suspect especially with this Government that much of their legislation is introduced because they do not explore the possibilities open to them under existing legislation as is the case with some of the measures currently before the House, and that they proceed to do what they think in the easiest way, copy a Bill introduced in 1973 and say that they will make it work this way.  I suggest to the Minister that in section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946 he has adequate power if he moved in time to ensure that what he is trying to cover by this Bill could have been covered without the necessity and the cost in time and unpleasantness of introducing this measure.  Section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Court shall consider any matter referred to it by the Minister concerning the employment conditions prevailing as regards the <Col N="1094" /> workers of any class and their employers and shall furnish a report thereon to the Minister together with such recommendations (if any), as it thinks proper, and the Minister shall consider any report and recommendation so made.</P>
    <P>That section should be adequate to enable any Minister for Labour to deal with the situation now facing him. This Bill is untimely because the avenues open have not been, in my opinion, fully explored.  I suspect there are Ministers in the Government who, perhaps, are not capable of exploring them or, perhaps, not deeply committed enough to explore them to the benefit of the community at large.  That suspicion must be abroad.</P>
    <P>This is an inappropriate Bill as well, despite what the Minister tried to convey on the last occasion, because this Bill does, as did the 1973 Bill, interfere with collective bargaining.  It is in the national interest, particularly in the present economic climate that, as far as possible, the national pay agreement would be adhered to.  I am beginning to think that all the problems we face under this Government are due to the lack of an economic plan, the lack of a structure that can create a climate in which industry, agriculture and business can prosper.</P>
    <P>Up to a comparatively short time ago the Minister for Finance told us repeatedly that it was impossible, because of so many outside factors, to prepare such a plan.  However, after repeated pressure from this side of the House and after a little experience of Government he now realises that a plan is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If you would listen to the sentence to the end, I could explain the matter to you.  I referred to an economic plan and its relation to a national wage agreement &mdash;which I think is relevant to this&mdash; and to the anomalies that can at times occur within the national wage agreement to the detriment of many of our people.  For example, in the national wage agreement there is an escape clause that employers are using to avoid having to pay increases to which workers are entitled.</P>
      <P>Here we have the opposite situation. A group of bank officials, 8,000 to 10,000 sensible, responsible people, see the reverse situation in the institutions in which they work.  Human nature being what it is, it is understandable that they would feel entitled to gain extra money for themselves. This is how I believe the economic plan is related to the problem before us, in the sense that there is under-lending of money available in the banks because of the economic climate that exists.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  I do not intend to go outside the rules, but a situation is being created by the under-lending of money in the economic climate that exists, and money lies idle.  If the money lying idle was made available for reinvestment the industrial sector could benefit. In page 4 of the Minister's brief he expresses the hope that the benefits of savings will be passed on to members of the public.  Has the Minister or the Government made any approach to the banks in this regard? I understand he expressed the same opinion on a radio programme within the last day or two.  Surely the Government have approached the banks and asked them to pass on the savings to the general public by way of abolishing bank service charges on personal current account holders. This is very desirable, but is it merely another platitude?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> The Minister is directing this measure against a group of people who are organised in their own right. There are other banks in which the labour force is not organised.  However, this measure would seem to be the thin end of the wedge and to be opening the door for the continuing introduction of legislation of this nature in order to stifle free bargaining in certain situations.  The Minister has the advantage of not having to face an irate Opposition such as a Fianna Fáil Minister in the last Government would have had to face from the then Opposition had he been charged with the responsibility of introducing a Bill of this nature. Instead the Minister is facing a sensible and responsible Opposition who take into consideration the economic factors but who blame the Government for failing to handle the situation that has led up to this whole problem.</P>
    <P>I trust that when the Minister is replying he will answer the questions that we put to him.  For instance, will there be a date set for the coming into operation of this legislation and, if so, will this interfere in any way with equal pay legislation in regard to the banks?</P>

      <P>The terms of the two sections I have mentioned are very harsh.  For example, section 3 (1) states that:</P>
      <P>Where any banks, whether before, on or after the commencement of this Act, pay or agree to pay increases of remuneration to any of their employees or amend or vary or agree to amend or very any other terms or conditions of employment of any of their employees so as to provide improved or more favourable terms or conditions of employment for them...</P>
      <P>This section can go far beyond what I believe the Minister has in mind. From my reading of it it would appear that it would not be possible within its terms to procure as much as a new pencil, in other words, that there could be no improvement, no matter how small in conditions.</P>

It is surprising that despite everything said by the Minister during the 1960s when he was on this side of the House, he should be the one to introduce legislation of this kind.  The Minister has said that the Bill does not contain penalties.  I would not wish to impose penalties on anyone.</P>

      <P>No one wishes to see a strike situation occurring but in such an eventuality the banks would have the opportunity of making greater profits for the duration of the strike.  That is one situation, but another is that if the penalty is imposed on them it would hardly be possible to implement it, so that eventually there would have to be compromise between them and the Government.  I cannot see any necessity for this Bill.  I believe that will be the situation.  It might be worth mentioning that on the last occasion the Minister and his colleagues tried to convey that bank officials were a certain group that were weak to the extent that they did not have the popularity of stronger groups.  We have seen the Minister for Finance accused by the Employer Labour Conference of a breach of the national wage agreement.  We might well ask why?  It was because it was a group strong enough to beat the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>We have now a situation where the Minister and his party believe that the group in question at the moment do not command much sympathy.  That may not be entirely correct.  We must realise that not all bank officials are managers, that the vast majority are at a much lower level, earning a decent wage and no more.  They are obliged to maintain a certain standard of living because of conditions imposed on them by the management of the banks, not imposed by society or anyone else.  Indeed, action can be taken by management if certain standards are not complied with.  It is a myth that bank officials will not command the same support as other groups&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The reality is that the Minister is introducing legislation for this group of people. What can continue from there?  We know there are unions who are outside Congress, who have asked to be represented at Congress.  There is a danger that this is the beginning of a cycle, that the totalitarian state about which the Minister spoke so glibly and so strongly when he sat on this side of the House is now being created.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have always been a responsible party and we are showing that sense of responsibility in Opposition.  We realise the seriousness of the situation with regard to the national wage agreement.  I detest and abhor the introduction of legislation at this stage because I consider it is completely unnecessary.  The Minister has failed to cope with this problem and he has not tried to encourage or cultivate industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bank officials deal with the general public.  They have improved their services during the years and, from a human point of view, they are entitled to look on the performance of their company.  I am not advocating that that is the line of reasoning that should be taken by anyone in wage negotiations.  Fianna Fáil created the national wage agreement, we supported it at all stages and this we will continue to do.  However, bank officials see the profits being made by the banks, they see the dividends being paid&mdash;much of the money going out of the country &mdash;and, because of the economic situation here, they see the assets of the banks floating on the London money markets.  Human nature being what it is, it is understandable that these officials would like to get what they consider their just entitlement. Admittedly the fact that they are going outside the national wage agreement creates a problem for the Minister and it is a situation that has <Col N="1102" /> to be protected.  Despite what the Minister has said now and in the past, he has done away with the free bargaining situation, with the rights of the individual to negotiate around a table.  I could quote the Minister's own references to the situation but I would only prolong the debate.  However, certain comments will be made on the Committee Stage.  There are areas in the Bill that are not acceptable to me.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to make and one that the Minister might consider.  I refer to the appointment of the officers and the decision of an authorised officer to inspect bank accounts in certain circumstances.  The confidentiality that has been attributed to banks for such a long time can be broken.  If an authorised officer inspects a certain area of the bank's activities he may be able to explore much further than that and I am sure there are Deputies on the other side of the House who may be concerned about that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is in the red so far as ideas are concerned. He is bankrupt of ideas if this is the kind of Bill he has to introduce for a second time.  One could understand a young Minister making a mistake on one occasion but to make the mistake on two occasions is too much for Members of this House.  The principle behind the Bill&mdash;to hold the line&mdash;is one thing, but the contents of the Bill are a different matter.  In his statement the Minister says that this Bill does not apply to every employee of the bank, but this is not so.  It applies to every employee, as is shown in section 9 (b) which states that the authorised officer may:</P>
      <P>require any person, being a director or a member of the committee of management or other controlling authority of the bank or an employee thereof,...</P>
      <P>This Bill could be described as the Minister's Christmas box for Irish workers, a Christmas box of a battering-ram. Section 5 of the Bill states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... that payment of the fine be secured by the seizure, entry into <Col N="1103" /> possession and, where necessary, sale of the property of the person by the appropriate sheriff...</P>
    <P>I am sure that Captain Boycott or the Minister will run out of sheriffs if this Bill is put into operation.  The home is no longer a safe place.  The innocent parties will be the people affected if homes are seized and sold: the wives and children of the officials or the workers in the banks will suffer.  It is the first time in the history of the Houses of the Oireachtas that a person's home has been put at risk.  It is a very serious matter when a Minister suggests this course.</P>
    <P>This should be a warning to Irish workers.  In his statement the Minister has said that a person fined on conviction of an offence under this measure shall not be liable to imprisonment in default of the payment of the fine.  This is a farce but the Minister has written it into the Bill for the second time.  The Minister is deliberately misleading the House when he indicates that imprisonment is not on.</P>

      <P>1973.  As reported at column 822 of the Official Report of the debate on the Regulation of Banks Bill, 1973, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>If the bank director obstructed the seizure of his property he would obviously be in contravention of the ordinary laws of the land and he would have no immunity.</P>
      <P>Mr. Brennan: He would go to jail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister writes these few lines into the Bill, the Bill does not mean what it states. Under this Bill he cannot be imprisoned, but he can be imprisoned under another Act, as stated by the Minister during the debate on the previous Bill.  The Minister admitted several times during the course of that debate that, apart from this Bill, there are other Acts under which bank officials or employees could be charged and could be imprisoned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a vehicle of imprisonment, if the Minister likes to put it another way.  The Minister has specified that the sheriff will move in, seize a person's home and sell it and, if the man resists the seizure of his home in order to protect his wife and family, he will be caught under another Act.  A bank official could be sent to prison.  The Minister may have written these lines into the Bill to satisfy his own conscience, but it does not satisfy Members of this House. That is all-important.</P>
      <P>One would have thought that the crowbar, which was outlawed many years ago, would not be used again against Irish workers.  Apparently the Minister, together with his colleagues, has decided that the battering-ram and the crowbar are the solution to the industrial relations problems of the present day.  As Deputy Fitzgerald said, industrial relations are a very serious matter and need to be handled properly.  We need men who are experienced in industrial relations, who are conscious of the problems, and who will be guided by the problems of the past and the legislation of the past.  If mistakes were made in the past, we should ensure that they do not happen again.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the Regulation of Banks Bill, 1973, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that his remarks are not related to anything in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> On that occasion I pointed out exactly what was in the Bill of which, apparently, the Minister was not aware. Section 5 (2) of this Bill provides:</P>
    <P>A person who is fined upon conviction of an offence under this Act shall not be liable to imprisonment in default of payment of the fine...</P>
    <P>I say that is a fraud.  It is misleading because the person can be imprisoned under another Act.  Under section 9, a typist, a porter, or a cleaner could be sent to jail.  Senior officials of banks give instructions to cleaners, porters and typists.  If they are given instructions not to make available certain records, and not to allow personnel into certain sections of the bank, they will carry out those instructions.  Section 9 (2) provides:</P>
    <P>If any person obstructs or impedes an authorised officer in the exercise of his powers under subsection (1) of this section or does not comply with a requirement of an authorised officer under the said subsection (1), that person shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (1) provides:</P>
    <P>An authorised officer may, for the purpose of obtaining any information which the Minister may require for enabling him to exercise his functions under this Act, do any one or more of the following things:</P>
    <P>(a)  at all reasonable times enter premises of a bank,</P>
    <P>(b)  require any person, being a director or a member of the committee of management or other controlling authority of the bank or an employee thereof, to produce to him any records, books or documents...</P>
    <P>The Minister told us on a previous occasion that the cleaner or the porter could be sent to jail for carrying out his duties as he sees them.</P>
    <P>Will the authorised officers have special badges?  How will they be identifiable?  Is there any protection for the other employees or &ldquo;an employee thereof&rdquo;?  Section 9 provides that a person shall be deemed to be <Col N="1106" /> guilty of an offence.  I am sure some of the porters and cleaners are members of trade unions.  This is an attack on the weaker sections in the bank.  On a previous occasion the Minister agreed these people could be sent to jail, notwithstanding the fact that he has written these lines into this Bill.  This is a very serious matter which needs further consideration by the Minister if he is sincere.</P>

      <P>Column 110 of the Official Report.  I now want to quote the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Tully.  As reported at column 140 of the same volume, Deputy Tully, now Minister for Local Government, stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... I assure the Minister that as far as we are concerned in the Labour Party, every time this sort of measure is introduced here, we shall oppose it tooth and nail....  I would say this, that those in the Fianna Fáil Party who have been carrying trade union cards and displaying them at election time had better think very carefully before they cast their votes on this Bill, because I know they will not be <Col N="1107" /> allowed to give their views but they are going to cast their votes on this and before doing so, they should remember that there is another election coming and they will not be able to claim the protection of that card when they are going around working class areas.</P>
    <P>That is what the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party stated at that time: they would oppose this type of legislation tooth and nail.  Deputy Coughlan, at column 222 of Volume 223 of the Official Report for 8th June, had this to say:</P>
    <P>In a matter such as this, it tries the patience of any human being where coercive legislation is being introduced and is being clouded and woolled over.  It is our duty on these benches to shear that wool aside and to lay naked and bare the situation as it is presented and will be carried out by the Fianna Fáil Government.  We take our stand in this issue because we believe that coercion will solve nothing.</P>
    <P>That is what Deputy Coughlan had to say.  Deputy O'Leary, now Minister for Labour, at column 240 of Volume 223 of the Official Report for the same date, stated:</P>
    <P>The Bill brings us a step nearer to the totalitarian concept of the State....  This morning the Government took a step towards the totalitarian concept where the State no longer stands neutral in the struggle between employer and employee...</P>
    <P>The Minister at that time was concerned about legislation that tended to coerce.  Deputy Cluskey, at column 282 for the same date, had this to say:</P>
    <P>There is one comment I wish to make, that is, that it is terribly important that we should realise exactly what we are doing here today. It is particularly important that Fine Gael should realise what is being done.  The democratic rights of a comparatively small number of people are being taken away.  This <Col N="1108" /> amendment would suggest to me that Fine Gael have come to the conclusion that democracy is all right when it suits but when it does not suit, it should be suspended.</P>
    <P>I hope these members of the Labour Party who are now on the Government benches will once again give us the benefit of their wisdom and ensure we fully understand this Bill because they understood other Bills that, they argued, interfered in some way with the relationship between employer and employee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>They are on record speaking about interference between worker and employer, interference which was not in the interests of good industrial relations.  As Deputy G. Fitzgerald said, I am quite sure that if the Minister kept his hands out of this situation the matter would probably have been resolved long ago.  The Minister unfortunately has seen fit to interfere, as he interfered on previous occasions, and he has found out what the response is from these very responsible officials.  The Minister cannot say bank officials are not responsible people but, reading this Bill, one would think they were completely irresponsible.  I am quite certain the people referred to, the persons whose houses and property can be seized, are responsible people, people who will listen to reason and will reason with reasonable men.  But the Minister was sent along.  It is true it is no good sending a boy on a man's errand.  This is a job for a mature industrial relations officer who fully understands the problem and who can communicate, not in a dogmatic way, but in a reasonable and sensible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill in itself does not contravene the national pay agreement and the Minister has admitted this but he has indicated clearly that this Bill is based on that agreement.  The increases are examined on a parity basis and as a result of that examination this Bill is presented to the House.  As I said, the Minister is incorrect when he says the Bill is not directed against bank employees <Col N="1109" /> or their representatives.  If that is so who are the people against whom penalties are directed?  I have read section 9 several times.  The controlling authority of the bank are the employees thereof; that is quite clear in section 9.  Perhaps the Minister did not read section 9.  Perhaps he does not know it exists.  In a previous debate the Minister told us that the employee, be it the porter, the typist or the cleaner, could be sent to gaol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has very cleverly emphasised the fact, particularly in section 5, that they shall not be liable to imprisonment in default of payment.  Under another section the employees and all the other people concerned can, in fact, be sent to prison.  As Deputy Fitzgerald said, the principle is our first concern.  The composition of the Bill is another matter.  It is up to Members to point out the defects, the coercion and the brutality of the Bill.  This is the first time to my knowledge that the sheriff can be called upon with the battering ram to take possession of a man's house and cast his wife and children out on the roadside.  This is a very serious matter.  For years our people resisted this kind of intrusion.  Captain Boycott and others got their answer.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider some sections of this Bill if he wants to ensure fair play for Irish workers.  This Bill will affect all workers, whether or not they are trade unionists.  Under section 9, supposing records were destroyed before the arrival of the authorised officer, what will be the position then?  It would appear it is all right to destroy records. There is nothing in the Bill to indicate it is not, so long as the authorised officer gets access to whatever is there. The Minister must ensure that no employee will be liable to imprisonment in any circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 8 the authorised officer will be appointed by the Minister?  In what manner will he be appointed? From what Department will he come? Will he come from the Department of Finance, the Department of Labour or <Col N="1110" /> what Department?  The Minister is aware that to inquire into the private affairs of a firm is a serious matter and in the case of a bank where confidential records are maintained an officer may exceed his duty.  Confidential information, particularly the appointments from the Department of Finance or other Departments, other than the Minister's own department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate the method to be employed in the selection and appointment of these authorised officers?  How will they be identified and from what Department will they come?</P>
      <P>In section 10 the Minister is most generous in telling us that a bank official may not take action against a bank for failure to implement the agreement.  Deputy Fitzgerald raised the important matter of up-dating the conditions of employment which has been ruled out by section 4.  The Minister must be aware that there is a need for constant up-dating of conditions of employment.  It is possible that there are bank officials who are working under conditions which are not as good as those prevailing in other banks. It may be that those officials have been applying pressure for a considerable period for the up-dating of these conditions, but, irrespective of how bad the conditions are, how outmoded or outdated they are and how well the bankers may wish to up-date them, they cannot be improved because of section 4.  The Minister should reconsider this section because, as we all know, the up-dating of conditions is all important; it is an on-going matter because what is acceptable today may not be acceptable tomorrow.  Standards, attitudes and personnel are changing daily and for that reason an injustice can be done by section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the Bill pressures are being applied in a dangerous way.  I am sure the trade union will look at the Bill on this occasion&mdash;if they did not do it on the previous occasion&mdash;<Col N="1111" /> and see the pattern the Minister is pursuing in relation to the wider aspect of industrial relations and how he intends to block such matters.  I should like to know if section 6 applies to building societies and credit unions or does it only apply to a particular type of bank.  The answer given by the Minister to this question on a previous occasion was most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that the Government, with the twin objectives of combating inflation and maintaining employment, took certain budgetary action but they have not been very successful.  There are now 108,000 unemployed, substantially more than last June, the month the Minister was referring to.  In no area have the Government been successful.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was developing this point when he was ruled out of order.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the measures taken by the Government included the removal of VAT from clothing, footwear, electricity and all fuel, the introduction of subsidies on most CIE rates and fares, bread, flour, butter, liquid milk and town gas.  The Minister said that as a result of these initiatives the cost of living was reduced by 0.8 per cent.  I should like to know what the present position is.  We were told that those initiatives would reduce the cost of <Col N="1112" /> living by 5 per cent and the fact that it has only reduced it by 0.8 per cent shows that they were a disastrous failure.  I can understand a Government so confused like the present Government bringing in an irresponsible Bill like this.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that on Friday he met representatives of the Irish Bank Officials' Association in an effort to avert the need for legislation.  He said he told the representatives that if at any time an acceptable voluntary agreement could be reached, the legislation would not be activated.  The Minister has aggravated the situation and as a result may have to activate this legislation.  I hope the Minister will look at the aspects of the Bill I mentioned and endeavour to make the Bill more acceptable.  To hold the line is important in relation to wage claims and the national wage agreement.  The officials are not in conflict with that agreement but it was not agreed that the matter should be examined by the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested that any savings that accrue to the banks, as a result of the Labour Court's adjudication, would be passed on to the general public.  Will the Minister insist, if this Bill is passed, that the savings that accrue are passed on to the general public or is this more upholstery for the Minister's brief?  Is the Minister prepared to ensure that the savings that accrue are used for the benefit of the general public?  The Minister is not correct in stating that there are no penalties of any sort directed against bank employees or their representatives. They can be guilty of an offence and have charges brought against them and the Minister told us this on a previous occasion.  I hope the Minister will examine the position to ensure that we will have a more responsible package to present to responsible people who we would expect to take it in a responsible way.  I am sure they will if the Minister can project a responsible image.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first matter I should like to have confirmed is one which, if contradicted by the Minister, would alter to a large extent the comments I would make on this.  It is the <Col N="1113" /> word &ldquo;banks&rdquo; and its subsequent definition in which the impression is given that this legislation refers to all establishments known to the public as banks.  On the other hand, in his speech the Minister referred specifically to the banks where the employees are represented by a particular organisation known as the Irish Bank Officials' Association.  If the Minister could remove any doubt which exists there, I would be much happier about the legislation.  I take it that the fact that the Minister is not indicating that the legislation refers to all banks, in itself may be taken as proof positive that it refers only to banks where the employees are represented by that organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister indicating now that we can take it absolutely that it applies to all types of bank whether they are represented by IBOA or not?  As far as I am concerned, the IBOA operate and negotiate on behalf of employees of certain banks only, and how can the Minister now indicate that the legislation refers to all banks when in his speech there is no indication of the position in regard to other banks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>That means I must proceed assuming that it refers specifically to those banks who are organised.  That is what makes the proposed legislation obnoxious.  Here we have the Minister for Labour in this House allegedly because of his interest in organised labour, with a piece of legislation directed, we can assume, solely against those banks where labour is organised.  Surely the Minister, realising the importance of that issue, would have had a clear mind coming into the House and would have had no hesitation in enlightening us in regard to this point. I am trying to establish that this piece of legislation is aimed at and is prejudicial to organised labour, according to the Minister.  On that premise I will refer to section 1 of the Bill which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1114" /> If the Minister is satisfied that in order to maintain, in the national interest, general adherence to the National Agreements it is necessary for him to do so.</P>
    <P>Is that the freedom and the authority henceforth we are to give to a Minister&mdash;that if he feels because of A, B, C or D, because of what he regards as something which is not in the national interest, he can prevent increases in wages and salaries being given to organised employees?</P>
    <P>If legislation like this is taken on its superficial or face value and if, as is indicated in the Minister's speech, we want to organise public feeling against the alleged position of the bank officials, it can be done more readily than in the case of others. There are not many bank officials living in my constituency but notwithstanding that there is very little political gain in advancing a case of bank officials, I must admit I have a certain amount of sympathy with them in their present position.  By the very nature and responsibility of their profession, bank officials may be dismissed by the banks unless they observe what are called certain standards.  Surely these standards cannot be maintained on what might be regarded as low wages?</P>
    <P>If the Minister is concerned here about the position of the country, the banks and bank officials, and in pursuit of his interest in employees and trade unionists, perhaps he should at some later stage discuss with the banks the standards which they require from their employees.  Perhaps he should discuss with the banks whether the standards they require can be met by paying lesser salaries to their employees.  This, however, is not the point I intend to develop.</P>
    <P>I want to establish that the Minister is misreading the feeling of the public towards bank officials as his basis for the introduction of legislation which is aimed solely at restricting organised labour of all kinds.  If and when this Bill goes on the Statute Book, it will be used as a basis.  This will be the basis on which other Ministers will move against other branches of organised labour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> The Minister referred to a consultation he had had on Friday last with the Irish Bank Officials' Association when he indicated to them that he would withdraw the Bill, which saw the light of day on Thursday last only, on the understanding that the agreement of 1974 could be referred to the Labour Court.  I must admit to a certain lack of overall comprehension in the matter of the attendant legislation.  It seems to me rather strange that on Friday last the Minister should be requesting an association appearing before him to hold back on an agreement made in 1974.  Was it not possible for the Minister under the 1946 Act to have referred that 1974 agreement to the Labour Court?  If it was, why did he not do that or was the Minister awaiting the economic recovery he tells us did not occur in 1975 and is not likely to occur in 1976?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Although he said it would.  Why is it that so late in the day he put a proposition to the Irish Bank Officials' Association in respect of a 1974 agreement?</P>
      <P>I am mentioning certain points which make me suspicious of the intention of the Minister.  In continuing to do so, I refer to that part of his speech where he said:</P>
      <P>... Dáil Members, the Judiciary and many others who are not formally bound by the agreement keep in line with it ...</P>
      <P>That may be so.  If the Minister were making a balanced preparation of the case, he might have informed the House that in respect of classes other than Members of the Dáil and of the Judiciary under the clause dealing with anomalies&mdash;higher civil servants, teachers, Army officers, garda officers&mdash; all those sections benefit additionally to an extent of 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to get a clear picture of the reason for the proposed legislation.  Is it that in respect of the present claims or agreements made on behalf of bank employees there is an element which <Col N="1116" /> is equivalent to that 5 per cent?  If so, is the Minister not prepared to concede that right away?  This concession has already been made.  Nobody is objecting to it.  I, as a member of a teachers' organisation, welcome it and would be prepared to argue, if required, for its justification.  If allowed to those sections, broadly speaking comparable with bank officials, is it being accepted as an element of the two agreements to which the Minister refers?</P>
    <P>I shall continue to quote the Minister and refer to tones I do not like in his speech.  Talking about bank employees he says:</P>
    <P>... their refusal to accept an amendment to their present agreement as other workers have done compels me to ask the House to pass this legislation...</P>
    <P>Taken superficially that may be a good reason for doing something but will it form the basis of future legislation in respect of organised labour?  &ldquo;... their refusal to accept an amendment to their present agreement as other workers have done&rdquo; is a rather vague statement.  What other workers?  What is the basis of comparability?  Is this the great precedent we are getting from the archangel of the Labour and working classes&mdash;that in future if a Minister decides that any group of workers are not behaving in the same fashion as some other unmentioned group, he can decide to introduce legislation in this House compelling them to do not what they think is fit and proper for them in the matter of negotiations but that which he thinks they should do in what he described earlier as the national interest? I am not happy that the Minister for Labour is the best man to interpret for me or, indeed, for the people of this country what is best in the national interest.  I am not prepared to accept that he is the best man in this country to adjudicate as between the merits of one group of workers and another.  I am very hesitant to agree to legislation being introduced by the Minister which would give him that right.</P>
    <P>The essence of this Bill is too serious for any form of gimmickry.  It is too serious for off-the-cuff expressions as <Col N="1117" /> we have had already from the Minister in his speech.  Again, we get this playing to the feeling that the Minister thinks people have towards bank officials.  I hold no special brief for bank officials. I get the same rough ride from them and their managers as do other people in this House.  I have no direct or indirect connection with them but I am fearful of this legislation.</P>
    <P>On page 4, paragraph (1), the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I would hope that on passage of this legislation if any savings accrue to the banks as a result of the Labour Court adjudication that the benefits will be passed on to members of the general public.</P>
    <P>The Minister hopes that if any benefits accrue to the banks that they will be passed on to the general public. That is false.  He claims to be introducing this legislation because bank officials are getting more than they deserve and to restrict the amount the bank official gets.  From that I take it that there will be profit to the bank, the employer.  There should be no &ldquo;if&rdquo; in his statement.  He inserted that condition&mdash;&ldquo;the benefits will be passed on to members of the general public&rdquo;&mdash; because it gives him a way out.  There is no such guarantee in this Bill.  Why has it been introduced?  I suggest it was introduced to cloud the position and muddy the waters.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that responsible people in the field of organised labour will be carefully watching what he is doing.  People will say: &ldquo;Great, he is taking from the bank officials who have too much and giving it to us.&rdquo; That is the impression he is giving, but he is not promising it.  Therefore he can never be accused later of having said it, if and when he is challenged. The Minister suggested that consideration should be given to the abolition of bank service charges on personal current accounts.  I asked him to whom he suggested it?  Is he guaranteeing that the public will benefit from this saving if the bank officials do not get increases which have been negotiated and to which they think they are entitled?  Is this another part of the policy of the distribution of wealth? <Col N="1118" /> Is he now going to distribute the surplus wealth of the bank officials among the rest of us?  If so, why does he not say it?  He seems to forget that he holds the office of a responsible Ministry which was held in great respect when Deputy Brennan and Mr. P. Hillery were in office.  At that time we did not have the poppycock the Minister is now dishing out to this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that he hopes the banks will give the money to the public and not their employees, but he can give no such guarantee.  He knows that the profit, instead of reverting to the Irish public, could be very easily lodged outside the country.  Why does this great saviour of labour, this Minister who for so many years championed the cause of the worker against the banking institutions, not say that his concern from now on will be that the profits made by the banks will be kept at home and distributed among the Irish people?  Why is it that when the case of the bank employees comes before him, in an effort to thwart them he holds up this emotive alternative: do not give it to the employees and I will try to get it for you?  Why does he not boldly address himself, as he did in the past, to the question of profits made by banks?  In this proposed legislation it will be an offence for the banks, if they contravene certain sections, to give certain salaries to their employees. In other words, the banks and their employees will be breaking the law.  I am not a legal man but it seems strange that such a right should be given to anybody or any institution.</P>
    <P>My final point refers to the authorised officer.  We all know the confidentiality which exists between the banks and their clients and how well that confidentiality has been guarded up to now.  I know there is legislation under which a bank is obliged to give the Department of Finance certain information. But this is the only legislation I have ever seen where any Department&mdash;in this case the Department of Labour&mdash;may appoint its own authorised officer to go into a bank, allegedly in pursuit of information, get that information and remove it from the bank.  Is this the forerunner to what is going to happen next year or the <Col N="1119" /> following year, when another Minister, perhaps the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, will bring in similar legislation authorising their officers to enter banks and get information about the earnings of farmers or anybody on the land?</P>
    <P>This legislation is contrary to the spirit of collective bargaining which has developed in the country through the years.  It is legislation acting against individuals who are members of an organisation.  It excludes individuals in banks who are not members of the organisation.  It gives civil servants the right to enter banks and extract information. On both of those grounds, apart from others, I find this legislation most unwelcome.  It needs much more explanation and many more guarantees than have been given to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tunney did one good job today when he got the Minister to admit that he is not clear on some of his own legislation.  The Minister has kindly consented to try to sort out the confusion in his own Bill before the next Stage is taken. It is so ill-prepared that on its Second Reading today Deputy Tunney was able to come forward and point out the confusion.  The Minister had to leave the Chamber and probably he is now engaged with his officials trying to sort out the confusion in this frightful piece of legislation which has been so ill-prepared and is a complete reversal, for the second time, of the Minister's stated avant garde socialist beliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle is abhorrent to anybody who believes that we live in a state of free enterprise and free collective bargaining.  The big danger is that the Government are to blame: when they see an incompetent Minister who cannot lead his Department and give a headline in industrial or human relations he is not punished; he is simply permitted to bring in legislation to cover up his mistakes by suggesting that because the bank officials will not toe the line like the rest of workers legislation should be brought in to penalise them.  No matter what our callings are all of us <Col N="1120" /> should, in the pursuit of the common good, accept principles laid down by a competent body.  In this case the Minister is not competent.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a warning to every worker, whether he is a bank official or employed by a local authority sweeping the streets, that the days of Big Brother are almost here and if workers do not toe the line all the time the Minister will bring in suitable legislation to force them to do so despite the fact that it is the Minister who is at fault.  A few years ago the Minister started off with a grandiose promise of the new down in the socialist State of the 1970s.  Now we have a situation where 108,000 are unemployed.  Far from having a charter for the improvement of workers we are given here a piece of legislation which is badly drafted, unprincipled and confused, as the Minister has admitted.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the best thing the House can do is get rid of this Bill and let it be tested in the courts whether or not it is repugnant to the Constitution. It will be adjudicated on in the Supreme Court by competent people, whether or not one agrees with them. I cannot accept that the Minister is competent to bring in this legislation or to discern where the fault lies in our system.  We have a national wage agreement adopted by the vast majority of workers, but we find that because a certain organisation have objections to it the Minister brings in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney asked the question: does this Bill apply to members of the banking organisation only?  Those are the only people mentioned here.  Suppose there is a housing committee or a staff association who are not members of this bank officials' association, will they escape the legislation?  Will they be penalised?  Will they claim that under this Bill they are quite free to opt out and not be penalised?  Is this an overt attack on a trade union called the Irish Bank Officials' Association?</P>
    <P>We must warn the House and the people that the Minister in his clumsiness may have to embroil every section of workers.  I mean by workers all <Col N="1121" /> people who earn their living, whether by salary or wages.  That is why I refer to the coming of Big Brother.  In section 8 of the Bill the Minister is given power to appoint people to go in and inspect the bank accounts of an official. A bank official or a bank manager who contravenes the Bill could have lent money to a parochial or charitable society.  He could be penalised by the Minister and the money taken from the parochial society.  Section 5 (2) (b) spells out the organisations to which these men who are sent from the Minister to inquire into what the man did with his money can go.  We all know that in many parishes there are what are known as tontine societies, which are run purely for parochial purposes. Now we will find that State officials will be sent into small parishes and the local nominee of the parish priest will be called on to produce the books to show how much money the bank official has lent to this society.  He may be getting no interest on it, but the Minister will go after the man who lent the money to his local parochial society and if necessary seize that money in payment of the fine which the Minister hopes will be imposed on that official.  This is the type of legislation we are getting.  As one who had to listen to the Minister pontificating some years ago on the glorious epoch we would have in the seventies, I am amazed to find the same individual introducing penal legislation as I have pointed out in regard to section 5.</P>

    <P>My party's stand on ground rents was set out clearly before the local government elections a couple of years ago and was published, and it stated that Fianna Fáil would introduce legislation to stop the creation of future ground rents.  Existing ground rents can already be bought out at a reasonable price through legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil when in office.  Experience with the present legislation has shown a number of loopholes and we propose to amend the law so that these defects are immediately remedied and that the right to buy out the ground rent would apply to all.</P>

      <P>Prior to the last local government elections in 1973. In recent times the pattern of ground rents has changed somewhat in that large housing estates were built throughout the country and a large ground rent income created and subsequently sold to investors such as insurance companies.  Prior to that, ground rents were generally owned by big landlords, some of whom were resident outside the country.  In the thirties and forties it was quite popular for husbands to create pensions for their widows by buying ground rents as an investment for them.  The question of ground rents has been a thorn in the side of successive Governments but the real breakthrough was made by Fianna Fáil when, as a Government, they put on the Statute Book the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967.  It was acknowledged then and is now that this enactment did not go the whole way in curing the problem, but it was a very important step in the process of evolution which would eventually lead to the complete abolition of ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This piece of legislation basically allowed various categories of leaseholders to purchase compulsorily their ground rents.  This had the desired effect because since then <Col N="1123" /> ground rents have become more and more unpopular and it is now accepted both by the landlords who own the ground rents and most certainly by the lesses who pay them that they should be abolished and that they are a social injustice.  It is part of the Fianna Fáil package in relation to the ordinary householder that not only should he be relieved of the burden of rates but also of ground rents. Fianna Fáil now urge that legislation be introduced immediately to stop the creation of further ground rents.  We also urge that the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, be extended to remove the restrictions on tenants who are precluded by that Act from purchasing their ground rents.  This enactment should abolish the 25-year period below which a tenant cannot purchase his ground rent.  It should further abolish the restriction on buying out ground rents where the lease is not a building lease.</P>
    <P>The present Government have stated that this is part of their policy and the Minister for Justice said over a year ago that such legislation was in the pipeline.  But nothing has been done about it.  Most likely, his answer will be that he envisages more comprehensive legislation which will deal with all facets of landlord and tenant law and that it will take some time to prepare. The time has now well gone for that and we cannot accept this excuse.  If the Government were serious in the promises they made they can easily and quite quickly bring in the type of legislation I have outlined.  I believe it would be welcome in this House and would get a speedy passage through Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of ground rents which is more difficult and that is the abolition of ground rents altogether.  This aspect can be dealt with after the new legislation is enacted because it causes certain constitutional problems.  We are absolutely in favour of the total abolition of ground rents but we are acutely aware that this could cause constitutional problems and that by doing away with one injustice you might be creating another. <Col N="1124" /> The Constitution, in Article 43, guarantees the individual the right to private property and any attempt to abolish ground rents without compensation is, to my mind, likely to be unconstitutional.  It could be argued that it is not in accordance with the common good or the principles of social justice that ground rents should be imposed on tenants and the constitutional problems might be got over in this way.  However, this is a matter for further argument and it will obviously take a long time before it is remedied.</P>
    <P>There are many widows in the country at present who depend for their livelihood on the ground rents they receive and it could well be a grave injustice if they were deprived of that livelihood.  The organisations that constantly call for the immediate abolition of ground rents should see those possible injustices and realise that there is a problem in regard to complete abolition.  I think there is no problem, however, in bringing in immediate legislation to stop the creation of further ground rents and to amend the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, by removing the restrictions which at present prevent private owners from purchasing their ground rents if they wish to do so.</P>
    <P>In the past 18 months or so there has been quite a lot of speculation as to what action will be taken by the Government. In a letter dated 19th December, 1974, to one of his Cabinet colleagues, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>We, as a Government, decided last summer that legislation should be introduced to prohibit the creation of future ground rents on dwellinghouses.  I am enclosing a copy of a public announcement that was made at the time.  It may be taken that a provision to abolish existing ground rents without compensation would be set aside on Constitutional grounds. On the other hand, any question of a State compensation scheme would raise not only the immediate problem of finding the money but the equally important question whether, if the money were to be had, it <Col N="1125" /> would be right to use it to subsidise private owners irrespective of means, in preference to improving the lot of poorer people.  However, as the public announcement indicated, we are seeking to include in the new legislation proposals to lessen the difficulties regarding title and legal costs that are being experienced by persons wishing to buy out their ground rents under the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I expect that the proposed legislation (which will have to &ldquo;mesh in with&rdquo; comprehensive legislation that will deal with a large number of other landlords and tenant matters and that is at a very advanced stage of preparation) will be ready in the course of the next Session.</P>
    <P>There was, of course, quite a lot of publicity given to this.  On the 18th May, 1975, one of the political reporters of the <i>Irish Independent</i> wrote an article on it.</P>
    <P>A plan to enable many thousands of house holders to buy out their ground rents, without having to face huge legal fees, has been worked out by Government legal experts and agreed to by the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>It appears that this particular article is the result of a very well-informed leak from a member or members of the Government.  It does give the impression that positive action was being taken.  This interpretation, it seems, has been adopted by the correspondent because of the Minister's statement in the previous June.  I am open to correction on this, but I believe the Minister did say that legislation was being prepared and it was hoped to introduce it before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear that but, perhaps, it is just as well.  The delay in introducing legislation to reform the present position about ground rents is a cause of great frustration to many people who have to meet this annual bill.  At this point I would refer to the amendment to my motion by the Minister whereby the Minister wants us to accept that Dáil Éireann&mdash;which of course we cannot&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>... approves the Government's decision to prevent the creation of further ground rents.</P>
      <P>The Government made a decision and have done nothing about it.  They have left the whole thing hang, and this failure to introduce legislation is another example of the total lack of initiative in legal reform which this Government have displayed in almost three years of office.  I understand that there is a fair amount of consent between landlord and tenant alike that this rent should be abolished as soon as possible.  I believe the old arguments which landlords made in support of this rent have largely disappeared.  They were usually based on the principle that the ground rent system assisted good estate management, the maintenance of amenities, cheaper buildings' costs and so on.  This might have been true to some extent a long time ago, but in recent time the situation has completely changed.  Property values have soared in recent years, so that the ground on which housing estates are being built today are possibly more valuable than the house built on them. Therefore, the whole principle behind the ground rent system has altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, there have been some abuses by landlords in the exercise of the ground rent system.  It is well known that the purposes of some landlords are better served by allowing a property, especially an old property, to deteriorate to a point of almost complete dilapidation.  Then an attempt is made to buy out the leaseholders of that property and apply for planning <Col N="1127" /> permission for far more profitable development.  This obtaining of planning permission significantly increases the value of the property held.  Further abuse on the part of the landlord, which must be giving cause for concern, is the failure of the landlord to meet the obligation contained in most leases to maintain the property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a covenant would never be inserted in a lease creating a ground rent.  Invariably in a ground rent lease the obligation to pay would be on the tenant because he would be the person providing the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most significant developments in planning in Ireland in recent years has been the emphasis of planners and the responsibility laid on builders in regard to the provision of suitable amenities of landscaping in estates which were developed by them.  While undoubtedly this responsibility is accepted by everyone as essential to environmental control and proper standards in urban and rural areas nevertheless it is very easy for a builder, once he has completed a development, to collect the annual ground rent but to do nothing for the tenants in return, so that inevitably the obligation to maintain the environment of building estates has to be undertaken by the tenants themselves.  This responsibility might very well be transferred to the local authorities who should be able to maintain a uniform standard of amenities a planning standards for the environment of any building estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another argument advanced quite often in favour of the retention of the ground rent system has been that it enables builders to provide cheaper houses.  With inflation as it is and with soaring prices in this important area, that argument does not hold up any longer.  Nowadays we should provide as many incentives as possible for householders to maintain their property, even the gardens of the house itself, in as good a condition as possible.  One reason why existing tenants may not be anxious to indulge in that sort of expense is the ground rent system. The possibility of property reverting to <Col N="1128" /> the ground landlord because of a failure to pay ground rent is no incentive for people to lavish expense on their property.  There are significant restrictions on the right of tenants to purchase the fee simple of their properties. Such restrictions would have to be removed in any new legislation if the tenant were to get a fair deal. Many tenants, too, experience great difficulty in establishing title and meeting high legal costs.  We would all like to see positive efforts being made towards simplifying the procedure and, consequently, reducing costs.  I am told that cases can be cited in which the cost is prohibitive in terms of the property involved.</P>
    <P>If we accept that the continuation or the future creation of ground rents is a social evil and should be abolished, it follows that there should be set up some form of compensation fund which would not involve great cost to the Government but which would help to meet the hard cases of those who cannot meet legal costs. Likewise, the landlord can experience difficulties in connection with his own interests.  There is a constitutional difficulty in this regard but when consent exists between landlord and tenant the question of the landlord selling his interest on the grounds of suitable compensation should be easy.</P>
    <P>It would be possible to undertake immediate reforms in existing legislation. The Landlord and Tenants Acts 1958, 1967 and 1971 could be amended easily in order to enable them to apply to all long-term leases irrespective of whether such leases are building, proprietary or others.  The time limit of 25 years within which the ground rents can be purchased should be abolished.  This provision would apply, too, in cases where leases had expired or where a contract was not being signed by the landlord or tenant for the renewal of a lease.</P>
    <P>In Britain many of the technical difficulties encountered by a tenant when purchasing a ground rent were overcome many years ago in reforming legislation.  Similar legislation is needed urgently here.  The case for the tenant has been made today in the strongest possible terms but we are to a large <Col N="1129" /> extent in the hands of the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is accepted widely nowadays that anyone who purchases a house has a right to own that house as fully as is possible under our existing law and under our Constitution. The continuance of the anachronistic type of legislation which prevents that sort of ownership is a social evil. Therefore, there is an obligation on each of us to hasten the progress of reform legislation in this area.  The responsibility of ownership bestows the responsibility of care and of upkeep which originally was the responsibility of the landlord.  Given full ownership or a fee simple, as lawyers would say, house purchasers would be very happy to maintain their premises to the best of their ability.  This is an important factor in terms of the emphasis on environmental planning and so on.</P>
      <P>The Minister promised more than 12 months ago to introduce this legislation but something must have occurred since then to have caused this delay, a delay which is causing much frustration among those involved in the ground rents struggle, as it is known.  In correspondence with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister said that the legislation would be ready 12 months ago.  This promise was made known publicly.  The failure to bring it forward is resulting in people coming in conflict with the law.  For example, in the Sutton area there are 70 people who have been issued with decrees for the non-payment of ground rents.  It has been said that an irresponsible person, for personal and political purposes has guided those people this far.  This person does not purport to represent any political party but to represent a community effort at corporation level.  He has no solution now to offer those people except to tell them that he hopes to involve them in an expensive High Court action, an action which would not affect their liability for ground rents in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not being political in any way when I say that I have a certain sympathy for those people who are living <Col N="1130" /> in the hope that new legislation will get them out of their difficulties.  They have been living on hopes such as those expressed in <i>The Irish Independent</i> of May, 18 last.  They have allowed themselves to be guided into this situation by this corporation alderman who, apparently, is motivated by the question of personal publicity.  This is an extremely unfortunate situation.  Perhaps if the Minister had brought the legislation forward 12 months ago as promised, this situation would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>This party deplore the Government's inaction in relation to the ground rent situation.  We cannot accept the Minister's amendment even in the spirit in which it is meant. Instead of a Government decision of last June 12 months we want concrete proposals before the House, proposals which we can discuss fully.  All we should be concerned with in this House is legislation and I trust that this legislation will be before us as soon as possible.  I can assure him the House would welcome that legislation and he would have the best wishes of all sides in getting the measure through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister has delayed for so long has caused uncertainty as well as frustration.  The uncertainty is most harmful.  If the Minister had not been as definite as he was in his letter of 19th December, 1974, if he had not been as definite in the statement issued by the Government Information Services on behalf of the Government with regard to the decision, or if others who seemingly are in a position to receive well-informed leaks from members of the Government were not as definite in saying legislation was just around the corner and that it would be introduced shortly, things might have been different.</P>
    <P>Recently I met one or two individuals who are involved in an organisation that is concerned with ground rents and one of the gentlemen told me quite sincerely that he understood that the reasons the legislation was not introduced was that Fianna Fáil would not allow it to be <Col N="1131" /> introduced, that they were going to oppose it and that there was so much legislation waiting in the wings that the Minister had to take his turn.  If the Minister has the legislation ready and if he brings it before the House, we would be only too glad to facilitate him.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate because it enables us to clear the air with regard to certain misconceptions concerning ground rents.  I do not know who Deputy Collins met who gave him the impression that he was informed, presumably from this side of the House, that the legislation would be introduced but for the unwillingness of Fianna Fáil to receive it and assist its passage.  I have met various people with regard to ground rents and never has the Opposition's attitude been discussed because I assumed, from the history of ground rents, that the Opposition and ourselves would be of the same mind with regard to the problem generally.  I want to deny that and if a person made such a statement to the Deputy it was an attempt to sow trouble between the Deputy and myself.  I never put forward any such reason as being the reason for the delay in introducing the legislation.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of clearing the air because a number of misconceptions have grown up and a number of misunderstandings appear to have arisen.  Deputy Collins is critical of what he describes as a failure to introduce reforming legal measures but if he examines various statutes that have been introduced he will see that criticism is unjustified because it begs the question why so much reform is necessary.  The answer to that is that the necessary reforming legislation did not appear in the last decade and a half when it might have appeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come to a very pertinent example in the area of ground rents with regard to the prevention of the creation of ground rents.  When the Ground Rents Commission reported to my predecessor in 1964 they recommended that the creation of future ground rents in the case <Col N="1132" /> of residences and combined residences and businesses was undesirable.  If that recommendation had been accepted in 1964 and implemented in the Ground Rent Act, 1967, we would not now be debating the prevention of future ground rents.  However, my predecessors for reasons with which I do not agree&mdash;reasons which have to do with the question of the cost of providing houses because they had the mistaken idea that if they prevented the creation of ground rents at that time the cost of houses would rise&mdash;did not accept the recommendation.</P>
    <P>The failure of the then Government to accept what I think was the unanimous recommendation&mdash;I am subject to correction on this&mdash;of a committee of experts considering the question of ground rents left me with a mess.  If that recommendation had been accepted in 1967, there would be eight years less ground rents created.  The recommendation was not accepted for reasons which I think were bad.  They could be advanced today as strongly as they were adduced then; in fact, they were advanced but I rejected them and, on my advice, the Government took the decision to prevent the creation of future ground rents.  In 1967 the then Government partially implemented the report of the commission by introducing the Ground Rent Act, 1967, giving rather limited rights of compulsory purchase to ground tenants.  However, the decision has now been taken and it will be implemented in legislation.</P>
    <P>I have always been of the opinion that it is not enough just to give the right unless the exercise of that right is going to be reasonably feasible.  The working of the rather limited measure introduced by my predecessor gave a right that, in many cases, is not reasonably feasible to exercise.  In many cases&mdash;I speak from personal experience&mdash;ground tenants were inhibited from purchasing their ground rents because of the legal costs and the complexities of title that were often involved.  While the right was given, albeit in a limited sense, it was further limited by the practical difficulty relating to the conveyancing aspect of the purchase.  The Government <Col N="1133" /> accepted my advice that in the legislation to prevent the creation of future ground rents there should be a provision easing the burden of purchase on the tenant both as regards title and cost.  One will follow the other; if the title question is simplified, the question of costs will also be simplified.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Collins pointed out, the question of cost has been an inhibiting factor but that is not my fault. It is because of the limited nature of the legislation that was introduced.</P>
    <P>Very often the amount of cost involved exceeded the purchase price and was a disincentive to a ground tenant to acquire the fee simple. This has its origins in the complexity which can attend many titles, particularly the titles relating to ground landlords.  They may be very old and complex titles, with a great many legal incidents attaching to them, all of which make the conveyancing a complex and difficult matter which, in turn, adds to the costs of the conveyancers.</P>
    <P>The 1967 Act provided that the purchasing tenant would have to discharge the costs incurred by the ground landlord to his solicitor for making the title available.  This was a recognition by the Government of the day that there was a constitutional aspect involved and that, if this provision were not present, an element of confiscation would be introduced into the compulsory purchase, in so far as the purchase money coming into the hands of the ground landlord was calculated on a formula designed to ensure that that money would be equivalent to the property he was being compelled to sell, and, if that money were in any way diminished by reason of costs having to be paid, an element of confiscation would be introduced and the constitutionality of the transaction would come in question.  In recognition of that aspect, the Act of 1967 provided that the costs would have to be paid by the tenant.</P>
    <P>That was fine in theory but, in practice, this has worked out as a real inhibition against tenants <Col N="1134" /> freely purchasing.  That is why the Government took the desision, on my advise, that in the legislation to prevent future ground rents, there should also be provision to ease and simplify the purchase but, at the same time, avoid introducing any element of confiscation so as to preserve the constitutionality of the transaction.  The reason for the delay is the difficulty of devising a mechanism which will meet both of those objectives.  It would be a simple matter to direct that the landlord be not entitled to his costs, full stop. Then the position is eased but the constitutionality is immediately in question.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins stated that positive suggestions could be made as to how these title difficulties could be overcome.  I would be very pleased to hear them in the course of this debate.  It is a simple matter to say they should be overcome and suggestions can be made to have them overcome, but I can assure the Deputy and the House that a tremendous amount of thought has had to be given to this aspect which has been the reason for the delay in bringing forward legislation.  The prevention of the creation of future ground rents <i>per se</i> is not a difficult legal or drafting exercise but when it is married to the other leg which is necessary to implement fully the spirit of that decision, it becomes an extremely, tricky and difficult drafting problem.  Many minds have been brought to bear on it.  Various formulae have been devised and teased out.  They lead to practical or legal difficulties or constitutional implications and all these have to be got out of the way.</P>
    <P>However, a formula has now been defined and its drafting is now at an advanced stage.  I hope it will meet the two objectives without bringing in its train any of the objections I mentioned as being on the scene in this area.  I am apprehensive about putting a date on these things, having been disappointed in the past, but I hope we will have, in the very near future, a comprehensive piece of landlord and tenant legislation which will do what <Col N="1135" /> the commission recommended in 1964 and which my predecessor refused to implement.  It will prevent the creation of future ground rents.  I agree that ground rents are obnoxious and should be abolished.  This legislation will do that, but it will go forward the further important extra step.  It will do it in such a way that it will be a real benefit to the tenant.  He will be able to purchase without lumbering himself with a bill of costs and massive title deeds, a bill of costs that would far exceed the amount of the purchase price and a bundle of title deeds that would frighten any would-be conveyancer who might have to deal with that title in the future.</P>
    <P>I hope to deal with two defects in the legislation up to now: first of all, the failure to provide a simple mechanism for purchase and, secondly, the more glaring and obvious defect of the failure to avail of the opportunity in 1967 to abolish ground rents for all time.  Those two failures will be provided for in the forthcoming legislation. It will be an expensive measure because it will deal with the whole code of landlord and tenant right back to 1931.  Those of us who helped to deal with that branch of the law will be aware of its size, complexity and technicality, both from the point of view of all the statutes dealing with that field, and also from the mass of judicial decisions which have been delivered from time to time on landlord and tenant questions.  The question of ground rents is an integral part of this whole area.  That is why I felt this was not something which could be introduced in a separate Bill, that it should be married into the general landlord and tenant code, and so it will be.  It will not be introduced as a separate Bill.</P>
    <P>The other misconception which is current is that it is possible or desirable to abolish existing ground rents. I am glad of the opportunity this debate gives me to clear the air in that regard.  As a matter of policy, I am not in favour of the abolition of existing ground rents, not for any theoretical love of ground rents, but because of the practical difficulty that it <Col N="1136" /> is not possible to abolish them and remain constitutional unless compensation is paid at the same time.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Collins rightly pointed out, to abolish them without compensation, apart from the constitutional issues, would be to work a serious injustice on many people up and down the country who, <i>bona fide,</i> have come into possession of ground rent income and rely on it to stay alive. A serious inequity could be worked on those citizens, and they are entitled to justice in the same way as the person paying the ground rent feels he or she is entitled to justice.  Apart from the constitutionality of it, the balance of justice requires that ground rent should not be abolished without compensation.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in the letter to my colleague to which the Deputy referred, compensation raises two questions.  One is the availability of funds in time of scarce resources. Even in a time of affluence it raises the question of the priority of applications of State funds.  There are far greater priorities for the spending of State funds than the paying of compensation to landlords in cases where it is felt their ground rents should be compulsorily acquired.  We have to consider it as a hardship on the ground tenants.  I use the word &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; to point out the fact that it may be irksome to a ground tenant to have to pay this rent.  I personally feel it would be.  That is why I recommended to the Government that it should be abolished.  It is irksome and there is something distasteful about the principle.  Whether it is a hardship is something we could debate and it is something I would be very doubtful about.</P>
    <P>I feel quite strongly that the current campaign against existing ground rents, the campaign telling people not to pay existing ground rents, is somewhat exaggerated and does not reflect the general feeling of people paying ground rents.  I am aware of one Irish firm&mdash;I do not want to name it; it would not be proper to do so&mdash;with a large number of ground rents.  They offered these ground rents for sale on very advantageous terms, at a price <Col N="1137" /> about seven times the annual rent and with costs not exceeding £25.  The tenants to whom this offer was made showed very little interest in it and this leads me to believe that the agitation is, perhaps, more in the headlines than in the reality.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins mentioned a number of people who had decrees obtained against them.  I think the advice these people got not to pay the ground rent was extremely wrong and bad advice. If it was given in the expectation of there being legislation to abolish ground rents I would like here and now to take the opportunity of removing that expectation and saying to these people that to persist in a campaign of not paying their ground rents will only involve them in litigious processes, legal costs and difficulties.  The Government have no proposals to abolish ground rents for the two reasons I have given: it would be unconstitutional and the amount of compensation which would have to be paid to avoid the unconstitutionality would be such that it would not be justified in terms of social priorities.  There are far more pressing interests in need in the country than providing money for that purpose.  But the Government have taken a decision to prevent the creation of future ground rents and this will be coupled with a mechanism which will enable ground rents to be purchased at a reasonable cost and in a simplified way so the Deputies opposite can be assured that legislation is coming.  I am disappointed this legislation has not come before now.  I have indicated the reasons.  They are reasons of the immense technical difficulties in drafting a provision that will simplify title and, at the same time, avoid the element of confiscation.  I am sure all of us would regret devising legislation which would end up being declared unconstitutional.  Indeed, with regard to another measure, the Opposition have already indicated their concern and I am sure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The failure of my predecessor to accept in 1964, 11 years ago, the unanimous recommendation of the Commission on Ground Rents that future ground rents be prohibited has led to the present situation.  Had that recommendation been accepted and implemented, we would not have this difficulty now.  We hope to introduce a measure which will have within it a legal mechanism to make the purchase of existing ground rents worth while for the ground tenant. The Bill will be designed to cure both the existing difficulties in a way that will be of real benefit to the people and in a way that will be constitutional.</P>

      <P>I will certainly quote some of them.  I do not want to transgress the rules of order.  The Ceann Comhairle would only rule me out of order for being repetitious and it would not be my intention to disobey the ruling of the Chair.  It is very difficult for the Opposition and others to accept the Minister's undertaking that he will, in fact, introduce a Bill in the near future to abolish the creation of ground rents and make it easier for tenants to buy out existing ground rents.  The Minister said he would do this in the near future and then he said &ldquo;months&rdquo;.  When pressed as to how many months he could not be specific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested 12 months or 24 months and the Minister would not concede that maybe I was right and that I had, as it were, come to the truth of the matter and this particular problem will now be put on the long finger. What I object to is the Minister's sly legislative subterfuge in putting in this amendment to Deputy Collins's wellreasoned motion: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann deplores the Government's inaction in relation to ground rents.&rdquo;  That amendment is deliberately put in to ensure there will be no division because, <Col N="1140" /> when the Government introduce an amendment to a motion, that amendment takes precedence.  That is why the Minister's amendment is unfair.  It is almost as phoney as the recent amendment to the Verolme motion in which the Government called on themselves to do something. The only place the Government's decision can be is in legislation passed by this House and nowhere else.  This amendment is, therefore, phoney.  It should read: &ldquo;approves the Government's intention to prevent the creation of further ground rents&rdquo;. There is no Government decision as such.  A Government decision can only be found in legislation and there is no legislation.  We reject the Minister's undertaking.  We will not accept him as <i>bona fide</i> until such time as he introduces legislation&mdash;then and only then.</P>
    <P>The Minister has called on me to quote a number of quotable undertakings to identify, as it were, the stream of statements about the Government's intention to abandon the creation of future ground rents.  We know that in addition to the Minister for Justice the Minister for Local Government has called ground rents an abomination.  Deputy Collins quoted a number of statements from the Government indicating their intention to abolish ground rents and to introduce legislation to prevent the creation of future ground rents.</P>
    <P>To my certain knowledge a statement was issued by the Government propaganda services about the middle of 1974 to the effect that it was the Government's intention to prevent the creation of future ground rents.  An article appeared in <i>The Irish Independent</i> of 16th May, 1975, written by Chris Glennon, one of the political correspondents of that newspaper, on this subject.  It stated:</P>
    <P>A plan to enable many thousands of householders to buy out their ground rents without having to face huge legal fees, has been worked out by Government legal experts and agreed to by the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>If it has been worked out and agreed to by the Cabinet why has it not <Col N="1141" /> appeared in the House?  Mr. Glennon, in fairness to him, did not get this information off the top of his head; this information was provided through the normal Government services.  It was reasonable that he should print that information <i>bona fide,</i> which he did.  If he had information to the effect that plans had been worked out by the Government legal experts and agreed to by the Cabinet there is no good reason why the plans should not be before this House.</P>
    <P>Mr. Glennon's article continued:</P>
    <P>It is based on a system used by the Landed Estates Court, which went out of existence about 50 years ago, but which had power to give clear title to land where titles had been lost or where decisions could not be based on old titles.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary draftsmen are already putting the plan into the form of a Bill, which also will fulfil the Government's commitment to ban the creation of ground rents in the future.</P>
    <P>Despite pressure from tenant groups like the Association of Combined Residents' Associations (ACRA), there will be no provision in the Bill for the abolition, without compensation, of existing rents, assuming new and controversial significance in housing estates built around all the major cities and towns in the last decade.</P>
    <P>That raises a question of a very important nature: the longer the Minister puts off the bringing into this House of such a Bill the more new ground rents will be created.  Today new ground rents are being created bringing further hardship on those people who buy houses because, even if the Minister brings in this Bill during the next year, they cannot do away with their ground rents as such. My information is that leases were created yesterday and today and will possibly be created tomorrow and the next day imposing a great hardship on people.  It is most unfair.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from an interesting letter from the Department of Justice to my colleague, Deputy Seán Browne, our assistant Chief Whip.  This letter announces the time <Col N="1142" /> when the Minister intends to introduce the Bill.  The letter, dated 3rd February, 1975, was written to Deputy Browne arising out of representations to him from the residents in Enniscorthy, New Ross and Wexford town, where there is a serious ground rent problem.  The letter stated:</P>
    <P>Dear Deputy,</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Justice, Mr. P. Cooney, T.D., to refer to your letter of 25th January concerning legislation on ground rents, particularly in relation to the position of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>At this stage the name of the individual on whose behalf Deputy Browne was making representations was mentioned.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;whose lease has eight years to run.</P>
    <P>The Government intend to introduce legislation which will prohibit the creation of future ground rents on dwelling houses and the Minister hopes to be in a position to arrange for the circulation of the necessary Bill shortly after Easter.</P>
    <P>I can understand why the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has a smile on his face because Easter Sunday, 1975, was on 30th March.  How could we accept the undertaking of the Minister, given during the course of this debate, that he hopes to have this Bill before the House in the coming months?  The letter continued:</P>
    <P>As regards existing ground rents, the Landlord and Tenant Commission have recommended the extension to new classes of leases and yearly tenants of the right to acquire the fee simple that is given by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967.  These recommendations are contained in the Report of the Commission, entitled &ldquo;Report on Certain Questions arising under the Landlord and Tenant Acts, 1958 and 1967&rdquo; (Prl. 59), copies of which are abtainable from the Government Publications Sale Office, GPO Arcade, Dublin I (Price 17½p plus postage).  Legislation on the basis of these recommendations, which will have to <Col N="1143" />&ldquo;mesh in with&rdquo; the legislation to implement the Government's intention to prohibit the creation of future ground rents, is at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>
    <P>An advanced stage of preparation is one thing, but an advanced stage of passage through this House is another, and that is what motivated Deputy Collins to produce this worthwhile motion.</P>
    <P>The Minister's unfair method of avoiding division was by introducing his own amendment which then becomes the motion.  It is agreed by all that ground rent is an immoral rent. It is an abuse of our concept of social justice and a penal taxation.  I would go so far as to categorise it in the same way as I would rates and the effect they have on urban private dwelling houses.  We in Fianna Fáil over the year have been committed to the prevention of the creation of future ground rents and we illustrated that commitment through the passage of the 1967 Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act.  That showed our <i>bona fide</i> commitment to the whole question of ground rents.  We have committed ourselves to the abolition of rates on private dwellinghouses. All these things are nothing new as far as this side of the House is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Constitution provides that private property shall be protected against outside challenge or interference. We accept that requirement without demur and it leaves us in the difficult situation of trying to evolve a system whereby existing ground rents can be bought out.  You cannot abolish existing ground rents through any kind of instrument that can be brought into the House because I do not think it would be constitutionally on.  We have been advised that is the position.  It has been said people who own existing ground rents have a right which must be recognised and respected because the law and the Constitution should apply to everybody equally, to those who are subject to ground rents and who bear the fierce hardship of paying them, and to those who own ground <Col N="1144" /> rents as a particular type of investment.  Both sides of the problem have to be appreciated.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested he intends to introduce in his package of legislation in this area some method by which ground rents would be made easier on people, some system through which buying out ground rents would be made easier.  I hope that what the Minister means is that the burden of the purchase would be reduced to a minimum.  This is a very important point.  As Deputy Collins has said, the 1967 Act left certain categories of leases untouched.  We admit that piece of legislation proved to be not as worthy as we had thought it would be. We found that out after experiencing its workings over a period of years.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been prevaricating about introducing a Bill to prevent the creation of future ground rents immediately. We are giving him until after the new Dáil term begins because we know that the legislative process is so blocked up that the prospect of having this legislation produced and debated in the Dáil before Christmas is not on: the time is not there, again due to the Government's mismanagement and mishandling of the legislative process.  They have a great capacity for blaming the Opposition for obstrucing and holding up legislation. That is only another excuse for delaying legislation which is so badly needed in relation to the problem we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that in the matter of existing ground rents we might evolve a system equivalent to the Land Commission.  We might set up a board to buy out ground rents. This theory is undeveloped and it raises a spectre which would be of some concern to whichever Government happened to be in power&mdash;the cost of buying out blocks of ground rents. A board could be set up to examine the possibility of buying them out on a three- or four-year purchase.  The serious matter is that the money would have to be forthcoming to give effect to the conclusions of such a board and my only concern would be the cost, which would run into millions of pounds.  We must have our priorities right and I agree with the Minister's <Col N="1145" /> point of view that the priorities of the State demand that the State should not be asked to the detriment of other areas affected by lack of finance to buy out ground rents at enormous cost.</P>
    <P>However, this is the only way we can overcome the constitutional difficulty. If individuals, groups of individuals or companies have invested money in ground rents, the only way that can be dealt with is by the State buying these blocks or individual ground rents.  What one finds most offensive about ground rents is that an innocent house dweller goes into a house, having bought out the fee simple, and thinks he owns his property.  One of the great tragedies is that, in fact, he does not, because the ground landlord, if the ground tenant refuses to pay the ground rent, can come in on that property and take from the value of its sale the amount due and owing to him by the ground tenant.  This is an appalling hardship and a very wrong social concept.  I am afraid we must all share in the blame for having allowed such a situation to continue.</P>
    <P>The main burden of our argument during the course of this debate is that the longer the Minister postpones the introduction of the Bill to prevent the creation of future ground rents, he is guilty of their continued creation because they will continue to be created during that lapse.  It is an appalling prospect, is most unfair and is something the Minister should remedy as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>There is also the suggestion that the Opposition are in some way obstructing the passage of this type of legislation. In any reforming legislation the Minister for Justice has introduced in this House, or that introduced by any other Minister, which tragically has been very little, the Opposition have never been found wanting in co-operating.  Of course, we put down amendments to the legislation.  I do not think legislation should merely pass through this House as a matter of the Government's right.  The Opposition have an obligation to scrutinise legislation to ensure that it goes far enough or perhaps guard against its going too far. That is the undertaking we have continuously <Col N="1146" /> given the Government.  Unfortunately they are undertakings we have not had to honour too often, because the lack of legislation of a reforming nature has been tragic.</P>
    <P>During the course of the preparation of the motion in the name of Deputy Collins we had many discussions with various groups and many individuals concerned about the whole problem of ground rents.  If there was one common thread running through those discussions it was the feeling by ground tenants that they were paying money for nothing; that, as far as they were concerned, they were paying a barren tax.  One pays a tax and expects at least to get some form of return, either to oneself or to others for the common good.  But there is nothing good in ground rents; nobody has said anything in their favour over the past number of years; there is no case to be made for them.  We believe on this side of the House we have discharged our obligation to those individuals and groups who came to see us by placing this motion on the Order Paper.  The Minister's amendment is a gimmick; it is phoney in the extreme; it is wrong, unfair and unjust.  The only way we can have a decision is through legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There has always been a great degree of concern regarding ground rents.  They have always been considered an obnoxious form of recouping money from people who bought houses.  When people bought a house and asked why it was so expensive, they were told the price of land had gone up £X and, by inference, they felt they were buying the land when they purchased the house. Then they found that there was this obnoxious charge on their small piece of land which is so untypical of what we preach in this country at present. Certainly it completely lacks social justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews said the Minister's amendment was phoney.  Surely the only phoney thing about it is the inaction on the far side of the House.  Ground rents did not grow up overnight; they have been with us for some considerable time.  When a commission reported on them in 1964, some 11 years ago now, Fianna Fáil <Col N="1147" /> took no action.  When they introduced legislation in 1967 they did not accept that commission's report stating that no further ground rents should be created.  Instead they introduced a rather bad piece of legislation, which Deputy Andrews admitted it was.</P>
    <P>The Minister is endeavouring to bring before the House legislation which will stop the creation of any further ground rents and make it considerably easier for people to acquire their existing ground rents. There is no doubt that, while legislation was introduced to enable people purchase their ground rents, it was a rather expensive exercise in a lot of cases and people were put off by its cost.  If it does take some further months to ensure that good legislation is brought before the House, it will be worth waiting for.  When we introduce legislation in this House it should be effective and meet people's needs.  The cry about ground rents has continued for so long now that, when we do introduce legislation to deal with it, it should be acceptable, operable and make it easier for people to acquire the ground they should have possessed always.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the previous speaker's attitude to this.  He got an assurance from the Minister that the legislation would be introduced fairly soon.  It is fairly difficult to get legislation through this House now. Throughout the summer we had quite an amount of filibustering on excellent capital taxation.  It dragged on throughout the summer when we could have had other legislation passed as well.  The people on the far side of the House were not concerned about getting legislation on to the Statute Book but rather with delaying it.  If they want to point a finger for the blockage in legislation, then they should look at themselves, because it is they who caused the delay.  While I admit it is the duty of an Opposition to oppose, it must be constructive and meaningful opposition. I believe their tactics throughout the summer were neither.</P>
    <P>There is an amount of legislation required to be passed by this House. <Col N="1148" /> Fortunately, we managed to get the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Bill through a Special Committee.  The Misuse of Drugs Bill is another going through a Special Committee.  Hopefully, when this Ground Rents Bill is introduced, it will go to a Special Committee also because that type of committee work will prevent a backlog of legislation. There is no use in the Opposition crying that we are holding up legislation because we are not.  In fact the House sat longer this year than in any other year in its history, which is an indication of the Government's serious attempt to get legislation through the House.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the Opposition will not oppose the Ground Rents Bill when it is introduced and it should get a speedy passage.  It is up to the Opposition to ensure that this happens and that it is on the Statute Book as quickly as possible.  All sides of this House want this legislation passed so that the people can get their ground rents more quickly and that the creation of further ground rents will be stopped.  It is regrettable that Dublin people today are being led astray by individuals who tell them not to pay their grounds rents.  This type of advice is wrong.  It is not coming from any political party but from the representatives on local authorities. It is wrong to mislead the people in this way and to put them to costly litigation.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I asked where this type of special legislation stood.  This Bill affects the Irish Bank Officials' Association. Suppose another association opts out of the national pay agreement and refuses to accede to the wishes of the Minister in this respect, will we have more legislation to deal with that case?  This could bring industrial and <Col N="1149" /> human relations into chaos and disrepute. This is what we are doing here today.  For the second time in our history we are dealing with these officials through legislation.  I suggest that this is a reflection on the Government, and especially on the Department of Labour, because this patchwork legislation is trying to stop a gap here and a gap there, but there is no overall plan.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister give any guarantee that in a few years' time he will not bring in similar legislation, which will infringe on the liberty of the individual, to deal with any section of the community?  Section 5 deals with penalties and reads:</P>
      <P>A person guilty of an offence under this Act shall be liable&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £400, or</P>
      <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £10,000...</P>
      <P>It is also stated that he shall not be liable to imprisonment in default of payment of the fine.  In most civilised countries if a person cannot or, on principle, will not pay a fine, he can opt to go to prison.  If this Bill becomes law&mdash;and there is nothing we can do to stop it unless the courts find it unconstitutional&mdash;the law will demand the full penalty.  The bailiff may come to the guilty person's home, take any part of his furniture or property and sell it to pay the fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A charitable bank official may have been a member of the local parochial friendly society and loaned money to them.  If he is found guilty the law can demand that the local society worker give details of the money which the bank official loaned the society and that money can be taken to pay the fine.  This is not a figment of my imagination; it is written into section 5 of this Bill.  In the interests of decency and democracy the Minister should remove that section in so far as it affects parochial societies.  In my view, this is penal legislation because the law sets out to ensure that every last penny loaned by the bank official to the friendly society can be taken to pay his fine.  In his generosity this official may have loaned the <Col N="1150" /> money to the society to build a parochial hall or for other charitable work, but the State says that that money must be taken back to pay his fine.  It may be said that many people of the calibre of a bank manager do not invest in friendly societies, but that is not so.  If this Bill becomes law a bank official may transfer his funds outside this country where, if he is found guilty, the Minister cannot touch it.  Of course, unless he lives under very spartan conditions, he will have furniture and his house which can be seized and sold to pay his fine.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the fine can be of £10,000 for each day on which the offence continues.  This is not democratic legislation.  Section 5 (1) (b) reads:</P>
    <P>... on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £10,000, together with, in the case of an offence under section 3 or 4 of this Act which is a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding £10,000 for each day upon which the offence is continued.</P>
    <P>The best thing a bank manager who may fall foul of this Act can do is to transfer his money to South America or even nearer home where the laws prohibit the Irish Minister demanding that this money be sent back to Ireland to pay the fine of £10,000 for each day upon which the offence continues.</P>
    <P>This is absurd.  The man is alleged to have paid out money beyond the income limit set by the Minister.  At the moment we have rampant inflation and every section feel their incomes are not adequate.  I am not making a case for any officials to cash in on a general wage increase.  If these men and women are insisting on this it may be because we have such archaic industrial relations machinery. When no guarantee can be given to people that the value of the money they earn will hold its value for any length of time they look for various ways to increase their incomes to enable them to live according to the standards they have been used to.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any offence where a fine of £10,000 a day is imposed. <Col N="1151" /> How could any person pay £10,000 a day?  If a man owns a house, even in the most affluent suburb, and if he has saved money during his lifetime, could he pay £70,000 a week for very long or £3,650,000 a year if it went on that length of time?  What happens when the State have taken everything from that man and have left him standing in the suit he owns?  His family have suffered because their home and savings are gone.  The wife of the official and their young children may well have to go on to public assistance so the State will have to start paying out money to keep those people.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should go back to the Government and draw their attention to this absurd piece of legislation which we will probably pass tonight.  After the full penalty of the law has been inflicted on the erring bank manager or official and if it goes on for a 28-day month the man will have paid £280,000 in fines. As I said, very few people have that type of money.  The State then decide that, having taken everything off that man, they might as well go to somebody else in the bank and tell him that he also was part of this and must pay the fine as well.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the men who drafted this Bill or the Minister who brought it in have read it properly.  It comes down so heavily on bank officials that it defeats itself.  We must protest against this, even though we know that the majority of the Members of the House will pass it.  I have no power to say to the Minister that this must not be done but I can ask him, rather than having us look ridiculous before other democratic powers, to amend the section I am talking about.  Section 9 is not much better, but certainly in section 5 we could have a dreadful fine imposed.</P>
    <P>We can picture the circumstances in which this man has paid out this money.  He is dragged before the courts.  People may say that had the bank officials obeyed the law this would not happen.  If we do not protest, who can say that there will not be some other section involved in this <Col N="1152" /> tomorrow?  Is the Minister prepared to say now that, while he will not allow any person to be paid over the maximum allowed under the national wage agreement, he also will not allow anybody to be paid under the amount laid down in the national wage agreement?</P>
    <P>We ask the Minister to bring some kind of order and sanity into his dealings with the banks because, while it is the banks we are dealing with today, it could be some other section of workers tomorrow.  The Minister could then come in with a similar Bill, change the name of the association and&mdash;to show how generous he was&mdash; say that a man need not go to jail. It is laid down in the Bill that a man who is fined because of an offence under this Act shall not be liable to imprisonment.  The person will be driven to imprisonment in another way.  He will be made a pauper by having his home, savings and all his property taken from him.</P>
    <P>It will never be said of the Minister that he sent a man to prison because of legislation be brought in but, as Deputy Dowling said earlier, even though it is not written into the Bill, the most junior member of the bank staff could go to prison.  If he refuses to do certain things he could, under the ordinary civil law, be charged and sent to prison.  While the Minister spells out in section 5 that a man may not suffer imprisonment Deputy Dowling has proved that under the ordinary civil law he could go to prison on charges arising from an alleged offence committed under this Bill.  That may sound rather ambiguous, but the whole thing is ambiguous. If it is meant to promote good relations it is a hopeless failure.</P>
    <P>We have no guarantee that in another three years or even three months' time the Minister, because of his blundering in this field, will not have to come back again with new legislation.  We still boast that we uphold the right of free negotiation but there is no such thing.  When any future national wage agreements are being planned the Minister may well bring in the representatives of wage and salary earners and tell them that <Col N="1153" /> because of the state of the economy that this is the most that can be paid. To show that he is being fair to everybody, from the lowest paid worker to the highest paid executive, he may tell them he will ensure that nobody is penalised and that everybody gets a fair deal.  People are now likely to say, because of the Minister's mishandling of his Department during the last three years, that they will force the issue to the ultimate.</P>
    <P>Again, the lower-paid worker will suffer if there is any disruption in the bank service&mdash;it is not necessary to have the banks closed&mdash;because such a strike would not help the economy to grow.  We may well say to the bank people: if the Minister is proving irresponsible there is no reason why we should all lose our sense of responsibility and even at this late stage I would ask them also to accept the guidelines laid down even if they are not great guidelines because I fear that if the Minister continues his rake's progress untold damage will be done to the economy and to the trade unions in general.  While I do not know whether the Irish Bank Officials' Association is registered as a trade union or not, if it is in the context of a workers' organisation it probably is and we may see some other association being similarly penalised at the rate of £10,000 a day.</P>
    <P>We have always considered the higher bank officials to be in the better-off section but can one imagine a man in an institution smaller than the bank suffering the same penalty of £10,000 a day and lasting very long?  He could not last at all.  Having seized the man's goods and his meagre savings, what could the Minister do then?  He would not have paid his fine.  Would the Minister then come along with some other idea to ensure that this vicious piece of legislation is fully implemented and make people toe the line?  The Minister's handling of the matter is shown in this Bill. Last Friday when the Minister saw the bank officials he said he would withdraw the Bill if they did certain things.</P>

      <P>Perhaps he does or, perhaps, that is wishful thinking on our part.  We hope he will come round because if this absurd Bill goes through and if the Minister thinks that there are many people who can afford to pay £10,000 a day, he will have a rude awakening. Perhaps one or two individuals may be able to last for a very short while but if they could afford that kind of money, they would not tie themselves to working in a bank.</P>
      <P>What annoys me about the Bill is the hypocritical attitude by which the sacredness of the individual is being upheld by saying that he cannot go to prison.  You can bankrupt the man, penalise his wife and children but in the sacred name of democracy, according to the Minister, he must not be sent to prison.  If the law exacts its full penalty and the man is impoverished, the State must help his wife and children to prevent them from starving.  This is what the Minister would describe, perhaps, as socialism in the 1970s a phrase we heard <i>ad nauseam</i> from the Minister when he was on this side of the House.  If that is socialism in the 1970s, very few will want to have anything to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should drop this hypocritical stand and stop raiding the coppers of the parish fund&mdash;he would have power to do that under this legislation.  If some of us feared an Orwellian situation would arise, we have proof here that it is on the way. When Orwell wrote <i>1984</i>, he took that as the year in which Big Brother would appear and tell us all how to run our own lives.  We have entered the year of Big Brother in 1975 and this Bill can only be seen as a vital part of the Orwellian situation.  We must point out what the Bill contains. The Minister has admitted that he was somewhat confused about whether the Bill applied only to the Irish Bank Officials' Association or whether it could apply to other organisations.  I believe it applies only to the Irish Bank <Col N="1155" /> Officials' Association but tomorrow or next week it could be some other association or trade union.</P>
    <P>In most countries there is a battle between democracy and certain subversive elements but in this case the State is joining in with £10,000-a-day fines and the Minister demanding the full penalty, an initial fine on indictment of £10,000 and after that £10,000 per day.</P>

      <P>Did we ever think we would see such fines in this country?  With that, I shall reserve further comment for Committee Stage.  I had hoped the Minister would pay the House the courtesy of sitting here for the debate: perhaps it shows his contempt for the House when he is not here and, indeed, the contempt of the Government for this legislation, because the whole afternoon, while the Fianna Fáil benches had quite a number of Deputies sitting there waiting to speak, there was but one or two on the Government benches.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Committee Stage would bring in other Deputies on that side, but one can understand their distaste at having to sit here and even give tacit support to this Bill.  If it is in order, I want to suggest to the Minister that he might well bury this Bill and do some constructive thinking.  He could ask himself why the bank officials are proving so difficult, why they are being so obdurate.  Is it because they <Col N="1156" /> feel they have a tremendous case?  Is it because they feel they must maintain their standards, which they have achieved over the years, at a certain level?  Most of us, in any job we are in, try to do the same thing.  We do not give in easily if our standards are being lowered.</P>
      <P>I suppose the Minister can make a good case by saying that the economy is in such a frightful mess at the moment, that that is necessary. Maybe it is necessary, but what is more necessary is that the Minister should retain some sense of proportion and not show anger at being thwarted by a body of organised workers, to whom it must be very galling that he paraded his great principles here when in Opposition and now shows that he can propose rather vicious legislation.</P>
      <P>It may well be taken by the mass of the people that it is only the bank officials that are involved, that they are well paid and so on.  That is today. Who knows whose case it will be tomorrow. The Minister in his brief used the usual clichés and platitudes, the rejuvenated uprising economy, GNP and so on.  That may sound impressive but it all adds up to the Minister indulging in wishful thinking that something will happen in the next year which will obviate the necessity for him to have a look at the next national pay agreement.</P>

      <P>It is mentioned in the Minister's brief, but I shall not pursue it.  What I do say is that he should reconsider this for the sake of future Ministers for Labour who will follow him&mdash;very soon, I hope&mdash;and who will have to take out the poison which this legislation has put into the wells of industrial relations.  We as a democracy should not have to look back and say we acquiesced in this matter. We on this side of the House are very mindful of the state of the economy and we certainly will not do anything rash to worsen matters for the people. At the same time, we must warn the Minister that we cannot go on watching his incompetent performance, for which he is not being penalised but <Col N="1157" /> for which many of the people are being penalised.  If we are to have any hope of industrial or, as I would prefer to call them, human relations, then the big stick must be withheld, and we must appeal to the people concerned, particularly the bank officials to take cognisance of the fact that the economy is in a bad way and that if any organisation are to draw the wrath of the Minister upon them they may well have to have this type of legislation introduced in their case.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that the bank officials should not be made the victims of this incompetent legislation. I appeal to the Minister and his colleagues to take this Bill back now, to try to bring in some commonsense legislation and drop the absurd fines which are envisaged here.  There is provision for a £10,000 fine per day, while in the same section there is a threat to raid the coffers of the provident and friendly societies in order to take the money from the bank officials because the banks have erred in the opinion of the courts, in paying out a wage or salary greater than that which the Minister thinks is adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a discussion on the Second Stage of this Bill, this measure which circumstances forced me to reluctantly bring before the House.  There has been no wish on my part to single out bank employees for any special treatment.  Rather, it has been my attempt in my contacts with them to pursue an argument and to get their acceptance to the proposition that bargaining concluded in their area with their employers should be in general conformity with bargains agreed upon by other categories of workers, in this case the national agreement.  I accept that they are not signatories to the national pay agreement and that, therefore, what they concluded in their area should not be subject to every detail of the national pay agreement.  In the economic situation facing us, it is quite clear that the incomes of all groups must relate to one another and must conform to a general orderly pattern. I do not believe that legislation in the area of relations between employers <Col N="1158" /> and employees is any substitute for agreement.  It is not.  In my meetings with the bank officials I repeatedly expressed my conviction that voluntary agreement was far superior to any kind of settlement brought about as a result of legislative intervention. That has been my position throughout, and was my position when I met the bank officials at our last meeting on Friday, when I offered to withdraw the legislation on their undertaking to transmit their claim to the court for adjudication and to abide by the Labour Court's decision.  In the event of such undertakings by them I was to scrap all legislative proposals.  They did not find themselves in a position to accept that approach.</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, it has been my endeavour in this area to banish the problems associated with the past, a past that was characterised by a great deal of Government intervention.  The previous Government were very perturbed in relation to settlements in the bank sector.  It has been my ambition to close that chapter and to see the pay agreements of the bank officials and the national wage agreements operating side by side.  We had achieved the happy position that the current agreement of bank employees as well as that of the previous year were leading in the direction of general comparability with the settlements under the national wage agreement, but this trend was upset because we did not succeed in getting the same kind of response from this sector that we got from those who were covered by the national wage agreement.  It is solely because we were unable to get this response from the IBOA that this legislation is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies raised various questions and I shall endeavour to deal with these as quickly as possible.  Deputy Fitzgerald said that by not paying increases employers were escaping the provisions of the national wage agreement. That is a view point, but there is a provision within the present agreement whereby employers can plead inability to pay but the inability must be justified before the Labour Court.  Also, the employer must disclose his financial statement <Col N="1159" /> to the technical assessors appointed by the Labour Court.  Therefore, it is not correct to say simply that there is a means within the present agreement of evading one's obligations. The agreement comprises a carefully laid down procedure to ensure that only in cases of justification can increases be withheld.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald made the point also that this measure is being undertaken by the Government without due consideration being given to all its possible effects.  While the Deputy is entitled to his opinion, the facts contradict that viewpoint.  He suggested that perhaps I could use section 24 to deal with the problem.  In this regard I would ask him whether any previous Minister for Labour has used section 24 more frequently than I have used it.  On average, I have resorted to it about once a month. The possibility of having recourse to section 24 was offered to the IBOA, but there was no agreement on their part to this course.  Therefore I deny that this measure is a product of any hasty action on our part.  Rather it is a response forced on us by circumstances. We have not singled out this category of employee for special treatment. Deputy Dowling persisted in making a point that he made a couple of years ago when we discussed this Bill first: he sees this legislation being linked directly to a Bill brought in by his own party&mdash;the one dealing with the ESB situation.  The Deputy is making a comparison between what are two totally different instruments, and the difference is that there is no penalty in the present Bill in so far as employees or their unions are concerned. This legislation which was drawn up in 1973 is on the lines of the general legislation that is in operation under the Wilson Government in Britain, that is, the reserve powers which they are using and which have no penalties directed towards employees or their unions.  The penalties in this Bill are directed against the employer, and in view of the heavy nature of the fines proposed it is doubtful if the banks could afford to break the law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling makes the point <Col N="1160" /> that those who would break the law in this way could be jailed.  If the Deputy were to break the law by assaulting some passers-by on his way home or by any other misdeed, he, too, could be jailed.  This Bill confers no immunity on anyone in so far as jail is concerned.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowling asked whether the Bill would apply to credit unions.  In this regard I would refer him to section 2, which defines banks and their subsidiaries for the purposes of the Bill and does not include credit unions.  The Deputy referred also to the question of authorised officers.  These can be officers of any Department of State and they can be identified by their warrants of appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To allay any other worry the Deputy might have about their possible appointment.  I should like to tell him that they would be appointed by Departmental competition.  They would probably be appointed on the same basis as the inspectors of the present JIC.  If the Deputy's imagination is troubled by jackbooted commissars <Col N="1161" /> walking into the banks throughout the country, coming in and pinioning people to the wall, leading them off to untold torture in various dungeons, he can let his imagination rest.  That will not happen.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowling spoke at length about sheriffs and Christmas presents, including batteringrams. I think he used the phrase &ldquo;parcels of battering-rams&rdquo;.  In view of the cost of postage at present it would be rather expensive to send a battering-ram by post.  The question was also raised regarding savings on bank charges and I have made such a suggestion. The central power of this Bill is that the Labour Court would adjudicate on a particular claim&mdash;I will not have that power under this legislation&mdash;and, if there were any savings accruing to the banks as a result of such adjudication, I have suggested that consideration be given to the question of abolishing charges on current accounts.  That is a matter to be considered when the Labour Court have adjudicated and, at that stage, one would hope for some response from the bank authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tunney referred to the question of authorised officers but I think I have answered that.  He also spoke about confidentiality.  Of course, such officers would be civil servants and would be bound by the Official Secrets Act.  Therefore, there would be no danger of any confidential information being disclosed to other persons. Deputy Tunney asked the question what other workers have accepted modification of their agreement.  The answer to that is that the majority of workers, certainly all those covered by the national wage agreement have accepted voluntary modification of the last two phases of the agreement.  It is because we have been unable to get that kind of agreement on the part of <Col N="1162" /> bank officials, because of their refusal to accept a voluntary modification, that we are forced on this legislative measure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney wondered what banks are covered.  Section 2 defines what is meant by the term &ldquo;bank&rdquo;.  It covers all banks that hold licences under the Central Bank Act, 1971, and it also covers the subsidiaries of such banks.  The Deputy asked if the banks got the anomaly claims being made by teachers, civil servants and others.  That is really a question to be answered by the IBOA as they conducted negotiations with the banks.  There is no specific mention in this legislation of increases based on anomalies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney asked if it was proposed to take action in relation to the 1974 banks agreement.  That is a very good question because it gives the lie to those who say that this is precipitate action, hastily conceived, all the usual epithets that are applied when one is forced to take a given course of action. The hurlers on the ditch crowd in at that stage and say it is too soon or it is too late, that it is precipitate or is unwise.  However, it is the job of the Government in any eventuality to take a decision, subject to all the frailties or the possible mistakes such a decision may be heir to.  The accusation cannot be levelled at us in this case that we have been ignoring the problem in the last year or two.  The 1974 bank agreement was referred to the Labour Court for adjudication and they adjudicated it to be in accord with the national wage agreement.  I have made this point to officials of the association in my discussions with them.  In order to be fair to them I agree with their assessment. They have said they are not signatories to the agreement and I accept that.</P>
    <P>They have said that comparisons of their agreement and the national wage agreement in any one year would not give their true position and I accept the justice of that point of view.  I am in agreement that we would have to look at both the 1974 and the 1975 agreements because it is only when both agreements are taken in combination that we see that they are roughly on course with the present <Col N="1163" /> national agreement.  This course was quite satisfactory until the question of amending the national wage agreement arose.  As Deputies know, that occurred after the Government initiative last June when other people amended the agreement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney made the point that an offence by the banks would <i>ipso facto</i> lead to breaches of the law by bank officials.  I do not see the logic of this argument.  Banks will be guilty of offences if they break the norms laid down by the court after passage of this legislation.  The banks would be breaking the law and there would be an order declared which would ensure that the proper penalties would be visited on anyone who breaks the law in this connection.  If the banks are guilty of such offences, it does not follow that the officials would be guilty of any offence.  The question was asked if the legislation applies to house associations not connected with the IBOA.  The legislation applies to all banks who are holders of a licence for the time being in force under the Central Bank Act, 1971.  To Deputies who might be worried about this, I would emphasise that this legislation does not apply to tontine societies. I think it was Deputy Moore who suggested it might.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

There is nothing to stop Deputies opposite or anyone else doing this. I do not propose to send it there because I am happy enough that it does not conflict with any constitutional provisions.  However, I emphasise the point that it is the right of any person to refer any piece of legislation to the Supreme Court.</P>

As the Deputy knows, the Government have indicated in relation to a piece of legislation we will be discussing tomorrow, the Criminal Jurisdiction Bill, that we are quite happy to see it referred to the courts to test its constitutionality.  Opposition to any Bill should not be based simply on reference to the courts.  Deputies should be aware that anybody can do that at any time.  It is the appropriate thing to do where there is any doubt about any piece of legislation.</P>

If the banks were not in breach of the 1974 agreement why has the Minister made the Bill retrospective? Secondly, how does the Minister know whether or not they are in breach of the agreement when he did not invoke section 24?  That would be the official way of ascertaining whether there was a breach.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to envisage what could happen when workers decide to take industrial action in the teeth of legislation.  The Minister is powerless to deal with the ensuing débâcle.  One has to move rather gingerly and with the greatest caution, because legislation is the last resort if we cannot find another peaceful way of coming to agreement.  There is nothing in this Bill to deal with that sort of situation.  I would not like to anticipate the very unpleasant situation that might arise.  Does the Minister contemplate action should this eventuality occur?  I am still not quite clear about the agreements.  They are deliberately in the plural.  The agreement of 1974 is definitely included.  If the Minister found the bank officials were in breach of that agreement he could take retrospective action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In this definition section we point to national agreements. We deliberately have national agreements in to be fair to the bank <Col N="1172" /> officials.  One must consider in combination the agreements of 1974 and 1975 and only by taking them together will one appreciate that the officials this year sought to recoup for themselves the relative loss they incurred in 1974.  To be fair to their argument&mdash;and I have made no bones about the fact that this is the only fair way to see it&mdash;one must take together the 1974 and 1975 agreements they negotiated.  In our examination in the Department of Labour we took together the 1974 and 1975 bank pay agreements.  When they were taken together they were comparable to the combined 1974 and the unrevised 1975 national agreements.  The problem is that it is the unrevised national agreement of 1975.</P>
      <P>The problem arises in that while we achieved on the part of those covered by the 1975 national agreement a revision of the third and fourth phases, we did not get a similar response in the case of the bank officials and that is why this legislation is necessary.  The Deputy referred to the position in the aftermath of possible strike action.  In the legislation with which he was identified, which I opposed, there was provision outlawing strike action; certainly it deprived the people concerned of the protection of the 1906 Trade Union Act.  From the benches opposite I opposed that measure on the grounds that it was impracticable, as it turned out to be.  The Deputy knows that people ended up in jail and later taxis was sent to take them from the jail because the provision was seen to be inoperable.  No democracy can ensure that people will not go on strike if they feel sufficiently frustrated about any situation and they must be free to withdraw their labour.  No legislation can prevent them from doing so.</P>
      <P>This Bill has no clause in it preventing strike action.  If the IBOA take strike action this year, or next year, after the passage of this Bill they will still enjoy the protection of the Trade Union Act, 1906.</P>

At its best the Bill is only a <Col N="1173" /> gesture to show the determination to keep all parties in line over the agreement. I am not satisfied that the inclusion of the 1974 agreement was in the best interests of the officials. The Bill states: &ldquo;If the Minister is satisfied that in order to maintain, in the national interest, general adherence to the national agreements&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; There is no indication there that if they did not get all they should have got under the 1974 agreement it should be taken into account in the 1975 agreement, that the two of them be taken together.  The section refers to adherence to these agreements but not to the benefits that may be derived from the possibility of their having been below the maximum they could have received under the 1974 agreement.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows that the situation arising under this section is confined to four banks, the Associated Banks.  The association with which the Minister was negotiating caters for the officials in those banks and not in any of the many banks mentioned in this section.  There is a subtle reference to banks generally in this section although the Minister knows that the area of operation would be confined to the four banks. The Minister is being subtle in this regard.  He is acting against the employees in a subtle indirect sort of way because the association concerned negotiate on behalf of the staffs of those banks.</P>
      <P>What implication will this Bill have in regard to the situation whereby this association also negotiate with the banks in the Northern part of our country, in view of the fact that successive Ministers there have been lenient to the officials and treated them in a special category class because of the overlap that exists here?

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the two sections which I believe represent the main approach of the Minister. Subsection (1) reads:</P>
      <P>Where any banks, whether before, on or after the commencement of this Act, pay or agree to pay increases of remuneration to any of their employees or amend or vary or agree to amend or vary any other terms or conditions of employment of any of their employees so as to provide improved or more favourable terms or conditions of employment for them&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the Minister may refer the matter to the Labour Court,...</P>
      <P>This section, and section 4 are all embracing. In effect they mean that in regard to any improvement in working conditions detected by one of these inspectors to be appointed by the Minister and reported to him the Minister may, if he so wishes, then decide to refer this&mdash;even if it is of a trivial nature&mdash;to the Labour Court to have the matter investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, on this section, might I ask the Minister how this stands with regard to equal pay which, despite the Minister's statement this evening, has not yet been enacted in full in the banks but will on the 1st January next?  Will we have an anomaly here? If equal pay is implemented on the 1st January next can we, under this section and section 4, have one of these inspectors reporting to the Minister and the Minister getting the Labour Court to investigate the fact that the banks have implemented equal pay?  We want the Minister to explain to us how he will get over that anomaly.  Which comes first? It is my understanding that the newer legislation supersedes the former where they are contradictory.  I submit <Col N="1181" /> there may be, and probably will be, a contradiction in terms there.  If we relate it back to section 2 and its definition of &ldquo;bank&rdquo;, the bank can be all embracing, plus its subsidiaries. Deputy Dowling made the case a moment ago that a hotel could well be a subsidiary of one of the banks. It could be a hire purchase company, or any place else where equal pay has not yet been implemented but will be on the 1st January next.  If equal pay is implemented does it mean that the Minister, his inspectors or his Department may invoke section 3 of this Bill to have the matter investigated by the Labour Court and what will be the outcome?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the general legislation is necessary here to ensure comparability with the national wage agreement.  There is nothing in the national wage agreement that militates against advance towards equal pay.  Therefore, this legislation does not concern itself with the issue of equal pay.  It is a Bill designed, if you like, to ensure conformity with the national wage agreement in one area.  Therefore, it constitutes no danger to the principle of equal pay, whether totally realised or otherwise in the banks.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the point the Minister is making if he reads the Title of the Bill and then reads section 3 in relation to that Title it would appear that when the banks pay or agree to pay increases of remuneration to any of their employees that can be referred to the Labour Court for investigation. There is nothing there that refers to the national wage agreement or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the comprehensiveness to which he refers here is necessary in the circumstances.  There have been unhappy experiences in the past of attempts to see that settlements in this area conformed to the national wage agreement.  In view of that the comprehensiveness of this section is necessary and I am indebted to the draftsman of past Administrations for its <Col N="1182" /> comprehensive nature here.  It is necessary in the circumstances.  Of course, I have made it clear that I will not be determining wage rates in this area. That will be for the Labour Court. The Labour Court will simply adjudicate for some weeks and, once they come out with their assessment of the situation, that would be the authoritative regulation.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will accept from his experience here that what a Minister intends is one thing but what appears in the Act is another thing.  That is what will guide people and will be interpreted later. After much pressure the Minister has been specific about one matter, that is, that this legislation is intended solely for bank officials who are members of the Bank Officials' Association.  If that is so, why in section 3 does he refer to employees generally?  Earlier he told us that all other employees were well behaved and had nothing to fear.  Why does he not specifically name the organised labour within the banks as the organisation for which the legislation is intended?  He told Deputy Dowling that it was not a matter for him to adjudicate and that he will take the recommendation of the Labour Court.  Section 3 (1) (b) (ii) requires of the Labour Court to&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...furnish a report thereon to the Minister together with such recommendations <Col N="1184" /> (if any) as it thinks proper,</P>
    <P>This leaves a way out for the Labour Court.

      <P>This is the operative section of the Bill because it lays down the procedures which are: the Minister asks the Labour Court to examine any agreement made by the banks and bank officials and report to <Col N="1186" /> the Minister.  If action is required the Minister takes the action thereafter. How does the Minister ascertain if this is necessary?  Does he send in an authorised officer to look at the books?</P>
      <P>If the Minister feels that a wage agreement by the banks is in breach of one or other of the national wage agreements he may ask the Labour Court to examine it, the Labour Court shall report and the Minister takes the necessary action.  If he decides to take no action, that is published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and any previous order he made becomes nullified. In such a case, how could he examine it again?</P>
      <P>Section 3 (1) (c) states:</P>
      <P>if, having considered the report of the Labour Court in relation to the matter, the Minister decides not to make an order under section 4 of this Act in relation thereto, he shall, as soon as may be, cause notice of his decision to be published in the <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> and, if an order was made under this section in relation to the matter, thereupon it shall, for the purposes of the entitlement of any employees to whom it applied to any increases of remuneration or amendments or variations of any other terms or conditions of employment, be deemed never to have been in force.</P>
      <P>I confess I cannot understand this.  If an order was made by the Minister previously it is nullified by his not making an order now.  It might be regarded as completely extraneous matter in referring to the equality of women and equal pay.  If wages were found to be in excess of the renegotiated national wage agreement and that increase only brought female staff into line with the requirements of equal pay for women, would the banks still be made rescind the agreement and not pay that amount to the female staff?  I am not a stickler for decorum but the Minister did not stand once when he answered any of our questions.</P>

      <P>This is a pretty tough section.  I have been trying to follow the Minister's argument all day in relation to the conviction on indictment.  This is aimed at the bank directors and management if they pay a figure over and above the stated amount.  The Minister has been trying to take the heat off himself by saying that they had not hit at the worker or organised labour.  This is a glaring case where they have.  They are not going to fine them but they will make absolutely sure that by imposing a fine somewhere else the money will not be paid to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> The Minister is trying to argue that there is no penalty in the Bill for workers but, of course, there is.  This is why we pointed out earlier that we were not in favour of such legislation, that we preferred a different approach to industrial relations.  We abhor the idea of a fine being imposed because of increases granted.  It is the banks who will have to pay this money.  This is basically the people's money which they have paid into the banks in small and large investments and other accounts.  What back-up can the Minister give us to the statement he made during the Second Stage debate that if there was a savings he hopes it will be passed on to deposit accounts and to borrowers by a reduction in bank charges?  Would the Minister elaborate on that statement? I asked him during the Second Stage if he had conveyed his own idea to the banks because I believe he mentioned on radio yesterday that this was his considered opinion.  It cannot be unless he has conveyed it to the banks and made them aware of the situation.  I hope he will explain in detail what steps he has taken and what progress he has made.</P>

      <P>It is a reasonable enough maximum.  The tontine societies are not covered by this legislation and are not intended to be referred to.  Let us assume, first of all, that a bank director broke the law or that the person in charge of the assets broke the law.  The fines would be levied on his property only in the event of his having property in a credit union.  This is not the most likely place that a bank director would have assets.  It is only in such an unlikely event that his assets or his property would come under this.  Only if he had assets in such a strange quarter or in a tontine society would his property be levied. I do not know how many bank directors are members of a tontine society or have assets in them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is most repulsive in its present form even though one agrees that the penalty section must include penalties.  Earlier, I referred to this as the battering-ram section.  I want to explain why and ask the Minister to explain what is involved. The section says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who is fined upon conviction of an offence under this Act shall not be liable to imprisonment <Col N="1190" /> in default of payment of the fine, but the court by which the person is convicted may by order direct that payment of the fine be secured by the seizure, entry into possession and, where necessary, sale of the property of the person by the appropriate sheriff...</P>
    <P>It appears that if the person convicted does not pay the fine and endeavours to secure himself against the sheriff he will be convicted under another Act and can be imprisoned, according to the Minister.  I ask the Minister to modify this so as to ensure that in the event of a man's house being seized by the sheriff and sold the wife and children will not be victims of this vicious section as it now stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that little or no consideration was given to the problems of the innocent parties, the wife and children when the Minister inserted this provision.  The Minister will probably run out of sheriffs if action is taken in this way. I hope the section will be modified. Property includes a variety of things other than what one would normally think of as property, shares, debentures, rights or interests in shares or debentures, securities of the Government, or securities of any local authority and rights in respect of money lent to or deposited with any industrial and provident society, friendly society or building society. Could the Minister explain the extent of the implications of this?</P>
      <P>Section 5 (1) (a) states that on summary conviction a person found guilty of an offence under this Act shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £400. Assuming a bank official purchases a large section of land and for that purpose it would be quite likely that he would have an overdraft, where will the Minister extract the £400 if the man has no property other than land?  He cannot take land.  What will he do in that case?  Will the Minister modify this section?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to modify it but this is meant as a deterrent <Col N="1191" /> to ensure that the law is complied with.  I think the law will be complied with and that the various eventualities envisaged by the Deputy will not arise. In the unlikely event of the law being infringed and these penalties becoming due, one would expect that if an offence were being committed that the management of the bank would not allow an official acting on their direction to pay a fine out of his own assets.  The funds of the bank would probably be employed.  That is a very unlikely event because the penalties are heavy and the reason why the law is being invoked is essentially rational. I do not visualise this section becoming a reality.</P>

      <P>While what the Minister says is commendable, he might be making the same mistake as is made in earlier sections.  It is not enough to say that because of the way in which he anticipates certain developments, it may not occur.  We must be concerned with the actual wording of the Bill and what will appear in the Act.  It is a little unusual to have in any section that to which it does not refer.  I think he is catering for a certain emotion and endeavouring to quell what he regards as a possible emotional reaction by saying: &ldquo;We will not put anybody in prison.&rdquo; Having regard to his alternative, it might be better if he did.  I do not see any virtue in saying: &ldquo;We will not send you to prison but we will take the roof from over your head.&rdquo;  That is precisely what is here.  You cannot take section 5 in isolation.  I think you must couple it with what is in section 7 where it speaks specifically about officials as against the inanimate things called banks.  Is the Minister serious in saying that of the two he thinks it preferable to remove the penalty of imprisonment&mdash;even though it might never arise&mdash;and to substitute instead a provision saying: &ldquo;We will take the roof from over your head?&rdquo; Is there any merit in the latter as against the former?</P>

I can picture the sheriff riding up with his posse to get £400 so he takes some very valuable article from the house which would make £4,000 and sells it for £400 just to pay the fine.  This is more injustice to the person.  Could the Minister not tie it down to taking an article commensurate with the fine imposed.  We are being frightfully punitive in this section. A convicted person must have some protection under the law.  This Bill reminds one of taking a hammer to kill a fly on the baby's head.  The Minister is just bashing in relentlessly.

      <P>That arises because the Northern Bank, the Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Banks are all companies within the meaning of the Companies Act, 1963.  The procedures of section 382 of that Act in relation to the prosecution of companies under that Act on indictable offences applies to these three in the sense that they are companies under that Act, but the Bank of Ireland, I am informed, was established by charter and is therefore not technically a company.

      <P>This is the section where the individual is affected instead of the bank.  The Minister has been making a point about not having imprisonment.  That would be much easier for this poor devil if he runs into a situation where a £10,000 a day penalty is being imposed on him and his furniture and so on is being taken bit by bit.  Even with a man of very strong financial standing, the longest he would last would be four or five days.  What happens at the end of that time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This section enables an authorised officer to do a number of things.  He may:</P>
      <P>(a)  at all reasonable times enter premises of a bank,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  require any person, being a director or a member of the committee of management or other controlling authority of the bank or an employee thereof, to produce to him any records, books or documents which are in the person's power or control and which the officer has reasonable grounds for believing to be records, books or documents containing information <Col N="1196" /> of the kind aforesaid and to give him such information as he may reasonably require in regard to any entries in any such records books or documents,</P>
    <P>(c)  inspect and copy or take extracts from any such records, books or documents.</P>
    <P>Is there not a danger that we are giving a great deal of scope to a group of people that are appointed by him to investigate the confidential records of members of the public? I think it could be said that by long-established tradition people generally have relied on banks and bank officials as being their closest confidants, and confidentiality was preserved.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that for other reasons some Ministers have certain rights in relation to information from these officials but when ascertaining the remuneration of bank employees these investigating officers will have access to other confidential information.  I am not saying that the banking system is perfect but I am concerned that the long-established confidentiality of the general public in the banking system and in bank officials, in particular, may be endangered by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the sort of section that is objectionable in any legislation.  All of us have had experience of it at some time.  I remember the debate on the Dangerous Substances Bill when, as the Minister responsible, I heard a great deal of opposition from the other side of the House in respect of the type of provision being discussed here.  A provision allowing for inspectors to visit business premises for the purpose of investigating accounts is undesirable.  Undoubtedly the Minister will assure us that the provision in this instance will be used with the greatest possible discretion and that the people appointed will be sworn to secrecy and so on.  However, in so far as the banks are concerned the provision is particularly objectionable because of the degree of privacy and confidentiality which exists between the bank and its clients.  It <Col N="1197" /> is sacrosanct that the banks retain this privacy and confidentiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate what my colleagues have said and I appeal to the Minister to think again about this section.  He may say that he is concerned only with data that is relevant to this legislation but he must accept, too, that once it is known that civil servants have the right to enter a bank for the purpose of ascertaining information, there is the danger that moneys which would be deposited normally with the banks to which this legislation refers would be channelled into other banks, especially since the investigating officers would be in a position to ascertain the amount of deposits, for instance.  This situation could lead ultimately to a certain amount of unemployment in the banks concerned.  The Minister is aware of the sensitivity that exists in relation to an examination by any third party of money which people have deposited in banks.  The section provides that the Minister can direct civil servants to authorise themselves to go into banks for the purpose of extracting certain information.  Can the Minister indicate the manner in which he will guarantee that only specific information will be extracted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This power exists already.  It is a power that is necessary if this legislation is to be effective.  The inspectors will be civil servants and, consequently, would be vowed to secrecy under the Official Secrets Act.  The power is there in respect of other industrial relations Acts.  The information which will be considered necessary will be confined to the purpose of ensuring that the banks are complying with the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 says that:</P>
      <P>(1)  An authorised officer may, for the purpose of obtaining any information which the Minister may require for enabling him to exercise his functions under this Act, do any one or more of the following things:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" /> (a)  at all reasonable times enter premises of a bank,</P>
    <P>(b)  require any person, being a director or a member of the committee of management or other controlling authority of the bank or an employee thereof...</P>
    <P>Therefore, if the inspector did not catch the typist within the terms of section 7, she would be caught within section 9.  Subsection (2) of that section reads:</P>
    <P>(2)  If any person obstructs or impedes an authorised officer in the exercise of his powers under subsection (1) of this section or does not comply with a requirement of an authorised officer under the said subsection (1), that person shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>That can include typists, bookkeepers, porters or cleaners.  The Minister went to great length to indicate that under section 5 the banker would not be liable to imprisonment in default of a fine but in relation to this section the Minister has admitted that if the staff such as those I have mentioned break the law by refusing to carry out orders given to them by officials of the bank in regard to the protection of the bank's property, they can be found guilty of an offence and sentenced to a term of imprisonment, not under this Bill but under another Act.</P>

      <P>The unpleasant aspect of this Bill is that we have been given little opportunity of going into it in greater detail.  I have pointed out that the Bill is unacceptable to us and we cannot see the necessity for it. I am satisfied that if the people concerned had been approached in a more competent and less domineering way, and had section 24 been used in time, a solution to this problem would have <Col N="1199" /> been found long ago.  I trust that the Bill is not the beginning of a series of legislation of this nature.  While the Minister has been given the utmost co-operation from this side on this occasion, I can assure him that that situation will not continue in the event of legislation of this kind being introduced continually.  The failure of the premium employment programme can be attributed to the legislation being rushed through this House because of a guillotine motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is preparing sets of safety regulations relating to the importation, manufacture, storage and conveyance of explosives and the storage and conveyance of petroleum.  These regulations will be made under the Dangerous Substances Act and are intended to up-date and extend the existing safety precautions in the handling of dangerous substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dangerous Substances Act is largely an enabling measure, which will permit me to make regulations which will require that all practicable steps are taken to prevent risk of injury to person or property in the conveying, loading and unloading of any declared dangerous substance. The Dangerous Substances Act can be brought into force as soon as the drafting of regulations dealing with explosives and petroleum is completed. In addition, other chemical substances which might be dangerous are being investigated.  The results of this investigation will enable me to <Col N="1086" /> decide which ones should be specially designated under the Act and how best these could be covered by safety regulations.</P>
    <P>I understand that you have been informed by the Minister for Local Government that Article 96, Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the safe loading of vehicles generally.</P>
